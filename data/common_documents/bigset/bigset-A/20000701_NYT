FLYERS DECIDE TO GAMBLE AND MAKE LINDROS AN OFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (UPDATES head and story thruout with Flyers offering Lindros a
contract) 
By JOE LAPOINTE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The free-agent period begins in the NHL with Eric Lindros still
the limited property of the Philadelphia Flyers and Mark Messier
probably free to make his own deal with any team.
</P>
<P>
   Both big centers may be interested in playing for the Rangers.
But the Flyers' difficult decision to submit a contract proposal to
Lindros Friday night makes Lindros a restricted free agent, with
only conditional mobility. The Vancouver Canucks were not expected
to pick up Messier's contract option by the midnight deadline
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindros decision came after a day of debate within the
Flyers' hierarchy. Lindros suffered four concussions last season
and criticized the team's medical care. He was stripped of his
captaincy and relations had deteriorated between the Flyers and the
Lindros family. Lindros is represented by his father, Carl Lindros.
Eric Lindros still suffers from postconcussion symptoms and it is
not certain he will ever play again.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday General Manager Bob Clarke of the Flyers was unsure
whether the Flyers would submit a qualifying offer of $8.5 million
for next season, equal to Lindros' pay last season. Had the Flyers
not made the offer, Lindros would have been unrestricted and free
to sign with any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a gamble,'' Clarke said. ``If someone wants him,
it's a gamble on their part. If we want to keep him, it's a gamble
on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros still can sign with any team, but the Flyers have the
right to match any contract offer and keep him. Should Lindros sign
with another team, with the Flyers declining to match, they would
get five first-round draft choices as compensation. Or, the two
teams could work out a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night, after extending the contract offer to
Lindros, Clarke said: ``Eric Lindros is one of the top players in
the game and is an integral part of our organization. We're hopeful
that he will enjoy a complete recovery and return to play hockey at
the high level to which we have become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the
relationship between myself and Eric and his family has
deteriorated. I intend to do whatever I can to try to move this
relationship onto a better course.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lindros signs his offer from Philadelphia, it appears as if
the Flyers are obligated to pay him, even if he cannot play because
of injuries. Can the Flyers avoid paying Lindros if he does not
pass the physical examination before the season and is unable to
play? Not according to the NHL Players' Association spokesman, Tim
Wharnsby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he signs it, he'll still get his money because the Flyers
knew he was injured,'' Wharnsby said.
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, Lindros is one of the best players in the NHL. He
won the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in 1995. But
neither Lindros nor Messier is considered the powerful and
intimidating force he was five years ago. When asked about his
son's health, Carl Lindros said this week: ``He's progressing. He
still has symptoms.'' But he declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   The Messier situation is less complicated. After three seasons
with the Canucks, Messier is 39 years old. A popular captain who
left the Rangers as a free agent in 1997 after six seasons, Messier
could have stayed in Vancouver another season if the Canucks picked
up a $6 million option on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Canucks decline, they would owe him a $2 million
buyout and Messier would become an unrestricted free agent. Brian
Burke, general manager of the Canucks, said this week, ``At this
point in time, it is unlikely we will exercise our option.'' In 66
games, Messier scored 17 goals, with 37 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Messier, Mark's father and agent, said Friday that the
Canucks had not extended his son's contract and that an extension
was not expected. From 1984 through 1990, Messier played on five
Stanley Cup champions for the Edmonton Oilers. He added another
ring with the Rangers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Sather, the general manager and coach of those Oilers
teams, is the new general manager of the Rangers. There is much
speculation around the NHL that Messier will sign with Sather's
Rangers, perhaps for a lower salary, to finish his career in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   And there are hints of more movement along the Oilers-Rangers
pipeline. A report in The Hartford Courant on Wednesday said the
Rangers would name Ron Low as coach. But John Rosasco, a Rangers
spokesman, said Sather would not name a coach until at least July
8. Low is a former coach of the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Sather last week got permission from the Flyers to talk to
Lindros, and inquired about his health. Also getting permission
were the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Dallas
Stars and Carolina Hurricanes are also thought to be interested.
Long an admirer of Messier's, the 27-year-old Lindros has said in
the past that he would like to be Messier's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are represented by their fathers. When Messier left the
Rangers in 1997, there was a rift between his father and some
members of the Madison Square Garden management. But Doug Messier
said Friday that it would not be an obstacle to his son returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future's what everything's about,'' Doug Messier said,
adding that his son holds no grudges. &QL;

GORE, IN INTERVIEW, ASSAILS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS story with updates thruout) By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attacking the pharmaceutical industry for engaging
in ``corporate chutzpah'' and for ``gouging the consumer
unfairly,'' Vice President Al Gore said Friday that he would take
on the drug manufacturers next week at campaign stops in
battleground states from California to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the veranda of his home here, Gore cast
himself as a longtime critic of what he said were the industry's
excessive prices and profits.
</P>
<P>
   He does, in fact, have a long record on the topic, dating to his
days as a young Tennessee congressman in the early 1980s, when he
played a crucial role in defeating legislation that would have
granted drug companies patent extensions on lucrative medicines.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore is dusting off his congressional record and past
speeches to stake out policies at odds with the manufacturers. A
review of his record, though, and a detailed talk with the vice
president make clear that his views are more nuanced than his
language suggests. And some of the same drug makers that Gore now
criticizes have hired his friends and advisers to represent them as
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry, which responded icily to Gore's
statements Friday, has in some cases embraced his positions. For
instance, drug manufacturers are among the biggest beneficiaries of
the government's tax credit for research and development, and Gore
favors legislation that would make that credit permanent.
</P>
<P>
   And while he argued for greater disclosure of the industry's
pricing practices, the vice president allowed that some information
probably should remain proprietary. Gore has also been a strong
supporter of the biotechnology industry, which through
collaborations and mergers is becoming part of the
prescription-drug business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as a basher of the pharmaceutical
companies,'' Gore said. ``I see myself as opposing the excesses
that have accompanied their enormous market power, excesses that
have come at the expense of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug executives, who have contributed far more to the campaign
of Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, have mixed
feelings about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   His support for innovation and new technology endears him to
them, and he is not nearly as vociferous a critic as the Green
Party candidate, Ralph Nader. But industry executives are becoming
more nervous about Gore as the presidential campaign progresses.
And when asked about Friday's escalating attack, their trade
association responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly sad to hear the vice president arguing for reducing
incentives for biomedical innovation,'' Alan Holmer, president of
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a
statement. ``If his rhetoric became government policy, patients
would suffer. Thankfully, no one will be fooled by political
posturing four months before an election.''
</P>
<P>
   With his heightened, anti-industry stand that consumers are
``being ripped off'' by drug makers, Gore is positioning himself as
a champion of a far-reaching Medicare prescription drug benefit for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his campaign's polls show that the issue
resonates strongly with voters. So Gore is also trying to sharpen
the distinctions between himself and Bush, who supports a benefit
that would rely more heavily on private insurers, an approach the
industry favors.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry is one of the nation's most lucrative, and
secretive, businesses. It consistently ranks as the most profitable
industry in the Fortune 500 list of companies: in 1999, the
industry's net profit after taxes was 18.9 percent of revenues,
compared with 15.8 percent for the next most profitable industry,
commercial banking, and 5 percent over all, according to a recent
compilation by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers argue that their prices are justified by the high
costs, and risks, of researching and developing new medicines. And
they say they need substantial profits to plow back into research
and development, clearing the way for the next generation of drugs.
To the industry, any threat to profits or drug prices is a threat
to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   That concern is reflected in the contributions the two major
presidential contenders have received. To date, Bush's campaign has
received $221,715 from drug company executives, while Gore has
received $50,700, election records show.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not made the prescription-drug issue a cornerstone of
his campaign, but one of his top health advisers said that the
Texas governor is opposed to tampering with the industry's ability
to develop life-saving medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that would dampen innovation, particularly price
controls, ought to be avoided,'' said Bill Roper, who was a top
health official in the administration of Bush's father, and is now
dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to trust the marketplace,'' Roper added.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign did not make the Texas governor available for
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Friday that he, too, opposed regulating drug prices or
profits. ``I don't see it as the government's role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say the industry's profits were out of line, and he
favors policies that would, in effect, cut into profits and curb
prices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore said he supported a legislative amendment,
recently passed by the House of Representatives, requiring drug
makers to agree to reasonable prices for treatments invented in
collaboration with government scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 90 such collaborations under way with the
National Cancer Institute alone. But the industry has consistently
opposed a pricing clause, and its protests were a main reason why
the National Institutes of Health abandoned such a provision in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been in the Congress, I certainly would have voted
for it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Gore supports requiring drug companies to pay
a fee to the government for medicines developed with the help of
government grants. Some of today's top-selling drugs got their
start in the federally financed laboratories of university
scientists, and Gore said that the public ``ought to have some
right not to be gouged on the purchase of products that they
themselves helped to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the vice president favors a proposed rule that
would make it more difficult for companies to use the regulatory
process to delay competition _ a rule the industry opposes. And he
is against a highly publicized provision that has been circulating
in Congress to extend the patent for Claritin, the top-selling
allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stance on Claritin puts him somewhat at odds with a close
adviser and friend, Peter Knight. Last year, Claritin's
manufacturer, the Schering-Plough Corp., hired Knight to help
develop a lobbying campaign for the patent extension, among other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has since left the lobbying business, and Gore insisted
Friday that he has never talked with him, or other friends who have
represented drug makers, about industry issues. ``All the positions
I've taken,'' he said, ``are against their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was clearly well-briefed for the hour-long interview, and
seemed to relish the opportunity to go on the offensive against an
industry he has long taken an interest in. At one point, he
recalled a meeting he had 18 years ago with Rep. Richard Bolling,
then the chairman of the House Rules Committee _ a meeting that led
to the defeat of the patent-extension legislation the industry
coveted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore said, he was particularly irked that the
industry refused to make public data that would have supported its
position. ``It was the most astounding example of corporate
chutzpah I had ever run across,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a serendipitous moment for the vice president, his
11-year-old black labrador, Shiloh, wandered onto the veranda
midway through the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Shiloh takes medicine for arthritis. ``This dog
here,'' Gore said, ``gets a cheaper price for the same drug than
humans.''

MEXICAN DRUG PIPELINE RUNS THROUGH CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An ever-increasing wave of drugs from Mexico is
turning Southern California into the nation's major distribution
center for heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana,
officials told Congress on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs
Service and Border Patrol told members of a House subcommittee that
Mexican cartels were taking advantage of increased border trade and
utilizing undocumented immigrants to smuggle their drugs into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Mexican drug cartels, which formerly served as
middlemen for suppliers in Colombia, were now controlling the trade
in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that the cartels are using sites throughout
Southern California to store large quantities of drugs for their
growing distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, during early morning raids throughout the country on
June 15, authorities arrested 200 people accused of running a
highly organized, multimillion-dollar Mexican black-tar heroin ring
led by a Panorama City, Calif., man.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, one member of the congressional panel, Rep. John
Mica, R-Fla., accused the Mexican government of doing little to
stem the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thumb their noses at our requests for interdiction and
extradition of drug lords,'' he said. Mica also accused the Mexican
government of widespread corruption, charging that ``Baja
California has become a narco-terrorist province.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Zabalgoitia, minister of information for the Mexican
Embassy in Washington, refuted those charges, saying his government
is making strong efforts against the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very conscious that narco-trafficking is our top
national security threat,'' he said. ``It is our top priority and
we take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that there have been cases of high-level
corruption in Mexico, Zabalgoitia dismissed Mica's allegation of a
terrorist-run Baja as ``really over the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting drugs because they are poisoning our country,
not to appease the Micas of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has endorsed and supported Mexico's
anti-drug effort, which has begun to focus on its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, programs were directed toward keeping drugs out
of the U.S.,'' Zabalgoitia said. ``Now our goal is to seal off our
territory, stop being a conduit and keep drugs from coming into
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Logan, special agent in charge for the Customs Service's
San Diego region office, told the congressional panel - the House
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources -
that 58 percent of the agency's drug busts nationwide in 1999 took
place along the California-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said drug arrests and seizures are on the rise, but that
smugglers can evade detection due to the high volume of border
trade and traffic. Last year, customs agents manning 26 locations
in San Diego and Imperial counties encountered 95 million people,
30 million passenger vehicles and 1 million trucks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan credited much of the traffic increase to the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which spurred a 115 percent rise in
U.S.-Mexico trade from its enactment in 1994 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service is also monitoring increased smuggling of
prescription drugs from Mexico to the United States, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said Mexican pharmaceuticals, long a legal and low-cost
alternative for American visitors filling their own needs, are now
being smuggled in large quantities and distributed across the U.S.
in a black market.
</P>
<P>
   Drug smuggling and related violence have risen sharply in border
desert regions of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, said
Luis Barker, chief agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector.
</P>
<P>
   Barker testified that smugglers are increasingly paying
undocumented immigrants to carry small quantities of illegal drugs
into the U.S., where they are turned over to distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also testified Friday that:
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 percent of all cocaine now being distributed in
the United States is smuggled into Southern California from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine labs in California, operated and supplied by
Mexican drug gangs, produce 85 percent of the nation's supply.
</P>
<P>
   Those meth labs, called ``super labs'' for their huge output,
stretch from San Diego to Sacramento along the I-5 corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of Mexican heroin has lowered street prices for a
one-milligram dose to $1 on average nationwide, compared to $3.90
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican black-tar heroin is now much more addictive and potent -
41.6 percent pure compared to 3.6 percent in 1980. Users can now
snort heroin or take it in pill form and need not inject the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The border region stretching from San Diego to El Paso is the
major smuggling zone for Mexican and Colombian marijuana.

E-TRADE SERVES NEW AD ON BACK OF BREAKFAST BOX  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
You might call it capital grains.
<P>
   E-Trade Group, a company known for over-the-top advertising
rarely seen in the fusty brokerage business until the Internet came
along, has found an unlikely venue to promote itself _ cereal
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The online broker is teaming up with Kellogg, the venerable
breakfast foodmaker from Battle Creek, Mich. In a campaign now
rolling out, E-Trade is advertising on boxes of Smart Start cereal,
pitching brokerage accounts to the bleary-eyed masses scarfing down
their morning meal.
</P>
<P>
   A promo on Smart Start boxes promises $100 to people who open
accounts through a link on Kellogg's Web site. More than 3 million
packages of cereal with E-Trade ads will be shipped in the
campaign's first round, said Jacqueline Russo, a spokeswoman for
the brokerage. The promotion expires in April.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park's E-Trade is a company that feels more kinship with
the Net world than with Wall Street and its tradition of ads filled
with gray-haired men in walnut-paneled rooms. But for Internet
companies, E-Trade's marketing style isn't unique.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ask Jeeves, the Emeryville search engine company,
has plastered stickers with its name, logo and sample search
questions on some 175 million apples, oranges and bananas,
according to spokeswoman Alexa McCann.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has already set up joint marketing deals with companies
as varied as United Airlines and Blockbuster Video. But cereal
boxes?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the connection between a bowlful of Smart Start and an
E-Trade account isn't as obscure as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   The low-fat, whole-grain cereal, marketed to health-conscious
25- to 45-year-olds, is good for you, a little like investing money
for the future. But it's also loaded with sugar, a bit sinful, like
the money lust E-Trade promotes in its edgy television and
billboard ads.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said E-Trade marketing chief Michael Sievert, cereal
boxes are ``one of those kinds of marketing media that people
really read.``
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, of course, has never walked the straight and narrow in
touting itself. This is the company after all that ran a TV spot
featuring a patient rushed into emergency surgery because he had
money coming ``out the wazoo.``
</P>
<P>
   Ads like that have propelled the company into a solid No. 2 spot
among Internet brokers, gaining on market leader Charles Schwab
Corp., despite a lackluster reputation for customer service.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months ended in March, the company added a
phenomenal 603,000 new accounts, bringing its total to 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sievert wouldn't discuss financial terms of the Kellogg deal but
stressed the benefits to both companies. Kellogg might sell more
cereal with a $100 bonus offer on the front, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers presume the broker is paying a tidy sum to get
its pitch on an object that's one of the first things people see
every day.

THE METS INSTIGATE THEIR OWN DISTURBANCE
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the end, all the mayhem was in left field, right
about where everyone thought it would be.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama in Friday night's Mets-Braves game had nothing to
do with John Rocker, who was requested three times by the sold-out
crowd of 52,831 at Shea Stadium during the eighth inning but never
dashed from the left field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was better than an appearance by Rocker, and any
of the jeering and sneering that would accompany one. This was what
the Mets and Braves were talking about when they said they would
play great baseball this weekend. If people focused on one relief
pitcher and his six-month old social commentary, it would be their
loss.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch he saw from Terry Mulholland in the eighth
inning, Mike Piazza lined a three-run homer just inside the left
field foul pole to cap an inning that matched the most prolific in
Mets history. It broke a tie, gave the Mets 10 runs in the inning
and lifted them to an 11-8 victory in a game that had been
dominated by the Mets' sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are intense games, with all the added issues surround
it,'' said first baseman Todd Zeile. ``You can feel beat up on
after you've made a couple of mistakes, and you can get flat. But
one positive is, we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pulled to within two games of first place in the
National League East, and can tie the Braves for first by winning
the final two games of the series, Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was not the kind Piazza usually hits. This was no
scorcher to the opposite field or high-arching parabola into the
left field bleachers. This was the kind of shot that defines the
broadcasters' cry of ``It might be! ... It could be! ... it is!''
</P>
<P>
   When it crashed against the padding a few feet over the fence,
the fans exhaled and screamed and arms shot up all over Shea. The
postgame fireworks seemed redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike gets in certain situations where you can feel that the
pitcher is in trouble,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves starter, Kevin Milwood, never seemed in trouble as
the Braves built an 8-1 lead through seven and a half innings.
Millwood had handcuffed them for seven innings and muted the crowd,
but the presence of journeyman reliever Don Wengert created an
opening for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell opened the inning with a single. Piazza singled with
one out and an error advanced the runner. Robin Ventura's ground
out brought in Bell to make it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then Zeile singled, and Jay Payton did the same. As they had
done when Wengert entered, the fans chanted for Rocker, who had a
callous on his thumb and could not pitch. Bobby Cox called for
Kerry Ligtenberg, and he was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani walked to load the bases. A walk to Mark Johnson
walked in a run. A walk to Melvin Mora walked in another.
Mulholland entered _ still no Rocker _ and the control specialist
walked Bell, forcing in another run. Somewhere in Texas, former
Mets pitcher Kenny Rogers, who walked in the run that clinched the
pennant for Atlanta last October, must have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The score by then was 8-6 Braves, and Edgardo Alfonzo came to
bat. The Mets' second baseman lashed two-run single to left, tying
the game and setting up Piazza's 22nd home run of the season. The
blast also gave Piazza 13 consecutive games with a run batted in,
establishing a new National League record.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth inning and was credited with a
victory by the official scorer, who ruled that the rookie Eric
Cammack, who had been the last pitcher before the game-turning
outburst but whose outing had been brief and ineffective, did not
deserve the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Until the eighth, the Braves were asserting their dominance over
the team they had beaten in 19 of their last 25 regular-season
meetings, and in the National League Championship Series last
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had two singles in the first inning, but a passed
ball, a hit batter and a bases-loaded walk helped them to their
first run. In the third, a bases-loaded single led to three Braves
runs. In the seventh, Melvin Mora threw away an inning-ending
double play ball and the Braves scored again.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton had shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates in his last
start and has been rolling for almost two months. But he allowed
five runs Friday night, the most in any start since his dreadful
month of April, and he walked six (one intentionally) over seven
innings.

YANKEES, LACKING PEP AND POP, FAIL TO PULL OUT ANOTHER CLOSE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Maybe the New York Yankees need more than
David Justice, or a couple of pitchers. Maybe what they are missing
is more subtle than that.
</P>
<P>
   There is a dullness to the Yankees these days. They always found
a way to win in 1998 and 1999, and now they are giving away games,
exuding the energy of flagmen on a highway construction site,
hazily guiding opponents to victories.
</P>
<P>
   After Bernie Williams tied Friday night's game against Tampa Bay
with a two-run homer in the top of the eighth, Yankees relievers
walked four batters in the bottom of the eighth, forcing home two
runs in a 6-4 loss to the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was 0 for 3 in his Yankees debut, reaching base in his
first plate appearance on catcher's interference.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6 the Yankees' record in one-run and two-run decisions
was 13-1. They are 7-19 in one-run and two-run games since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is contagious, and losing is contagious,'' said Derek
Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop. ``I don't think anyone here lacks
confidence. We're just not getting the breaks we're used to
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   They were in a position to win; they should have won. Jason
Grimsley started in spite of an ear infection, and although he
surrendered nine hits in 2 1/3 innings before he was relieved _
Grimsley was so sick that he had trouble seeing the ball coming off
the bat of hitters _ the Yankees trailed by only 4-2 early. Craig
Dingman, promoted to the majors Thursday, shut out the Devil Rays
for 2 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Bryan Rekar had a 2-4 record and a 4.80 earned run
average before Friday night's game, but he stifled the Yankees, who
seemed to be overeager against him. Rekar is a sinkerball pitcher
and hitters usually try to drive the ball to the opposite field.
But of the 19 balls the Yankees put in play against Rekar, 14 were
pulled; they kept beating the ball into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to relax and let the game come to us,'' Justice
said later, after pulling three grounders to the right side. ``I
didn't let the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams bailed out the Yankees, however, slamming a two-run
homer off Jim Mecir (6-1) with two out in the Yankees' eighth. The
Yankees have won games like this time and again over the last few
years, coming back in the late innings to tie the game, holding
opponents with their bullpen and then pushing across the winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson relieved in the Tampa Bay eighth, retired the first
hitter and got the second hitter, Fred McGriff, to lift a high pop
to the left side. Scott Brosius, the third baseman, backpedaled,
then held his arms out: he couldn't see the ball. Neither could the
shortstop Jeter, and left fielder Shane Spencer could not reach the
pop before it fell to the fake grass at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I turned my back _ I don't know if it was the backdrop or
the catwalks _ I just couldn't spot it up there,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson walked the next batter, but struck out Jose Guillen. Two
outs. He had control of the inning. He fell behind in the count to
Mike Difelice, and then disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get down, two balls and no strikes,'' Nelson said,
``you start pressing, and you start aiming the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked Difelice, loading the bases. Russ Johnson came to bat.
When the game began, he had drawn a total of two walks for the
season, but he had three in the first seven innings, and Nelson
could not throw strikes. With the fans screaming, Nelson walked
Johnson, as well, forcing home the go-ahead run. Nelson snapped at
the return throw from the catcher Jorge Posada, as teammates looked
on mournfully.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson fell behind the next batter, Felix Martinez, two balls
and no strikes. The Yankees scrambled in their bullpen, rushing to
get Todd Erdos warmed up. Nelson appeared frazzled. Posada went to
the mound to kill time until Erdos was ready.
</P>
<P>
   But after Erdos came on, he completed the walk to Martinez _
another run _ and Erdos slammed a fist into his glove. In all,
Yankees pitchers issued 11 walks and allowed 12 hits. The Devil
Rays stranded 16 runners, a club record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it away, basically,'' Manager Joe Torre said.

AMERICAN AND NORTHWEST CONTINUING MERGER TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Merger talks between American Airlines and
Northwest Airlines are progressing and could lead to a deal this
month, people close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   American ``has a bunch of people working on it, and the goal is
to be ready to do something'' by the middle of July, one source
said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials tacitly acknowledged early last month that
they had met with counterparts from Northwest to discuss a merger.
American also held preliminary talks with Delta Air Lines during
which, sources said, the primary subject was Delta's interest in
acquiring Northwest's 13 percent stake in Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings followed a May 24 announcement by UAL Corp., parent
of United Airlines, that it would buy US Airways, the nation's
sixth-largest carrier, in a deal worth $11.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``American wants to get a deal announced and out on the table by
the time Justice Department gets going on its review of the
United-USAir deal,'' the source said, explaining why the goal is
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing talks were confirmed by several people inside and
outside American who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   American, which is based near Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, and
Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., declined to comment officially on
the status of any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chiames, an American spokesman, said airline management
had promised employees and others that it would not initiate a new
round of industry consolidation. Still, American has to consider
the changing dynamics of the industry seriously, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our employees would prefer internal growth,'' Chiames
said, ``there's probably not one person out of the 100,000 or so
here who would want this company to stand still and put their
futures at risk because of a lack of competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, whether we want to buy Northwest or not has nothing to
do with it now,'' the official said. ``Now that United has moved on
USAir, we've got no choice. We're trying to get a deal done.
There's no guarantee that we'll get a deal done, but I think it is
very likely that we will get a deal there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't do a deal at any price,'' the official said. ``But
we'll probably have something soon.''
</P>
<P>
   American employs 27,000 people in North Texas and controls 70
percent of the passenger traffic at D/FW.
</P>
<P>
   Joining American, which is the nation's No. 2 carrier, and
Northwest, the No. 4 carrier, would create an airline about the
size of a combined United and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, which has more flights to Asia than any other U.S.
carrier, would also bolster American's domestic system with its
hubs in Minneapolis and Detroit. That would be crucial in competing
with a bigger United, which is based in Chicago and would dominate
the Northeast with US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But any merger would also present the challenge of meshing
unionized work forces and disparate fleets. It would also be
costly.
</P>
<P>
   American values Northwest at about $56 a share, the sources
said, based on the notion that Northwest shares should fetch what
United is paying for US Airways. But, the sources said, Northwest
Chairman Gary Wilson is seeking at least $65.
</P>
<P>
   Because Northwest has about 100 million shares outstanding, its
price would run from $5.6 billion to $6.5 billion, under the two
scenarios. In addition, American would probably have to assume
Northwest's $3.3 billion in debt, pushing the value of a deal to at
least $8.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harris, airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York, has reached a similar conclusion. In a report issued to
clients three weeks ago, Harris estimated Northwest to be worth $55
a share, or about $5.5 billion. However, Harris said Northwest's
ownership of preferred shares in Continental could inflate the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that American could recover $2.3 billion to $3
billion of its purchase price for Northwest by selling certain
assets, such as the Continental stock and Northwest's stake in
Worldspan, a computer reservation company.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's stock closed at $30.44 a share yesterday on the
Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said American does not have an agreement on price with
Wilson and Alfred Checchi, the California financiers who led a $3.6
billion leveraged buyout of Northwest in 1989. Wilson, Checchi and
their associates own a controlling stake in Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But both sides know what it will take to do a deal, and both
sides really want to do this deal,'' one source said. ``The
negotiations on a final price will be tough, but Gary and Al want a
big payday, and American is the only bidder. I can't imagine that
these two sides wouldn't be able to reach a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   American recently rekindled contract extension talks with its
pilots union in hopes of enlisting its support for a Northwest
deal.
</P>
<P>
   American's desire to announce a deal this month is driven by its
belief that it needs to put a deal before regulators before they
sign off on a United-US Airways combination.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said his company formally asked
the Justice Department on June 16 to conduct an antitrust review of
its proposed merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
</P>
<P>
   That means Justice has until July 16 to decide whether it will
allow the merger, oppose it in court, propose conditions, such as
selling off certain assets, or seek more time for review. Most
observers, including airline executives, expect the Justice
Department to extend the review period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect the Justice Department to take more time
reviewing the United-US Airways case because it's such a complex
subject and could have such far-reaching implications for
competition in the airline industry and for the consumer,'' said
Julius Maldutis, airline analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, a New York
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Although some members of Congress have questioned whether
airline mergers harm consumers, Maldutis said mergers can create
opportunities for new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my conclusion that mergers are actually beneficial to
new entrants and to consumers,'' Maldutis said. ``They create entry
opportunities for new entrants because the merged entities
consolidate and restructure their operations.''

KREUTER TO CONTINUE APPEALS PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter was prepared to
begin serving his eight-game suspension Friday, but after
consulting with the players association and his agent, Kreuter said
he needed to follow through with the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the players association continue to
research the viability of appealing the five-game suspensions of
Gary Sheffield, Carlos Perez and F.P. Santangelo. Reliever Mike
Fetters said he is dropping his appeal of a one-game suspension,
only because it's the best thing for the team. Fetters will serve
his suspension July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said
commissioner Bud Selig would hear this round of appeals. A baseball
official said it was imperative Kreuter gets an opportunity to
speak to Selig during this appeal, and that apparently will happen.
The time being discussed is during the All-Star break in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to follow the appeals process right now,'' Kreuter
said in a rare comment about the suspensions. ``I was ready to bite
the bullet and be a team player and take my suspension, but the
players association and my counsel feel it's in my best interest to
go through the appeals process and take it to a higher jurisdiction
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter said his decision could change, but he's been advised
not to drop the appeal because of the civil lawsuits filed against
him and club, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big issue and it's still a big issue,'' Kreuter
said. ``For Major League Baseball and fan-relations, there's a lot
of ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association has seven days to appeal from when Paul
Beeston announced his decision Thursday. Beeston, chief operating
officer for baseball, wiped out the suspensions of 11 players, kept
four players' intact and reduced Fetters' from four games to one.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official said the players association was looking
primarily at appealing Kreuter's and Sheffield's suspensions. The
players association convinced Fetters to drop his appeal and likely
will talk to Santangelo and Perez about doing the same, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players
association, said Kreuter's situation is worth appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this ruling, it still portrays Chad as a monster,'' Orza
said. ``That is the furthest thing from the truth. With the ruling,
it makes it OK for fans to do anything and the player has no
recourse. You couldn't do that to an individual on the street and
get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions are a result of the May 16 fight at Wrigley
Field in which Kreuter was allegedly struck in the head and had his
cap taken. Kreuter said he only went into the stands to detain the
person when the melee broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers understand litigation must be considered in filing
the appeals, but if the club had their way all but Sheffield would
serve their suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to take it to the highest level and go through the
appeals and exhaust every option,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``The one danger that concerns me is that we're pretty
healthy right now in catching, and in the game of baseball things
can change. There were some other things in there with the way it
was structured where (Kreuter) would miss (catching) Chan Ho (Park)
once, and there's an off-day in there.''
</P>
<P>
   HERSHISER CLEARS WAIVERS: Right-hander Orel Hershiser cleared
waivers Friday, making him a free agent. But the former Cy Young
winner, who can now negotiate with any team, hasn't made a decision
about his future.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hershiser, 41, did release a statement through the
Dodgers about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have certainly been interesting days,'' Hershiser said
in a statement. ``First, my family and I want to thank so many who
have called to wish us well. Your words of encouragement are
sincerely appreciated. As of 11 PDT Friday morning, the waiting
period is over and I have cleared waivers, making me a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already I have received a number of inquiries, both from
inside and outside of baseball. We're taking the long holiday
weekend to seek the counsel of family and friends, and to pray
about our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Dodgers officials believe, given the right opportunity,
Hershiser would continue pitching. He has spoken with several
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   AND FINALLY: Right-hander Gregg Olson faced four batters and
pitched a scoreless inning in a rehab outing with Single-A San
Bernardino against Mudville in the California League. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: METS COMEBACK IN KNICK OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets needed this miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Silly as it may sound on one night of a 162-game season, the
Mets made a major claim on posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were down, 8-1, going into the bottom of the eighth
inning Friday night at Shea Stadium. The Braves were on the verge
of taking the Mets' heart. They had already trounced them on
Thursday, and now they were moving in for the kill. Atlanta
manhandled Mike Hampton, the multimillion-dollar pitcher whose sole
purpose in baseball life was to carry the Mets over the top. Melvin
Mora, the rock-solid everything player, made an error Friday night
and Mike Piazza made his second in three days.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Atlanta was toying with the Mets. The Atlanta
players were on the bench laughing and guffawing, sitting on the
top step of the dugout, backs turned to the Mets as if the game
were over.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the eighth inning, when the Mets loaded the bases with
two out. In a fitting turnabout for a team that was eliminated from
the National League Championship Series by Atlanta on a
bases-loaded walk, the Mets scored three runs on three consecutive
walks. They tied the game, 8-8, on a two-run single by Edgardo
Alfonzo and then finally won it on a three-run homer by Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's victory did so much to cut through a depressing
funk that was enveloping this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a man wearing a jacket and a badge
approached me and asked how he might get the key to Wilpon's suite
and Doubleday's suite. Two other men were holding a pair of dogs by
leashes. The man with the jacket and badge explained that they were
part of the New York City Police Department's bomb detail. ``We
have to sweep Wilpon's suite, but we need the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Why he was asking me how to get the key, I had no idea, but
searching for bombs in the suites of the Mets' co-owners was
unsettling. With walkie-talkies, the police officers left with the
dogs to sweep other parts of Shea Stadium but said they would
return.
</P>
<P>
   Take me out to the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Shea, waves of New York City police officers lined up
and received instructions for deployment inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   All this because a 25-year-old Atlanta Braves relief pitcher
named John Rocker pushed the limits of his constitutional right to
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs went sniffing and the police officers went to their
posts.
</P>
<P>
   This was Day 2 of a four-game Atlanta-Mets series. But the men
with blue coats and badges and dogs created an atmosphere that
intruded on the hallowed space of a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, finished
his pre-game interview with reporters, looked around the stadium
and shook his head. He said the Rocker affair made him feel
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 17-year-old who just brought three friends up from
Texas,'' he said. ``I gave them free rein, after he spent a month
in the city, battling the subway when he's downtown, taking the No.
7 coming out here, leaving when he wants to leave. Going to Times
Square, going to SoHo on his own, with his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now their parents are in Texas going: `What's this idiot doing
with my kids? They took the train home from the game.' And just the
fact that my wife had to say `Are you sure it's OK for them to do
it?' bugs me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom is a wonderful thing,'' Valentine added. ``People say
it's not free, but it definitely isn't for anyone to take away from
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this police state is what we're all about,''
Valentine said. ``I understand protecting the individual, but the
guarded statements, closed clubhouses _ what is all that?''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker made disparaging remarks about Valentine, New York City
and its ethnic groups in a Sports Illustrated article six months
ago. ``I almost think he was saying what he thought was cool,
taking that persona when he runs out of that bullpen, what I think
of as a WWF mentality.`
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has apparently cautioned the Mets and the Braves to
watch what they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're held to a higher standard than everyone else,''
Valentine said. ``Our sport and the rest of society are going in
different directions. We're under more restrictions as the rest of
society becomes more free. What is that? I feel resentment of the
fact that I do feel restrained.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was something unsettling about all the police, the
bomb-sniffing dogs, the layers of cameras. The scene was
depressing. Everyone had been diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night there was some illumination. The Mets needed this
miracle. We all did.

FBI DECLASSIFIES REPORTS ON AMERICANS KILLED UNDER CHILE'S
PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES thruout with details of report) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI collected intelligence on an American
student living in Chile who was killed soon after Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's takeover of Chile in 1973, according to newly
declassified documents made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1972 report from one informant, the FBI said that
the student, Frank Teruggi Jr., had attended a ``Conference on
Anti-Imperialist Strategy and Action'' held by former Peace Corps
volunteers who, the FBI said, ``espouse support of Cuba and all
Third World revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chilean authorities have never confirmed that Teruggi was
executed, he was arrested at his apartment days after the coup and
tortured at the National Stadium, witnesses said. His body was
discovered in the morgue 10 days later, riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   The document on Teruggi was one of several hundred released
Friday, ordered by President Clinton last year as part of a major
declassification project on human rights abuses under Pinochet's
1973-90 dictatorship .
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's release, which represented the final government
disclosures on three Americans killed in Chile during the Pinochet
dictatorship, disappointed family members and human rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
   While the documents offered some details, they broke no new
ground as to the circumstances under which the Americans perished.
In addition to Teruggi, those killed were Charles Horman, an
American journalist whose plight was portrayed in the 1982 movie
``Missing,'' and Boris Weisfeiler, a mathematics professor who
disappeared in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA had released only six documents concerning Horman's
death. It released another dozen or so on the death of Teruggi, all
concerning the attempts of the dead man's father to see a document
the agency refused to release 24 years ago. The intelligence agency
continued to withhold that document Friday, arguing that its
information was provided by a foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Horman, whose husband was killed at the age of 31, held up
documents no more than an inch thick, many with chunks of black
lines keeping whole paragraphs secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they're withholding documents,'' she said, ``or they
really didn't do anything to protect an American citizen or to
investigate his detention in Chile at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The only new insight Horman gleaned came from an informant who
approached the U.S. Embassy in 1987 to say that Horman had been
killed in the National Stadium for being a ``foreign extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   On learning that the man they had killed was an American
citizen, stadium officials panicked and had his body dumped on the
streets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But American Embassy officials had doubts about the informant's
credibility, and eventually lost contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the documents released Friday involved Weisfeiler,
44, who apparently was picked up by the military while hitchhiking
in Chile. His body has never been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   At her home in Newton, Mass., Weisfeiler's sister, Olga
Weisfeiler, spent Friday combing through the documents, and they
confirmed what she had gradually come to suspect since a Chilean
lawyer reopened her brother's case this year: that her brother had
been tortured and killed at a secretive concentration camp in the
Chilean countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report, though covering events in 1971, was written the
fol- lowing year, after Terruggi took up residence in Chile and
before the 1973 coup. In addition to noting his attendance at the
Peace Corps con- ference, the report said a Chicago- area group,
whose goals it described as furthering the ``Socialist revolu-
tion,'' had sent Terruggi to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Though the documents released to- day do not indicate that the
FBI shared its information with Chilean authorities, the
insinuations re-L appeared in the Chilean military's references to
him after he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report did not allege any illegality in Teruggi's
actions, and he traveled to Chile to support the elected Socialist
government of Salvador Allende. But after his kill- ing, Chilean
military officers por- trayed him as a revolutionary in Chile to
``discredit the governing jun- ta,'' an unfounded charge because
the junta did not exist until a few days before his death.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman, Tracy Silberling, said there would be no comment
on the bureau's report on Teruggi.

`FRUSTRATED' BOTTENFIELD GETS BACK TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Pitcher Kent Bottenfield shagged fly balls during
batting practice Friday with the fervor of a wide-eyed rookie.
Bottenfield's motivation, though, wasn't to impress coaches into
giving him playing time.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply part of his between-starts workout regimen, which
is probably the most rigorous of any pitcher on the staff.
Bottenfield can be seen running the stadium steps in the ballpark.
On the road, he can be found running the city streets. When he's
not working out, he's studying videotape.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it understandable that Bottenfield was so upset
after Thursday's loss to the Mariners. It was probably his biggest
start to date as an Angel, but he was the losing pitcher after
giving up four runs in 5 innings in a 7-2 loss the Mariners. The
normally affable Bottenfield snapped at the Mariners' Mike Cameron
during the game, then waved off reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was frustrated,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He's put a
lot of weight in the fact he knows he's a big part of the rotation,
a big part of the ballclub. He wants to go out there and lead. And
it's tough to do when you're not throwing the ball as consistently
as you'd like to. But I think Kent's been a little hard on
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, 4-7 with a 5.60 ERA, and second baseman Adam
Kennedy were acquired from the Cardinals on March 23 in a trade for
Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   MIKE AND OREL: Scioscia said he has tried calling pitcher Orel
Hershiser, who was released this week by the Dodgers. Scioscia, who
was a teammate of Hershiser's with the Dodgers in the 1980s, said
he left a message on Hershiser's answering machine but hasn't heard
back from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a difficult transition,'' Scioscia said. ``You
think you have an ounce of competitiveness left, you want to get it
out of your system.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Angels would consider signing Hershiser, Scioscia
said: ``You'll have to ask (general manager) Bill Stoneman.''
Reminded that he has another former Dodgers pitcher on the staff in
Tim Belcher, Scioscia responded: ``Why don't we get Fernando
(Valenzuela) too?''
</P>
<P>
   NOT READY: Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis is eligible to come off the
disabled list Sunday, but he isn't close to recovering from a
strained muscle in his right side.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis believes he hurt himself initially when batting in a
National League stadium (Bank One Ballpark in Arizona) on June 11,
then aggravated it pitching in Baltimore on June 16, forcing him to
the DL. He has not even begun playing catch and there are no
immediate plans to do so. &QL;

THE NO. 2 EXECUTIVE AT ORACLE RESIGNS ABRUPTLY
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Oracle Corp., the world's second-largest
software publisher, said Friday night that Raymond Lane, its
president and chief operating officer, had abruptly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, 53, had been at Oracle for eight years and had held the
post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking
executive in one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies, he
has always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive
and co-founder, Lawrence J. Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's departure came just days after the company admitted that
it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival,
the Microsoft Corp., in an effort to prove that Microsoft was
secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the
federal antitrust lawsuit against it.
</P>
<P>
   The spying operation led to several exposes based on documents
that were supplied to reporters at The New York Times, The Wall
Street Journal and The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   In a short statement announcing Lane's departure, Oracle gave no
indication why Lane had chosen to resign. Lane made no public
statement Friday and could not be reached Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lane will continue to serve on Oracle's board of directors, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful to Ray for all of his efforts,'' Ellison said in
a statement. ``He will be missed. We wish him nothing but the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oracle spokeswoman, Jennifer Glass, declined to comment on
why Lane was leaving his post. But she said his departure was not
due to the Microsoft controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely unrelated,'' she said, to the events that
exploded this week when Oracle executives admitted the company had
hired the Washington detective firm of Investigative Group
International in an effort to link Microsoft to public relations
efforts in its behalf during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's departure has been rumored for months. Friday night,
several people familiar with the company's internal strategy said
that Lane's role has decreased in the past year and that Ellison
has increasingly guided the company in a direction different from
the one advocated by Lane.

PRESBYTERIANS VOTE TO BAN CLERGY FROM CONDUCTING UNIONS OF GAYS

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ In a close vote, the top policy-making body
of the Presbyterian Church (USA) approved an amendment to the
church's constitution Friday night forbidding ministers from
conducting same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which will take effect next June if it is ratified
by two-thirds of the church's regional jurisdictions, came after an
emotional debate on an issue that has been quite contentious among
other Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, for example, two ministers within the
larger United Methodist Church have been brought to trial for
violating a law of their denomination forbidding same-sex unions.
Both were convicted and one was defrocked, while the other was
suspended from his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian amendment's approval came on a 268-251 vote,
among the final items of business at the denomination's General
Assembly, which has been meeting in this southern California port
city since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, supporters of the amendment described it as
upholding a traditional Christian view of marriage. One church
elder, Paula Metherell, a member of the local presbytery here in
Long Beach, said ``the duty of the church'' is to serve as ``a
moral beacon,'' calling people to a life of holiness.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure, like George McCall of Missouri,
argued that the amendment, if approved, would limit the ability of
pastors to minister effectively to all members of their
congregation. ``Do not bind our conscience and tie our hands as
pastors,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the vote, the assembly narrowly defeated an alternative
proposal that would have called for a ``spirit of dialogue'' to
prevail among Presbyterians and for the church to honor ``the
discretion of pastors'' in providing care to their congregations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The denomination, with 2.6 million members in 11,400
congregations spread coast to coast, represents one of the most
historically influential streams of Protestantism in the United
States. Presbyterians have been heavily represented in U.S.
politics, most prominently counting Woodrow Wilson, Dwight
Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan among their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination's governing structure has significant parallels
to that of the United States, with the Presbyterian assembly
playing a role similar to that of Congress in passing
constitutional amendments, which then must be ratified by the
presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions, that play a role in that
process similar to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the denomination has become increasingly
riled by issues centering on what rights are due its gay members.
And division over same-sex unions was evident earlier this week,
among the commissioners, as Presbyterian delegates are called, on
the committee that formulated the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, by a vote of 25-22, the committee approved a
statement declaring, ``Scripture and our confessions teach that
God's intention for all people is to live either in fidelity within
the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity
in singleness.'' The amendment adds that church officers may not
bless same-sex unions, nor may church property be used for such a
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's wording is close to the law against same-sex
unions adopted by the Methodists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night's vote is not the first time Presbyterian
leaders have attempted to legislate against same-sex unions. Six
years ago, the assembly adopted a similar amendment, but it failed
to win the approval of the needed majority of the presbyteries to
become law. In 1995, a similar effort failed to pass the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the denomination has seemed to lean in a more
conservative direction on issues relating to homosexuals. In 1996,
the assembly approved an amendment barring the ordination of anyone
sexually active outside the bounds of marriage, a move widely
understood as aimed at preventing noncelibate gays and lesbians
from serving as ministers, elders or deacons. It became church law
the next year, after more than two-thirds of the presbyteries voted
in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial questions among religious organizations of how to
relate to gays and lesbians in their pews reflect similar tensions
within U.S. society and politics. The vote here, for example, came
the same week as the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld the right
of the Boy Scouts of America to bar a gay man from serving as a
scout leader. And the Presbyterians' vote also follows the decision
of the Vermont legislature earlier this year to extend to same-sex
unions a civil recognition that stops just short of calling them
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Major religious organizations have taken different positions as
they have wrestled with such questions as whether they should
ordain gays or permit same-sex unions. For example, the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, representing the spiritual leaders
of more than 800 Reform synagogues, voted in March to support its
members who officiate at same-sex unions. Two months later, the
Methodists' policy-making body affirmed its church law forbidding
ministers from performing such unions.
</P>
<P>
   An even tougher approach has been taken by the conservative
Southern Baptist Convention, with 15.8 million members, which
amended its basic statement of faith in June to call on Christians
to oppose homosexuality, along with abortion, pornography and
racism. Eight years ago, the Southern Baptists amended their
constitution to allow the denomination to sever ties with any
congregation that ordained gays or allowed same-sex unions.

WHITE SOX BLASTS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Statistically, this is (thus far) the best Chicago
White Sox team since the 1919 edition that wound up tanking the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, we have a Red Sox ballclub that is doing what
all the others have done since 1918 _ only this time they're free
falling sooner than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The team on the way up met the team on the way down Friday
night, and the result was a predictable 10-4 White Sox victory over
the remnants of a Red Sox team that made New England dare to dream
only a few short weeks ago. 10-4. Over and out?
</P>
<P>
   The erstwhile Princes of Suffolk County surrendered five more
homers (two each for Frank Thomas and Brook Fordyce), lost for the
27th time in their last 40 outings, and Saturday could drop to the
sea level of .500 for the first time since April 14 (5-5). Boston
goes into Saturday's battle with Paxton Crawford, a 22-year-old
righty who'll be making his major league debut. How could it have
come to this so swiftly?
</P>
<P>
   They went 9-18 in June and the clubhouse karma is being tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of looking back,'' catcher Jason Varitek said. ``If
we look back at this damn month, we're never gonna get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only riled Boston player. Jeff Frye, who pinch hit
for Mike Stanley in the eighth inning, was furious after striking
out. Frye would not say why he was mad, but he may have been
bothered that manager Jimy Williams was embarrassing Stanley (seven
K's in his last 10 at-bats). Meanwhile, Frye got into an animated
discussion with Carl Everett before the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't getting into it,'' said Frye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say,'' said Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad they can't field more than one Nomar Garciaparra. The
incomparable shortstop had three more hits and is at .396 on the
first day of July.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox' pitching staff is reeling. The immortal Hipolito
Pichardo was followed to the hill by brutal Bryce Florie,
``Virtual'' Rheal Cormier and John ``Way Back'' Wasdin. All four
gave up home runs. Boston pitchers have been taken over the bridge
in a club-record 15 consecutive games, yielding a whopping 36 bombs
in that sorry span.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' answered Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan had an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making really bad pitches,'' said Kerrigan. ``Those
pitches are right down the middle of the plate. You couldn't put it
on a tee any better. We're pitching right into their strength _
right where we tell them not to throw it in our meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hipo made his first big league start since he faced the Red Sox
while working for the Kansas City Royals two summers ago. It was
only a matter of time before the ChiSox got to Pichardo. They
scored three in the third with some help from Boston's increasingly
dubious defense.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce (his sister owns a beauty salon in Newton) led the
three-run third with a bloop to medium right field. Izzy Alcantara
broke in, but stopped and let the easy out fall for a single. After
Jose Valentin hit a one-out double, the Sox intentionally walked
Thomas to load the bases. Magglio Ordonez brought home the first
run with a fielder's choice grounder, then Chris Singleton hit a
first-pitch double to left, scoring two more runs, and it was 3-0.
With two out and nobody aboard in the fourth, Fordyce hit his
second homer of the season, a shot to left off Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Facing lefthander Jim Parque (8-2), the Sox had one of their
lineups quilted from Dan Duquette's regular visits to the junkyard.
Morgan Burkhart batted fifth, followed by left fielder Brian
Daubach, Stanley, Alcantara, and Manny Alexander. Stanley, who had
fanned five times in his prior seven at-bats, struck out against
Parque in the second and again in the fourth. He looked like Joe
Hardy in the final scene of ``Damn Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox broke through with three runs in the fifth. Rookie
Alcantara led off the inning and golfed a 414-foot drive over the
fence in center. It was the kid's first big league homer and he
savored the moment, rounding the bases in Jeffrey Leonard fashion.
A member of the Red Sox bullpen crew fetched the souvenir for
Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Varitek hit what should have been an
inning-ending grounder to short, but Valentin booted it (error No.
18 this year), and it opened the gates for the Red Sox. Garciaparra
followed with a single to left, Everett got hit by a pitch, then
Burkhart held back on a hanging curve and grounded it into center
for a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Florie came on to start the bottom of the fifth and it was ugly.
Thomas greeted the righthander with a heat-seeking shot into the
left-field seats on a 1-2 pitch. After a double by Ordonez,
Singleton grounded out (he should have been awarded first on
catcher's interference, but Boston caught a break), then Carlos Lee
drove a 1-0 pitch far over the wall in left-center. It was 7-3, and
Cormier got the call. In Florie's last four games, he's given up
eight hits and eight earned runs in 2 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hang one and he hits it 700 feet,'' said Florie. ``There's
nothing tired about that. It's just tired pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier gave up his homer to Thomas in the sixth. Thomas's
second shot of the night gave him 12 for June and brought Wasdin
into the game. The rout was on. Scott Hatteberg hit a pinch homer
for the Sox in the eighth, and Fordyce answered with the obligatory
shot off Wasdin in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday Red Sox Nation turns its lonely eyes to Paxton
Crawford.

KINGS KEEPING EYE ON LINDROS SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Taylor had a sense the Philadelphia Flyers would wait until
the last minute to offer a new contract to Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his cell phone nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the Kings general manager, is spending the holiday
weekend at his in-laws in upstate New York, where he learned of the
Flyers offer just hours before the deadline for eligible players to
become either restricted or unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have expressed an interest in acquiring Lindros, the
one-time Hart Trophy winner as the league's MVP who is
re-evaluating his hockey future after suffering four concussions in
the last six months and six in his career.
</P>
<P>
   So have the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. If the
Flyers hadn't made a qualifying offer to Lindros at $8.5 million,
the list certainly would have grown. Lindros would have become an
unrestricted free agent, with the Flyers receiving no compensation.
Any contract offers were expected to be short on guaranteed money
and filled with incentives based on games played.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Friday it appeared the Flyers, after months of
acrimony over Lindros' medical treatment, might let him leave
without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   When he is playing, Lindros is one of the best. But he also is
suffering from post-concussion symptoms from his last injury, which
occurred in late May during the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Kings, Rangers or Maple Leafs mentioned players in
their talks with the Flyers. All were waiting to see a report on
Lindros' condition from the Chicago-based neurologist James Kelly,
who is treating him. Any team that trades for Lindros would have to
assume the $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a risk the team could not receive insurance on the
contract given Lindros' medical history. The NHL requires that the
top five salaries on each team are covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were required to tender him a new contract of at
least last year's salary. Lindros has until Aug. 1 to accept or
become a restricted free agent. Teams can still make offers for
Lindros, but if the Flyers do match the offer, it will cost the
offering team five No.1 draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   The list of unrestricted free agents includes:
</P>
<P>
   Forwards Mark Messier, Claude Lemieux, Shayne Corson and Rick
Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Mathieu Schneider, Paul Coffey and Dave Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders Ron Tugnutt, Sean Burke and Tom Barasso.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the Kings who is an unrestricted free agent
is defenseman Garry Galley, who is not expected back.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lindros, the list of potential restricted free
agents includes:
</P>
<P>
   Forwards Joe Sakic, Doug Weight, Owen Nolan, Slava Kozlov and
Adam Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Sandis Ozolinsh, Scott Niedermayer and Alexei
Zhitnik.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders Felix Potvin, Chris Osgood and Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   After teams make a qualifying offer ($8.5 million in Lindros'
case), player have 30 days to accept it or become a restricted free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   NHL general managers will receive a final copy today of the
complete list of restricted and unrestricted free agents. &QL;

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ In a close vote, the top policy-making body
of the Presbyterian Church (USA) approved an amendment to the
church's constitution Friday night forbidding ministers from
conducting same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which will take effect next June if it is ratified
by two-thirds of the church's regional jurisdictions, came after an
emotional debate on an issue that has been quite contentious among
other Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, for example, two ministers within the
larger United Methodist Church have been brought to trial for
violating a law of their denomination forbidding same-sex unions.
Both were convicted and one was defrocked, while the other was
suspended from his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian amendment's approval came on a 268-251 vote,
among the final items of business at the denomination's General
Assembly, which has been meeting in this southern California port
city since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, supporters of the amendment described it as
upholding a traditional Christian view of marriage. One church
elder, Paula Metherell, a member of the local presbytery here in
Long Beach, said ``the duty of the church'' is to serve as ``a
moral beacon,'' calling people to a life of holiness.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure, like George McCall of Missouri,
argued that the amendment, if approved, would limit the ability of
pastors to minister effectively to all members of their
congregation. ``Do not bind our conscience and tie our hands as
pastors,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the vote, the assembly narrowly defeated an alternative
proposal that would have called for a ``spirit of dialogue'' to
prevail among Presbyterians and for the church to honor ``the
discretion of pastors'' in providing care to their congregations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The denomination, with 2.6 million members in 11,400
congregations spread coast to coast, represents one of the most
historically influential streams of Protestantism in the United
States. Presbyterians have been heavily represented in U.S.
politics, most prominently counting Woodrow Wilson, Dwight
Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan among their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination's governing structure has significant parallels
to that of the United States, with the Presbyterian assembly
playing a role similar to that of Congress in passing
constitutional amendments, which then must be ratified by the
presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions, that play a role in that
process similar to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the denomination has become increasingly
riled by issues centering on what rights are due its gay members.
And division over same-sex unions was evident earlier this week,
among the commissioners, as Presbyterian delegates are called, on
the committee that formulated the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, by a vote of 25-22, the committee approved a
statement declaring, ``Scripture and our confessions teach that
God's intention for all people is to live either in fidelity within
the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity
in singleness.'' The amendment adds that church officers may not
bless same-sex unions, nor may church property be used for such a
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's wording is close to the law against same-sex
unions adopted by the Methodists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night's vote is not the first time Presbyterian
leaders have attempted to legislate against same-sex unions. Six
years ago, the assembly adopted a similar amendment, but it failed
to win the approval of the needed majority of the presbyteries to
become law. In 1995, a similar effort failed to pass the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the denomination has seemed to lean in a more
conservative direction on issues relating to homosexuals. In 1996,
the assembly approved an amendment barring the ordination of anyone
sexually active outside the bounds of marriage, a move widely
understood as aimed at preventing noncelibate gays and lesbians
from serving as ministers, elders or deacons. It became church law
the next year, after more than two-thirds of the presbyteries voted
in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizations that sup- ported that amendment was the
Presbyterian Coalition. Its modera- tor, or top official, the Rev.
Jerry Anderson of Glen Ellyn, Ill., said after Friday night's vote
that there was ``no room to gloat'' for the amend- ment's
supporters, because many Presbyterians who opposed the L amendment
were suffering ``a lot of pain.'' Nevertheless, Anderson said he
expected the amendment to be ratified overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the amendment's oppo- nents, Mitzi Henderson, a
Californian who serves as co-moderator of the More Light
Presbyterian Churches, an organization that supports gay rights,
said, ``I don't think it's the end of the struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said she did not agree that the amendment would be
easily ratified by the presbyteries.
 &UR;  &LR; Controversial questions among religious organizations of how to
relate to gays and lesbians in their pews reflect similar tensions
within U.S. society and politics. The vote here, for example, came
the same week as the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld the right
of the Boy Scouts of America to bar a gay man from serving as a
scout leader. And the Presbyterians' vote also follows the decision
of the Vermont legislature earlier this year to extend to same-sex
unions a civil recognition that stops just short of calling them
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Major religious organizations have taken different positions as
they have wrestled with such questions as whether they should
ordain gays or permit same-sex unions. For example, the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, representing the spiritual leaders
of more than 800 Reform synagogues, voted in March to support its
members who officiate at same-sex unions. Two months later, the
Methodists' policy-making body affirmed its church law forbidding
ministers from performing such unions.
</P>
<P>
   An even tougher approach has been taken by the conservative
Southern Baptist Convention, with 15.8 million members, which
amended its basic statement of faith in June to call on Christians
to oppose homosexuality, along with abortion, pornography and
racism. Eight years ago, the Southern Baptists amended their
constitution to allow the denomination to sever ties with any
congregation that ordained gays or allowed same-sex unions.

DRAFT DAY WAS GOOD FOR CLIPPERS' BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's young-and-the-feckless edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   For a good definition of purgatory, see Elgin Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Hall of Famer has been the Clippers General Manager for
14 years, meaning he's had maybe a dozen good nights of sleep since
signing on with renown basketball slumlord Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fact injuries forced Baylor to retire early in
1971, the year the Lakers won their first NBA title, and you have a
man who has without question paid for his sins of this life and
several others.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a good day for Baylor. He weaved in and out of the
draft and picked up four rookies with promise and two second-year
players who, alongside Lamar Odom, shines a rare ray of hope on the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But something nags at me nonetheless, and it has to do with
Sterling's attention to his money. Thanks to the NBA's new labor
deal, it now takes five years for a player to become a free agent,
and the draft is subject to salary slotting. Meaning, the best way
for a team to keep a lid on its expenses is to assemble a team of
young players.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's motive is pure. He aches to build a winning team, and
this may be his best opportunity since Danny Manning was a Clipper.
But let's not lose sight that this works to Sterling's benefit, and
the only losses that bother him are financial. ...
</P>
<P>
   This strategy may also work to Sterling's benefit when he gets
around to hiring a coach. Rather than hiring another NBA coaching
retread with salary history, it may be smarter and cheaper to hire
an ambitious college coach with a reputation for teaching. Because
Odom, Darius Miles and the other members of Boyz II Men will need
instruction. ...

<P>
   Best one-liner going around about the Clippers: They finally
have a team capable of making it to the Final Four. ...
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Mark Madsen was ecstatic to be drafted by the Lakers.
But it probably hasn't dawned on him yet that he'll now be dragged,
bludgeoned, minced and squashed on a daily basis in practice by the
NBA's original 800-pound philosopher, Shaquille O'Neal. Madsen may
come to view game days as a day off. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's one draft development that warmed by heart. With JaRon
Rush not being drafted, his pseudo-agent, sneaker league coach and
all-around misanthrope Myron Piggie, who personally turned Rush's
college career into a nightmare, will receive 10 percent of nothing
for all of his work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush story should be bound and made mandatory reading for
every high school basketball player with a dream. ...
</P>
<P>
   The people who went to Costa Rica to study the juice factor in
major league baseballs now say there's only a modest difference in
the ball being used in 2000 compared to the ones used in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but the ball's liveliness was only part of the
equation. The best hitters say they can pick up the rotation better
because of the blue Major League Baseball logo on each ball. And
the best breaking ball pitchers say the seams are lower and it has
taken some of the bite out of their pitches.
</P>
<P>
   While I don't doubt the tests were thorough, seeing is
believing. Balls are being hit harder and farther by a greater
number of players this year than last. That's all the information I
need to believe the 2K ball is hitter-friendly. ...
</P>
<P>
   All-Star voters in general do a good job selecting the right
starters for the game. But when they miss, they do so like Sammy
Sosa chasing high heat.
</P>
<P>
   The American League scorecard is perfect except for the
predictable sentiment installing Cal Ripken as the starter at
third. It even has Royals outfielder Jermaine Dye atop the outfield
list. With Cal injured, the starting job will likely go to the
Angels' Troy Glaus (23 home runs) or Indians' Travis Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the reserves won't be easy. Four first baseman deserve
to go -- the A's Jason Giambi (.345, 22 home runs, 75 RBI),
Toronto's Carlos Delgado (.361, 27, 72), Chicago's Frank Thomas (65
RBI) and Kansas City's Mike Sweeney (73 RBI) -- but there may be
room for only three. And Jim Thome, having an off year, is second
in voting behind Giambi and could pass him.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez currently ranks third in the outfield, but his
lead on Carl Everett (23-68) and Darin Erstad (.373, M.L.-leading
126 hits) is slim and he, too, may skip the game because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's no logical backup for Roberto Alomar at
second. On the fence: Ex-Dodger catcher Charles Johnson, Yankees
catcher Jose Posada and Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick, stuck
behind The Trilogy (A-Rod, Jeter, Nomar).
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. has two blatant mistakes: Craig Biggio leading at
second base and Ken Griffey Jr. leading all outfielders. Biggio is
having a poor season, and worse, there are six viable alternates
behind him -- the Mets' Edgardo Alfonso (.340), the Braves' Quilvio
Veras, ex-Dodger Eric Young (.321, 54 runs, 23 steals) of the Cubs,
the Marlin's Luis Castillo (.357, 33 steals), Montreal's Jose Vidro
(.370, 50+ runs and RBI), and the Giants' Jeff Kent (.347,
N.L.-leading 75 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is hitting just .241 (with 25 HR), the lowest average of
any Reds regular, and both Vladimir Guerrero (.369-22-67) and
ex-Angel Jim Edmonds (72 runs, 22 HR) are more deserving of a
starting spot. Sammy Sosa (.312-20-66) also is a tentative starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield has the numbers (.350, 25 home runs,
66 RBI), but he's ambivalent about the game and a glut of outfield
candidates -- Brian Giles (67 RBI), Eric Owens, Andrew Jones, Steve
Finley, Geoff Jenkins -- could lead manager Bobby Cox to select
Kevin Brown as the Dodgers' lone representative. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing it took only 30 seconds for ex-Tar Heel Larry Brown
to call his alma mater and inform them he would to take over for
Bill Guthridge. And it took only 35 seconds for Allen Iverson to
call North Carolina with a personal recommendation. ...
</P>
<P>
   A couple more apologies and relief efforts like Thursday and the
New York tabloids will start suggesting the Mets trade for John
Rocker. ...
</P>
<P>
   I know Mike Tyson is hungry for a match against Lennox Lewis,
but he should snack on Evander Holyfield one more time before
moving to the main course, uhh, event. &QL;

COOPER, ANDERSON DO JOB FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Angels pitcher Brian Cooper surely owes center
fielder Garret Anderson a hearty ``Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Anderson's home run-robbing catch of a deep fly ball by
Oakland's Randy Velarde in the fourth inning that made Cooper's
first major-league shutout possible in the Angels' 7-0 victory in
front of 28,765 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (3-2) gave up only three hits, walked one and struck out
four while making 124 pitches. Other than Velarde's deep fly,
Cooper was never in danger of giving up a run. No A's baserunner
even reached second base.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd on its feet, Cooper retired Velarde on a grounder
to third to end the game. Cooper had fallen behind 3-0 in the count
to Velarde and knew if he walked him he would be taken out because
of his high pitch count. But he settled down just enough to finish
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jacked up,'' said Cooper, who lowered his ERA to 3.48,
best among the starters on the staff. ``That first pitch (to
Velarde) was as hard as I threw all game. It pumps you up to be out
there like that. I felt tingling down my spine. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper went right after the A's hitters. The A's lead the league
in walks, and Cooper didn't want to play their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the type that strikes people out, I rely on the
defense,'' Cooper said. ``I need them to make plays for me, and
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly Anderson, who celebrated his 28th birthday with
home run No.22 (a career high). But it was the catch that gave
Cooper an even bigger lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would go that far,'' Anderson said. ``But I
knew once I got back to the wall and it was still in the air I had
a shot at it. Those are always hard to judge. You have so much time
and you get back so early, you have to judge it instead of just
react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's play wasn't the only fine play made by the Angels
defense. In the sixth inning with Terrance Long on first and one
out, A's manager Art Howe called for a hit-and-run with Velarde at
bat. Velarde lined out to Tim Salmon in right center, and Salmon
doubled up Long at first with a one-hop throw. It was Salmon's
seventh outfield assist of the season, second most in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was in command throughout the game, his sinker helping
him get 14 outs on ground balls. Between Jason Giambi's two-out
single in the first inning and Matt Stairs' one-out single in the
fifth, Cooper retired 11 consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in games he's struggled early, he's managed to pitch deep
into ballgames, and that's about as deep as you can pitch into a
ballgame,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia. ``You look at his
stuff, a sinker and a slider, and he's not intimidating. But he
executes his pitches in jams. He doesn't scare off and he pitches
inside well. He knows what he has to do and he does it. He's a real
clear thinker out there and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn caught third baseman Troy Glaus'
throw for the final out, handed the ball to Cooper and giving him a
hug. Cooper then got hugs from catcher Bengie Molina and Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coop, he's a cool cat,'' Vaughn said. ``He doesn't get too
excited about himself. He's always relaxed, always cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second complete-game shutout by the Angels this
season. Scott Schoeneweis did it on April 10 vs. Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper nearly threw a shutout earlier this season. On June 14,
Cooper and the Angels held a 2-0 lead after eight innings against
Tampa Bay, but Scioscia went to closer Troy Percival in the ninth,
and Percival gave up three runs in a 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper admitted he was looking over his shoulder after the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried (about coming out),'' he said.
``Especially when Buddy (Black, pitching coach) came up to me. But
Buddy and Scioscia said `How you doing?' I said fine, then Scioscia
said, 'You've got seven pitches (to finish the ninth).'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper needed 11 but still got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 12 hits, including Anderson's homer and homers by
Molina and Benji Gil.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Angels to within five games of first-place
Seattle and 4 of second-place Oakland in the AL West. It was the
first game in a 10-game homestand, which includes seven games
against the A's and Mariners. &QL;

U.S. FALLS SHORT AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ On Wednesday in the UPS International
Tournament in Los Alamitos, the U.S. National water polo team won a
close game against Croatia thanks in part to several shots bouncing
off the bar and into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chris Humbert of the U.S. said those shots, which
are called bar-in when the ball goals in and bar-out when it
doesn't, can be the difference in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night against powerful Yugoslavia it was a bar-out on a
shot by Tony Azevedo with one second remaining that kept the U.S.
from salvaging a tie, and the Yugoslavians swam away with a 9-8
victory in front of 1,500 at the U.S. National Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing signs of some good things,'' U.S. coach John
Vargas said after his team played one of the world's best teams to
a near-standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. may get another chance against Yugoslavia, which
improved to 4-0-0 in the tournament and clinched a spot in Sunday's
3 p.m. final. The U.S. (2-1-1) can clinch their spot in the
championship game with a win or tie against Italy in today's 1:30
p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. may have already clinched a berth in the final if it
would have done better on man-advantage situations against the
Yugoslavians. They managed to convert only 2 of 10 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, which converted 15 of 21 man-advantage opportunities
in the first three games of the tournament, remained hot on 6-on-5s
by making 5 of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 6-on-5, there are so many subtleties'' said Vargas,
whose team only recently returned to full strength. ``The key is
playing together. The success on the 6-on-5 will come with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia opened up a 6-3 lead at halftime and scored the first
goal of the second half. But the U.S. stormed back with five
unanswered goals. Humbert began the streak with scores on a
man-advantage and a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. got to within 7-6 when Gavin Arroyo tipped in a goal
after a nice lob pass by Azevedo with 3:20 left in the third
quarter. They then evened the score at 7-7 with 5:32 left when Sean
Kern fired a goal into the upper-right corner on another
counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, the U.S. took the lead when Humbert
drew a four-meter foul and Azevedo converted the penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, which went 11:22 without a goal, tied the score on a
twisting shot by leading scorer Aleksandar Sapic with 3:15 left and
notched the game-winner with 1:46 remaining on a pretty backhand
from the hole by Viktor Jelenic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian goalkeeper Aleksandar Sostar smothered Arroyo's
point-blank shot on a 6-on-5 with 1:03 and Azevedo just missed on
the team's other prime late-game opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalkeeper Dan Hackett kept his team in the game by making
eight saves, many coming on point-blank opportunities. Humbert,
Kern and Azevedo each had two goals for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
   ITALY 10, TEAM UPS 6: Merrill Moses had 15 saves for Team UPS
(0-4-0), but it wasn't good enough to hold off Italy (2-2-0). Layne
Beaubien and Omar Amr had two goals each for Team UPS and Italy was
led by Roberto Calcaterra. Team UPS never led in the game but they
did close within 7-5 with 4:33 left on a goal by Amr.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA 8, CROATIA 7: Australia (1-2-1) won for the first time
in the tournament as they jumped to a 5-2 lead and held on for the
win over Croatia (2-2-0). &QL;

SHEFFIELD CAPS BIG MONTH WITH BIG NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Emotion often got the better of Gary Sheffield
earlier in his career. He admitted that when his five-game
suspension was upheld two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, what separates Sheffield's past from his present is how
he channels his emotions, and that can't be illustrated any better
than by what he accomplished Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield capped one of the most explosive months in his career
with a pair of homers and four RBI as the Dodgers pummeled the San
Francisco Giants 9-2 at Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time this season Sheffield hit two homers in a
game and the third time he did it in June. In batting .383 (38 for
99), Sheffield homered 12 times and drove in 30 runs in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday) was a tough day for me and I tried to suck up
everything and go out there and help my team,'' Sheffield said.
``For me to break down like I did (Thursday), I needed to get that
out of my system. Like it says in the Bible, it's healthy. When you
do that, you can get it behind you and move on, and that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield leads the Dodgers with 27 homers and 70 RBI. He's
seven short of his home run total of last season and has
established a Los Angeles Dodgers record for homers before the
All-Star break. Mike Piazza had 24 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield trails Mark McGwire (29 homers) and Barry Bonds (28)
in the home run race and Todd Helton in RBI (76). The production,
not to mention Sheffield's leadership role, is why the Dodgers are
strongly in favor of him appealing the five-game suspension that
was upheld by Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very concerned about the suspension thing and he's
still very concerned about it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He's an emotional player. He plays with a lot of emotion.
You may not see it, but it's there. ... ``That (second homer)
against the wind, that might have been the hardest hit ball I've
seen hit this year. That was a bone-crusher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's offense gave Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown some
much-appreciated but rarely seen run support.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (7-2) allowed two runs in seven innings as his mastery
over the Giants continued.
</P>
<P>
   Brown entered the night 7-1 with a 1.20 ERA in nine games
against the Giants, including a no-hitter when he was pitching for
the Florida Marlins. He was even better by the bay. Brown didn't
pitch at Pac Bell Park when the Dodgers played three games here in
April. But at Candlestick, Brown was 5-1 with a 1.29 ERA in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie was nasty, as usual, but a little wild,'' Johnson
said. ``He threw a few more pitches than you'd like to see, 122 in
seven innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave Brown a 2-0 lead in the first as Eric Karros'
sacrifice fly and Todd Hundley's double qualified as a windfall for
Brown. Or at least it was a premonition of how the evening would
turn out.
</P>
<P>
   In Brown's two losses, the Dodgers failed to score a run. In the
seven no-decisions Brown has had, the Dodgers scored three runs or
less three times.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who walked in the first inning, hit his first homer
when he pulled Russ Ortiz's 2-2 pitch down the left-field line for
a solo homer. It put the Dodgers ahead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Sheffield delivered again, and in a much bigger
way, with a three-run homer into the teeth of a strong wind to give
the Dodgers a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously a tough day for (Sheffield) with the
decision, but he uses things like that to motivate him,'' said
Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green, who walked a career-high four
times. ``He's even more intense than he usually is right now. He's
not the type to mope or let things get him down. He uses adversity
to his benefit.'' &QL;

   A Shiver Creeps Over Los Angeles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bernson, a Los Angeles city councilman, did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this city may regret the day that it ever voted
to bring this convention here,'' he declared, summing up the city's
growing anxiety about the possibility of demonstrations at the
Democratic National Convention there next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson was responding to a warning by the Los Angeles police of
the potential for ``a level of activity'' at least as intense as
the violent protest that disrupted a meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last December. Responding to those
concerns, the council approved a plan to cordon off protesters in a
fenced-in parking lot, and the Secret Service revised plans for
lodging Vice President Al Gore in a nearby hotel. The American
Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The jittery mood was a counterpoint to the placidity of the
campaign elsewhere. As has become almost pro forma in the campaign,
another multibillion-dollar spending plan was put forth by a
presumptive nominee: Gore unveiled an energy plan that he said
would authorize $148 billion over 10 years to improve mass
transportation and decrease dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Gore said, an
obvious dig at his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a former
oilman. Bush, however, said Gore was fooling no one, as a member of
an administration that has seen a 50-cent rise in the cost of
gasoline in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A new dynamic in the debate was fostered by the rise of Ralph
Nader, who after securing the Green Party's presidential nomination
did not wait long to ridicule Gore as ``a gee-whiz techno twit''
who had abandoned the disenfranchised in favor of large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader's words threatened to liven the race up a bit, so did
the ruling on Tuesday by the U.S. Supreme Court, striking down a
Nebraska law that banned a procedure known as a partial-birth
abortion. Gore used the decision to remind voters of Bush's
opposition to abortion rights. ``His views about choice are really
quite extreme,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   _ PETER MARKS
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, America. Hola, Cuba! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever emotional problems Elian Gonzalez may develop later in
life, he can never say he was unwanted as a child. For seven
bizarre months, almost everyone seemed to want him _ on both sides
of that odd political fault line off the tip of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the courts had the last word. The Supreme Court
chose not to hear the case, unable to find any grounds for an
appeal. On news of the court's refusal to get involved, Elian and
his entourage (how many 6-year-olds have entourages?) quickly
headed back to a cheering welcome in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That ended the drama, perhaps, but the ripples still roll onto
both shores. In Cuba, Fidel Castro got a definite jolt of

   A Shiver Creeps Over Los Angeles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bernson, a Los Angeles city councilman, did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this city may regret the day that it ever voted
to bring this convention here,'' he declared, summing up the city's
growing anxiety about the possibility of demonstrations at the
Democratic National Convention there next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson was responding to a warning by the Los Angeles police of
the potential for ``a level of activity'' at least as intense as
the violent protest that disrupted a meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last December. Responding to those
concerns, the council approved a plan to cordon off protesters in a
fenced-in parking lot, and the Secret Service revised plans for
lodging Vice President Al Gore in a nearby hotel. The American
Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The jittery mood was a counterpoint to the placidity of the
campaign elsewhere. As has become almost pro forma in the campaign,
another multibillion-dollar spending plan was put forth by a
presumptive nominee: Gore unveiled an energy plan that he said
would authorize $148 billion over 10 years to improve mass
transportation and decrease dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Gore said, an
obvious dig at his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a former
oilman. Bush, however, said Gore was fooling no one, as a member of
an administration that has seen a 50-cent rise in the cost of
gasoline in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A new dynamic in the debate was fostered by the rise of Ralph
Nader, who after securing the Green Party's presidential nomination
did not wait long to ridicule Gore as ``a gee-whiz techno twit''
who had abandoned the disenfranchised in favor of large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader's words threatened to liven the race up a bit, so did
the ruling on Tuesday by the U.S. Supreme Court, striking down a
Nebraska law that banned a procedure known as a partial-birth
abortion. Gore used the decision to remind voters of Bush's
opposition to abortion rights. ``His views about choice are really
quite extreme,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, America. Hola, Cuba! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever emotional problems Elian Gonzalez may develop later in
life, he can never say he was unwanted as a child. For seven
bizarre months, almost everyone seemed to want him _ on both sides
of that odd political fault line off the tip of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the courts had the last word. The Supreme Court
chose not to hear the case, unable to find any grounds for an
appeal. On news of the court's refusal to get involved, Elian and
his entourage (how many 6-year-olds have entourages?) quickly
headed back to a cheering welcome in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That ended the drama, perhaps, but the ripples still roll onto
both shores. In Cuba, Fidel Castro got a definite jolt of
revolutionary caffeine from the epic Battle for Elian, and now he
wants to keep that energy humming in his unceasing campaign to end,
or at least ease, the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   And, after 38 long years, such a prospect suddenly seemed a

   Voting Surprises in Zimbabwe
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe awoke to a new political dynamic after voters gave a
nascent opposition party just over a third of the seats in
Parliament. The two days of balloting were largely free of the
intimidation that has marked the political climate for months. The
ruling party, led by longtime President Robert Mugabe, still won
the most seats. His party once held all but 3 of the 150 seats.
With 57 going to the nine-month-old Movement for Democratic Change,
it was a stunning setback for Mugabe.

however, that the surpluses will materialize; much is earmarked for
debt reduction.

tax returns, 40.1 million, showed less than $15,000 of income, but
many of these taxpayers were children who sold stocks at a profit

COMMENTARY: GOING FOR BROKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever I start to get blase about today's amazing business
world, I pull out my copy of John Kenneth Galbraith's ``New
Industrial State,'' published in 1967. It's a reminder of how
thoroughly the economy has defied the old conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Galbraith was expressing the consensus of the economics
profession. On the contrary, throughout the book he expressed
contempt for his colleagues, with their naive belief that market
forces still mattered. But his message _ that planning by huge
corporations was increasingly supplanting the chaos of the market
system, that capitalism was becoming indistinguishable from
socialism _ found wide favor. When Galbraith wrote that ``the
entrepreneur no longer exists as an individual in the mature
industrial enterprise,'' when he spoke of the ``euthanasia of
stockholder power,'' many people _ living, let us remember in
Galbraith's defense, in an era when General Motors was the very
model of a major modern manufacturer _ nodded their heads in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of weeks questions about the prospects for
the world's most visible e-tailer have once again roiled the
markets. An analyst at Lehman Brothers has warned that Amazon may
run out of cash early next year; other analysts have leapt to the
firm's defense. I'm not going to get into the middle of this fight.
Isn't it amazing, though, that Amazon has become a household name,
that last year Time named founder Jeff Bezos Person of the Year _
and that we still don't know whether Amazon, or for that matter any
dot-com, has a viable business model?
</P>
<P>
   But that is actually the point. Amazon's business strategy _ to
lose money for an extended period while building a market position
_ is not all that unusual. In fact, it's exactly what Japanese
companies did in their export markets during the '70s and '80s,
when Japan's economy seemed an unstoppable juggernaut. Information
technology, with its powerful increasing returns _ the more people
who use a product, the more useful it becomes _ may have made it
even more necessary than it used to be to lose money now in order
to make it later. But the strategy per se isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the sight of Amazon and other companies pursuing
a full-scale go-for-broke strategy right from the start, losing
hundreds of millions before anyone is even sure that there is money
to be made in their businesses. When Galbraith was writing, it
seemed obvious that only large, well-established companies with
plenty of profits from their existing businesses could afford to
make big bets on the future. When people thought about
private-sector innovation, they had in mind IBM's development of
the 360 series of computers, or Boeing's development of the 747. In
fact, as little as six or seven years ago the common view was that
Japanese companies would steadily gain the technological upper hand
over their American rivals because only the Japanese _ not faced
with annoying pressure to satisfy the financial markets _ could
afford to take the long view, and ignore short-term losses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years our stock market has proved willing
and eager to finance brand-new companies with highly speculative
business plans that require years of losses before anyone will know
whether they make sense. In fact, even companies that could afford
to finance their innovations out of profits on older businesses
prefer to spin off the sexiest projects as semi-independent
companies, in order to benefit from that enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? I suspect that the emergence of our
innovation-friendly finance markets was less inevitable than many
people imagine. And it is by no means certain that the new era will
last. For a while almost every IPO was enthusiastically welcomed by
markets willing to imagine that every new company might be the next
Microsoft. That euphoria has faded; but will it eventually be
replaced by cynicism, by the demand that new businesses show an
actual profit before they can raise large sums of money?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon may be the test case. If the company proves the
pessimists wrong, the golden age of the individual entrepreneur
will certainly go on for a while longer. If Amazon really does go
under, we may be headed back to the era when only big companies
could afford to make big innovations.

TWO OARS BY SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the start, 66-year-old Bill Lenderking said he wondered
if he had ``the right stuff'' to keep up with the four younger and
more experienced rowers. He felt the old-school dread of letting
the side down and a more recent fear of discovering he really was
as old as his reflection in other people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Would he shame himself and slump over his oars, unable to
continue, or, even worse, be humiliated by his companions'
indulgence? Of course, they would wait for him to catch up; the
four-day, 100-mile trip from South Street Seaport Museum to Shelter
Island had been his idea.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest and most experienced of the five, the wiry, cool
David Stookey, 57, doubted at the start that Lenderking would make
it. He did not appear especially fit or muscular, and he had not
rowed since childhood. His greatest strength, an almost childlike
enthusiasm, seemed to desert him as the four boats pulled out of
the slip at the foot of John Street into the East River. Lenderking
was already falling behind, jerking his oars in a ragged rhythm.
God help him at Hell Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Three people came to see them off at 10:30 a.m. last Monday.
Chelsea Danburg, 26, one of Louis Mackall's four daughters, brought
her husband, Asher, to support her dad's sustaining passion. For
the past 12 years, Mackall, a 59-year-old architect from Branford,
Conn., has rowed nearly every day, summer and winter, before work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that the body is happy only when it gets a lot of
exercise,'' said Mackall. ``We need much more exercise than we get.
If I was a therapist, I'd tell my patients, `Go run 20 miles, then
come back and we'll talk.'''

<P>
   The third waver from the shore was Robert Ruenitz, a former
Foreign Service colleague of Lenderking's who had been surprised
when he read about the proposed trip; he knew Lenderking had
trekked and scuba-dived during overseas assignments, but he had
never heard about rowing. No wonder, he agreed, watching him
awkwardly yanking under a boiling sun, trying to get out before The
Beast, a huge tourist boat with a wake as terrifying as a perfect
storm, came churning in. As the four boats turned left and headed
north, Mackall yodeling in the lead, Lenderking already trailing by
several lengths, Ruenitz sighed and said, ``A gallant band.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not a band yet. They barely knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lenderking, who had sentimental memories of boyhood rows off
Shelter Island, where he recently bought a house, conceived the
trip as a test. For all his endearing, lanky gawkiness, there is
something steely and calculating about Lenderking. It is not hard
to envision him as a propagandist for the government's Vietnam
pacification program. But ever since he was pensioned off five
years ago at 61, Lenderking has struggled to chart a new course in
a world skewed to the young. He sensed a metaphor in rowing out of
the discard pool.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, he called a longtime friend, Stookey, a
management consultant who also publishes a newsletter, ``Open-Water
Rowing.'' Stookey thought the cruise, as he called it, was
``do-able.'' He called one of his 800 readers, 58-year-old John
Mullen, a Dallas architect and businessman whom he had once met
briefly at a race. Mullen has won a number of masters sculling
championships, but, like the others, had never rowed more than 20
miles in a day, and then for only one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But Mullen called his summer rowing partner, Mackall, who
recruited his neighbor, 60-year-old Tom Luckey, an architect who
designs children's playground climbing structures. Luckey had never
rowed before but was in good shape and willing to train for rowing
a two-man boat. The men began an e-mail circle of questions,
training tips and bios. None of the men considered themselves
jocks, although Lenderking ran track at Dartmouth, Mackall played
ice hockey at Yale, Luckey is a swimmer, Mullen, who is 6 feet 7
inches, played freshman basketball at Rice, and Stookey once sailed
solo across the Atlantic in a race. They became cyberbuds.
</P>
<P>
   As the notion became a high concept, Lenderking drove from his
home in Washington to Ontario to buy a 17-foot Loudon fiberglass
boat for $2,200. He named it Up the Creek. And then, in an act that
they all admit raised the ante, Lenderking, without consulting the
others, called to see if I was interested. We had never met. I was
mildly interested, I said, being in their age group.
</P>
<P>
   But after I wrote about the plan-in-progress (``It gives new
meaning to the word `cockamamie,''' Mackall would say later),
thelipsite(at)aol.com received more than 100 e-mails requesting the
trip be covered. The e-mailers tended to be upper-middle class,
middle-aged men engaged by Mullen's reason for rowing _ ``I'm at an
age when I'm looking for stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two hours, despite unexpectedly smooth conditions
(the East River turned out to be cleaner than much of Long Island
Sound, which was a millpond), it seemed far more than a stretch for
Lenderking. He would say later that he never for a moment doubted
he would finish, but as he frequently rested from his flailing
strokes, the others' concern mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Luckey, a whimsical man with a spacey
delivery, ``I was hoping Bill would give me an excuse. Mackall has
these annoying bursts of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometime after the surprisingly pacific Hell Gate,
Lenderking found his rhythm. The long, ropy arms on his 6-4 body
became an extension of the oars. Up the Creek began to move
smoothly into the brown waters of the Sound. Stookey stayed with
Lenderking and they pulled into Bayville a half-hour behind the
other two boats. Exhausted, the five men lugged the four boats
across a highway to a motel, ate and fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   They all felt better in the morning, astonished at their lack of
stiffness. Mullen said his back had ached more in training. On the
second day, they pulled with a favorable tide, screamed and laughed
through a brief thunderstorm that, according to Mackall, turned the
surface of the water into ``vibrating marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackall (``He is a bull,'' said Luckey) was pulling more than
his weight in a 17-foot Monument River wherry he had bought used
for $1,500 last winter. The boat had won a number of races, but
with the two men's gear and food it looked like a floating slum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so exciting,'' Mackall said. ``I feel like a kid again
on an adventure with the guys. I brought Luckey along because he
talks endlessly, but we have run out of interesting things to say.
We are into fantasies now.''
</P>
<P>
   The most do-able and durable of their fantasies revolved around
their designing The Dinner Boat, in which people would work up an
appetite by rowing out while one of them cooked in the stern. Once
in open water, a dining table would slide out for the feast they
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The fantasists stopped once at a private beach in Sands Point
for a quick swim; the owners of the mansion were not at home and
the workmen didn't care. Mullen did not swim; raised water-skiing
on Texas lakes, he says he is still not used to salt water drying
on his body. With Mullen, they pulled into Mount Sinai Yacht Club
near Port Jefferson at about 4:30 p.m., after seven hours of
rowing. Lenderking and Stookey, caught in a tide shift, arrived
three hours later. They ate pizza and drank beer on the yacht club
deck, then all slept on a sailboat, Daydreamer, courtesy of a
yachtsman they knew only as Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone that night, Mackall said he was amazed by
Lenderking. He added: ``The guy is smiling. He's getting
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third morning, Stookey took off a half hour ahead of the
others. Because his boat was the slowest, he said. He dismissed
Lenderking's suspicion that he was really trying to avoid another
long day of baby-sitting Up the Creek.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, tightly knit man with curly dark-blond hair, blue eyes
and a sharp, sun-weathered face, Stookey is self-contained, almost
mysterious, genial yet watchful. He has done most of his rowing
alone, often testing boats for his newsletter and Web site
(www.openwater.com). Manufactured by a French firm, Birus, his boat
was a self-bailing, white 14-foot fiberglass yole with a sliding
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Stookey hugged the shore on the third day, stopping several
times to examine geological formations and to bird-watch. Maybe
that's why the others never noticed that they were passing him.
Mullen was Lenderking's ``escort'' that day, and Mullen likes to
row a mile out to sea. The Mackall/Luckey fantasies were
particularly absorbing (``Babes on the beach'' was all they would
reveal later.) At 4:30, when they pulled into the Matt-A-Mar Marina
in Mattituck, which charged them $20 each a night to tie up,
Stookey was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he just found people he likes better than us,'' Mackall
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whacked-out side to him,'' Luckey said. ``He's up to
something. We'll see him tomorrow. He'll just row out to meet us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mullen, the tall straight-arrow from Texas, fretted all the
way back to the motel and while the others showered, he called
other marinas on his cell phone. He was faintly annoyed that
Stookey was not carrying a cell phone or a VHF radio or a global
positioning system, as he was.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:45, about to go for dinner, Mullen insisted they all go
down to the dock for one more look. It was Lenderking who shouted,
``The drama is over.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Stookey, cool and smiling, changing his shirt. He had
reached the inlet hours ago, assumed he was still in the lead,
parked the boat and fallen asleep on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   He was only one who did not drink at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, they hitched a ride on a garbage truck back to
the marina. Mullen had wanted to row around Orient Point as part of
his grand scheme of circling Long Island in stages. But the others
were ``smelling the barn,'' as Mullen put it, and so they
compromised on a portage through Truman Beach near East Marion.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen was amazed at how jaunty everyone was, how much lighter
the boats seemed on the fourth day than the first. They were all so
much stronger, surer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trip was much easier than I thought it would be,''
he said. ``You wonder how many things in life you don't try because
the idea seems too big, too intimidating. I stayed up nights
worrying about Hell Gate, and it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have tried this without Bill, and I've rowed for
years and he never rowed before. I'm grateful to him and I'm amazed
by his indomitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen seemed to get the most pleasure from his boat, the
fastest of the four, a beautiful, wooden, 18-foot St. Lawrence
River skiff, a copy of a 19th-century boat in Mystic Seaport called
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you row you blow out your pipes,'' he said. ``There's a
freshness, a different set of ideas out there. Clouds, water, your
body, it's not a place to ponder changes in your life. It's a place
to just plug into the environment we are usually isolated from.''
</P>
<P>
   The last day for the gallant band was the mellowest. They rowed
at their usual 4 knots, but they arrived unusually close together,
atypically on schedule, at about 4:30 p.m. They pulled up onto a
private lawn on Gardiner's Creek in Shelter Island. It was
suspicious that Lenderking was in the lead, but he seemed as fresh
as the rest of them. His grin was certainly the widest. He echoed
the consensus: The trip had been hard and senseless, and more fun
than any of them had had since boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   The welcoming committee was smaller than the bon voyage
entourage. Mullen's wife of 35 years, Anne, and their dog, Lover,
were waiting on the lawn. Plans were made for a victory feast the
next night at Mullen's house in Springs, Easthampton. Stookey was
returning to Manhattan to pick up his car, then drive back to pick
up his boat for the trip home to Rhode Island. It sounded harder
than the row. Mullen, Mackall and Luckey would return in the
morning to row to Springs and Amagansett.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' said Luckey, ``my wife, Ettie, will ask me again to
explain why I am doing this, and I will tell her again I still hope
to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is an existential search,'' said Lenderking, as if he
was considering the trip for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about life,'' said Luckey, striking a pose on the
lawn. ``People die because they get out of the stream. The body
senses you are not having a good time and says, `That's it, buddy,
we're out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what we just did,'' asked Mullen, ``was in the stream?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' said Luckey, ``this was the stream.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a Supreme Court term of surpassing interest,
rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder of the court's power
to scramble settled expectations, put old questions to rest and,
ultimately, to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The justices stood by some precedents and repudiated others.
They invalidated four federal laws, continuing on the path of
subjecting the exercise of congressional authority to close and
skeptical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   During the term that began last Oct. 4 and ended June 28, the
court decided only 73 cases, the fewest of any term since the early
1950s. Although small, the docket ranged over almost the entire
constitutional landscape. The First Amendment alone, with its
provisions governing association, religion and free speech,
injected the justices into state electoral systems, high school
football games and sexually explicit cable television programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the court's most important rulings were
statutory: the invalidation of the Food and Drug Administration's
regulation of tobacco and a decision keeping many medical
malpractice cases against health maintenance organizations out of
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO decision was unanimous, as were more than a third of the
court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual,
with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases
were decided by 5-4 votes, a higher proportion than in most recent
years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and
prevailed in 13 of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The four more-liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted as a
group in the majority in only one 5-4 case, the decision striking
down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by O'Connor.
The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the
case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit
programming on cable television, Thomas, who often displays a
libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Kennedy, who almost
always adopts the free-speech position, were in the majority to
strike down the regulation, while Breyer, often sympathetic to
government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the court this term were O'Connor, who cast
only five dissenting votes; Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Kennedy,
who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the
center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the
court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's
most frequent lone dissenter before President Ronald Reagan chose
him ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for example, on criminal law, Rehnquist's vote is a fair
indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Scalia,
who dissented 15 times this term, and Thomas, who dissented 12
times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision
that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left,
Stevens dissented 28 times and Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from
equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture
this court. ``Which cases were most visible to the public this
year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and
former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration,
asked rhetorically the other day. ``Probably school prayer,
abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,''
Roberts said. ``The conventional wisdom needs to be taken
skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the
justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such
as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the
court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices
have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been
sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee
is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's
own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of
governmental power in general, both among the branches of the
federal government and between Washington and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the
general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful,
too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke
University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck
down state incursions into the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead
``the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal
government, we need it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly
drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take
it next.
</P>
<P>
   One logical path, Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian
direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against
government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment
doctrine against the uncompensated ``taking'' of private property,
for example. But Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as
his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite
succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally
questionable as a ``regulatory taking'' for which landowners must
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about
the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer.
Even a casual look at the term's 5-4 decisions shows what could lie
ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies,
if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing
federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents
if they gained another vote, while at the same time, Thomas and
three other conservative justices _ minus O'Connor _ who came up
one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid
to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that
direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much
prologue as last word.

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion
opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically
appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot
constitutionally be banned. The 5-4 decision, Stenberg vs. Carhart,
No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of
30 other states unconstitutional as well. Breyer wrote the majority
opinion; the dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas and,
surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a
``no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the
free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not
to go through with their abortions. Stevens wrote the opinion in
Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   By the 5-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's
increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal
and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of
one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated
the application of the federal age discrimination law to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a
straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law _ as opposed
to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority _
the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act
case, United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ``the
Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil
damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by
victims of crimes ``motivated by gender.'' The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the same 5-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to
make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority,
O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age
discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the
Constitution and looked only to Congress' intent in ruling that
Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False
Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Scalia wrote the
opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No.
98-1828, with Stevens and Souter dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights
challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that
bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives
and automobile owners. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno vs.
Condon, No. 98-1464.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of
federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one,
Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion
by Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the
former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state
business from companies that do business with that nation's
repressive military regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's
safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its
coast. Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701.
</P>
<P>
   Due Process &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in
their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court
ruled 6-3 that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a
judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's
objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel vs. Granville, No.
99-138, invoked the Constitution's due process protection for
parental child-rearing decisions, but failed to agree on a
definitive approach. O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion that
Rehnquist, Breyer and Ginsburg joined. Souter and Thomas provided
additional votes on the parents' side. Kennedy, Stevens and Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's 7-2 reaffirmation of Miranda vs. Arizona, in an
opinion by Rehnquist, was the leading criminal law case. The court
said in Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525, that because
Miranda ``announced a constitutional rule,'' Congress was not free
to replace the famous Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of
whether a confession was voluntary. The decision invalidated a 1968
law, known as Section 3501, by which Congress had purported to
overrule Miranda. Scalia and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down New Jersey's hate crime law, ruling 5-4
that the Constitution requires the jury to make the central
finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of whether a crime was
motivated by bias. The New Jersey law left this job to the judge.
The decision, Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, cast doubt on
federal and state laws in which judges make the crucial findings
that determine sentences. Stevens wrote the majority opinion; the
dissenters were O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy, along with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other criminal law cases were a mix of
search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law
restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion
opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically
appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot
constitutionally be banned. The 5-4 decision, Stenberg vs. Carhart,
No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of
30 other states unconstitutional as well. Breyer wrote the majority
opinion; the dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas and,
surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a
``no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the
free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not
to go through with their abortions. Stevens wrote the opinion in
Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   By the 5-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's
increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal
and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of
one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated
the application of the federal age discrimination law to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a
straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law _ as opposed
to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority _
the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act
case, United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ``the
Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil
damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by
victims of crimes ``motivated by gender.'' The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the same 5-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to
make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority,
O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age
discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the
Constitution and looked only to Congress' intent in ruling that
Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False
Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Scalia wrote the
opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No.
98-1828, with Stevens and Souter dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights
challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that
bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives
and automobile owners. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno vs.
Condon, No. 98-1464.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of
federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one,
Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion
by Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the
former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state
business from companies that do business with that nation's
repressive military regime.

<P>
   In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's
safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its
coast. Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701.

   In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in
their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court
ruled 6-3 that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a
judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's
objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel vs. Granville, No.

search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law
restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 5-4, that flight at the mere sight of a police
officer can often _ although not always _ be suspicious enough to
justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Rehnquist
wrote for the majority in Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036,
upholding the search of a man who bolted from the sight of police
cars converging on a Chicago street. Stevens dissented, joined by
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defendants prevailed in two other search cases.
Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court that an anonymous tip that a
person is carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk
search in the absence of some indication that the information is
reliable. The case was Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993. And the court
ruled 7-2 that, without some particular suspicion of wrongdoing,
law enforcement agents cannot walk down the aisle of a bus
squeezing passengers' overhead carry-on bags to see if any might
contain contraband. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, in Bond
vs. U.S., No. 98-9349, while Breyer and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, a 1996 law in which Congress limited the rights of state
inmates to challenge their convictions in federal court by means of
petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the court made clear that
federal judges still have an important role to play despite the new
law's limitations. Applying the new law, the court overturned death
sentences in two cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the court was unanimous in ruling that a Virginia
death row inmate, Michael Williams, should not have been penalized
by the state's failure to provide needed evidence. Kennedy wrote
for the court in Williams vs. Taylor, No. 99-6615.
</P>
<P>
   A second ruling under the 1996 law, also confusingly called
Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, was more convoluted, producing
two controlling opinions. First, the court interpreted a provision
barring federal courts from setting aside a state court decision
unless the state ruling was an ``unreasonable'' application of
federal law. The question was the meaning of ``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because a decision was wrong did not make it necessarily
unreasonable, O'Connor wrote in a 5-4 portion of the ruling that
was joined by Rehnquist, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. In dissent,
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer said federal judges should not
have to defer to state court decisions they regarded as incorrect,
even if plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But by a 6-3 vote, in a portion of the opinion by Stevens, the
court then granted relief to the inmate in this case, Terry
Williams, on the ground that he had not received effective
assistance of counsel. Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled that documents produced in
response to a broad subpoena under a grant of immunity cannot be
used as evidence if the prosecutor did not previously know of the
documents' existence. The case, United States vs. Hubbell, No.
99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L.
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion
charges. In an opinion by Stevens, the court ruled that Hubbell's
production of thousands of personal financial records was a
``testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement.
Rehnquist dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Free Speech &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6-3 to
reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign
contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be
valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was
from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of
federal campaign law. Souter wrote the opinion, joined by
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Kennedy, Scalia
and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority,
wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's
entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect
student activity fees even from students who object to particular
activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student
organizations' viewpoints. Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of
Regents vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of
Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-3
vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa.,
that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string.
O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Rehnquist, Kennedy
and Breyer, while Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the
ordinance. Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie
vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court voted 5-4 to strike down a federal
law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours. Kennedy's majority opinion,
U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by
Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Rehnquist, Breyer, Scalia and
O'Connor dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Association &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom
of association, Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which
all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose
candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of
their right to political association, Scalia said for the 7-2
majority in California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401.
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.

   The court ruled 6 to 3 that the practice of organized,

an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Stevens wrote the
majority opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe,
No. 99-62. The dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas.

   At the same time, the court lowered the barriers against public
aid to religious schools, upholding a federal program that places
computers and other equipment in parochial school classrooms. The

splintered over how far to go. Thomas wrote a plurality opinion for

   In an employment discrimination case, the court ruled

Voting 7-2 in Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, the court found the
provision to violate the 15th Amendment, which provides that the
right to vote shall not be denied on account of race. Kennedy wrote

<P>
   In an important voting rights case, the court ruled by a 5-4
vote that the Justice Department must approve districting changes _
even those adopted with a discriminatory purpose _ as long as the
changes leave minority voters no worse off than before. Prevention
of backsliding is the only test for Justice Department
``pre-clearance'' under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the court
said in Reno vs. Bossier Parish, No. 98-405. Scalia wrote the

   The court ruled 5-4 that the Food and Drug Administration never
received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products. The
court's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
was a blow to the Clinton administration's anti-smoking policy; the
invalidated rules restricted the marketing of cigarettes to
children and teen-agers. O'Connor wrote the court's opinion in FDA
vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, joined by Rehnquist, Scalia,
Kennedy and Thomas. Breyer dissented, joined by Stevens, Souter and
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that governs employee health
benefits, the court ruled unanimously that the financial incentives
that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down
costs do not amount to a violation of the federal duty to put
patients' interests first. The decision, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No.
98-1949, handed the patients' rights debate back to Congress.
Souter wrote the opinion.

<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld a provision of a recent federal
law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, that restricts the authority
of federal judges to keep in place court orders governing the
operation of state and local prison systems. O'Connor wrote the

   In an important environmental case, the court upheld the ability

himself, Rehnquist, Scalia and Kennedy, with a narrower concurring
opinion by O'Connor and Breyer declined to go so far.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an employment discrimination case, the court ruled
unanimously that even in the absence of smoking-gun evidence of
discrimination, a plaintiff can prevail by showing that an
employer's innocent-sounding explanation for its action was a lie.
O'Connor wrote the opinion in Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing
Products, No. 99-536.
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned a provision of Hawaii's constitution under
which only descendants of the native Hawaiians can vote in
elections for trustees of the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
Voting 7-2 in Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, the court found the
provision to violate the 15th Amendment, which provides that the
right to vote shall not be denied on account of race. Kennedy wrote
the majority opinion. Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important voting rights case, the court ruled by a 5-4
vote that the Justice Department must approve districting changes _
even those adopted with a discriminatory purpose _ as long as the
changes leave minority voters no worse off than before. Prevention
of backsliding is the only test for Justice Department
``pre-clearance'' under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the court
said in Reno vs. Bossier Parish, No. 98-405. Scalia wrote the
majority opinion, joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Kennedy and
Thomas. Souter wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Stevens,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Law and Regulation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 5-4 that the Food and Drug Administration never
received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products. The
court's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
was a blow to the Clinton administration's anti-smoking policy; the
invalidated rules restricted the marketing of cigarettes to
children and teen-agers. O'Connor wrote the court's opinion in FDA
vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, joined by Rehnquist, Scalia,
Kennedy and Thomas. Breyer dissented, joined by Stevens, Souter and
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that governs employee health
benefits, the court ruled unanimously that the financial incentives
that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down
costs do not amount to a violation of the federal duty to put
patients' interests first. The decision, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No.
98-1949, handed the patients' rights debate back to Congress.
Souter wrote the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld a provision of a recent federal
law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, that restricts the authority
of federal judges to keep in place court orders governing the
operation of state and local prison systems. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion in Miller vs. French, No. 99-224, joined by
Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. Souter, Stevens, Breyer and
Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important environmental case, the court upheld the ability
of private plaintiffs to invoke so-called citizen suit provisions
of federal environmental law and bring lawsuits to stop pollution.
Ginsburg wrote the 7-2 opinion in Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw,
No. 98-822. Scalia and Thomas dissented.

<P>
   BEIJING _ ``A huge superpower and you say you're afraid of tiny
little North Korea?'' snorted Sha Zukang, China's chief
arms-control negotiator, in a recent interview. ``We think that's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's hard to find any foreign-policy expert here, in
or out of government, who believes the stated U.S. rationale for a
continental anti-missile defense: that it's merely intended to stop
the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will decide in coming weeks, after
a crucial test scheduled for July 7, whether to start building
radars and 100 missile interceptors in Alaska, the first phase of a
grander project.
</P>
<P>
   Even westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for
missile defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction, in
the U.S. military and a strong faction of the political elite, that
the United States must better prepare for battle with China.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Washington has a growing coterie of politicians,
ex-officials and experts who warn of an emerging ``China threat,''
China has an even broader group of officials and scholars who think
the United States is trying to hem their country in. They portray
the United States as a power-drunk bully, determined to preserve
its post-Cold War status as the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders almost certainly share suspicions about the
``American threat,'' but they also know that their ability to shape
events will remain limited until China becomes far richer and more
technologically advanced. So for now they are putting more emphasis
on revamping the economy than on pursuing a costly arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is the obvious flashpoint, the place where U.S. promises
and China's core goals most obviously could collide. But many
experts here see U.S. support for Taiwan as part of a broader,
unstated program of containment.
</P>
<P>
   ``China faces an elementary reality: the United States is
steadily encroaching on China, and China's means for counterattack
and room for maneuver under American pressure have shrunk,'' wrote
Wang Weiguang, an international relations expert at Beijing
University, in an essay in the current issue of Strategy and
Management, a mainstream policy journal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Washington's guarantees to Taiwan, these experts point
accusingly at recent U.S.-Japanese defense guidelines that seem
designed to draw Japan into any Pacific war; at U.S. military ties
elsewhere in Asia; at U.S. use of human rights and trade disputes
to keep China on the defensive; and now, at the seeming rush toward
missile defenses that would neutralize China's nuclear forces and
could be extended over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, as the missile defense proposal gained
popularity, Washington's attention was largely on Russian
objections and the need to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Only belatedly have officials seriously considered the
depth of China's objections and the possible truth of its warnings
that a dangerous arms race could be set off.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington ignores Beijing's protests, some scholars here
privately say, the always shaky support for friendly relations with
the United States will be eroded. For from here, American
assurances that the system is not intended to counter China simply
will not wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has used North Korea as an excuse to build
missile defenses, but now the two Koreas have improved their
relations and the risk of war has dramatically declined,'' said Yan
Xuetong, a scholar at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary
International Relations, which has close ties to the government.
``If the United States continues to develop a missile defense
anyway, it's difficult for us to believe that it's not aimed at
China.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the proposed missile defenses would
be useful against only one country and that is China, said Shen
Dingli, an expert in arms control and American studies at Fudan
University in Shanghai. Russia's missile forces will remain large
enough to overwhelm the system, he noted, and, realistically, no
other potential enemy will have effective intercontinental missiles
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners say that for reliable defense, three
interceptors should be launched toward every incoming missile. So
the 100-interceptor plan seems tailor-made to cancel out China's
small force of long-range missiles, estimated by Western
intelligence agencies at no more than 18 or 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the United States says the system is not aimed at
China, the capability is aimed at China,'' Shen said.
</P>
<P>
   China is already developing more accurate and powerful
intercontinental missiles and officials here say they will do what
is necessary to protect China's nuclear credibility. They would
probably multiply the number of new missiles they build or put
multiple warheads on new missiles, as well as deploy decoys to
outwit the American defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their suspicions about American goals, President Jiang
Zemin and other Communist Party leaders continue to stress their
desire for cooperation, and they are taking the politically risky
path of further opening their economy to global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Like American counterparts who advocate building ties between
the two nations, China's leaders may hope that frictions can be
contained and overwhelmed by the two nations' shared interests in
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also know how much their power over
international affairs remains constrained by China's relative
backwardness, economic and military. And they seem to believe that
``economic power is the most important and most essential factor in
comprehensive national power,'' as the latest Pentagon assessment
of China's military described the Chinese credo.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the Kosovo war, which the Chinese saw as a
terrible sign that the United States can take drastic measures
while ignoring China, there was serious debate in Beijing about
whether to accelerate the growth in military spending, which
remains far below U.S. levels. But at a key leadership meeting last
summer, the senior leaders reaffirmed their priority emphasis on
economic and technological development, according to the Pentagon
report.
</P>
<P>
   China does seek great power status and especially to become the
preeminent Asian power, strong enough, in the words of the Pentagon
analysis, ``so that no major action will be taken by any other
international actor in Asia without first considering Chinese
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Through sheer size and assertiveness, if not yet weaponry, China
may be almost there. But America's apparent readiness to pursue a
missile shield despite the evident harm to China's security would
be, for many people here, one more stinging reminder of why they
must make China stronger.

Service for AMs of Sunday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ The past hangs heavy over
Mexico's people and politics, but rarely has a moment seemed so
pregnant with history as the presidential balloting scheduled for
Sunday. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-BORDER (Border Post 34, Lebanon) _ The quick deployment
of U. N. peacekeepers and Lebanese forces into the stretch of
southern Lebanon that Israel abandoned in May after 22 years of
occupation has been thrown into doubt with the controversy over a
series of apparent Israeli incursions across a borderline drawn in
1923. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-PASTRANA (Bogota, Colombia) _ He has just received a
vote of confidence from the United States in the form of $1.3
billion in emergency military aid. But as President Andres Pastrana
nears the midpoint of his term, his standing is sinking. By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-PEOPLE-TRAFFIC (Dover, England) _ This was once a quiet
port town famous above all for its white cliffs. It is now
notorious for the corpses of 58 Chinese immigrants that lie,
unclaimed and unnamed, in refrigerators normally used for meat
shipments _ and for the likes of Tara Muhammad roaming its streets.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PARTY-STRUGGLE (Shenyang, China) _ For more than 40 years,
Zhou Wei found success as a Communist Party cadre. Colleagues and
family say he was a brilliant, if prickly, man who still loves the
party. But today he is in a labor camp, accused of organizing
illegal assemblies and inciting unrest in this depressed industrial
city. Now, a campaign to gain Zhou's release has brought into
public view an extraordinary five-year struggle between the local
party and some of its most senior retired officials _ a bizarre
conflict in which the police tail old men who are heros of the 1949
revolution that brought the party to power. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-FUTURE (Seoul, South Korea) _ While the friendship and
reconciliation that emerged from the Korean summit meeting two
weeks ago was surprising, and sudden, officials in South Korea
insist that actual unification is years, if not decades, away and
can be achieved only gradually. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-JEWS (Shiraz, Iran) _ A judge convicted 10 of 13 Jewish men
accused by the Revolutionary Court of being spies, asserting that
their years of religious piety were a cover for espionage and
illegal aid to Iran's enemy, Israel. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-SPORTS (Baton Rouge, La.) _ In July 1996, Southern
University, a powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a
quarterback, and a white player, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a
place to play quarterback. Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson,
recruited Jacoby. The decision made headlines. So began an odyssey
of triumph and defeat on and off the football field. By Ira Berkow.
</P>
<P>
   With photos.
</P>
<P>
   DYING-TOWNS (Mountain, N.D.) _ Like towns of the West that
turned to shells once they were stripped of their gold, new ghost
towns are sprouting over much of the Great Plains. By Peter T.
Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   SC-FLAG (Columbia, S.C.) _ As its reign atop the South Carolina
statehouse finally drew to an end, the Confederate battle flag had
become almost as much a curiosity as an object of division, a
symbol of the state's exhausted recent history even more than of
its distant past. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   VERMONT-GAYS (South Burlington, Vt.) _ From Burlington to
Brattleboro, with hoopla or careful privacy, a scattering of gay
couples across Vermont became the first in the country Saturday to
legally take on all the rights and responsibilities of marriage, in
the first state to let them. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-EXPERIMENT (Youngstown, Ohio) _ Nine convicts were free
to exchange hugs with their children, some of them hesitantly at
first, and to play and advise and gaze upon them for four hours
each morning last week. Sharing thoughts and meals, they tested a
program, as merciful as it is experimental, to let 11 children and
their imprisoned fathers directly repair family ties. By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   PRESBYTERIANS-GAY-UNIONS (Long Beach, Calif.) _ After an
emotional debate over one of the most contentious issues embroiling
some Protestant denominations, the top policy-making body of the
Presbyterian Church (USA) has approved an amendment to the church's
constitution forbidding ministers from conducting same-sex unions.
By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) _ One breezes past the tough stuff
in an effort to remain forever buoyant, and can come across as
lighter than air. The other fairly bludgeons listeners with all
that he knows, and can come across as aloof. Their campaign
schedules and appearances last week perfectly captured these
contrasting styles, which also happen to tap into their strengths
and especially their weaknesses as candidates, what they must take
advantage of and what they must overcome. By Frank Bruni and
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS-POLITICS (Philadelphia) _ When the
Republicans gather here this month for their national convention,
to some it might be hard to tell the difference: Is this a
political convention or a telecommunications trade show? While the
main event at the convention here _ and the Democratic convention
to be held in August in Los Angeles _ is, of course, nominating a
presidential candidate, a big corporate sideshow is being planned
as well. And in that effort, no single industry is better
represented than telecommunications companies. By Leslie Wayne.

   Duncan and Hill on a Recruiting Visit to Magic's Kingdom
</P>
<P>
   Disney World is not closing down for a private party this
weekend. And 20,000 people will not line the airport terminal to
cheer the superstars' arrivals. But everything else about Tim
Duncan's and Grant Hill's trips to Orlando, Fla., runs toward the
extravagant and lavish.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent negotiating period began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday,
and it was highlighted by an all-expenses-paid trip to the Magic
Kingdom by the well-funded and desperate Orlando Magic franchise
still seeking replacements for Shaq and Penny.
</P>
<P>
   For at least three days Duncan and Hill are essentially on a
luxurious recruiting visit that they could have never imagined at
Wake Forest or Duke, respectively. There will be jumbo-shrimp
receptions, seven-course meals and most likely golf with Magic
Coach Doc Rivers. They will no doubt tour the exclusive Islenorth
residential community where Tiger Woods, Ken Griffey Jr. and
Shaquille O'Neal own palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's race to dump salaries last week gave the club more
than $20 million to spend on the game's top free agents. Orlando
could now afford to pay two maximum-level contracts and add another
decent free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Hill do not seem to be players who respond to glitz
and gaudiness. Duncan is said to be leaning toward re-signing with
the San Antonio Spurs. If Hill does not leave the Detroit Pistons,
he could join Duncan at least on paper, signing for the exception
and waiting for the Spurs to clear salary-cap room the following
season so they could sign him to a maximum contract.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know. To entice Horace Grant to leave the Chicago
Bulls in the mid-1990s, the Magic used Disney World to shoot
fireworks with Grant's name into the Orlando sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic staff wore Grant-like goggles in the office, and
O'Neal chauffeured Grant around town. There is talk the Magic may
go as far as Duncan's hometown, St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands,
to court the All-Star center.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams are peeved about the visits, charging Orlando with
violating the no-contact rule before Saturday. Jerry Krause, the
Bulls' general manager, wondered last week, ``How did they arrange
the trip?''
</P>
<P>
   One Eastern Conference coach, requesting anonymity, said,
``We're all hoping it's unseasonably hot, humid and muggy down
there, with a few thunderstorms spliced in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady, Eddie Jones and Tim Thomas are most likely hoping
for the same. If Hill and Duncan commit to the Magic on Aug. 1 _
the day teams can actually sign contracts with free agents, as if
they have not got the deal in place already _ the leverage of some
of the other top free agents disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has $19 million to sign free agents, but Krause appears
to be more realistic about his chances of landing the biggest
free-agent fish. Quite possibly, Orlando may have to resort to a
backup plan that involves acquiring McGrady, perhaps Thomas and
pulling off a deal for Portland's Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the possibilities over the next month:
</P>
<P>
   TRACY McGRADY _ He wants to go to Orlando more than anyone else,
but the Bulls may be the favorite if the Raptors cannot pull off a
sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   TIM THOMAS _ Milwaukee wants to keep him, but if the Bulls and
Magic cannot pry Duncan or Hill loose, his asking price may be too
much for the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   EDDIE JONES _ He has his heart set on Miami, but base-year
contract status prevents the Hornets from receiving equal value.
Unless he is traded, Charlotte may be where he stays.
</P>
<P>
   TONI KUKOC _ The 76ers barely got to see what he could do after
trading for him at midseason, so rather than take a gamble on an
aging Glen Rice in a trade with the Lakers, they may decide to
start running the offense through him more and open up the passing
lanes.
</P>
<P>
   GLEN RICE _ His star has fallen, to the point that he simply
cannot secure the maximum deal. But a desperate free agent is a
dangerous one, and it would not be a complete shock if he remained
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   RASHARD LEWIS _ Seattle wants to keep him, but the Bulls' Krause
may overpay him if other options fail. Maybe the most unheralded
free agent, Lewis could turn out to be an All-Star in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN GRANT _ The Lakers are not going to get him. He will
probably secure more money from his own team after opting out of a
$41 million deal. If not, don't rule the Knicks out in some kind of
creative sign-and-trade deal. That is, if the Blazers president Bob
Whitsitt will still deal with New York after the Chris Dudley
contract fiasco three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   MAURICE TAYLOR _ The Knicks made a play for him at the All-Star
Game break, but he will most likely end up with a needier team like
the Bulls or the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   JOE SMITH _ The Timberwolves want him back, and he does not have
a lot of leverage to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   KURT THOMAS _ Nice role player who could be a lot of teams'
backup free agent if the Knicks do not re-sign him for what he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   JALEN ROSE The Pistons are praying, but Rose got off his
need-to-play-point-guard kick during the playoffs. He likes where
he is.
</P>
<P>
   REGGIE MILLER and MARK JACKSON _ Like Stockton and Malone, they
believe they have one more run left.
</P>
<P>
   TIM HARDAWAY _ Health reasons aside, how can Pat Riley lose one
of the game's premier clutch players? He can't.
</P>
<P>
   DEREK ANDERSON and RON MERCER _ Both players do not have the
pedigree of the others, but they will probably wind up being moved
in sign-and-trade deals at bargain rates.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN STARKS _ Yes, he would still like to come back to New York
if the Knicks will find it in their hearts to reacquire him (a slim
possibility, one team official said). And, yes, he will also take a
paycheck from Riley, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to keep my options open at this point,'' Starks said
by cell phone Friday as he was watching his 13-year-old son play at
a Memphis basketball camp. ``This probably being my last contract
and all, I can't limit the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks said he recently spoke with Patrick Ewing but did not get
any indication of what Ewing would do.
</P>
<P>
   With a year remaining on his deal, Ewing is expected to ask the
Knicks for an extension or request his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for him,'' Starks said, ``coming back from the
injury and playing as well as he did at times, and then to have to
deal with all the negativity. But that's New York. He knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Value of Williams
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams' retirement because of a career-ending leg
injury had been rumored for months. When it happened last week, so
many other stories encircled the Nets that it basically put
Williams on the back shelf. With the draft, the hiring of Byron
Scott and other league business, the NBA hardly blinked an eye.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, because the league lost one of the best blueprints
for its young players.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the self-proclaimed ``knucklehead'' who turned his
career around and became an All-Star. If you throw out the
entertainment factor _ Williams was as funny as Charles Barkley and
not as mean-spirited _ you essentially have a person who gave up
the surreal party life of the league in his late 20s and started to
understand the importance of winning and playing together.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman was hailed as the greatest rebounder of the last
decade, but Williams hunted down loose balls with the same or more
urgency and desire. Yes, he chipped a lot of paint off the rim with
his jump shot and was a bit undersized to stop the game's elite
centers. But he never stopped working and going hard at his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable beyond many of his peers, Williams was also one of
the best people in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping he gets an analyst's job soon, so he can finally
get paid for making fun of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A Pacers' Timeout
</P>
<P>
   It is supposed to be a fait accompli, Isiah Thomas taking over
the Indiana Pacers' coaching duties. But the team's president,
Donnie Walsh, is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the news media leaks and campaigning going on between
Thomas and Rick Carlisle, a Pacers assistant, Walsh was taking the
weekend to re-evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to step away from this for a day or two,'' Walsh said.
``I want to see if these are the right two guys. I'm not going to
say I'm not going to hire one of them. I'm just saying it's time to
step away.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has not interviewed anyone else. But if Thomas is not
named soon _ he is still in negotiations to sell the Continental
Basketball Association to the players union _ it will not be
surprising if the Pacers turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond obvious candidates like Mike Fratello, Del Harris could
find himself in the mix. Harris, who grew up in Indiana,
interviewed with Walsh before he took over the Lakers job. The two
have a good relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh would not comment on other coaching candidates, but down
deep he is starting to wonder: if this is how they perform going
after a job, how will they perform when the first team crisis hits
the Pacers?

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Carmen Salinas, a popular television talk show
host, was warming up a huge crowd for the party in power before a
speech by its presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida. She did
not emphasize his views or personality. ``Labastida is the man, the
good one, the winner,'' she said. It was all the crowd needed to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   In most democracies, parties nominate candidates they hope will
win by persuading citizens to vote for them. But this is Mexico.
And the party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
the PRI, which has governed Mexico since its founding in 1929. In
that party, things work differently.
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when the PRI held a virtual political
monopoly, its insiders picked the candidate they knew would win and
then instructed citizens to vote for him. Today, the monopoly is
cracking. But even so, PRI voters still expect to be told who is
the likely winner. Their party is still driven by patronage, and
they want to be on the right side of whoever will dole it out. And
so the all-important thing is to know who is ``el bueno,'' the good
one, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a facet of a political culture that sets the PRI apart
from parties born of pluralistic democracy. And that is the
all-important issue at stake Sunday as Mexicans vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the PRI is going into a presidential
election in which there is a real possibility that it could lose.
It promises to be the most fair and open election the country has
ever had. Polls show Labastida running even with a moderate
conservative, Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party or PAN (a
leftist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates call themselves democrats, but Mexicans
are nevertheless making a fundamental choice about the nature of
their democracy. They are choosing between two sharply different
interpretations of it _ a PRI version that says only one party is
needed, and the challengers' version, which says competition
between parties is the very essence of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, not only candidates but also profound
questions in front of these voters: What makes a country a
democracy? Is it enough to have an election, or does it require
real competition between parties? Suppose the party always in power
is popular because it keeps the society on an even keel and doles
out lots of favors. Isn't that democracy? If so, what about policy?
Can it come only from the leaders, or must it bubble up from the
voters? Months ago, the PRI government promised, and seems to have
delivered, reforms that produced a real election contest. Still,
what the PRI is offering is a continuation of top-down control _
and of public acceptance that it will do whatever it can get away
with to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, by contrast, has staged a grass-roots campaign
for citizens' rights and for a balance of powers between the
president and Mexico's legislature. In short, it is democratic in
the way that most U.S. voters understand the term. The PRI is not.
Still, many Mexicans think of the PRI as a party that truly
represents them.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans recognize that the central dispute in the presidential
race is over ``la alternancia'' _ the idea that parties must
alternate in power if democracy is to be achieved. PRI leaders
argue that they can reform their party from within and make it
democratic. ``As long as we have the option of alternating power,
we have democracy,'' said Sandra Fuentes Berain, a top official in
the Labastida campaign. ``Alternating power is not a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox and Cardenas represent those who believe that their
country will not become a democracy until the PRI is removed.
Denise Dresser, a political analyst, puts it this way: ``Mexicans
have truly never had the chance to throw the bums out. Tasting that
experience would be extraordinarily empowering. It would inject a
whole new fresh air into the process.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders make no bones about the authoritarian nature and
genius of their party. ``In this election, you are going to see the
machinery of the PRI, like few parties in the world have,'' said
Emilio Gamboa, one of Labastida's top campaign managers. ``I'll bet
not even the party in China has a machine like the one we have
built up over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, in fact, was created by Mexican strongmen determined to
impose order on the chaos of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. To this
day, Gamboa said, its early work to spread national unity, services
like clinics and schools, and political largesse throughout the
land have cemented its followers' loyalty. ``Our party kept the
social peace,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   Many PRI supporters who turned out to cheer Labastida knew
little about him, other than that he was their man. But his rallies
turned into dense crushes as followers pressed to shake his hand
or, with luck, have a picture taken with him that they could
display in transactions with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of change, PRI voters have been forgiving of its corruption
scandals and long-term economic policies that have failed to lift
the poor. ``I'd rather have an old devil I know than a new devil I
don't,'' said Cristina Luna Flores,42, a rural homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party, the PAN, has deeply conservative Catholic and
business-oriented roots. But its rightist ideas have been tempered
as it evolved into a a resistance movement against the PRI,
battling to defend electoral victories against PRI fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, to be sure, evokes another anti-democratic figure in
Mexican politics, the caudillo or strongman. He is a strong-willed,
hard-driving and charismatic candidate who overwhelmed and
sometimes even ignored his party. But he forced the PAN to
modernize its platform and endowed it with a new organization for
getting votes. In doing so, he mobilized millions who are not PAN
militants but want something new. They range from young people to
the wealthy elite and even the military. ``We need change,'' said
Fernando Antonio Reyes, 49, an active duty army lieutenant in a Fox
crowd. ``The PRI has taken away all our buying power. We can't take
its corruption anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, the closeness of the race means Mexico will face
new conflicts. even if Labastida wins, the struggle to topple the
PRI has accelerated. If Fox wins, his own style and the need to
share power with PRI holdovers in the Congress may sorely test the
assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So even as it evolves, Mexico is likely to remain a strange
hybrid _ an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an
authoritarian force at its very heart.

PRI has accelerated. If Fox wins, his own style and the need to
share power with PRI holdovers in the Congress may sorely test the
assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So even as it evolves, Mexico is likely to remain a strange
hybrid _ an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an
authoritarian force at its very heart.

   LONDON _ In its understated way, Britain is the Ed Koch of
nations, endlessly wondering ``How'm I doing?'' But unlike the
self-congratulating former mayor of New York, Britain rarely
expects a positive answer. And lately, a nation that is always
sensitive about perceived slights to its international status has
found more than usual to be upset about.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did CBS News recently report that some crime in England
is far worse than in the United States, but England's soccer team
ignominiously lost to Romania (Romania!) in the Euro 2000
tournament. Then, the country's No. 2 tennis player, Greg Rusedski,
was blown out of Wimbledon on opening day by Vincent Spadea, an
American known to British newspapers as ``the world's biggest
loser'' because he had lost 22 of his last 22 matches.
</P>
<P>
   And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the American
Revolution that presents the English as effete war criminals with
snobby accents who herd families of fledgling Americans into barns
and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons sick of being pushed
around, this obnoxious affront to retrospective pride may be the
last straw.
</P>
<P>
   The film hasn't even opened in Britain yet, but the newspapers
have been full of outrage at what they see as wanton disregard for
the historical record. Maybe the war was dirty and violent at
times, they say, but their soldiers certainly never shot children
or minced around in the creepy manner of Nazi generals. And it's no
accident that Mel Gibson stars in the film, they say _ he's
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every Hollywood casting agent knows, the devil speaks with
an English accent,'' Neil Norman wrote in The Evening Standard,
deploring how ``to a man, the dastardly English are presented as
heartless toffs and Machiavels, war criminals and child-killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do the British persist in casting everything in terms of
national pride? Shouldn't they just lighten up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a significant pride in what we achieved in the past
with regard to the British empire, and we don't like to see it
unfairly traduced,'' explained the British historian Andrew
Roberts. This puffed-up feeling about the past, he said, is
inextricably linked to a sadly deflated view of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to be proud of?'' he asked, musing crossly about
the European Union. ``What are we doing now? We're getting sucked
into some amorphous European superstate, largely against our will.
As a nation we haven't achieved much since 1945, and the things
that we are rightly proud of are being taken away from us by the
distortions of a foreign entertainment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot,'' of course, is just one in a recent series of
Hollywood slights perpetrated on the British _ and more
specifically, the English. There were the Englishmen in
``Titanic,'' who battened down the hatches to prevent the declasse,
mostly Irish, lower-deck passengers from escaping. Then there was
Anthony Hopkins, the repellant hissing villain in ``The Silence of
the Lambs.'' And don't forget Gibson's ``Braveheart,'' in which the
English are shown raping, slaughtering and pillaging their way
through 13th-century Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, Britons don't figure in ``U-571,'' a recent
film starring Matthew McConaughey as the leader of a band of
Americans on a submarine who capture the German Enigma code-making
machine in World War II. In real life, the Americans didn't capture
the code _ the British did.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Before the communists, when the Nazis
were still the worst villains, World War II movies regularly showed
the British and Americans working together to repel the heinous
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until quite recently, films made in America were on the
whole quite admiring of the British and British history,'' said
Jeffrey Richards, a professor of cultural history at the University
of Lancaster. Since then, he said, the British film market has
virtually disappeared, and Hollywood no longer cares whether it
alienates British viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The British are feeling alienated a lot these days. But no
matter what other people say about them, it's not as bad as what
they say about themselves _ particularly when they lose at sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this absurd obsession with sport,'' Roberts said.
``Even though, since 1967, we've been beaten at all the sports we
invented, after 30 years we still get into great emotional upsets.
The things we should be looking at seriously are things like
Britain's great economy, but instead we get into a huge tussle
about whether Greg Rusedski has a good day at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   When the unfortunate Rusedski lost to Spadea, the hapless
American who had been touring the world losing one match after
another for eight months, The Times of London just couldn't control
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are on a 22 match, world-record losing streak,'' it
wrote, ``there is only one person capable of ending your misery: a
British sports star.''

   Last week, Playboy magazine published nude photographs of Darva
Conger, the 34-year-old emergency room nurse who agreed in February
to wed the self-described real estate baron Rick Rockwell on Fox
TV's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' Their brief
matrimonial union was subsequently annulled, unconsummated.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her television appearance, Conger assured the
public that she did not intend to exploit her sudden celebrity by
accepting the many offers that had come her way _ including posing
nude on a Web site _ but she seems to have changed her tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had any problem with Playboy,'' she explains in an
article that accompanies a 10-page romp along an undisclosed beach
in the August issue. ``It's amazing how comfortable I felt, maybe
because everything was so professional and it was a natural
environment. . . . I'm not a voluptuous bedroom bunny, I'm an
outdoor person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures are beautiful and pure and natural. They're nude,
but they still have a feeling of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Katarina Witt, Olympic ice skater, defending her appearance in
Playboy, December 1998
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sensuality in art, and I wanted to use nudity to
create an art of sensuality. . . . This entire experience has been
a renaissance for me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Farrah Fawcett, actress, defending her appearance in Playboy,
July 1997
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my legacy. I wanted to look pretty _ for the men in my
life and for me. I was nervous, of course. . . . but I walked up to
((Playboy photographer)) Steve Wayda and pulled up my shirt:
Ta-daa!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joey Heatherton, entertainer, defending her appearance in
Playboy, April 1997
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually part of my reawakening. From my Mediterranean
background, I'm very European in my thinking, and Europeans aren't
judgmental. To them, nudity is considered natural. I strongly
believe the human body should be celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Faye Resnick, figure in the O.J. Simpson murder trial,
defending her appearance in Playboy, March 1997
</P>
<P>
   ``There was another girl shooting the day I was at the Playboy
photo studio, and she was perfect. But . . . I didn't hate her, I
didn't feel jealous. . . . We bring different things to the
pictures. She brings beautiful breasts, and I bring OK breasts and
lots of personality.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Sinatra, singer, defending her appearance in Playboy,
May 1995
</P>
<P>
   ``This pictorial has totally changed me. . . . Playboy stripped
me down to find the real Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Downtown'' Julie Brown, former MTV celebrity, defending her
appearance in Playboy, August 1998
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shy. In fact, I was kind of a prude. I finally realized
I had nothing to be ashamed of. I thought, why feel guilt about my
sexuality? I'd been a child-woman all my life. It was time to be a
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dian Parkinson, ``The Price Is Right'' TV model, defending her
appearance in Playboy, December 1991
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of the work I've put into my body. I'm 41.
When I was 21, I didn't look like this. . . . Besides, my parents
are never going to approve of what I do, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, defending
her appearance in Playboy, July 1994
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are going to say, `Why did you pose for
Playboy?' Well, the answer is, I think the body is a beautiful
thing. I know I was not supposed to have an affair with a married
man, but I'm human, too. I'm a Christian. I go to church on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tai Collins, the former Miss Virginia who claimed to have been
involved with Sen. Charles S. Robb, defending her appearance in
Playboy, October 1991
</P>
<P>
   ``These pictures are a celebration of a new life for me. A new
beginning. For the first time in my life, someone took the time to
ask, `Jessica, what do  &UR; you &LR;  want?' No one had ever done that
before, certainly not the church. Playboy did.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual
encounter with the televangelist Jim Bakker led to the demise of
his ministry, defending her appearance in Playboy, November 1987
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the most fun when I posed with a 60-pound Burmese
python. I love snakes and wanted to do a shot all covered with
them. I was disappointed that there was only one; I'd envisioned
six or seven.''
</P>

March 1989

 Adam Liptak is a senior counsel in the legal department of The New

<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' said Vice President
Al Gore as he released the transcript of a contentious sworn
interview with a Justice Department official over fund-raising in
the 1996 election. Ordinary folks trying to untangle the 123-page
document may wonder how Gore really treats his friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Gore's answers were very different from
those in any questioning of a smart, well-prepared witness
disinclined to help his adversary. They were, however, very
different from human conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about legal proceedings and particularly those
pretrial sworn interviews known as depositions that turn
sophisticated people into quibblers, dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why
can't they just respond to the questions posed as people respond in
everyday conversations?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor
under oath, questions that had House Republicans putting pressure
on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel. The
independent counsel Robert Ray recently concluded that the
testimony of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the dismissal of
several White House travel office employees in 1993 was at least
truthful enough that Ray did not think he could prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that she had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was, in fact, tolerably forthcoming as far as depositions
go. At times, he was precise, even a little funny. He knew that on
the day of the interview he had been vice president for ``seven
years and two months and 28 days.'' He recounted his delight on
learning in the spring of 1996 that his schedule would include a
luncheon at a Buddhist temple in California. ``This ought to be
interesting,'' he said he remembered thinking. ``Little did I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of an impressive series of documents that
suggested the contrary, he stoutly resisted his interlocutors'
efforts to make him concede that fund raising was going on at
either White House ``coffees'' (of which he attended either one,
according to Gore, or some 30, according to other reports) or the
luncheon at the Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer for all the parsing is that depositions are
preparation tools meant to prevent surprises at trial. They are
very rarely considered in their entirety or even used at trial.
Lawyers sometimes use them to contradict witnesses who change their
stories on the stand; occasionally the transcripts are read to the
jury when witnesses are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of videotaped depositions, and their use in and
out of the courtroom, a lawyer's standard advice to witnesses _ to
say as little as possible _ may no longer be wise, particularly
when those witnesses are public figures. The evasive responses of
Microsoft's Bill Gates helped undermine his corporation's case.
President Clinton, on the other hand, is thought to have helped
himself with his garrulous and expansive grand jury testimony,
whatever its truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer prepares a witness by stating that the enterprise
embarked upon is an exercise in playing defense, and that the
questioner is the enemy. The object is not to give up any ground.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, the lawyer continues, must become a user-unfriendly
computer, producing a truthful answer but not a particularly
expansive one. The witness is not obligated to reformulate the
questions or respond to what the questioner is plainly, if
clumsily, driving at.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also reminds witnesses that their names on a document
_ as addressees or perhaps even as authors _ are no proof that they
have ever seen it, much less that what it says is true. The lawyer
will note the value of stock answers like ``I don't know'' or ``I
don't remember.'' It may also be suggested that perjury
prosecutions are rare and that the crime is a long coast dotted
with countless safe harbors. Perjury requires a statement that is
known to be false when said, actually false rather than merely
misleading, and material to the case.
</P>
<P>
   One Supreme Court case demonstrates just how hard perjury is to
prove. A witness was asked, ``Do you have any bank accounts in
Swiss banks?'' He said no, truthfully. ``Have you ever?'' The
witness, who once had a personal account there, replied: ``The
company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.''
Because the last answer was literally true, although certainly
misleading, the defendant's conviction was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary conversation is a very different beast. A chat with a
friend over a beer is filled with answers to the question you meant
to or should have asked, with corrections of mistaken premises,
with volunteered information, with little anticipations and
courtesies and clarifications.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, everyday life is full of misunderstandings. It is no
easy task to communicate even where both sides are trying their
best. Now factor in the adversary system, and the chances of
learning anything the witness chooses not to convey diminish
radically.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that life outside of litigation is an
Eden of truth-telling. Gore was questioned mercilessly about a
seemingly harmless courtesy letter to a supporter after a visit to
Taiwan. He was made to assess his own truthfulness, sentence by
sentence. ``No, I was actually glad I was not with them on the rest
of the voyage,'' he testified. And, he continued, ``the statement
that the `meetings with the government and business leaders were
fascinating' appears to be an overstatement, as does the
description of the visit to the Fo Kuang Shan facility as being
`almost overwhelming.''' So too ``the statement that it was `the
most enjoyable trip I have ever taken.''' The entire thing was a
tissue of lies or, as Gore put it, ``within the customary bounds of
this sort of communication.''

<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' said Vice President
Al Gore as he released the transcript of a contentious sworn
interview with a Justice Department official over fund-raising in
the 1996 election. Ordinary folks trying to untangle the 123-page
document may wonder how Gore really treats his friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Gore's answers were very different from
those in any questioning of a smart, well-prepared witness
disinclined to help his adversary. They were, however, very
different from human conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about legal proceedings and particularly those
pretrial sworn interviews known as depositions that turn
sophisticated people into quibblers, dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why
can't they just respond to the questions posed as people respond in
everyday conversations?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor

THE FOUR-LETTER ALPHABET THAT SPELLS LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are uncaring devices that run on electrons and the
cold numbers in their programming. They are hard, boxy things and
essentially hateful. People are soft, warm, fuzzy, logic-averse
creatures who like to cuddle and are mostly rounder than they want
to be. Surely nothing connects two such far distant realms.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, something does, something that last week was pried out
from the obscurity where for 4 billion years it has been gradually
evolving its present shape.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely as any shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human
genome is a program, a set of precisely coded instructions that
evolution has written for the design, operation and unfortunately
rather limited maintenance of a person. That people should be
operated by such a specific script is as amazing as it would be to
find that robots have souls.
</P>
<P>
   The genome's programming language has only four letters,
designated A, G, C and T after the chemical units of DNA, but these
suffice to express the instructions for building the most complex
known object in the universe. The human brain is thought to possess
about 100 billion nerve cells wired together with 100 trillion
interconnections. The connections are so cunningly engineered that
some scientists suspect there is not a single miswiring in the
entire system.
</P>
<P>
   How do you go from four letters to the complexity of the brain?
That's pretty easy. You just build one layer of complexity on top
of another until you have what you need. The four letters spell out
64 three-letter words. The words, in strings of about 300,
constitute some 50,000 instructions, a k a genes, and the body's
cells, of which the brain has about 1,000 different varieties, each
use a special subset of the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long survive when the
genome proves that life, at its deepest level, is scripted by a
logical program? The program's control is so tight that, as has
long been known, a single error in the instructions can cause
malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other hereditary
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Even in matters of behavior, the program can be astonishingly
precise. A favorite laboratory animal, the microscopic roundworm
known as C. elegans, can be found in soils around the world,
peacefully eating bacteria. Some C. elegans colonies are very
social and all dine together. In others, solitary feeding is the
rule. Biologists at the University of California in San Francisco
recently discovered that both social and solitary feeding in the
worm are controlled by the same gene. In the 215th word of the
gene, the solitary feeders have the letters G-T-T, the social
feeders T-T-T. Just as in computer programs, a single letter can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the genome's designer has an absolute lock on the
biological software market, the human genome is written in the same
programming code as is that of roundworms. But no doubt our
behavioral instructions have somewhat more wriggle-room than the
worm's because the choices we must make to survive are rather more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years we should get to read those behavioral
instructions. Whatever they are _ instincts to slaughter or show
mercy, the contexts for love and hatred, the taste for obedience or
rebellion _ they are the determinants of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' said Dr. Francis Collins, head of
the Human Genome Project, in announcing its decipherment at a White
House ceremony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesis account, to continue Collins' thought, tells us
there were two trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life. God evicted Adam and Eve because he feared
that, having tasted the Tree of Knowledge, his problem tenants
would eat next of the Tree of Life and live forever.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, to borrow the Genesis writer's metaphor, is surely
represented by both trees, entwined around each other like two
strands of a double helix. Have we not now broken back into the
garden for a second bite?
</P>
<P>
   From the Tree of Knowledge we will learn to read the programming
instructions that shape human nature and determine the implicit
survival rules of human societies. From the Tree of Life we will
learn to fix the programming errors that limit longevity and,
should we choose, to change the program so as to extend lifespan
many decades.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists trying to reconstruct the language spoken by the
ancestral human population have found that the world's major
language groups bear strong echoes of the mother tongue's words for
``one'' and maybe ``two,'' but nothing more. Perhaps the first
people, like many primitive cultures today, had a counting system
that went, ``One, two, many.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that we have lost our innocence and can count the
different degrees of infinity, we can see that that world is
constructed of numbers, just as Pythagoras taught, and that beneath
the velleities of human nature lies the same powerful programming
language whose G-T-T/T-T-T switch determines the sociality of the
roundworm.

<P>
   The question is: How much would it cost to contain the global
AIDS epidemic? The short answer is: Well, how much have you got?
</P>
<P>
   How much would it cost to banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to
shame rape, to stop war, to enrich the poor, to empower women, to
defend children, to make decent medical care as globally ubiquitous
as Coca-Cola _ in short, to get rid of all the underlying causes of
the epidemic in the Third World?
</P>
<P>
   The latest global survey of the epidemic was released last week
by Unaids, the U.N. agency dealing with AIDS. It estimated that
more than one-third of all 15-year-olds in the worst-affected
countries are still destined to die even if infection rates somehow
drop.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, AIDS is usually addressed as a medical
problem to be solved with health care or public health policy.
Overseas experts say that even seeing the epidemic that way is a
luxury that reflects American thinking: any germ can be killed if
it is hammered long enough with a big enough wad of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS in the Third World, said Anthony Kinghorn, a South
African consultant to governments and businesses facing the
epidemic, is ``really a welfare and education issue rather than a
medical one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe and India and Haiti, one cannot tackle AIDS the way
it has been fought in San Francisco and New York. One cannot simply
put baskets of condoms in all the gay bars and clean needles in all
the methadone clinics or even send speakers to all the high schools
and plant scary articles in the press.
</P>
<P>
   For one, much of the world at risk of AIDS can't read. Most of
the world at risk has never used a condom. Most of the world at
risk has never heard of Act Up and wouldn't dare heckle a
president. And most of the world with AIDS thinks it doesn't have
the disease and doesn't know anyone who does, because 95 percent of
those infected in the Third World have never been tested. (Most
estimates come from anonymous testing at pre-natal clinics.) And
most of the world cannot afford the drugs that Americans can.
</P>
<P>
   With such verities in mind, then, how is one to think about
containing AIDS _ say, in Africa, the continent most dramatically
affected so far?
</P>
<P>
   If there were money, what might be done with it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, estimates are bandied about. The Unaids survey
mentioned a need for $2 billion a year for sub-Saharan Africa, of
which about $300 million has been committed, said Dr. Peter Piot,
head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure seems negligible, given the scope of the
disease. And it is, because Unaids estimates are painfully
conservative. The $2 billion was only for prevention _ not care _
and only to bring standards up to the level of Uganda or Senegal,
the only two African countries that have cut their numbers of
citizens living with AIDS. It envisioned modest goals: condom
handouts, blood testing, counseling for prostitutes and students,
routine treatment for venereal diseases, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   When Unaids tries to calculate the theoretical additional cost
of medical care, ``it gets more difficult,'' said Bernhard
Schwartlaender, the agency's chief epidemiologist. The calculations
are pared down to what realistically might be done. They include
treating only people with access to medical systems that can do
easier things like tuberculosis treatment and pre-natal care
reasonably well. Most of the money would go for the cheapest drugs,
like the antibiotic Bactrim, which prevents only simple infections.
Some money is allotted for more sophisticated drugs to fight
drug-resistant tuberculosis and fungal infections, and for an
``AIDS cocktail'' of anti-retroviral drugs _ but in these cases,
only enough to reach a fraction of those infected because those
therapies must be closely supervised and the medical resources to
do so are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the calculations assume that the cocktail will cost
only $1,400 a year (as opposed to the $12,000 a year or more that
an American AIDS patient might spend). To get the cost that low,
Western drug companies would have to cut their prices by 90 percent
or the drugs would have to be purchased from Brazil, India or other
countries that ignore patents.
</P>
<P>
   If that could all be arranged by 2005, Schwartlaender said, the
cost would be about $1.7 billion a year to get the cheapest care
for the dying to 40 percent of all infected Africans and the AIDS
cocktail to 10 percent _ an inadequate, but realistic, goal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If the drugs are more expensive or you increase the coverage
rate, the costs explode accordingly,'' Schwartlaender said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody calculates what it would cost to give Africans and Asians
the kind of health care that Americans _ even American welfare
recipients _ receive. That would run into hundreds of billions,
because one would have to start from ground zero, building the
hospitals and importing the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   To put this in perspective: There are an estimated 34 million
HIV-infected people in the world, at least 30 million of them poor.
Poor not just by American standards, but by world standards: living
on less than $2 a day. AIDS specialists rarely say this bluntly,
but the truth is that most of those 30 million people have simply
been written off, because the first priority for the first few
billion dollars is prevention, not treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is possible to talk so straightforwardly about the
terrible cost of AIDS _ at least not until more political leaders
in Africa realistically confront the dimensions of the problem, and
more governments overseas mobilize to help Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Whiteside, an economist who studies AIDS in South Africa,
which has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, puts it this way:
``You can't give up on the infected because of the message it
sends.'' But if he had $1 billion to spend most wisely, he would
spend it on ``giving women more power, caring for orphans and
getting them education.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the overwhelming problem of poverty. An
HIV-positive American can focus on his T-cell counts; an
HIV-positive African in a rural village still has to focus on
finding clean water and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Uganda,'' said Kinghorn, the South African consultant,
``there are lots of kids who are aware of AIDS now. But they're
simply not able to protect themselves. They have to do high-risk
things to put bread on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Once poverty is factored in _ especially when the dying young
can no longer build an economy _ the question becomes: How much can
be done with the least money? But that, too, is problematic. The
cheapest form of prevention is condoms. The U.S. Agency for
International Development is the biggest condom customer in the
world. With its European counterparts, the total bill for Africa
and Asia runs to Tens of millions of dollars. But distribution is
the difficult part, along with overcoming prejudices against them.
When, for example, will grown men in Soweto stop teasing young men
by asking, ``Oh, do you shower with your raincoat on, too?''
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine would also be a cheap countermeasure. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation has put up $250 million for the hunt, and
the Clinton administration has offered $1 billion in tax credits to
any company that invents one. But a vaccine, like a cure, remains
elusive. Optimists say one might be found and approved in 10 years.

WALTER MATTHAU: AMERICAN CURMUDGEON 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a 500-word sidebar 
 By GAYDEN WREN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Matthau was so unlovable he was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The more crotchety and curmudgeonly the characters he played,
the more charming audiences found him. Not since W.C. Fields has
anyone captured the spirit of the aging misanthrope with such comic
glee.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, of course, Matthau managed to conceal his
deepest secret _ that behind the cartoonish glare, perfectly
pitched grumble and impeccably timed shtick lurked one of
Hollywood's best actors.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Oscar-winning actor died on Saturday, July 1, of a
heart attack at 79, he left behind four decades of films to testify
that he was a lot more than a grumpy old man.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on Oct. 1, 1920, as Walter Matuschanskavasky,
Matthau got his start as a child actor in Manhattan's flourishing
Yiddish theater. After spending three-plus years in Europe with the
Army Air Force, he returned to New York and began to seriously
pursue an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   His Broadway debut came in ``Anne of a Thousand Days'' (1948),
and for the next 15 years he would be a favorite of theater-goers,
earning Tony Awards as Best Actor for ``A Shot in the Dark'' (1961)
and ``The Odd Couple'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   With his world-weary look even as a young man, Matthau was
rarely called on to play leading roles. However, he created a wide
range of supporting parts, from corrupt officials to sarcastic best
friends, in a variety of plays and live television productions into
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood called _ his first role was in ``The Kentuckian''
(1955) _ Matthau continued to play straight roles, for the most
part. When he starred, it was usually as a heavy, as in ``Gangster
Story'' (1960), his directing debut, in which he played a mobster
whose girlfriend (Carol Grace, Matthau's newlywed wife) tries to
reform him.
</P>
<P>
   But comedy was clearly his forte, and in 1966 legendary director
Billy Wilder cast Matthau as Jack Lemmon's brother-in-law in ``The
Fortune Cookie.'' Matthau took home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar
as the shyster lawyer ``Whiplash Willie,'' and three patterns were
established: Matthau would be a comic actor, he and Lemmon would
work together frequently and both would become favorites of the
aging Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   The finnicky Lemmon was a natural choice to pair with the
slouchy Matthau when he recreated his Tony-winning role in ``The
Odd Couple'' (1968), and the two would team repeatedly in years to
come, including Wilder's ``The Front Page'' (1974) and ``Buddy
Buddy'' (1981), ``Grumpy Old Men'' (1993), ``Grumpier Old Men''
(1995), ``Out to Sea'' (1996) and ``The Odd Couple II'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Matthau etched a series of
comic portrayals which were similar in broad overview but
distinctive in their details. He had a harder-than-usual edge as
the driven newspaper editor Walter Burns in ``The Front Page,''
then aged a couple of decades for an Oscar-nominated turn as a
spiteful, elderly comedian in ``The Sunshine Boys'' (1975) _ 55 at
the time, Matthau played the older half of the team, opposite the
79-year-old George Burns. In 1976, he gave unexpected bite to his
performance as the loser coach of a Little League team in ``The Bad
News Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his other memorable roles, Matthau played a craggy Supreme
Court justice in ``First Monday in October'' (1981), and in 1993
found a perfect role as the harried Mr. Wilson in ``Dennis the
Menace.'' He and Lemmon were better than their material in the
unexpected hit ``Grumpy Old Men,'' while the next year Matthau
delivered perhaps his most charming performance as a whimsical
Albert Einstein in ``I.Q.'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   He made his money with comedy, but Matthau continued to
demonstrate that he could shine in drama as well. He played a bank
robber in ``Charley Varrick'' (1973) and a cynical Transit
Authority official in the hostage drama ``The Taking of Pelham One
Two Three'' (1974), and had an effective cameo in ``JFK'' (1991).
On the small screen, he played a small-town lawyer in the Emmy
Award-winning television movie ``The Incident'' (1990), whose
success led to a couple of sequels.
</P>
<P>
   In drama or comedy, however, Matthau's assets remained the same
_ a surly curmudgeonliness that suggested he was inwardly laughing
at the world, including himself, and a native intelligence that
expressed itself in cynical asides and occasional moments of
genuine warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a young man, Matthau seemed older than his years, and as
he aged he sometimes let his jowly, baggy-eyed visage and shambling
walk do too much of the work of characterization. He could also
succumb to the temptation to overact, especially when paired with
fellow ham Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   But to the very end of his career Matthau was capable of
nuanced, interesting performances that lifted second-rate and
first-rate material alike. Behind the facade of the classic grouch
lived a canny, masterful American actor. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: FOREVER OLD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of Walter Matthau's best films can be found on video
cassette, and a few on laser disk or DVD. A greatest-hits sampling
might include the following eight films:
</P>
<P>
   + `CHARADE' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those sophisticated, neo-Hitchcockian thrillers _
this time from musical maven Stanley Donen, of all people. Audrey
Hepburn is an American widow in Paris who's being stalked by a
bunch of killers and protected, she thinks, by Cary Grant. But
Grant has more names than the average man should, and the only
person she can trust is American Embassy official Matthau ... or
can she?
</P>
<P>
   + `THE FORTUNE COOKIE' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lemmon is injured at a Cleveland Browns game, and his
ambulance-chasing brother-in-law sees it as their ticket to the big
bucks. Matthau won an Oscar for his role as ``Whiplash Willie,''
and deserved it for the scene with the nuns alone. Nice plus: Some
real-life game footage from the NFL's low-glamour years.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE ODD COUPLE' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Neil Simon's play gets an impeccable film rendition, with the
tense, obsessive-compulsive Felix (Lemmon) moving in with the
aggressively slobbish Oscar (Matthau, who created the role on
Broadway). With all due respect to Randall and Klugman, Lemmon and
Matthau have this one nailed. Pass on the disappointing 1998
sequel, though.
</P>
<P>
   + `KOTCH' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Matthau plays an elderly man whose children are trying to shove
him aside _ but, predictably, the crotchety Matthau isn't ready to
go. Heartwarming but rarely saccharine. Matthau's frequent screen
partner, Jack Lemmon, directs in his only stint behind the camera,
and does well.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE FRONT PAGE' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wilder's remake, the third go-round for the classic
Hecht-MacArthur play, casts Matthau as tough editor Walter Burns
(previously played by Adolph Menjou in 1931 and Cary Grant in 1940)
and Jack Lemmon as determined-to-quit reporter Hildy Johnson
(previously Pat O'Brien and Rosalind Russell!). Hard-hitting drama
with comic overtones, plus a great supporting cast that includes
Susan Sarandon, Vincent Gardenia, Charles Durning and Carol
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE BAD NEWS BEARS' (1976).
</P>
<P>
   Matthau is a sodden, underachieving pool cleaner trapped into
coaching a pathetic Little League team, with Tatum O'Neal as the
girl pitcher who suddenly gives the team a whole new look. Some
raunchy language, but funnier than its many imitators, with Matthau
surprisingly touching in a broadly sketched part. He skipped the
two sequels, incidentally, and so should you.
</P>
<P>
   + `HOUSE CALLS' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   One of the decade's funniest comedies casts Matthau as a
recently widowed doctor who is torn between reveling in his
independence and the charms of Glenda Jackson. Terrific support
from Richard Benjamin and from Art Carney as a dotty chief of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   + `I.Q.' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   A highly unusual romantic comedy, half Meg Ryan movie and half
philosophical fantasy. Tim Robbins is an auto mechanic in 1950s
Princeton, N.J., who falls in love with the physicist niece (Ryan)
of the famous Professor Albert Einstein. Matthau plays Einstein as
an inspired combination of absent-minded professor, insightful
genius and twinkle-eyed romantic in a performance that deserved the
Oscar it didn't get.

WALTER MATTHAU: AMERICAN CURMUDGEON 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a 500-word sidebar 
 By GAYDEN WREN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Matthau was so unlovable he was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The more crotchety and curmudgeonly the characters he played,
the more charming audiences found him. Not since W.C. Fields has
anyone captured the spirit of the aging misanthrope with such comic
glee.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, of course, Matthau managed to conceal his
deepest secret _ that behind the cartoonish glare, perfectly
pitched grumble and impeccably timed shtick lurked one of
Hollywood's best actors.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Oscar-winning actor died on Saturday, July 1, of a
heart attack at 79, he left behind four decades of films to testify
that he was a lot more than a grumpy old man.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on Oct. 1, 1920, as Walter Matuschanskavasky,
Matthau got his start as a child actor in Manhattan's flourishing
Yiddish theater. After spending three-plus years in Europe with the
Army Air Force, he returned to New York and began to seriously
pursue an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   His Broadway debut came in ``Anne of a Thousand Days'' (1948),
and for the next 15 years he would be a favorite of theater-goers,
earning Tony Awards as Best Actor for ``A Shot in the Dark'' (1961)
and ``The Odd Couple'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   With his world-weary look even as a young man, Matthau was
rarely called on to play leading roles. However, he created a wide
range of supporting parts, from corrupt officials to sarcastic best
friends, in a variety of plays and live television productions into
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood called _ his first role was in ``The Kentuckian''
(1955) _ Matthau continued to play straight roles, for the most
part. When he starred, it was usually as a heavy, as in ``Gangster
Story'' (1960), his directing debut, in which he played a mobster
whose girlfriend (Carol Grace, Matthau's newlywed wife) tries to
reform him.
</P>
<P>
   But comedy was clearly his forte, and in 1966 legendary director
Billy Wilder cast Matthau as Jack Lemmon's brother-in-law in ``The
Fortune Cookie.'' Matthau took home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar
as the shyster lawyer ``Whiplash Willie,'' and three patterns were
established: Matthau would be a comic actor, he and Lemmon would
work together frequently and both would become favorites of the
aging Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   The finnicky Lemmon was a natural choice to pair with the
slouchy Matthau when he recreated his Tony-winning role in ``The
Odd Couple'' (1968), and the two would team repeatedly in years to
come, including Wilder's ``The Front Page'' (1974) and ``Buddy
Buddy'' (1981), ``Grumpy Old Men'' (1993), ``Grumpier Old Men''
(1995), ``Out to Sea'' (1996) and ``The Odd Couple II'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Matthau etched a series of
comic portrayals which were similar in broad overview but
distinctive in their details. He had a harder-than-usual edge as
the driven newspaper editor Walter Burns in ``The Front Page,''
then aged a couple of decades for an Oscar-nominated turn as a
spiteful, elderly comedian in ``The Sunshine Boys'' (1975) _ 55 at
the time, Matthau played the older half of the team, opposite the
79-year-old George Burns. In 1976, he gave unexpected bite to his
performance as the loser coach of a Little League team in ``The Bad
News Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his other memorable roles, Matthau played a craggy Supreme
Court justice in ``First Monday in October'' (1981), and in 1993
found a perfect role as the harried Mr. Wilson in ``Dennis the
Menace.'' He and Lemmon were better than their material in the
unexpected hit ``Grumpy Old Men,'' while the next year Matthau
delivered perhaps his most charming performance as a whimsical
Albert Einstein in ``I.Q.'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   He made his money with comedy, but Matthau continued to
demonstrate that he could shine in drama as well. He played a bank
robber in ``Charley Varrick'' (1973) and a cynical Transit
Authority official in the hostage drama ``The Taking of Pelham One
Two Three'' (1974), and had an effective cameo in ``JFK'' (1991).
On the small screen, he played a small-town lawyer in the Emmy
Award-winning television movie ``The Incident'' (1990), whose
success led to a couple of sequels.
</P>
<P>
   In drama or comedy, however, Matthau's assets remained the same
_ a surly curmudgeonliness that suggested he was inwardly laughing
at the world, including himself, and a native intelligence that
expressed itself in cynical asides and occasional moments of
genuine warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a young man, Matthau seemed older than his years, and as
he aged he sometimes let his jowly, baggy-eyed visage and shambling
walk do too much of the work of characterization. He could also
succumb to the temptation to overact, especially when paired with
fellow ham Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   But to the very end of his career Matthau was capable of
nuanced, interesting performances that lifted second-rate and
first-rate material alike. Behind the facade of the classic grouch
lived a canny, masterful American actor. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: FOREVER OLD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of Walter Matthau's best films can be found on video
cassette, and a few on laser disk or DVD. A greatest-hits sampling
might include the following eight films:
</P>
<P>
   + `CHARADE' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those sophisticated, neo-Hitchcockian thrillers _
this time from musical maven Stanley Donen, of all people. Audrey
Hepburn is an American widow in Paris who's being stalked by a
bunch of killers and protected, she thinks, by Cary Grant. But
Grant has more names than the average man should, and the only
person she can trust is American Embassy official Matthau ... or
can she?
</P>
<P>
   + `THE FORTUNE COOKIE' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lemmon is injured at a Cleveland Browns game, and his
ambulance-chasing brother-in-law sees it as their ticket to the big
bucks. Matthau won an Oscar for his role as ``Whiplash Willie,''
and deserved it for the scene with the nuns alone. Nice plus: Some
real-life game footage from the NFL's low-glamour years.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE ODD COUPLE' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Neil Simon's play gets an impeccable film rendition, with the
tense, obsessive-compulsive Felix (Lemmon) moving in with the
aggressively slobbish Oscar (Matthau, who created the role on
Broadway). With all due respect to Randall and Klugman, Lemmon and
Matthau have this one nailed. Pass on the disappointing 1998
sequel, though.
</P>
<P>
   + `KOTCH' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Matthau plays an elderly man whose children are trying to shove
him aside _ but, predictably, the crotchety Matthau isn't ready to
go. Heartwarming but rarely saccharine. Matthau's frequent screen
partner, Jack Lemmon, directs in his only stint behind the camera,
and does well.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE FRONT PAGE' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wilder's remake, the third go-round for the classic
Hecht-MacArthur play, casts Matthau as tough editor Walter Burns
(previously played by Adolph Menjou in 1931 and Cary Grant in 1940)
and Jack Lemmon as determined-to-quit reporter Hildy Johnson
(previously Pat O'Brien and Rosalind Russell!). Hard-hitting drama
with comic overtones, plus a great supporting cast that includes
Susan Sarandon, Vincent Gardenia, Charles Durning and Carol
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE BAD NEWS BEARS' (1976).
</P>
<P>
   Matthau is a sodden, underachieving pool cleaner trapped into
coaching a pathetic Little League team, with Tatum O'Neal as the
girl pitcher who suddenly gives the team a whole new look. Some
raunchy language, but funnier than its many imitators, with Matthau
surprisingly touching in a broadly sketched part. He skipped the
two sequels, incidentally, and so should you.
</P>
<P>
   + `HOUSE CALLS' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   One of the decade's funniest comedies casts Matthau as a
recently widowed doctor who is torn between reveling in his
independence and the charms of Glenda Jackson. Terrific support
from Richard Benjamin and from Art Carney as a dotty chief of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   + `I.Q.' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   A highly unusual romantic comedy, half Meg Ryan movie and half
philosophical fantasy. Tim Robbins is an auto mechanic in 1950s
Princeton, N.J., who falls in love with the physicist niece (Ryan)
of the famous Professor Albert Einstein. Matthau plays Einstein as
an inspired combination of absent-minded professor, insightful
genius and twinkle-eyed romantic in a performance that deserved the
Oscar it didn't get.

<P>
   Blame HBO's ``Sex and the City'' or blame the decline of the
ozone layer, but skin is in. American women are showing more of it
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Summer itself is hotter. And over the last decade, the
proliferation of the Wonderbra coincided with global warming so
that just as cleavages became more pronounced, shorts became
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, always synchronized with hemlines, has reached
crazy new heights and so has the slip dress. Some of the skirts,
like some of the stocks, have since plunged down again. Other
skirts, like other stocks, have reached these new heights without
having much to them in the way of visible material: They're so
sheer, they're almost transparent.
</P>
<P>
   With the triumph of minimalism, the handkerchief has returned,
not as a decoration in a man's pocket but as an entire piece of
women's clothing, featured in handkerchief tops and hanky hemlines.
Sleeves, once a staple of the workplace, have become optional.
MTV's official anthem for its Spring Break 2000 was the ``Thong
Song,'' the R-and-B artist Sisqo's ode to revealing apparel.
</P>
<P>
   A brief history of skimpy: When things from the lingerie or
handkerchief category first became ``clothes,'' they seemed like
mistakes. The model wearing the bra top down the runway looked as
if she had been interrupted while getting dressed. The woman
arriving at the party in the camisole looked as if she had been
awakened from a nap. Backless shoes and shirts appeared incomplete.
But now everyone can tell that these things are not mistakes,
because it has become OK to wear what was formerly considered
underwear or handkerchiefs in most situations.
</P>
<P>
   They're not fashion mistakes, at least. But following fashions
can lead to other mistakes. Just as tight corsets put Victorian
women into severe physical discomfort, so today's scarf tops and
cropped tanks can bring stylish dressers to new levels of personal
discomfort. As women have embraced the empowerment and comfort of
wearing less, they have also been punished by those who can't see
past naked skin. As Erin Brockovich discovered, and as Julia
Roberts learned when she played Brockovich in the recent movie, if
women need to work twice as hard as men to prove they're as good,
scantily clad women need to work three times as hard.
</P>
<P>
   Female exposure has been attacked by the puritanical and the
macho alike. At the George Washington Middle School in Alexandria,
Va., 12-year-old girls wearing shorts of the lengths recommended by
Seventeen magazine were accused of violating the school dress code,
lined up and subjected to humiliating inspections. Last season,
even the trend-setting sitcom character Ally McBeal was held in
contempt of court for wearing a micro-mini.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the recent Puerto Rican Day parade in New York
City's Central Park, women wearing the latest fashions were mauled
by young men less interested in the pages of Vogue than in the
violent imagery of traditional skin magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that plunging necklines and ascending midriffs have
become identified with pornographic fantasies, because they do
reflect an improved reality. Women of all sizes, shapes and ages
wear the tie-backs and halters once seen only on the young and
slim, partly thanks to better self-image and the increased
acceptance of different body types. Designers have even made tube
tops for the visibly pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems generous of designers to want women to feel
better about themselves, clothing makers do profit from skimpy
fashions: they can charge more and more for items that are tinier
and tinier.
</P>
<P>
   Less is simple, and simplicity especially delights the low-end
retailers who copy and mass-produce couture. The popularity of the
George label sold in England's Asda chain, which was just purchased
by Wal-Mart, demonstrates that consumers like cheap versions of
designer fashions so much that they will buy them in the
supermarket. The American discount warehouse Sam's Club now sells
clothes. Why go elsewhere? these non-clothing clothing stores seem
to be asking. Wouldn't it be nice to wear less, pay less and think
about the whole thing less?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, if the judgments and gazes that followed
weren't quite so judgmental and gazing. Those who dare to show the
flesh and the confidence celebrated by current styles may find
themselves in a zone of discomfort. Women who dress provocatively
have traditionally been accused of sending a mixed message. But now
that provocative is chic, women are the ones receiving the mixed
message: Everyone's wearing it, but wear it at your own risk.

BALLS, STRIKES, AND SOME FIRST AID 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   People ask her why, at 38, she is still out there, on the road,
a different tour stop every night, chasing a dream she has already
lived. Dr. Dot Richardson can answer only that she still has the
passion and she earned the opportunity and because a game not
measured by time is preferable to waiting around for hers to be up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not forever,'' she said. ``Every moment of our lives we
truly need to live.''
</P>
<P>
   What sounded like the inside of a fortune cookie was actually
more the voice of traumatic experience. When she is not winding her
way along the Olympic softball trail, Richardson is a surgeon and
thus not unfamiliar with mortality's terms. She just didn't expect
to be confronting them while warming up recently at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was my favorite Atlanta Olympian in 1996, the
freckled and chatty shortstop who invited the world to come watch
the U.S. women do their thing at the isolated outpost of Columbus,
Ga. She also hit the game-winning home run against China that gave
the Americans the first Olympic gold medal in women's softball, a
splendid game requiring abundant levels of athletic skill.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to be an ambassador for her sport, which she had
played internationally since 1979 and at UCLA and throughout
medical school and her residency years. And though none of the
Olympic softball games were televised, the buzz from Columbus was
so strong that the network geniuses back in New York finally broke
down. They stole a few moments from the gymnastic pixies, and let
Dr. Dot and teammates rap live with Bob Costas on the night they
struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Atlanta, I felt that I never wanted to step on a field
again,'' she said last Thursday when the national team, on the long
road to Sydney, stopped by in Staten Island to play a college
all-star team. ``It was like I never wanted to taint those
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years is a long time to stick to an emotional decision. By
the following year, Richardson was convincing herself there was no
harm in returning to Columbus for an encore. She wanted to say
thank you to the fans, relive the moments. The plan would have been
perfect had she not tried out for the United States team, and been
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop had become the undisputed territory of Crystl Bustos,
a strapping 23-year-old slugger. Richardson, at 5 feet 5 inches,
felt they were telling her the game had outgrown her, that she was
too old. That made her mad enough to try out again.
</P>
<P>
   She had a 10 a.m. flight to San Diego from Los Angeles, where
she lives, for the next national team auditions. After being up at
the hospital all night, she missed the flight, tending to a
patient. Now she had a choice: give it up for good and go home to
sleep, or drive the two hours and try out, exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember driving and thinking about how they say athletes
never know when to get out,'' she said. ``I was saying, `God, give
me a sign.'''
</P>
<P>
   She got cut again, and decided that wasn't the sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I took from San Diego,'' she said, ``was that while
I was on the field, I was thinking: `I just love this. I want to
play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson kept trying and, finally, last year, she remade the
national team, at second base. The Americans rolled into Staten
Island, not having lost since a 2-1 preliminary round defeat to
Australia at the 1998 world championships. On the current tour,
after 13 of 32 stops, they had outscored the opposition, 154-1.
</P>
<P>
   Before hitting the road, Richardson completed a fellowship with
the Kerlan-Jobe Institute, and she plans to start her own practice
in sports orthopedics next year. Medical duties were on hold, until
the second inning Thursday night at the ASA complex in Staten
Island. When she saw the commotion by the bleachers behind first
base, when she noticed her team manager, Ralph Weekly, frantically
waving her over, she knew why. She dropped her glove and sprinted
off.
</P>
<P>
   She had treated diabetics at games before. She performed a
Heimlich maneuver once. But this time, a 70-year-old man, Sal
Lamendola, had gone into cardiac arrest. He lost consciousness and
Richardson started cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to go to a hospital,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency medical van, she began chest compressions. She
checked for a pulse and found none. Soon, the van was pulling over,
intercepted by an ambulance, which soon sped off with the patient.
Richardson, in uniform, was in the street, in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so stressed, working so hard, and it felt as if we had
driven for miles,'' she said. ``I said to someone, `Where's the
field?' He said, `Right over there.'''
</P>
<P>
   She walked around the corner, into the dugout. The coach, Ralph
Raymond, asked if she wanted to play. Why not? Richardson replied.
She soon grabbed a bat and went up to hit.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Richardson learned that Sal Lamendola had died
at the Sisters of Charity Medical Center. She didn't know the man.
She just tried to save him. She had heard that he often umpired
softball games at the complex and that his life had ended watching
his favorite sport, doing something he loved.

doctor and softball philosopher. ``Things that we love.'' &QL;

   Reds Try to Find a Way Back Into the Race
</P>
<P>
   Unable to fix the Cincinnati Reds' primary problem this season,
Jim Bowden has embarked on a do-it-yourself plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have five boys,'' Bowden said. ``I'm trying to make them all
starting pitchers. We have a mound in the backyard and I'm going to
make sure they all become pitchers. How else can we afford
pitchers?''
</P>
<P>
   As a long-range solution, the Bowden plan is commendable. But
what can it do for the Reds in their attempt to get back in the
National League Central race this season? Bowden's sons _ J.B.,
Tyler, Chad and their twin brothers (even younger, not quite 2) _
are not going to replace Steve Parris, Ron Villone and Rob Bell. So
what is a general manager to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night,'' Bowden said, ``I go home and my kids say, `Do
you have a pitcher, do you have a pitcher?' I tell them, `It's not
as easy as your Nintendo game.' They do trades every day on their
video games.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability of Ken Griffey Jr. to hit the Ken Griffey Jr. way
the first two months of the season focused attention on the
newcomer as the culprit in the Reds' disappointing start. A few
days into June and he was hitting a paltry .211.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, Bowden said, Griffey was not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hogwash,'' he said. ``This guy is playing Gold Glove
center field, he's on pace to hit 50, 60 home runs and drive in
120. It's not his fault that other guys haven't hit. If they were
on base when he's hitting these bombs, he'd have 180 RBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was not hitting for average, Griffey was slugging
home runs, 15 in the first two months, 11 more since in 22 games,
in which he has also batted .338 and raised his season average to
.247.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about the average?'' Bowden asked. ``Greg Vaughn hit
.220 most of last year and he almost got us into the playoffs. He's
producing runs and saving runs every night.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Reds acquired Griffey from Seattle last Feb. 10, the
Reds were immediately viewed as the team most likely to win the
division championship. But just about at the midway point in the
schedule, the Reds languish eight and a half games behind St. Louis
(before Saturday's games).
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, meanwhile, have one of the best records in the
American League, but that is another story.
</P>
<P>
   This one is about the Reds and their failure not only to command
the division race but also to take off in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me in spring training that on June 30 we'd
have the same number of wins as the Yankees, I'd probably have been
happy,'' Bowden said. But he is not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my responsibility that we're not winning,'' Bowden said.
``I haven't been able to make deals for starting pitching. Why do
the Yankees have the same number of wins as we do? Starting
pitching. You don't win without starting pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have sent one of their starting pitchers, a rookie, Rob
Bell (5.28 earned run average), back to the minor leagues after 15
starts. Parris has a 5.67 ERA and 11 losses, Ron Villone a 5.92
ERA. Only Denny Neagle (3.86) and Osvaldo Fernandez (3.21) have
been consistently effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys who get us down 5-0 before we say hello,'' the
usually resourceful Bowden said. ``If we have starting pitching, we
can get back in this thing. There are pitchers out there who I
think will make a difference. We can't afford to add payroll so we
couldn't get Mussina or Radke, that type of guy, but we need
someone to keep us in games for six innings.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Pete Harnisch, the Reds' No. 1 starter, returned
from nearly two months on the disabled list with an ailing shoulder
and pitched six shutout innings against Arizona Friday night. The
Reds won the game for Harnisch's first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey did not get a hit in 4 times at bat, lowering his
average to .244. In 11 seasons with the Mariners, Griffey was a
.300 hitter seven times. He hit a career-high .323 in the
strike-shortened 1994 season, then followed it with a career-low
.258. He hit .284 and .285 the past two seasons, leaving him at
.299 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   His batting average, then, has never really been an accurate
barometer of his overall contribution. He has averaged 52 home runs
the past four seasons, and his 26 home runs this season have helped
keep the Reds close enough to the Cardinals to be able to make a
run at them if the starting pitching cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' said Bowden, an admittedly shameless admirer,
``one of the best players I've seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's Discomfort
</P>
<P>
   Can Sammy Sosa rediscover peace and happiness on the North Side
of Chicago? The Cubs certainly hope so, but the betting in baseball
circles (where no betting is allowed) is that he will not. The
furious love affair that had existed has been shattered, very
likely beyond repair. One friend of Sosa said he was ``dying'' to
get away from the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa probably lost his chance to go elsewhere when the Cubs
squandered what appeared to be their best chance to trade him. The
Yankees came within one player of making a deal, but they wouldn't
give the Cubs the extra player they demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of other clubs saw the Cubs' stance as greedy. ``They
let a left-handed `A' ball pitcher stand in the way,'' one general
manager said contemptuously, referring to Alex Graman. ``This might
have been the biggest trade blunder in Cubs history. They had an
opportunity to get four pretty good young players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs may find another team that would be willing to give up
a cache of good young prospects and sign Sosa to a contract
extension worth perhaps $18 million a year, but it's highly
unlikely. As one general manager pointed out, next winter's free
agent crop will feature Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Manny
Ramirez and Chipper Jones. A team that otherwise may be interested
in Sosa could sign one of those players and keep their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, does not see the team's
circumstances as dire as others obviously do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get involved in these type of things,'' he said,
``you have to satisfy yourself that you did your best for the
organization and the player. We made a good faith effort to
accommodate the player, balancing that with what we perceived our
needs to be down the road. The Yankees chose to go a different
road, which is their prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was obvious their talks with the Yankees had died, the
Cubs quickly took steps to try to repair the schism that had
developed with Sosa. General Manager Ed Lynch spoke with him in
Pittsburgh, and MacPhail contacted one of his agents. There is not
much confidence outside of Wrigley Field that their words will
create the peaceful coexistence the Cubs now desperately need.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Deep on the Disabled List
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, who reached Saturday alive but a shocking
nine and a half games from first place, have had a fulltime job
shuffling pitchers. Because they have had so many pitchers hurt
this season, they have had to bring pitchers up from the minor
leagues when they hadn't planned to or signed free-agent pitchers
who were available only because other teams had released them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You anticipate that you'll have to go to Triple A and get
three guys during the season,'' Mark Shapiro, the team's assistant
general manager, said. ``You can't do it with seven. We're seven
pitchers deep on the disabled list. No team is equipped to handle
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In order, the Indians have added to their pitching staff this
season: Sean DePaula (now on the disabled list himself), Jim
Brower, Mark Watson (lost on waiver claim), Scott Sanders (released
next day), Paul Rigdon (disabled list, later optioned to minors),
Tim Drew (optioned next day), Justin Speier, Jared Camp (lost on
waiver claim), Jamie Brewington, Kane Davis (optioned, later
recalled), Willie Martinez (optioned three days later), Brian
Williams, Jaime Navarro (designated for assignment after two
starts), Mike Mohler (designated for assignment two days later),
Andrew Lorraine, Alan Newman (designated for assignment two days
later).
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nagy, a veteran starter who has been on the disabled
list since May 18, is expected back just after the All-Star break.
Jaret Wright, on the disabled list for the second time this season,
won't be back until August, if at all this year.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Benefits
</P>
<P>
   On the same day last week, Wednesday, Cal Eldred gained his 10th
victory against 2 defeats for the Chicago White Sox and Jeff
Cirillo hit 3 home runs in a game for the Colorado Rockies. Eldred
and Cirillo were traded to their teams a month apart last winter by
the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   With Eldred becoming one of two 10-game winners, the White Sox
have grabbed a commanding lead in the American League Central. With
Cirillo hitting .348 and driving in 61 runs, the Rockies are
challenging Arizona for first place in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin was in the trade with Eldred and is the White Sox
shortstop. Within that same month, the Brewers traded Fernando Vina
to St. Louis, where he was hitting .290 as the regular second
baseman for the first-place Cardinals before going on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, at last look, were languishing near the bottom of
the N.L. Central.

RIORDAN IN FINAL YEAR OF OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twelve months from now, Mayor Richard Riordan
leaves Los Angeles City Hall, ending what will have been a
personally expensive, eight-year experiment in reconfiguring local
government.
</P>
<P>
   Left in doubt at this point is how well the multimillionaire
businessman will have fared with his vision of a safer city,
friendlier to both business and its constituents. What, in essence,
will be his legacy?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you worry about that, then you are unable to do anything,''
the 70-year-old mayor said in a recent interview in his
eighth-floor office at City Hall East, overlooking historic City
Hall, which is undergoing earthquake repairs and might be open by
the time Riordan returns to private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about legacy. It will be what it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do gauge legacies say this is Riordan's make-or-break
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that people will remember Richard Riordan for will
take place this summer,'' political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole legacy will be based on how the city comes through
the (Democratic National) Convention, how the Rampart scandal
shakes out and how well (new schools superintendent) Roy Romer does
at the school district.''
</P>
<P>
   There is irony in the controversies that surround Riordan and
the nation's second-largest city: The secession drives and the
police corruption scandal at the Los Angeles Police Department's
Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   It was Riordan who ran in 1993 on a campaign of making the city
safer after the 1992 rioting that followed the initial acquittal of
four LAPD officers accusing of beating African-American motorist
Rodney King and the promise of increasing the Police Department to
10,000 officers _ a goal that was never reached, and for which the
mayor was not held accountable as crime dropped anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Riordan who raised the hopes of neighborhoods by urging
them to demand service from the city.
</P>
<P>
   When that failed and a growing disenchantment settled across the
city, secession drives began _ first in the San Fernando Valley,
then spreading to the Wilmington-San Pedro area and to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While he adamantly opposes secession, Riordan said he is proud
of the energy he has unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one thing I'm proud of, it is empowering
neighborhoods,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this past year has been the toughest for him even
as others question his commitment to city issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been busier this year than I've ever been,'' Riordan
said. ``I'm spending every day dealing with Rampart and the
convention. And, then there's education and the school board that
takes a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention is seen as crucial in
remaking the image of the city from the scenes of rioting and fires
following the Rodney King verdict in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be worth $1 billion in publicity,'' Riordan said. But
that is contingent on a smoothly run convention with few problems
and a police department seen neither as overbearing nor
under-reactive to protests and demonstrations that could turn
violent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the convention planning has been far from smooth. Fund
raising fell so far short, the Host Committee was forced to ask the
City Council for $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The council reluctantly agreed - although there are moves to
reverse that - but only after it forced Riordan to pay off on a $1
million personal letter of credit he had written for the Host
Committee to cover some of its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Riordan insists his relationship with the City
Council is strong on practical matters affecting the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only when we get into politics that there is a
problem,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has been both ally and
adversary to the mayor, said it might be too late for Riordan to
forge a relationship with the council after years of ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, he continues to refuse to work cooperatively with
the council,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``It has been one form of combat
after another and we have suffered from that. His administration
has suffered, the people have suffered and local government has
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Riordan's lame duck status.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a level of intolerance and impatience by several
members of the council toward the mayor, and that's unfortunate,''
Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan worries only about the potential loss of staff during
his final year in office rather than being a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of having the will to get things done,'' Riordan
said. ``But I have a lot of loyal people who are going to be
looking ahead. A lot of them can make twice the amount of money in
the private sector as they do here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of Riordan's problems with the City Council stem from his
original campaign, which cost him $6 million of his own money. He
ran as an outsider against ``career politicians,'' lambasting city
bureaucrats and criticizing the level of spending.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unsuccessful with many of his original proposals such
as selling off Los Angeles International Airport and privatizing
city services. Others, such as reforming the city business tax
structure, saw partial success but never went as far as Riordan
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's second election in 1997 was much easier than his first
_ in which he defeated former Councilman Mike Woo in a runoff _ but
still cost millions of dollars. Riordan spent $3 million of his own
funds in the 1997 race against state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Riordan has used his own money and his contacts with
millionaires to bring them in for a variety of causes, from the
Disney Hall to library and police programs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the area in which Riordan has been most successful is
one in which he has no direct power: The Los Angeles Unified School
District.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan created a political committee, Coalition for Kids, that
saw the election of three new school board members and the
re-election of a fourth member committed to the mayor's vision of
reform.
</P>
<P>
   That board ousted Superintendent Ruben Zacarias, brought in
interim superintendent Ramon Cortines and recently hired former
Colorado Gov. Romer to oversee the latest restructuring plan of
creating 11 minidistricts.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, however, said he will continue his efforts in the area
of education. He's already raised $300,000 and is targeting two of
the three board members up for election next year, Julie Korenstein
and Vickie Castro. Riordan said board member Valerie Fields has
embraced his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he has no such plans against any City Council
members, half of whom will be leaving their seats for other
political jobs or because of the term limits approved by voters
after an initiative campaign financed by Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   While a victim of those term limits, Riordan said he has no
regrets over being forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, people forget who they are and begin to define
themselves by their title,'' Riordan said. ``That's when it's time
to move on.''

MEXICAN VOTERS LIVING IN U.S. PLAN CARAVAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of Californians are in Tijuana this
Fourth of July weekend, not to party but to vote in the most
contested presidential election in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   To vote, Mexicans must cross the border, where special booths
have been set up to handle the expected crowds. Fifteen such sites
have been set up in the tourist town of Tijuana, a three-hour drive
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Mexico a long time ago,'' said Desiderio Villegas, a
semi-retired Christian pastor who came to Van Nuys from Mexicali,
Mexico, 19 years ago. ``But the struggle for change there is still
my struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment is a widespread one, as most of the estimated 4
million Mexican-Americans in the Los Angeles area closely watch the
elections, regarded as a test of true democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those in the mass ballot-box exodus are thought to
support Mexican opposition candidates in an election that has the
first real chance of dethroning the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, since it took power in 1929. The PRI is the
longest-ruling political party in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only Mexican citizens with voter identification cards qualify to
vote. Mexico estimates there are 1.5 million people in the United
States with valid Mexican voter cards. Mexico recognizes dual
citizenship, allowing people who live in the United States to vote
in Mexican elections if they've received a voter card.
</P>
<P>
   Villegas, who has networked through his extensive ties in the
San Fernando Valley to church groups, unions and grass-roots
community organizations, said he believes at least 5,000 from the
area will travel south to vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexicans living in the United States can't vote from
abroad, they are highly influential members of their extended
families across the border. Each year they send home an estimated
$6 billion annually, the country's third-biggest source of foreign
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a historic moment to bring democracy to
Mexico,'' said Francisco Garciduenas, an opposition supporter
organizing a voting caravan from Los Angeles to Tijuana expected to
draw at least 500. ``It's not a question of, Can we afford to do
this, but rather it's our duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that most of those going, like many other
Mexican-Americans, maintain intense cross-border relations with
family members, and even maintain property or businesses in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition has made great progress in the past decade,''
he said. ``We now have non-PRI governors, mayors and members of
congress. We're moving closer to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He has contacted family members in his home state of Michoacan
to influence their vote, just as many others in the United States
have called relatives down south.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the PRI-controlled Mexican congress killed a law that
would have allowed Mexicans abroad to submit absentee ballots
through consul offices. The move was criticized as a political
safeguard against strong opposition support abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Vicente Fox of the center-right National
Action Party (PAN) and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) each have extensive support
groups in California, where they traveled this year to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vote from abroad could have an impact on the close
presidential race, with the most recent voter polls showing Fox in
a dead heat with Francisco Labastida, the PRI candidate. Cardenas
runs a distant third with 15 percent to 20 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former governor and head of Coca-Cola in Mexico, has set
himself apart by promising to seek a more open border with the
United States and radical tax incentives to lure foreign investment
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida, a former governor and three-time federal cabinet
secretary, has criticized Fox for setting unrealistic job-creation
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox made an unsuccessful, last-ditch effort last week to seek
Cardenas' support to ensure opposition victory over the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Fox supporters plan to hand out thousands of
two-minute phone cards so that Mexican-Americans not able to travel
to Mexico to vote can call relatives and influence their choice,
said Carlos Salazar, international relations advisor to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling throughout Mexico and on this side of the border
is that people want change, and that's what we represent,'' Salazar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Elections Institute, or IFE, which runs the election
process in Mexico, estimates there are 56 million registered voters
in Mexico, and expects about 40 million to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Created in the aftermath of the 1988 elections, in which
Cardenas claimed he was robbed of victory by a corrupt government,
the IFE is an independent agency put in place to ensure a clean
election.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a former governor and mayor of Mexico City, held a
strong lead in polls in 1988 but lost by a landslide after a
suspicious computer glitch in the PRI-controlled government offices
on election night.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the IFE in this election will be
ensuring the public that a fair vote took place. The agency is
sending out thousands of observers on election day and will begin
releasing early results this afternoon, with the first official
tally expected at 11 p.m. Mexico City time.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is the key monitor from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the IFE is setting up more than 110 special voting
sites with 750 ballots each along the 2,000-mile U.S. border with
Mexico in expectation of a large number of Mexicans traveling south
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana, where there will be 15 sites with 11,250 total ballots,
is the expected destination for many Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Many planned to leave Saturday and spend the night to get in
line before voting sights open at 8 a.m. to ensure they get a
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on this for years,'' said Juan Jose
Bocanegro, one of 20 Mexicans in a group traveling from Seattle to
Tijuana who plan to ride the last mile across the border on
horseback for dramatic effect. They will be joined by other
horsemen in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and hope to be 100
strong by the time they reach Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bocanegro has run a job training program aimed at immigrants in
Seattle for the past 13 years, and says his ties to Mexico have
remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my family in Guadalajara will be voting for the
opposition, but the votes from up here are important, too,'' he
said. ``What affects my cousins and uncles also affects me.''

WHITE ABALONE ON BRINK OF EXTINCTION

<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ In its heyday, white abalone dotted the ocean
floor in the prime fishing grounds off the Ventura County coast and
numbered in the millions from Point Conception to Baja.
</P>
<P>
   The sea snail was common fare on California's menus, offered
deep fried or in sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than 2,540 remaining, white abalone is nearly
extinct. The public has until Wednesday to comment on a National
Marine Fisheries Service plan to list the mollusk as an endangered
species, the first time a marine invertebrate would receive the
classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is listed, it's sort of a milestone in our thinking
about the ocean,'' said Ian Taniguchi, a marine biologist with the
California Department of Fish and Game. ``For the longest time,
probably throughout recorded history, there has been a sort of
mentality that things that come from the ocean are infinite, are
non-exhaustible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception we could ever fish an invertebrate species to
extinction is sort of being realized now with the white abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The NMFS had already designated the white abalone as a candidate
for the endangered list in 1997. Last year, several environmental
groups - including the Channels Island Marine Resource Institute in
Port Hueneme - petitioned the agency to include it it under the
Endangered Species Act. And state Fish and Game currently is
working on listing the species under California's Endangered
Species Act, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups hope to bring more attention - and,
potentially, money for restoration and recovery - by classifying
the abalone as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties also would be greater for those who illegally harvest
the species, with violators facing a $100,000 fine and a year in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The white variety is among eight species of abalone that live
along the West Coast. It is the deepest dwelling, found on
low-relief rocks covered with algae at 80 to 200 feet, where the
water temperature is cooler.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, divers harvested thousands of pounds of the
melon-sized invertebrate - its shell lined with mother of pearl -
for the local and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always been a delicacy from Native Americans
onward,'' said Tom McCormick, director of the Channel Islands
Marine Resource Institute. ``They've always been perceived as
something exotic, very delicious and very California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1950s after the war, when scuba diving becoming
available and expanding to new areas, you would hear reports of
hundreds of thousand of abalone from dives,'' he said. ``There are
pictures showing mountains of abalone as tall as two-story
buildings at processing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people in the 1940s and 1950s, the $1.50 abalone sandwich
was very common. That memory is gone for younger people unless they
are out sport diving in Northern California to get the red
abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The white abalone, favored for its tender meat, commanded a
higher price at market, up to 20 percent more than the red abalone,
which was the main staple of the fishing industry, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1977, more than 95 percent of the commercial white
abalone harvest took place, with a peak catch of 144,000 pounds in
1972, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. A common
spot for catches was off the Ventura County coast - east of Santa
Cruz Island to Anacapa Island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years the white abalone population has went
from an estimated high of 2.22 million to 4.24 million to 1,613 to
2,540 - a 99 percent decline, the NMFS reported.
</P>
<P>
   That drop prompted state Fish and Game officials to close
fishing for white, pink and green abalone in 1996. A year later,
they imposed a moratorium on commercial and sport catches on all
abalone species found south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although harvesting was banned, the white abalone has not
rebounded, marine biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Overfishing has reduced the density of the population, making
reproduction practically nil for the slow-growing gastropods, which
have a life span of 30 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both male and female abalone are broadcast spawners, meaning
they release their eggs and sperm into the water to make contact by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be within a few yards of each other to have
successful fertilization,'' McCormick said. ``If they are spaced in
order of 1 to 1 miles apart, in most cases these animals won't
successfully reproduce because they are so far apart. So they will
die of old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Abalone move slowly on a single foot along the ocean bottom, and
adults have extremely limited movements. With its single, flattened
spiral shell, the species averages five to eight inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Research in the 1970s showed a potential of one white abalone
per square meter in its natural habitat - today it's maybe five
abalone per hectare or 10,000 square meters, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Locations such as San Clemente, Catalina Island and Anacapa
Island, where the greatest number of white abalone was removed in
the 1970s, were surveyed last fall with disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 157 in 10 days of looking,'' said Dan Richards, a
marine biologist at Channel Islands National Park. ``That is not
very good. Seventy hours of prime time searching over really good
habitat - and that was all we could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Although human consumption is largely to blame for the white
abalone's demise, some experts said a bacterial infection also
could have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Withering syndrome, which shrivels the abalone in its shell, has
decimated 99 percent of the black abalone, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   First detected in the late 1980s in Southern California waters,
the syndrome is moving north and has reached Point Conception, in
Santa Barbara County, he said. The syndrome, which affects the
abalone's digestive glands, also has been found in pink, red, green
and white abalone.

PROJECT SEEKS TO BREED WHITE ABALONE FOR RELEASE

   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ At the dead-end of Hueneme Road, on the
edge of Port Hueneme Harbor, a nonprofit institution is gearing up
for its role in breeding a sea snail that is facing extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The Channel Islands Marine Resource Institute is part of a group
of public and private entities that have come together to form the
White Abalone Restoration Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use techniques that have been in existence for almost
a half-century to breed abalone,'' institute Director Tom McCormick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been used successfully on green, pink, red and black, so
we will modify those spawning conditions and rearing for the white
abalone to get them to spawn for us in captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute has built two self-contained systems that mimic
the habitat of the white abalone. The systems each have six tanks
able to house up to 10 abalone.
</P>
<P>
   The white abalone can thrive in shallow water but is typically
found in the deep, where temperatures stay below 60 degrees and
they are sheltered from predators, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Abalone reproduces by releasing millions of eggs or sperm into
the water, where they make contact by chance. After the fertilized
eggs hatch, the larvae spin around for a week - each the size of a
grain of sand, McCormick said. They then settle down and begin to
feed on algae.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love to eat for the first six, eight, 10 months of
life,'' McCormick said. ``These abalone, we hope will be grown up
to the size of three to four inches - adult size - and they they
will be released into the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said the goal is to release 10,000 abalone a year back
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is one of several labs along the California
coastline that will participate in the breeding program.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of nine white abalone were transported to the
University of California, Santa Barbara, and the next batch is
destined for the institute. McCormick said he expects to hear any
day now that a collection is arriving.
</P>
<P>
   The abalone at UC Santa Barbara are in quarantine, undergoing
treatment with antibiotics in case they have withering syndrome, a
bacterial infection that has decimated the black abalone, said Dan
Richards, marine biologist at the Channel Islands National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to collect as many as we can,'' Richards
said. ``The plan is to breed them in captivity like the condors and
eventually raise them up to a reasonable size so they can survive
for the first couple of years''
</P>
<P>
   It will take four years for the abalone to reach adulthood
before they can be released, said Ian Taniguchi, marine biologist
with the California Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot that we know about the (white
abalone's) life history,'' he said. ``Part of what we are doing is
figuring out the husbandry, how to keep white abalone in captivity,
and also learn about the reproductive process.''
</P>
<P>
   Taniguchi said another technique is to bring the adults closer
together in the wild - within a meter - on protective reefs so they
can reproduce. Over-consumption in the early 1970s has thinned the
density of the population, making it hard for their released eggs
and sperm to make contact.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCormick said it would take decades to bring the
species back to a sizable number, Richards estimated if all the
facilities are in operation and enough funding is available it
would take $10million over 10 years to get a healthy population
back in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to give them that boost or they are not going
to make it,'' Richards said. ``They are too few and far in between
right now.''

<P>
   DOVER, England _ This was once a quiet port town famous above
all for its white cliffs. It is now notorious for the corpses of 58
Chinese immigrants that lie, unclaimed and unnamed, in
refrigerators normally used for meat shipments _ and for the likes
of Tara Muhammad roaming its streets.
</P>
<P>
   Like the desperate Chinese travelers found dead here on June 19
in an airtight container, Muhammad entered Britain in June
concealed in the rear of a truck. From his native town of Kirkuk in
Iraq, he walked into Iran. From Iran into Turkey, five days on
foot, moving at night. A 24-hour bus ride to Istanbul, Turkey,
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went to a parking place for trucks,'' Muhammad, 22,
said. ``And I found this man and I told him, `I want to go to
Europa. Yes, anywhere in Europa.' And he said, `OK, no problem.'''
After paying $4,000 in cash, changing trucks three times and
traveling for 11 days, Muhammad reached Dover, where he requested
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europa,'' the old continent, persistent source of hordes of
migrants to the New World, has become the ersatz United States of
modern asylum-seekers. Where just 30,000 people applied for asylum
in America last year, down from 127,000 in 1993, more than 365,000
did so in the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is troubling to a Europe that tends to see more
problems than promise in alien blood. But its causes are not about
to disappear. The collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up new
land routes to Europe from Asia and turned once-closed cities like
Moscow and Kiev into nodal points of migrant travel from
Afghanistan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly well-organized criminal groups trading in human
freight _ a less risky but scarcely less lucrative commodity than
drugs _ have emerged to coordinate smuggled passages into a Europe
largely closed to legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties are far less severe than for drugs, the up-front
investment much smaller, and the evidence has legs and tends to run
away,'' explained Brunson McKinley, the director general of the
International Organization for Migration.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is also relatively cheap. Tan Wah Piow, a London lawyer
close to the Chinese immigrant community, put the cost of being
brought to Europe from China at $25,000, perhaps half the cost of
transport to America. ``People have turned from the United States
as it is more difficult to get into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On his desk sits a fax from China. It shows a blurred photograph
of a young man. His name is Lin Liguan. He weighs 136 pounds. He
was born on Nov. 30, 1979. He comes from China's southern Fujian
province and, a few months back, he departed for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The message pleads: Do you know where my son is? Could he be
among the dead in Dover? Can you help us? Tan points angrily at the
paper. ``It is good for China to join the World Trade Organization
because we support the free movement of global capital,'' he said.
``But what about the free movement of labor?''
</P>
<P>
   What indeed. Think of the anonymous Dover dead, piles of flesh
unclaimed by any relative because those relatives may themselves be
in Europe illegally and fear deportation, as so many units in a
grim global equation.
</P>
<P>
   The richest fifth of mankind earns 86 percent of the world's
income while the poorest fifth earns 1 percent. The riches are ever
more visible through global communications; options for travel are
ever greater; millions of sealed containers make an ever growing
exchange of goods even easier.
</P>
<P>
   So an opulent Europe, even one with high unemployment, glimmers
as a land of opportunity. More than 70 million migrants are thought
to be on the move at any one time. And, Europe looks accessible to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has now eliminated most internal borders,
making Athens, Greece, to Amsterdam, Netherlands, a passport-free
passage, but the pan-European police force to control a growing
flux of people scarcely exists. Europol, the fledgling FBI of a
united Europe, has all of 220 employees in its Dutch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this ``Europa'' is profoundly uneasy at its emergent role of
magnet to the world's dispossessed. Unlike America, no mythology
exhorts the embrace of ``your tired, your poor, your huddled
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the national psyches of Spain, Italy, Greece and Ireland
are shaped by tales of emigration. Even a country like Germany,
whose population is now 9 percent foreign, remains agonized over
whether it can become ``a land of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep sense that we are full up, that we have no
room, and that we are being exploited,'' said John Salt, a
migration expert at London University. ``No European country has
voted for a multicultural society, or thought of itself as such,
yet now we are all told we live in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Dover looks like one. Many of the bed-and-breakfasts
have been converted into impromptu hostels for asylum-seekers.
Signs advertise English lessons given by speakers of Czech, Slovak,
Russian, Polish, German, Finnish, Kurdish, Arabic, Turkish, Farsi,
Pashto and Urdu.
</P>
<P>
   In this world, six days into his English existence, Muhammad of
Kirkuk, Iraq, makes his way. Installed in Room 12 of one hostel,
proud possessor of the upper bed on a bunk, he has a television to
gaze at and is given three meals a day. ``I don't need money at the
moment,'' he said. ``Money for what?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the British government, responding to growing
criticism of ``phony'' asylum-seekers, cut back on benefits. But
the likes of Muhammad are still given enough for basic needs
pending a decision on their status.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the care-worn citizens of this once-proud port
now cursed by association with a problem the government seems
unable to deal with?'' thundered the Dover Express in a front-page
``Editorial Comment'' three days after the Chinese corpses were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Such exasperation is driving European attempts to make borders
less penetrable and, in countries from Denmark to Switzerland,
fueling a revival of rightist and nationalist parties symbolized by
the success of Joerg Haider's party entering the Austrian
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, the government wants to be seen as tough,'' said
Annie Ledger, the chief executive of Migrant Helpline, a
state-financed charity handling registration of 1,000
asylum-seekers a month in Dover. ``But personally I don't believe
we are so generous that people leave countries thousands of miles
away in search of our handouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is not what drove Wu Xueping, who left Fujian
province in April after paying $25,000 to the smugglers who
provided him with a fake passport.
</P>
<P>
   His journey to London, he said, initially took him by plane to
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. (China has close relations with Slobodan
Milosevic's Yugoslavia.) From there, he traveled by bus to Hungary,
then on into the Czech Republic, before entering the European Union
by crossing the mountains into Germany on foot _ a three-day hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Germany, we were taken to Belgium, where we were locked
in a small room in a house for about a month and fed on bread and
water,'' he said. ``Then I was put into the back of a truck with
eight other people, arriving in England on May 17.'' Wu, who has a
wife and 9-year-old child back in Fujian Province, said that, as a
member of the Falun Gong group banned last year, he had been
persecuted in China. But the reality is that economic and political
motives blur when seeking a better life in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week's pay here can support a family for two or three
months in China,'' said Chew Beng Lan, a lawyer in London. ``I know
one girl working in a restaurant in Chinatown who told me one year
worked here was equivalent to eight at home.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The pattern in Chinese immigration is now clear: Families pool
resources and borrow money to finance the dispatch of one member,
who then helps others come. Debts to the people smugglers are paid
off over three to seven years, when other relatives follow. Money
is earned mainly in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Working long hours, six days a week, an immigrant can earn as
much as $2,400 a month in London, Chew said. The immigrants, who
have destroyed any documents in order to make removal back to China
more difficult, live in a protracted limbo, working illegally or
with temporary papers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dream of just such an existence that prompted 60
Chinese to take their places beside cartons of tomatoes in a sealed
container in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on June 18. How they reached
Europe's largest port, transit point for 6.5 million containers a
year, remains uncertain, but the Dutch police say they believe that
they traveled overland through Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Wim de Bruin, a judicial official, said a Rotterdam warehouse
had now been identified as the place where the would-be immigrants
boarded the stifling truck and a ring of eight people suspected of
involvement in the human smuggling have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture of the crime fits the pattern of adaptable
criminal networks that the police say now run an international
business in illicit human cargo that turns over at least $3 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals, often from the so-called ``source countries,''
interact with local ``amateurs'' recruited ad hoc to act as
couriers. The operations are often hard to penetrate because of
language difficulties and the very closed nature of Chinese,
Albanian or other gangs engaged in trafficking, said Bjorn
Clarberg, a Swedish police officer who specializes in illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   This particular tragedy began in the unlikeliest of places: A
leafy Rotterdam suburb where Arie van der Spek, 24, lived in a
small apartment with his parents above the Piet Hordijk bicycle
store. The young man had a small decorating company but was
struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet, a bit naive, and there were rumors that he had
got involved in gambling,'' said Dennis Hordijk, 32, his neighbor.
``But like his parents, who have now moved away for a while, I was
incredulous at what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy Bruggeman, the deputy director of Europol, based in The
Hague, Netherlands, suggested that van der Spek, who has been
arrested, probably became a front man for Chinese operators after
incurring gambling debts in Chinese circles. To pay them off, the
police theorize, van der Spek agreed to establish the ``transport
company'' he registered three days before the truck departed for
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Perry Wacker, also of Rotterdam, may have met van
der Spek in the same gambling circles, the police said. Wacker has
been charged with 58 counts of manslaughter in Britain. Just two of
the people in his truck survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such cases, the owner of the truck company and the driver
may be paid a total $750 per person,'' said Poel van der
Molen-Maesen, a Dutch prosecutor. ``That is a lot of money. But the
people who have contracted them are getting much more.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of trafficking is happening on a very large scale. In
May, Dutch authorities found a Czech van at the German-Dutch border
``with 20 people from China sitting in back surrounded by their own
excrement,'' said Geert Pieglage of the defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, on board a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium, 50
desperate Chinese immigrants were let out of the back of a truck
after hammering on the sides of its sealed container, said Peter
Hillman, a spokesman for the British Home Office. They are now in
Britain as asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure fueling migration is such that European
governments will not be able to control this movement,'' said Salt
of London University. ``Their best strategy is try to manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dover deaths have spurred renewed talk of a coordinated
immigration strategy across Europe and of the possibility of
following Canada and the United States in permitting more legal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe does need workers in certain areas, so why not put
policy together in a way that takes the wind out of the sails of
the traffickers?'' said McKinley of the International Organization
for Migration.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current European political climate, making more
immigration legal will be arduous. Muhammad, who says he was
persecuted by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein but declines to say
how, has an engagingly open smile. His ambition is simple and
apparently inoffensive: ``To live in England just like English
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, among those who cause the resentments that led
to a pitched battle in Dover last year between rightist youths and
immigrants. Bruggeman of Europol was blunt: ``There is a problem of
saturation in Europe,'' he said. ``The differences between rich and
poor countries are such that people are going to move and we cannot
stop them. But open borders amounts to mission impossible.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The past hangs heavy over Mexico's people and
politics, but rarely has a moment seemed so pregnant with history
as the presidential balloting scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will choose either to bring down the curtain on a dynasty
that has governed since the Mexican revolution or, almost as
extraordinary, to inaugurate a new century by freely electing the
party that dominated most of the last one.
</P>
<P>
   Either result would usher in a period of some uncertainty. The
leading opposition candidate, Vicente Fox, pledged to govern with
caution if elected, but his victory would shatter an elite tied to
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. A new
triumph by the party that has won 13 consecutive presidential
elections would outrage many in the educated and middle classes,
with potentially volatile consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the decades, the PRI created an atmosphere of eternal
victory,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet and former ambassador. ``But
now the opposition has shown that defeat of the official party is
possible. Mexico has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rancorous presidential campaign that culminates with
Sunday's balloting, the country abandoned a series of authoritarian
traditions stretching back half a century. And in characteristic
fashion, even as Mexicans lived a thrilling period of democratic
innovation, they often debated their own history as fervently as
their strategies for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of the past has sometimes been more present than
the present itself,'' the author Enrique Krauze once wrote of
Mexicans' singular preoccupation with history's legacy, the
crucible of conquest and colonialism, reform and revolution that
forged their modern outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed true during much of the campaign, as the major
candidates and their supporters restaged Mexico's battles and
betrayals. Yet at the end of the grand debate, all Mexico seemed to
grasp the momentous nature of the choice at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is the culmination of struggles, initiatives and
sacrifices stretching throughout our entire history,'' Porfirio
Munoz Ledo, who ended his candidacy in June to endorse Fox,
thundered the week before last. ``Never, since we became an
independent nation, has power passed peacefully from one party to
another through elections. This vote is a watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the balloting, voters will elect a president for a six-year
term, 500 congressional deputies, 128 senators, two state governors
and the mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In a final opinion poll published by the newspaper Reforma on
June 22, the governing party candidate, Francisco Labastida, was
favored by 42 percent of voters, Fox of the center-right National
Action Party by 39 percent, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist
candidate, by 16 percent. The margin of error was 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those results showed how Mexico's opposition forces have grown
into a broad majority, but their division between two major
candidates could bring a new governing-party triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has a rich tradition of electoral fraud, but safeguards
put in place by the autonomous federal agency organizing the
election have greatly reduced the possibility for chicanery. One or
more opposition parties are expected to be represented at the vast
majority, if not all, of the 113,000 voting places.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it had authorized 860 foreigners to visit
Mexico to observe the voting. Jimmy Carter is here, as are
delegations sent by the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, founded in 1929 as an alliance of rival factions within
the postrevolutionary army, long monopolized Mexican life. During
its first decades, the party put the nation's finances on a sound
footing, built thousands of schools and clinics, and raised living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic intellectuals opposed to the land reform and other
policies that they considered socialist formed the National Action
Party, known as the PAN, in 1938, and it has always been the most
important opposition party. But it remained a mere sect during its
first half-century. The governing party has won 13 consecutive
presidential elections, usually by sweeping margins and four times
by alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, amid recurrent economic crises and
revelations of party corruption, opposition strength has grown.
Even in the last presidential balloting in 1994, however, the
party's candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, received nearly twice as many
votes as the National Action Party nominee, who came in second.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has mounted the opposition's fiercest assault,
galvanizing support among millions of voters beyond his own party.
Announcing his candidacy three years ago, he rewrote the political
calendar in which no campaigning ever began before the sitting
president had handpicked his successor.
</P>
<P>
   His audacity forced Zedillo and his party to organize the PRI's
first presidential primary, holding candidate debates and placing
new emphasis on television campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, Fox has changed Mexican politics forever,'' said
Federico Estevez, a political scientist. ``His candidacy forced the
ruling party to open up the process, bringing elite politics down
to the level of the masses. That's a huge change.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But throughout a campaign that moved Mexicans toward a more
modern presidential succession, the candidates frequently invited
them to look over their shoulders, drawing contemporary lessons
from past struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, for instance, often dresses like an American cowboy, and
his mother was born in Spain. In television advertisements,
Labastida stoked Mexicans' lingering bitterness over the Spanish
conquest and an 1847 American invasion in which Mexico lost
territories from Texas to Oregon, and he derided Fox as a man with
foreign roots and treasonous tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida reached back across 65 years of history to portray
himself as an heir to President Lazaro Cardenas del Rio,
Cuauhtemoc's father, who ruled with great popularity during the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who created our Social Security system?'' Labastida bellowed
during a rally the other day. ``Who expropriated the petroleum? Was
it a Martian, the PAN or was it one of our PRI presidents?''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Labastida cranked up his party's machinery,
enlisting the aid of 21 PRI state governors and a string of his
party's hoariest leaders, men associated with illicit fortunes and
election fraud. They carried out a nationwide campaign to dispense
taxpayer-financed giveaways to poor voters, often in exchange for
written vote pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics may have helped Fox to persuade some undecided
voters to adopt his view that in recent times the PRI governments
acted as corrupt stewards while workers' real income plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans have been the great losers of the 20th century,'' Fox
said in a televised debate in April.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, in another broadcast encounter with his rivals, he
portrayed himself as the champion of Mexico's democratic movement,
which has built since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road has been long and difficult,'' Fox said. ``We're
arriving at our goal, thanks to millions of Mexicans who have
confronted PRI authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's campaign to draw votes from across the political spectrum
seemed to be snowballing until May, when a letter in which Fox
courted the support of the Roman Catholic bishops stirred
anti-clerical animosities dating from the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust of the church smolders because of its often exploitive
role during colonial rule; it was the largest banker until
19th-century reform laws expropriated ecclesiastical properties.
Every president since Benito Juarez has come from a party with a
strong anti-clerical streak. Fox, in contrast, is an
unapologetically devout Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox wins, it will be the first time a party linked to the
church has assumed power in Mexico since the 1850s,'' said
Friedrich Katz, a historian at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest obstacle to Fox's attempt to unite the
opposition against the PRI was Cardenas, who broke with his
father's party in 1987 and lost his own presidential challenge the
next year, many believe through fraud. He finished last among the
major candidates in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent intellectuals sought to negotiate an alliance between
Fox and Cardenas last fall, but the effort collapsed because
neither man would relinquish his own candidacy. Fox has since
insisted that a vote for Cardenas is a vote wasted.
</P>
<P>
   That argument posed a powerful quandary for the left. Some from
Cardenas' party, and even a handful of former Communists, endorsed
Fox, declaring that since the fall of the Berlin Wall their desire
to oust the governing party had come to outweigh ideological
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas and most of his supporters spurned Fox's unity
pleas. Some cited Fox's 1996 proposal to privatize Pemex, the
state-owned oil company, an icon of Mexican nationalism ever since
Lazaro Cardenas expropriated the oil fields from Standard Oil in
1938.
</P>
<P>
   Others looked further back, across centuries, to conclude that
despite their current disgust with corruption, they had more in
common with the PRI than with Fox and his conservative associates.
</P>
<P>
   In a final campaign speech, Amalia Garcia, the historian who is
the president of Cardenas' party, outlined Mexico's national
development as a struggle between conservative traitors like Fox
and a line of heroic, modernizing leaders including Benito Juarez,
Lazaro Cardenas and his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the dawn of our independence, our nation has been in
conflict over two great visions,'' Garcia said. ``We're living the
same historic dispute again today.''

<P>
   MOUNTAIN, N.D. _ From above, the state of North Dakota is a
quilt of wheat and prairie grass stitched by rows of cottonwood,
ash and elm trees, two-lane roads, many dirt, and railroad tracks.
Every seven or eight miles beyond the few big cities, the tracks
link 100-foot-tall, century-old clapboard or galvanized metal grain
elevators. Alongside the elevators are towns, laid out in five or
10-block grids, and beyond, farms and ranches.
</P>
<P>
   But little moves down there. In every second or third town along
these tracks, the school, the city hall, the elevator, the bank,
the American Legion Hall, the farm tool dealer, the general store
of the '30s and the convenience store of the '80s, birds are the
only tenants. In many of these communities, only a bar and a church
hang on, along with a few homeowners who are too old, too poor or
too proud to move, or who simply prefer the solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Like towns of the West that turned to shells once they were
stripped of their gold, new ghost towns are sprouting over much of
the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota and well beyond, across thousands of old rural
towns in the broad belly of the Plains from Eastern Montana and
Western Minnesota and the Canadian border down through Nebraska
into Kansas and Oklahoma, the nation's long run of growth and
prosperity has blown right by.
</P>
<P>
   The contraction is most pronounced in North Dakota, one of only
three states, with Connecticut and Rhode Island, to lose population
in the '90s. In Ardoch, N.D., population 49, the city hall is
padlocked, its windows boarded, its electricity meter still, its
clapboard facade unpainted for decades. The bar closed a year or
two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Headstones in the cemetery commemorate Yankee settlers until the
early 1900s, when the harsh climate chased the survivors west.
Newer headstones mark the deaths of Polish settlers and their heirs
until the 1990s. The Poles, too, have moved on. Ardoch's only new
inhabitants are sugar beet workers from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Pisek, a largely Czech town with 113 people, 17 fewer than in
1990, the bank is no bigger than a one-car garage. A notice on the
door, posted a year ago, announces new hours. It is open Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. The Jelinek family's
general store survives, though it loses money and has stopped
selling clothing and shoes. ``Just your older people reside in
these small towns,'' said Elaine Swartz, the assistant postmaster.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains for Warsaw's 40 or 50 citizens, descendants of
Polish immigrants, is the one bar, Tork's Polski Dom, and at the
corner of two county roads, the surreal 100-year-old St. Stanislaus
Roman Catholic Church, an opulent red-brick, gothic edifice with a
143-foot spire, a gilded cross on top. Visible for miles, it rises
from the prairie like a cathedral, taller than any tree or grain
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The church can seat 700, and once it did. ``We're holding our
own at 345 parishioners,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Damian Hils,
but only because he draws them from as far as Fargo, 110 miles to
the south. He worries about more losses. ``Almost all my
parishioners are farmers,'' he said, ``and some have had to sell
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many western Plains communities, in Colorado,
Nevada and Utah, are bustling with the fervor of Silicon Valley.
Towns outside growing cities are reawakening as they join the
transition to the next ring of suburbs. Still other once-sinking
towns along major highways, like Interstate 80 that slices east and
west through Nebraska, have revived with convenience stores, gas
stations, motels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But the population of the core Plains states of Iowa, Nebraska,
Kansas, Oklahoma and the Dakotas, grew at half the 9.6 percent
increase of the nation as a whole in the 1990s. Growth of most
cities far exceeded state averages while the rural population
shrank.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals in many of these towns outnumber baptisms two to one.
Accelerating a process that started decades ago with the
mechanization of farming and the depletion of oil fields and mines,
the livelier economy elsewhere has shunned investment in the towns
and drained off the young to jobs and opportunity in Omaha, Fargo
and Pierre and beyond, to Denver and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sorting out going on,'' said Alan Barkema,
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., and at
the bank's Center for the Study of Rural America. ``Across a vast
sweep of the heartland, rural communities are not keeping up. The
sad truth of the matter is that some are not going to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In hardest hit North Dakota, which lost 5,000 people in the
'90s, to 634,000, visits to a score of communities in the
northeastern corner yield stubborn survivors and inspired boosters.
For $1 each and two years free of local taxes, the city of Minto
(population 560 in 1990 and 519 in 1998) is selling 90-by-150-foot
housing lots that a developer abandoned provided buyers put homes
on them within a year. Six of about 40 lots are left.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the four-county area, only the city of Grafton
grew, about 5 percent to 5,117, from 1990 to 1998. In North Dakota,
said Curtis Stofferahn, a rural sociologist at the University of
North Dakota in Grand Forks, ``There's a real concern that we're
probably seeing the last generation on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nelson County, one of four counties in the northeastern area
and 45 miles west of Grand Forks, the population shrank 17 percent
in the '90s, and more would be gone were it not for federal
largess. Last year, the North Dakota State Data Center at North
Dakota State University in Fargo reports, the government dispensed
$11,858 per capita in Nelson County, $6,246 above the national
average, for defense, farm, flood, retirement and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   One worn-out Nelson County town is Whitman, population 89 in
1998 and 63 in 1990. Whitman looks crisp and orderly, with the 10
or 15 homes of Norwegian descendants with small gardens and
weed-free lawns. But unpaved Main Street is dead. Silent at one end
stands the old gray elevator. On one side of the street is an open
lot, long cleared of its stores. On the other is an abandoned
one-truck firehouse and a shut-down strip of three weathered,
one-story shops.
</P>
<P>
   Just up from Main Street, a high-spirited yellow dog, the only
creature in view one afternoon, guards a one-story brick structure,
the Whitman Community Center. A window has been broken, and inside,
ceiling tiles rot in puddles on a linoleum floor. Across a dirt
path from the center is Sarnia United Lutheran Church, immaculate
and white.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Skjervem, 75, a retired farmer whose Norwegian immigrant
grandfather settled in Whitman in the 1880s, said the community
center shut down about four years ago, the elevator eight years
ago, the school 10 years ago and long before that four bars and two
general stores. He cannot buy anything close by any more.
``Everything gets to be farther away all the time,'' Skjervem said.
``The need isn't there for these towns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Skjervem (pronounced SHER-vem) can still go to the church. A
sign out front says that Pastor Sue Mackey performs a service there
three of four Sundays a month. From 1992 through last year, its
annual report shows, the church buried 11 members and christened
four. Twelve people attend services now, he said, compared with 35
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The towns' demise matters, their advocates say. With safe
streets, dawn-to-dusk work, and large and stable, church-going
families, they became a model of the American self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are who we are,'' said Bonnie Turner, director of a
Lutheran organization in Grand Forks that counsels the rural poor
and distributes food boxes. ``And they're blowing to dust.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even now, says Hils in Warsaw, ``the kids have a wholesomeness
about them, a goodness. They invite us to the prom. You know they
wouldn't do that if they were up to anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   They are healthy places, too. In predominantly rural North
Dakota, the Department of Health and Human Services reports, 63
percent of people 85 and older can still get around and take care
of themselves, the highest level in the nation. North Dakotans also
have a lower incidence of the nine leading causes of death than the
national averages, with one exception _ suicide.
</P>
<P>
   What growth there has been in North Dakota has been almost
entirely confined to Fargo and Bismarck. All but six of the state's
53 counties lost population in the 1990s, Census Bureau and state
estimates show, and five counties lost more than a fifth of their
people.
</P>
<P>
   The decline feeds on itself, said Richard Rathge, director of
the state data center. ``It reduces your potential for renewal,''
he said. Faster cars let people bypass Main Street to shop at
far-off discount stores. Better roads and buses let counties close
schools and whisk children out of town to consolidated schools
farther and farther away.
</P>
<P>
   The state's widely scattered population, with fewer than five
people per square mile in 26 counties, makes it all the harder to
rally local economies the usual way, by courting employers with
assurances of work forces.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, communities have invested in telecommunications
to help new businesses exploit the Internet. But the tide of
decline is overpowering. ``Most people recognize what is going
on,'' Rathge said. ``The frustration is how you deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well to the north of Nelson County, against the borders of
Minnesota and Canada, is Pembina County and this village of
Mountain, where the population has slipped from 134 a decade ago to
about 120, including 40 residents of the town's only new
institution, a home for the elderly. Mountain is and remains
entirely Icelandic, the largest Icelandic settlement outside
Iceland. Headstones outside the still-vibrant Vikur Lutheran Church
bear names inscribed in Icelandic.
</P>
<P>
   After Gene Gudmundson, 50, finished Macalester College in St.
Paul, Minn., he resurrected his father's and homesteader
grandfather's farm in Mountain, bought more land and raised wheat,
barley, pinto beans and sunflowers on 990 acres. He and his wife,
Helen, 42, a contract administrator at the Cavalier Air Force
Station, built a home in 1978, expanded it six years ago and have
four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But buffeted by debt, the lowest wheat prices in 30 years and
seven years of ruinous drought and floods, the Gudmundsons are
considering leaving Mountain for new jobs once their two younger
daughters, now teen-agers, finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   In the dreary, daylong drizzle of a few days ago, they auctioned
off their farm gear _ plows, swathers, cultivators, combines,
planters, herbicide tanks, loaders, five tractors and six trucks.
``You get tired,'' Gudmundson said. ``It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Gudmundsons' neighbors, Leslie and Delores Geir own
1,000 acres where Leslie Geir's great-grandfather began with the
160 he was given under the Homestead Act. They have two girls,
Diane, 16, and Laura, 10, and a son, Chris, 15. To make ends meet,
Delores Geir is an aide in the home for the elderly, and Diane
works there part time.
</P>
<P>
   All the Geirs still have hope. Chris intends to be a farmer, and
Diane hopes to settle on a farm. ``There is no better place to
raise a family,'' said Leslie Geir, 47. ``When my kids were
little,'' Delores Geir said, ``I could let them play alone outside.
The dog would stay with them. I would call the dog to find out
where they were.''
</P>
<P>
   But the inertia of decline has begun to intrude. Leslie Geir
went to school in Mountain, and there were 10 kids in his class. As
the population fell, the school was closed and students were sent
by bus to school in Edinburg, 16 miles to the south. With further
decline, that school, too might go. ``Laura had seven kids in her
fourth grade class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mountain, the forces of decline have chased away the
optimistic spirit of America. ``The future is pretty dim right
now,'' said the mayor of Mountain, S. Douglas Hanson, a gravel
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   Marabeth Hunter, the postmaster, said: ``We don't have anything
now. Just the one bar, the cafe that's open half days, the old
folks home and the church. I wish we had stores here, at least one.
You have to run 16 miles to get milk.''

10 JEWS CONVICTED BY IRANIAN COURT IN SPY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran _ A judge on Saturday convicted 10 of 13 Jewish men
accused by the Revolutionary Court of being spies, asserting that
their years of religious piety were a cover for espionage and
illegal aid to Iran's enemy, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ shopkeepers, Hebrew teachers, a part-time rabbi, an
English professor and an electrical utility official _ were
sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 13 years. Most were
convicted of being members of an illegal group, recruiting others
to join it and ``cooperating'' with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Two Muslim men convicted of aiding the spy ring were also
convicted and sentenced to two and four years. Two other Muslims,
arrested because they had dealings with some of the Jewish
defendants, were acquitted along with three Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely monitored by Western governments as an
indicator of Iran's adherence to international principles of
justice and human rights. Several European countries and the United
States have said that the conduct and outcome of the trial would
affect their future relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts, seen by Tehran-based diplomats as harsh, drew
immediate condemnation from Jewish groups and from Israel, which
has denied using the Iranians as spies.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
told the Reuters news agency that the outcome was ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a kangaroo proceeding,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations also had criticized the proceedings
as unfair, because the trials were held in secret and the
defendants were held for over 15 months without access to
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Esmail Naseri Mojarrad, the spokesman for the three-lawyer team
representing most defendants, said the court had not proved that
the men passed _ or even had access to _ classified information. He
said he would appeal the convictions if family members wished,
based on the absence of any evidence other than confessions of some
of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not guilty of collecting information, exactly what
kind of cooperation are they supposed to have given?'' Naseri
Mojarrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the defendants were paraded before cameras of the state
television channel during the hearings and made confessions that
were broadcast nationally. Defense lawyers complained that the
confessions, both off camera and on, were invalid because of the
length of detention and because their clients had no lawyers
present.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have gone to unusual lengths to defend their
handling of the case, denouncing the international attention as
interference in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare gesture, court officials read the 72-page decision of
the Revolutionary Court judge, Sadeq Nouri, to reporters and the
foreign diplomats who have monitored the trial since it began in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   The norm for the Revolutionary Court, which handles political
trials as well as drug-smuggling and national security matters, is
not to announce a verdict at all. Trials are secret, defendants
often do not have lawyers until the last minute and evidence is
never made public.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of the Shiraz Jews, court officials held public
briefings after each week of hearings and insisted that the closed
hearings were justified because national security was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Ali Amiri, the head of the provincial judiciary in
Shiraz, said each defendant had faced five separate charges
relating to spying, each carrying a possible sentence of 10 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The men could have also been charged with a special count in
Iran's Islamic penal code _ acting against God _ that carries the
death penalty. But the judge, who also acted as the prosecutor,
decided against that charge, Amiri said.
</P>
<P>
   While the case has traumatized Iran's Jews, a dwindling
population of about 30,000, it has not reverberated through the
country as a whole. Iranians have been absorbed, instead, in the
political battles between reformers allied with President Mohammad
Khatami and religious conservatives who control the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has not commented on the trial except to assure foreign
visitors that it would be fair and the court would act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   But the convictions may have a tangible impact on Khatami's
attempts to create warmer relations with the West. The week before
last, a visit planned for July 4 by the British foreign minister,
Robin Cook, was abruptly canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In just over a week, Khatami is scheduled to make a long-delayed
trip to Germany. The European Union is expected to make a statement
about the spy trial, and the fate of that visit is not clear.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on Saturday gave few details of the activities that
the convicted men were supposed to have conducted on behalf of
Israel. But it did indicate that Jews in Iran have been monitored
by intelligence agents for many years, even though investigation in
this case was said to have begun only in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's long narrative accused the Jewish men of working for
Israel for over 20 years, since before the Islamic revolution that
overthrew the shah in 1979. It said the espionage group began under
the tutelage of a Shiraz rabbi identified only as Itzhak, who
passed information to Israel's secret service, Mossad, by telephone
and fax and through Iranians traveling outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some Shiraz Jews, who said they were afraid now to speak
publicly, said that Itzhak is their former rabbi, Itzhak
Balalaness, who emigrated to the United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Balalaness, they said, was a charismatic figure who helped
revitalize Jewish life in Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men convicted in the spy case were quoted in the
judge's report about the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   One, Farhad Seleh, was reported to have said: ``He created love
for Israel in our hearts. He used to say that serving Israel was
like serving Torah and that in our Jewish books it says that we
should move before others move against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranian Jews have relatives in Israel and visit them,
although Iran does not recognize Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defendants were quoted in the judge's report as
saying that they had collected information about the location of
military bases and information about Iran's politics, culture and
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The group was also accused by the judge of being ``a cause in
the war between Iran and Iraq.'' One of the men convicted of
providing information about the war was only 17 years old when it
ended 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted Jewish men are: Asher Farzadmehr, 51, sentenced to
13 years in prison; Nasser Levi-Haim, 52, sentenced to 11 years;
Seleh, 41, sentenced to eight years; Javid Bent-Yakub, 43,
sentenced to nine years; Shahrok Paknahad, 30, sentenced to eight
years; Hamid ``Dani'' Tefileen, 31, sentenced to 13 years; Farzad
Kashi, 45, sentenced to eight years; Ramin Farzam, 31, sentenced to
10 years; Faramarz Kashi, 39, sentenced to five years; and Ramin
Nematizadeh, 27, sentenced to four years.
</P>
<P>
   The two Muslims convicted were Ali Akbar Safaee, sentenced to
two years for assisting the spy network, and Mehrab Yusefi,
sentenced to four years for assisting the network and cooperating
with Israel.

WALTER MATTHAU, 79, RUMPLED STAR WHO CREATED COMIC CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: optional sidebar at end)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Matthau, whose performances as cantankerous but endearing
characters made him a distinctive leading man in movies, theater
and television, died Saturday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Lindi Funston, a spokesman
for St. John's Health Center, where Matthau died.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's breakthrough role was as Oscar Madison, the slovenly
sportswriter in Neil Simon's 1965 Broadway comedy and 1968 film
``The Odd Couple.'' But that was only one of an extraordinarily
diverse galaxy of characters. In his long career he played lawyers,
editors, detectives, spies, sheriffs, even romantic leading men,
and each one of them looked and acted like Walter Matthau.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he played a comic version of Albert Einstein in the
movie ``IQ,'' and Einstein began to resemble the shaggy, shambling
actor. Although Matthau was an experienced stage actor, in common
with great film stars of the past like Spencer Tracy and Humphrey
Bogart, he created character through the magnetism of his own
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Simon credited Matthau's rumpled persona and ironic wit as being
the inspiration for Oscar, the nemesis of his fussy apartment-mate
and fellow dropout from marriage, Felix Unger (Art Carney on stage,
Jack Lemmon in the film). In his memoirs, the playwright said the
actor at first wanted to play Felix, in retrospect a mind-boggling
idea, but one that Matthau undoubtedly could have accomplished. He
was, said Simon, ``the greatest instinctive actor I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was a tall man with a perpetual slouch and a perpetual
frown. No matter how elegant his character was supposed to be, in
common with Oscar he usually looked as if he had been sleeping in
his clothes. But through a kind of reverse chic Matthau could make
himself seem stylish. Without airs or affectations, he became a
widely respected international star.
</P>
<P>
   Though he often played dramatic roles, comedy was his principal
metier. With his hangdog face and growling voice, he added humor to
his line readings. Dialogue that would not be so funny in print
became hilarious when delivered by Matthau. With perfect timing, he
was an expert at the slow burn, the double take, the explosion into
exasperation. ``Walter doesn't need funny lines,'' George Burns,
who starred with him in the movie of Simon's play ``The Sunshine
Boys,'' once said. ``He's fearless _ no inhibitions. If you want
him to play soprano, or be a toe dancer, he'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with Jack Lemmon that he became half of one of America's
favorite, if floating, comedy teams. In addition to ``The Odd
Couple,'' they were in three Billy Wilder comedies, ``The Fortune
Cookie,'' ``The Front Page'' and ``Buddy Buddy.'' The two aged
together before the camera until they were playing the twinned
title roles in ``Grumpy Old Men.'' In the sequel, they became
``Grumpier Old Men,'' and probably would have been on their way to
``Grumpiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was, Lemmon said, ``the most totally professional actor
I've ever worked with.'' And Wilder said, ``He knows how to get the
maximum out of everything. I wish I had him for my next 50
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau worked his way up from poverty on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan to varied roles in stock, more than 20 Broadway plays
(mostly flops) and scores of live television shows. He became,
successively, an adept movie villain and comedian and later,
improbably, a leading man.
</P>
<P>
   He was tireless in improvising fresh comic business to sharpen
and enhance plays and films, and in spinning perceptive
observations from commonplace events. With sly self-mockery, he
described his Hollywood image as a ``Ukrainian Cary Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Film portraits shaped by Matthau (pronounced MATH-ow) included a
tricky lawyer in ``The Fortune Cookie'' (a performance that earned
him a 1966 Academy Award as best supporting actor), an inept rake
in ``A Guide for the Married Man'' (1967), sly philanderers in
``The Secret Life of an American Wife'' (1968) and ``Cactus
Flower'' (1969), and three tour de force roles in Simon's ``Plaza
Suite'' (1971), as a callous husband, vulgar filmmaker and put-upon
father.
</P>
<P>
   He enlivened thrillers like Don Siegel's ``Charlie Varrick''
(1973) and ``The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' (1974), and he
played W.C. Fields-like child-detesters in ``The Bad News Bears''
(1976) and the 1979 remake of ``Little Miss Marker.'' Other
characters were a lugubrious editor in ``The Front Page'' (1974), a
henpecked assassin in ``Buddy Buddy'' (1981) and a crusty Supreme
Court justice in ``First Monday in October'' (1981). In 1993 he was
the beleaguered Mr. Wilson in ``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's personality also gleamed in bouts with other potent
personalities: Barbra Streisand in ``Hello, Dolly!'' (1969), Elaine
May in ``A New Leaf'' (1971), Carol Burnett in ``Pete 'n' Tillie''
(1972), Burns in ``The Sunshine Boys'' (1975), and Glenda Jackson
in ``House Calls'' (1978) and ``Hopscotch'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Comedy, Matthau said in 1981, should be shaped very seriously
and have an emotional foundation, evoke genuine laughter and then
provide some insight. Asked to compare stage and film acting, he
said: ``Theater is pure, while movies are bits and pieces. Right
now, I like acting in movies better because it's much easier, more
fun, though not as satisfying. Doing a play is like having a
seven-course meal, but a movie is like eating a lot of hors
d'oeuvres. You get filled up, but you're never quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few good stage actors,'' he continued, ``but
there are many good movie actors,'' partly because of efforts by
the director, the cameraman, the editor. ``On the stage, there are
no tricks, it's you.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Walter Matthau was born in New York City on Oct. 1, 1920, to
Milton Matuschanskayasky and the former Rose Berolsky, impoverished
Jewish immigrants. His father, from Russia, was an electrician
turned process server who abandoned the family when Walter was 3
years old and died 12 years later. Walter's mother, who was from
Lithuania, kept him and his elder brother, Henry, in a day nursery
while she worked as a sweatshop seamstress. The family moved often
because she could not pay the rent for their cold-water flats.
</P>
<P>
   Young Walter took refuge in acting, appearing in theatricals in
schools and settlement houses and reading Shakespeare nearly every
day. At 11, he started selling ice cream and soft drinks in the
Yiddish theaters on Second Avenue and, for an extra 50 cents a
show, did bit parts while studying the great Yiddish actors. At
Seward Park High School, he earned letters in six sports.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs after graduation included forestry in Montana in the
Civilian Conservation Corps and coaching boxing and basketball in
New York City. In World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps.
He served as a radio operator and cryptographer in Europe, rose to
staff sergeant and earned six battle stars.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Manhattan, he used his GI benefits to study at the New
School's Dramatic Workshop under the director, Erwin Piscator. He
later recounted the following exchange with Piscator:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Matthau, you say here every line wrong.' Another actor might
have been destroyed. I was destroyed for about 20 seconds. Then I
said, `Teach me how to say every line right.' One way and another,
I began to learn how to talk, how to look, how to walk _ how to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   In a summer stock production of ``Three Men on a Horse'' in
1946, he received what he considered to be the finest compliment. A
theatergoer told him he was the only one in the play he did not
like. ``The others looked like actors,'' he said. ``You just looked
like a poolroom bum.''
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Matthau was reflective and personable in
interviews, but he sometimes enlivened them with outrageous lies,
saying that his father had been a renegade, defrocked Orthodox
priest, and falsifying his training credentials, saying he had
studied at Oxford University, the Abbey Theater in Dublin and the
Moscow Art Theater.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he advanced from a candelabra carrier in ``Anne of
the Thousand Days'' (in 1948) to a bookish lover in ``The Ladies of
the Corridor,'' an urbane playwright in ``Will Success Spoil Rock
Hunter?'' and an exuberant impresario in ``Once More With
Feeling.'' In 1962 he won a Tony award for his performance as a
Parisian aristocrat in ``A Shot in the Dark,'' and three years
later won another Tony for ``The Odd Couple.''
</P>
<P>
   In acting, he used his intuition and his native intelligence
about people, especially those with eccentricities. ``You study the
character by living with him,'' he said. ``Even when you're
sleeping, you're developing the character. An actor shouldn't think
on the stage. He must only do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 Matthau suffered a severe heart attack that was brought
on, his doctor said, by heavy smoking, compulsive gambling and
insufficient exercise. The crisis created a reformed man: a
nonsmoker, a more moderate gambler (or so it was said) and a
dedicated walker.
</P>
<P>
   His obsession with gambling reached a low point early in his
career when he bet and lost $183,000 in only two weeks on
spring-training baseball games and scrimped for six years to pay
off the debt to an underworld loan shark. But his tendency to take
risks paid off later, when he reaped a fortune after opting to
receive percentages of film profits rather than salaries. He later
still placed bets, but relatively small ones, on race horses that
he owned with friends.
</P>
<P>
   He disliked jogging but became an avid walker, averaging 15
miles a week near his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. ``It makes
you ease up, if you have any sense,'' he said of the heart attack.
``It makes you think about what's important. I feel as though I've
been given a second life, one better than the old one.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifelong enthusiast of sports and classical music,
habitually playing records at home and tapes in his cars. In
contrast to the crotchety characters he generally played on screen,
he was known to friends and colleagues as one of the best-natured
of men. In later years, he made about one film a year, and when an
interviewer suggested in 1990 that he might be approaching
retirement, he replied sharply: ``That word is alien to my
vocabulary. Retire to what? I'm doing the work I like.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would not direct another film. His first and
last was a 1960 low-budget melodrama, ``Gangster Story.'' ``It was
one of the worst films ever made,'' he said with characteristic
candor, and then added, ``Let me put it another way: it was the
worst I ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   His son Charles became a movie director. In 1996 he made a film
of ``The Grass Harp,'' in which Walter Matthau played gentlemanly
Judge Cool and Jack Lemmon was a salesman. Matthau most recently
appeared in ``Hanging Up'' released in February and starring Diane
Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Matthau said his father approved his choice of career,
although he suggested that it would have been wiser for his son to
have a newsstand and ``find a husky woman who, at the end of a
day's work, can carry me home.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Charles, Matthau is survived by his wife, Carol,
and two children from a previous marriage, another son, David, and
a daughter, Jenny.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, Matthau starred opposite Ossie Davis in the film
version of Herb Gardner's play ``I'm Not Rappaport.'' The role had
been created on Broadway by Judd Hirsch and had been played in
London by Paul Scofield, but, as was often the case, once Matthau
played a character, he made it definitively his own. Not only did
the role seem written specifically for the actor, it also seemed as
if he might have been the real-life model: a stubborn old codger
who refused to surrender his independence, an irascible (but
lovable) survivor of all wars, political and domestic.

VERMONT LAW AUTHORIZING `CIVIL UNIONS' FOR GAY COUPLES TAKES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. _ From Burlington to Brattleboro, with
public hoopla or private solemnity, a scattering of gay couples
across Vermont became the first in the country Saturday to legally
take on all the rights and responsibilities of marriage, in the
first state to let them.
</P>
<P>
   On this, the day that Vermont's new law creating marriage-like
``civil unions'' officially came into effect, most town clerks were
closed for the weekend, so there could be no broad rush to the
almost-altar.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of clerks opened their offices in response to
requests from gay couples, very roughly estimated at perhaps two
dozen, from both in and out of state, who wanted to pay their $20
fee, sign their certificates and get all-but-married the moment
they could after years of unofficial union.
</P>
<P>
   For Lois Farnham and Holly Puterbaugh, who have been together
nearly 28 years and were plaintiffs in a 1997 suit against the
state that led to the civil unions law, such a moment was once so
unimaginable that ``The Impossible Dream'' was on the song list for
their private ceremony Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-seven-and-a-half years, that's a long engagement,''
Farnham said at the South Burlington municipal office, where the
couple received their license and a wet-eyed hug from the city
clerk, Margaret Picard. ``It's nice after all this time to say
Holly's my spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brattleboro, Carolyn Conrad, 29, and Kathleen Peterson, 41,
were so eager to get ``CU-ed'' that they went to the town clerk's
office at midnight and filled out the paperwork. Witnessed by a
cheering crowd of about 100 and a handful of protesters, they
exchanged vows before a justice of the peace minutes later outside
the town hall, making them the first in the country to be civilly
united (or ``civilly unionized,'' or ``unified,'' or maybe
``civilized'' _ there is still some confusion here over verbs,
couples say.)
</P>
<P>
   As eager as the couples were to unite, others are as eager to
see the outcome of all this civil joining. Opponents of civil
unions predict legal tangles when out-of-staters try to get their
Vermont civil unions recognized in their home state. Gay rights
advocates say they are eager to show that the sky will not fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same-sex couples will be forming civil unions, and the state's
not going to fall apart,'' said Beth Robinson, a lead lawyer in the
case that prompted the civil unions law. ``It's just going to be
better, and that's going to be the most helpful part of this
dialogue. Because the longer we go with the law in effect, the more
incredible the claims of our opponents will be exposed as being.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, although Saturday was mainly a day of joyful
celebration for uniting couples, the broader picture in this
pastoral state remains one of unusual turmoil _ particularly
turmoil centered on November's elections and the effect the civil
unions issue will have on them.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the state Supreme Court ruled last December that
denying gay couples the benefits of marriage amounted to
unconstitutional discrimination, the question of gay unions has
sundered the state, fanning atypical rancor. After months of
difficult debate, the Legislature passed a civil unions law in
April, and Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, promptly signed it. But
the turbulence continues on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   A few town clerks have said they would resign rather than issue
civil union certificates, though most appear willing to abide by
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm not sympathetic to people and their needs,
but I need to draw the line,'' said Gerry Longway, town clerk in
Fairfield since 1980 and one of those considering resignation. ``It
just doesn't seem right or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law are also suing to overturn it, claiming it
should be invalidated because as it was coming up for a vote in the
Legislature, several lawmakers placed small bets as to what the
margin would be. Their efforts to get a judge to block the law from
taking effect failed, but they say they plan to pursue their legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   They are also forming a variety of small groups with names like
``Who Would Have Thought'' and ``Standing Together and Reclaiming
the State'' to try to bring down lawmakers who voted for civil
unions in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some opponents have placed attack advertisements in
Vermont's newspapers, including a black-bordered full-page ad in
The Burlington Free Press on June 18 that denounced ``the
insufferable hubris of the narcissistic gay lobby that would place
personal pleasures before public order.'' It argued that it is
``probably no coincidence'' that financial markets began to slide
as the same-sex marriage debate got under way here in February.
</P>
<P>
   Because Vermont's procedure for referendums is so cumbersome,
few believe the civil unions law could be overturned that way; but
if the composition of the Legislature changes, there is a chance
that the new body could vote to alter the law. In that case, it
would be up to the state Supreme Court to decide whether the law
still complied with the court's ruling that gay couples must be
given the same benefits as straight couples.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of civil unions have started their own political
action committee, called Vermonters for Civil Unions, and plan to
continue efforts at public education about gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it is not clear what will happen when
out-of-staters get civilly united in Vermont and then ask their
home states to recognize the Vermont union. Some predict the issue
must inevitably make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Couples seeking civil unions must register with a town and have
their unions solemnized by a member of the clergy or justice of the
peace. Partners seeking to dissolve their unions must go through
the Family Court just as divorcing couples do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs of a nascent gay wedding industry in
Vermont _ nothing fancy or flashy, but little in this green state
of 600,000 ever is.
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site, www.gayweddingguide.com, offers everything from
a fledgling gift registry for gay couples to a selection of inns,
and the Web site of Vermont's gay newspaper, Out in the Mountains,
offers a list of justices of the peace who are friendly to civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Vermont wedding industry say they expect a surge
of civil unions in the coming days and weeks because of a
long-pent-up demand, but then expect gay couples to add only a
relatively small rise in the demand for quaint old inns and
florists. And even the current surge, they noted, is not as big as
it could be because so many wedding sites were already all booked
up for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Awodey, a justice of the peace in Burlington, said he was
booked for one civil union on Monday and three others in July, two
of them for out-of-state couples. He had heard of about 50 planned
for the coming week, and about two dozen to be performed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of unions were difficult, however:
Consider the spur-of-the-moment decision by Chuck Turner and Bill
Miller, lounge owners from New Orleans who have been together 29
years and had happened to be traveling in Canada in a motor home on
a long vacation with their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to dip down into Vermont on a quick break from
their itinerary, lined up a justice of the peace, stopped at a mall
for rings and showed up, mothers in tow, in the South Burlington
clerk's office Saturday morning for their union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Miller said, ``We finally get to send wedding
invitations to all those people who've been sending them to us for
30 years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio _ Dominique first heard the strange word
directly from her father four years ago, when she was 8 and he was
going away. But she did not grasp the meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy said `incarceration,''' recalled Dominique, who knows
the word well now that she has spent much of a week within the
confines of the prison that has kept her father, convicted of
violent assault, 300 miles from her.
</P>
<P>
   Nine convicts have been free to exchange hugs with their
children, some of them hesitantly at first, and to play and advise
and gaze upon them for four hours each morning last week. Sharing
thoughts and meals, they tested a program, as merciful as it is
experimental, to let 11 children and their imprisoned fathers
directly repair family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Small scenes of joy _ fathers and children making cutouts and
paintings together, laughing, embracing, finally airing difficult
problems, sometimes crying _ are hidden from society here in the
confines of the fathers' home behind bars and razor wire, which
they admitted to their children is known as ``the cage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cry when he first went away,'' Dominique said. ``But
Daddy would write me letters and tell me always do my homework.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his 6-year to 18-year sentence, her father,
Alonzo Thompson, found himself lying down hand-in-hand with
Dominique one morning on the floor of the Northeast Ohio
Correctional Center's visitors' room, where each father and child
had their own piece of silhouette paper on which to trace their
outlines for a life-size mural of their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my heart right there,'' Thompson said of his daughter
as she colored in fanciful details of the two of them and made the
fingers securely overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Their laughter never made it outside to this gray city of
burned-out steel mills. Youngstown is quietly becoming the prison
capital of a nation that, to use Dominique's hard-learned word, is
now the world leader in incarceration. Five prisons operate here
with about 40,000 inmates; two more are on the way. Many of the
prisoners are young fathers with plenty of time to ponder long
lists of regrets, with their children, often little known and less
seen, at the top of those lists.
</P>
<P>
   In this prison, there is even a class on being a parent for
clueless fathers. Jeanette Jenkins, a stalwart mother of six,
grandmother of seven and retired prison guard, fervidly teaches the
convicts that they still have the responsibility, and the power, to
inspire their far-off children along the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt when my boy goes back home, and I just may
cry, you know what I'm saying?'' admitted DeWayne Mixon, a hulking
32-year-old convict in his sixth year of a nine-year assault
sentence. His 9-year-old son, Diamond, nudged him as they painted
the record of themselves, together once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week spoiled me, but it tells me I got to put all the old
nonsense behind me and do the right thing,'' said Mixon, his face a
mask of paternal delight and worry. ``It's time to be a father, you
know what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   The parenting experiment originated with an inmates'-rights
volunteer, Carol Fennelly, who followed 1,300 inmates here when
they were moved three years ago from a condemned prison in Lorton,
Va., a Washington suburb. Now an overnight trip away from their
families, the inmates suffered a severe drop-off in family visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't care about prison inmates; there's not even
a debate any more about rehabilitation,'' said Fennelly, who
settled here and opened Hope House, a one-woman volunteer program
for which she is constantly seeking contributions. ``But people
care about children, so I thought maybe this way society will pay a
little more attention to the problems of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the pioneering children's programs for convicts at
the women's prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y., Fennelly did some
research and found that criminals behind bars who happened to be
fathers were of no special concern to anyone. She created a
teleconferencing hookup between here and two Washington churches
where fathers could see and talk with their offspring. Then she had
inmates read stories onto cassettes so their voices might soothe
their children back home.
</P>
<P>
   These programs, and the week of children's visits, might have
died as proposals in a typical state-run prison, Fennelly said. The
Northeast center is run by a private company, the Corrections Corp.
of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong family affection _ what these guys have to live for _
can get lost,'' Brian Gardner, the prison warden, said of the long
distance that discourages many families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a lot of her important years,'' Ricky Walker, a
36-year-old father doing seven to 21 years for second-degree
murder, said of his 13-year-old daughter, also named Dominique. ``I
last saw her when she was 9. I remember carrying her around on my
shoulders, and now look: She's a young lady who doesn't disrespect
no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique found the medium-security prison frightening when she
first approached it, but she forged ahead from clanging gate to
steel door, fulfilling her childhood mission. ``I missed him a lot
these years; we were so close before he left,'' she said,
remarking, as other youngsters also did, that the fathers had been
sternly lecturing their children on how to stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go back and do the same things I can't expect anyone to
come visit me, not if I forever play the fool,'' said Walker,
finding fresh resolve in his daughter's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Mixon looked up from his painting to beam upon the son
at his side. Lolling and smiling, the two might as well have been
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful, first time I've seen Diamond in five years,'' Mixon
said. ``It's taking the frustration out of me. I'm loving him, and
he knows where I'm at and why I'm here. I been telling him
wrongdoing gets you in prison, and don't follow in my footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boy never seemed more than hand-holding distance from
the man. Diamond happily sounded as if he had forgotten nothing
across the lost five years of his father's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have no beard when he left, and he bites his nails
now,'' Diamond said, smiling at his father.
</P>
<P>
   During this day's four-hour visit, the prison carried out its
required head count discreetly, with no lineup to demean the
fathers in front of their children. Their white prison uniforms
were daubed with some of the day's fun when Fennelly gathered the
children to leave. Diamond playfully resisted, even with the
promise of an afternoon swim waiting out in the world of the free.
</P>
<P>
   ``You going back in that cage with me?'' his father gently
growled, grateful for the gesture but surely knowing the answer.

COLOMBIAN GETS LIFT FROM U.S., BUT WOES PILE UP AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ He has just received a vote of confidence
from the United States in the form of $1.3 billion in emergency
military aid. But as President Andres Pastrana nears the midpoint
of his term, his standing at home is sinking, and even his
supporters fear that his position will continue to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to end decades of guerrilla war, Pastrana took office in
August 1998 with the highest vote total of any candidate in
Colombian history. But he has been steadily hurt by a lack of
progress in peace talks with the Marxist rebels, economic
recession, a crippling feud with Congress and now accusations of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The result is what Semana, the country's leading news magazine,
has called ``a crisis of governability without precedent.'' A
recent cover showed two rebel leaders with big grins and warned
that ``while the establishment wears itself out in futile clashes,
the country is collapsing and the guerrillas gain ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress' approval of an emergency antidrug aid package
this week appears to afford Pastrana only marginal respite. The
plan will do nothing to eliminate the sparring with his own
Congress or the complaints of corruption. Nor will it help to end
the recession, as the bulk of the aid will go to the military, not
into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   For economic relief, Pastrana has been counting on the other
side of what his government calls ``Plan Colombia,'' nearly $2
billion in social aid from European and other donors due to meet
Colombian officials in Madrid, Spain, in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants Pastrana to come home empty-handed, and every
effort will be made to prevent that from happening,'' said a
European diplomat here. ``But there is a feeling that this is a
primarily military plan and that we are being asked to clean up the
mess that the Americans are going to make.''
</P>
<P>
   With few visible signs of progress in ending the war and with
the economy reeling, popular support for the peace effort is now
``precarious,'' Jorge Humberto Botero, head of the country's bank
association, cautioned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is sickened by blood,'' he said. ``It is
intimidated and terrorized.''
</P>
<P>
   Botero's warning came after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, the main insurgent group, announced a plan to tax all
wealthy Colombians and kidnap those who refuse to pay. Since the
rebels are already taxing businesses and carrying out summary
executions in the sizable demilitarized zone Pastrana handed to
them in late 1998, the new demand has added to the impression they
see themselves as a parallel government.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much longer is our government going to keep treating these
subversive criminals with such deference?'' asked Jose Manuel Tovar
Jimenez, an accountant. ``I'm sick of constantly making concessions
to them and getting nothing in return but new and more outrageous
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's political problems mounted this spring when he called
for a referendum that would shut down the Congress, widely seen as
corrupt and ineffective, and replace it with a more streamlined and
accountable body. Legislators counterattacked, saying that
Pastrana's own job should also be put to a vote, and the president
was eventually forced to withdraw his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana is in dire straits as a result,'' a diplomat here
said. ``No matter how things turn out, he has poisoned relations
with Congress for the remainder of his term, and is going to have a
hard time getting any legislation passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges of corruption in Pastrana's administration have also
emerged, fed by the opposition Liberal Party, whose own image was
tarnished by evidence that drug traffickers contributed to its 1994
presidential campaign. Suspect donations to the Pastrana campaign
from a dredging company seeking government contracts have been the
focal point of the allegations, with key members of Pastrana's
cabinet and staff said to have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the certainty that nothing will be found, I'm not going
to slow down to dedicate further time or space to such infamies,''
Pastrana said in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   None of the accusations have been proved. But the simple
perception of irregularities has weakened the ``white knight''
image that has been about the only trump card remaining in
Pastrana's deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him because he seemed sincere, and I am
disappointed at the way things are turning out,'' said Mercedes
Ardila Ochoa, a secretary. ``I wanted a change, and what we are
getting is the same old way of doing things at the time we can
least afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's declining popularity is also part of a broader
institutional breakdown in Colombian politics. As in neighboring
Venezuela and Peru, the population here is growing increasingly
disgusted with the traditional party system, in which power
alternates between Liberals and Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people perceive the parties as not representing their
interests,'' said Myles Frechette, who was the U.S. ambassador here
in the late 1990s. ``And they are just not doing what the people
need. They equate the political class with corruption, and they see
a lot of cheap populist talk but nobody really doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, with any progress in fighting either the war or the
recession seemingly a long way off, Pastrana is trying to reverse
his sagging political fortunes by making over his image, which a
diplomat here described as ``slick and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed casually in a sweater and open-necked shirt and speaking
in an unusually colloquial manner, Pastrana went on television June
21 to urge Colombians to ``adopt a new attitude'' and be more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the bad news that does not let us see and
construct a better country for all, the country that we dream about
and need,'' he said. ``I'm tired of pessimism always winning out
over hope, of negativism over the positive, of the bad over the
good.''

BATTLE FLAG IS LOWERED BUT WAR ISN'T QUITE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As its reign atop the South Carolina Statehouse
finally drew to an end Saturday, the Confederate battle flag had
become almost as much a curiosity as an object of division, a
symbol of the state's exhausted recent history even more than of
its distant past.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over the flag might have grown familiar over its
38-year presence, but they were often riveting, and no issue has
delineated the state's racial chasm more clearly. Many of the
people, black and white, who have streamed by the Capitol over the
last few days before the flag's removal at noon Saturday seemed
wistful not so much for the flag itself but for the emotional
charge it injected into public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember when it wasn't up there,'' said Dwight Enroe,
a 32-year-old diesel mechanic who drove his family of four down
from Spartanburg for a last glimpse, even though he favors its
removal. ``For a while it seemed like that was all anybody talked
about, that and video poker. What are we going to fight about
now?''
</P>
<P>
   By a strange and resonant coincidence, the other issue that has
obsessed the state for the last decade _ the insistent spread of
video gambling machines _ also came to an end this weekend. Thanks
to a state Supreme Court decision last October, the 34,000 machines
that had noisily overtaken most of the state's gas stations and
convenience stores were illegal as of midnight Friday, the largest
shutdown of a state's gambling industry in a century.
</P>
<P>
   These two issues were related principally by the intensity of
the passions they created among citizens and elected officials, and
by their ability to eclipse any other substantive discussion during
legislative sessions and statewide elections. Partisans on the
various sides grumbled or exulted at the demise of the two
leviathans, but many South Carolinians saw the holiday concurrence
as a signal of relief and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a momentous weekend,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
of Charleston, who has campaigned prominently against both video
poker and the flag. ``After all these years of paralysis, the
people of South Carolina finally rose up at the grass roots and got
their representatives to respect their wishes. This state really
can control its own destiny, and now we can get to education and
everything else we put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote to remove the Confederate battle flag from the dome and
the Senate and House chambers came in May, after legislators
finally tired of years of pressure from business and religious
leaders, as well as a statewide tourism boycott imposed by the
NAACP. The moral argument against the flag as a banner of slavery
was ultimately unpersuasive; many suburban legislators who had
previously supported the flag as a benign symbol of Southern
heritage said the weariness of their constituents and the damage to
the state's economy finally changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision came only after flag supporters insisted on a
compromise: placing a smaller, square version of the flag on a pole
at the main entrance to the Capitol, adjacent to a monument to
Confederate soldiers. The prominence of the new flag, which was to
go up Saturday after the old flag was retired, has infuriated some
black leaders, who said the entire disposition of the flag was
arranged by the state's white leadership. (Actually, most black
senators voted for the compromise, while most black House members
did not.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the movement to another flagpole was intended
not to resolve the issue, but to continue the reign of the flag,''
said Dwight James, executive director of the state NAACP
Conference, which conducted a silent protest march to the Capitol
Saturday morning. ``They're trying to distract those who have
called for economic sanctions against the state, but it won't
work.'' The boycott has already shown some signs of weakening, but
the organization plans to maintain it as long as the flag flies in
its new location.
</P>
<P>
   The end of video poker was likewise the result of a middle-class
revolt against the enormous size and power of the gambling
industry, which at its peak in 1999 was generating $3 billion in
yearly revenue. Some 3,000 people will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum against the machines was on the verge of passage
last year, riding an enormous tide of revulsion generated by
religious and business leaders, when the state's high court beat
the voters to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same group that ultimately came together against
the flag, too,'' said Richard Gergel, a prominent Columbia lawyer
who brought a racketeering lawsuit against the video industry.
``They saw the social cost to the people who were gambling, and the
economic cost to the state. And they finally made the political
system respond.''

DESPITE SPEEDY ACCORD, LONG ROAD AHEAD TO KOREAN UNIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ While the friendship and reconciliation
that emerged from the Korean summit meeting two weeks ago was
surprising, and sudden, officials here insist that actual
unification is years, if not decades, away and can be achieved only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials have paid close attention to Germany's
unification _ in which an economically stronger country swiftly
absorbed its weaker brother _ and have determined, in the words of
Park Jie-won, minister of culture and tourism, ``that it will not
work on the Korean peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea would never agree to it, and South Korea's economy
would not survive the high costs,'' Park said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   However, if there is another thing to be learned from Germany's
unification, it is that such processes are unpredictable and can
happen faster than almost anybody expects. The leaders of East and
West Germany did not plan to rush their reunification, but as
thousands of East Germans overwhelmed the border, there was no
choice but to merge quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The costs to South Korea in unifying with the North, which is in
dire financial straits, are estimated at between several hundred
billion dollars and a few trillion, depending on the method of
calculation. But all estimates suggest that reunification by
absorption would greatly damage South Korea's rebounding economy
and would pose a far heavier financial burden than the one West
Germany bore from its union with East Germany in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Park, one of the main negotiators behind last month's Korean
summit meeting, said that there would be no quick reconciliation on
the Korean peninsula and that the heavily fortified border dividing
North and South would not suddenly come crashing down. On the
contrary, the minister said, North and South Korea would proceed
very slowly, taking a series of measured steps in the coming months
and perhaps years to break down the ideological and economic
barriers that have divided them for more than a half century.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing military tensions, rebuilding the North's shattered
economy and increasing cultural ties are chief among the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Through these efforts, Park said, Koreans from the North and
South, who have long been socialized to regard each other as
enemies, would begin to view themselves as one people, setting the
stage for a formal union.
</P>
<P>
   But unforeseen events in North Korea could spoil South Korea's
plans for an orderly reconciliation. Little is known about the true
state of affairs in North Korea. There appears to be no meaningful
political opposition to the Stalinist regime of leader Kim Jong Il,
who has kept his deeply impoverished country in a state of physical
and ideological isolation. But selected members of the Communist
elite have been allowed narrow windows on the outside world, and
there is no saying what effect even gradual contact with South
Korea would have.
</P>
<P>
   Park said it was still too early to say exactly what type of
political system a united Korean peninsula could have, and nearly
impossible to set a timetable for reunification. Considering the
political strength of both governments, Park talked of the
possibility of what he called a ``co-federation.''
</P>
<P>
   If relations between the two Koreas advance, some senior
government officials envision a day when Koreans would travel
freely between the two countries, the North's factories, now idle,
would manufacture consumer electronics and other products for South
Korean conglomerates, and Korea would send a unified team to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials acknowledged that much work lies ahead. They
said they had not anticipated the overwhelming success of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the agreement struck between President Kim
Dae-jung of South Korea and the North Korean leader have said that
it is very short on substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve a peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula, we
must link aid and economic development with North Korea's military
and political issues,'' said Kim Young-ho, a professor of political
science at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul. ``And so far Kim
Dae Jung's government has not done that. Just pouring money into
North Korea accomplishes nothing, because Kim Jung Il will readily
accept it and put it to good use.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, South Korean officials said they are well on their way to
realizing one of their first goals: reducing tension on the
peninsula. Already, both North and South have stopped their
propaganda broadcasts in the demilitarized zone and no longer refer
to each another in disparaging terms.
</P>
<P>
   And planning is already under way for a wide variety of cultural
exchanges in sports, the arts, religion, and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government is also encouraging South Korean and
foreign companies to form consortiums to develop North Korea's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit meeting, officials said, the Korean leaders
discussed using some of the more than 1 million North and South
Korean troops stationed in the demilitarized zone to finish
building the remaining 10 miles of railway that would connect the
entire peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Jong Il realizes that it's better to use the soldiers for
peaceful purposes rather than having them staring at each other all
day and building up hostilities,'' Park said.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ After an emotional debate over one of the
most contentious issues embroiling some Protestant denominations,
the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has
approved an amendment to the church's constitution forbidding
ministers from conducting same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which came on a close vote late Friday night here,
will take effect next June if it is ratified by two-thirds of the
church's regional jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The same-sex debate has also involved other major denominations
in the past year. For example, two ministers in the larger United
Methodist Church have faced church trials for violating a law of
their denomination forbidding same-sex unions. Both were convicted;
one was defrocked, and the other was suspended from his duties.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the Presbyterian amendment came on a vote of
268-251. It was among the final items of business at the
denomination's General Assembly, which has been meeting in this
Southern California port city since June 22.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, supporters of the amendment described it as
upholding a traditional Christian view of marriage. One church
elder, Paula Metherell, a member of the local presbytery here in
Long Beach, said ``the duty of the church'' is to serve as ``a
moral beacon,'' calling people to a life of holiness.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure, like George McCall of Missouri,
argued that the amendment, if approved, would limit the ability of
pastors to minister effectively to all members of their
congregation. ``Do not bind our conscience and tie our hands as
pastors,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the vote, the assembly narrowly defeated an alternative
proposal that would have called for a ``spirit of dialogue'' among
Presbyterians and for the church to honor ``the discretion of
pastors'' in providing care to their congregations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The denomination, with 2.6 million members in 11,400
congregations spread from coast to coast, represents one of the
most historically influential streams of Protestantism in the
United States. Presbyterians have been heavily represented in
American politics, most prominently counting Woodrow Wilson, Dwight
Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan among their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination's governing structure has significant parallels
to that of the United States, with the Presbyterian assembly
playing a role similar to that of Congress in passing
constitutional amendments, which then must be ratified by the
presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions that play a role similar
to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the denomination has become increasingly
riled by issues centering on what rights are due its gay members.
And division over same-sex unions was evident last week, among the
commissioners, as Presbyterian delegates are called, on the
committee that formulated the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, by a vote of 25-22, the committee approved a
statement declaring, ``Scripture and our confessions teach that
God's intention for all people is to live either in fidelity within
the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity
in singleness.'' The amendment adds that church officers may not
bless same-sex unions, nor may church property be used for such a
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's wording is close to the law against same-sex
unions adopted by the Methodists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Friday was not the first time Presbyterian leaders had
attempted to legislate against same-sex unions. Six years ago, the
assembly adopted a similar amendment, but it failed to win the
approval of the needed majority of the presbyteries. In 1995, a
similar effort failed to pass the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the denomination has seemed to lean in a more
conservative direction. In 1996, the assembly approved an amendment
barring the ordination of anyone sexually active outside the bounds
of marriage, a move widely understood as aimed at preventing
noncelibate gays and lesbians from serving as ministers, elders or
deacons. It became church law the next year, after more than
two-thirds of the presbyteries voted in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizations that supported that amendment was the
Presbyterian Coalition. Its moderator, or top official, the Rev.
Jerry Anderson of Glen Ellyn, Ill., said after Friday night's vote
that there was ``no room to gloat'' for the amendment's supporters,
because many Presbyterians who opposed the amendment were suffering
``a lot of pain.'' Nevertheless, Anderson said he expected the
amendment to be ratified overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the amendment's opponents, Mitzi Henderson, a
Californian who serves as co-moderator of the More Light
Presbyterian Churches, an organization that supports gay rights,
said, ``I don't think it's the end of the struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said she did not agree that the amendment would be
easily ratified by the presbyteries.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial questions among religious organizations of how to
relate to gays and lesbians in their pews reflect similar tensions
within American society and politics. The vote here, for example,
occurred in the same week as the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld
the right of the Boy Scouts of America to bar a gay man from
serving as a scout leader. And the Presbyterians' vote also follows
the decision of the Vermont Legislature earlier this year to extend
to same-sex unions a civil recognition that stops just short of
calling them marriage.

LEBANON'S REACTION TO ISRAELI INCURSIONS MAY JEOPARDIZE U.N.
DEPLOYMENT

   BORDER POST 34, Lebanon _ The quick deployment of U.N.
peacekeepers and Lebanese forces into the stretch of southern
Lebanon that Israel abandoned in May after 22 years of occupation
has been thrown into doubt with the controversy over a series of
apparent Israeli incursions across a borderline drawn in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.N. Security Council voted two weeks ago to endorse
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's certification that Israel had indeed
pulled out its troops, opening the way for an additional force of
peacekeepers to fill the security vacuum along the border, Lebanon
protested the findings. But Annan brushed aside Lebanese
objections, saying there were only a couple of border violations by
Israel and they would be cleared up swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were more transgressions, and U.N. relations with
both Lebanon and Israel became strained. Newspapers in the region
have reported an angry exchange, including curses, between Annan
and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, as well as a lengthy,
middle-of-the-night telephone call in which Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright reportedly shouted at President Emile Lahoud of
Lebanon to send his army into the south to replace the Hezbollah
guerrillas who are now the only force of local order.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has sent officers from the peacekeeping force
that has patrolled the south for more than 20 years to survey and
map the border, with orders to report back to New York headquarters
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the surveyors found nine violations by Israel, U.N.
officials said at their headquarters in Naqura.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the violations, they said, were minor. One, for
instance, involved a lone Israeli soldier at an observation post on
a hill a few dozen yards over the nominal line, although the next
day he was joined by two armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the violations have become a political issue, jumped on by
both Lebanon and Israel, and drawing a threat from the leader of
the Hezbollah militia to take unspecified action if the United
Nations does not resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Here along a lonely stretch of road through the stony hills
where the border marches sharply north to swing around the Israeli
settlement of Metulla are several problems that have evolved during
the two decades Israel maintained what it called a ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon with its proxy Lebanese militias and its
own forces.
</P>
<P>
   Border Post 33 _ a cement stake marking a point along the line _
is atop Sheik Abad Hill, a little way south. It had been a South
Lebanese Army and Israeli gun position. BP 34 is in a creek bed
below a cliff where a Lebanese family serves thick coffee in a
makeshift cafe of a truck and awning. BP 35 is on another hill
running north.
</P>
<P>
   Across the creek bed is the Israeli hilltop settlement of
Misgavan. Over the course of the occupation, the Israelis moved
their security fences forward, and the settlement spread over the
old border. Thus, if the original border were followed, the
settlement would be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   To the north in Addaiseh, the borderline drawn in 1923, which
runs down a hill and then turns alongside the main road would, if
strictly followed, put about 10 Lebanese houses in Israel. Just to
the south, the border runs so close to a road alongside the Israeli
settlement of Manara that it would be impossible to build a
security fence.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the problems of the modern Middle East, this one
dates back to the way the Western powers divided up the defeated
Ottoman Empire after World War I. Two lieutenant colonels, one
French, one British, trudged up and down the hills from the coast
to below Mount Hermon, marking what was to be the border of Syria
and Palestine with piles of whitewashed rocks. Over the years, it
shifted here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a border on wheels,'' a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government, which takes its cues from Syria,
has declared every inch sacred. Israel, for its part, wants to
retain high ground, which in much of the area provides a commanding
position overlooking its north.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut newspapers quoted Lahoud as saying that Annan had
promised him in a telephone call on Tuesday that the Israeli
encroachments would be cleared up by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annan promised me to end the violations in three days and to
send radar systems and helicopters to monitor any future Israeli
violations of Lebanon's airspace or territorial waters,'' Lahoud
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said that ``time
is running out fast for U.N. efforts to get the Israelis totally
out. The resistance cannot wait too long for the border corrections
to come about.''

County, Fla. wants to hire workers to assist elderly residents eat
but has been blocked by a federal regulation. Nursing homes in Ohio
and several other states also want to use ``single task'' employees
to assist residents in eating and to push their wheelchairs from

advocates support the government, claiming single task employees
won't solve the problem of understaffing in nursing homes. A bill

   MEXICO-ELECTION _ MEXICO CITY _ The curator of the Emiliano

that bloody upheaval 80 years ago. ``We're going for change,'' he
said without hesitation. ``Enough of corruption.'' Whether Mexico's
ruling party _ which has controlled this country's presidency for
71 years - loses or wins, Mexican politics will never be the same
after this Sunday. This is a country of striking wealth and
poverty, with the world's longest-reigning political party. It is
the fifth-largest oil producer in the world, but half the nation
lives in poverty. Sunday's election will determine whether the
ruling party will be jettisoned - or remain in power for another
six years. After decades of legendary PRI fraud, this election is
supposed to the cleanest ever. Yet it has already been tainted by
allegations of pressure tactics, vote-buying and lingering media
bias (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and map-graphic

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Larry Woiwode's ``What I Think I Did'' is neither
autobiography nor fiction but rather a memoir in the form of

trapped in a blizzard during the winter of 1996-97, the other his
life as a young man in New York when he hung around with an
aspiring teenage actor named Robert DeNiro and caught the eye of
William Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is
often hypnotic in its imagery (``. . . a wind hits and streaks of
snow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a
white-out.''), the other a recollection of another life and another
world entirely. Of DeNiro he writes: ``When he's unhappy his
parents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly angry, as if the

REPORTS SAY CHINA IS AIDING PAKISTAN ON MISSILE PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., N.J., Neb.)   By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. intelligence agencies have told the Clinton
administration and Congress that China has continued to aid
Pakistan's effort to build long-range missiles that could carry
nuclear weapons, according to several officials with access to the
intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations are complicating President Clinton's effort to
win quick Senate passage of a bill establishing normal trade
relations for China.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of classified briefings on Capitol Hill, most
recently on Thursday, the agencies have described how China stepped
up the shipment of specialty steels, guidance systems and technical
expertise to Pakistan, China's longtime strategic ally, after India
and Pakistan set off rival nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese experts have also been sighted around Pakistan's newest
missile factory, which appears partly based on a Chinese design,
and shipments to Pakistan have been continued over the past eight
to 18 months, several of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the administration is sending a large delegation to
Beijing to raise the issue in detail, the first high-level
negotiations over missile exports since November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation will be headed by John Holum, senior adviser to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for arms control, and will
include several other high-ranking officials. The talks were
suspended for more than a year after the accidental U.S. bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. general this week called the arming of Pakistan
``a longer-range issue'' that persists despite assurances from
President Jiang Zemin of China to President Clinton two years ago
that Beijing would review its aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the ties between China's military and Pakistan run deep _
both consider India their greatest threat _ and the general said
``part of the issue is, we're not sure how much is going on that
the Chinese hierarchy knows about.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, trying to head off action by
Congress that could place new sanctions on China, say they have
been encouraged that China has greatly reduced exports to the
Middle East. The White House has argued for several years that the
Chinese have abided by agreements to halt exports of nuclear and
chemical weapons to Iran, North Korea and other nations that the
United States considers a strategic concern.
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing exports of missile parts and technology to
Pakistan are creating a raft of political problems, much as they
did during the last presidential election, when Clinton decided in
May 1996 not to punish China for the sale of $70,000 in equipment
that helped Pakistan produce weapons-grade uranium. The latest
revelations appear to be contributing to the reluctance of the
Senate leadership to schedule a vote on permanent normal trading
relations with China, a bill which already passed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the administration fears that in order to win passage
of the trade bill, it may have to accept a bill constraining
China's exports of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., the bill would require the administration to
monitor China's proliferation record. It would also impose
automatic sanctions on companies or states if there is ``credible
evidence'' of certain exports _ even though China has never signed
the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary accord to limit
sales of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have the discretion to waive some of the
penalties, but others would be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The bill only focuses on China, even though North Korea and
other countries are believed by U.S. intelligence agencies to be
shipping full missile systems to Pakistan. Last month the
administration lifted 50-year-old sanctions against North Korea,
and there was no discussion even from conservatives in Congress
about North Korea's aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that both Thompson's measure and the trade bill
could pass, but supporters of the trade measure fear Beijing's
reaction if the tough sanctions legislation is passed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is on the Foreign Relations
Committee who opposes the Thompson-Torricelli legislation, said in
an interview last week that both that bill and the new intelligence
could greatly complicate or even imperil passage of normal trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already approved the change in China's trading
status _ part of the drive to make China a member of the World
Trade Organization by the end of the year _ but any changes in the
Senate version could send the legislation back to the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the Thompson bill passes, you might embolden people who do
not want PNTR to go forward,'' Hagel said, using the shorthand for
permanent normal trade relations. ``It so complicates the issue
that PNTR could fall as a result of its own weight. There are those
in the Senate who wish that to happen.''

</P>
<P>
   The argument over the sanctions bill culminates seven years of
struggle between the White House and Congress over which one will
manage relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration's China policy, both Democrats and
Republicans, argue that the White House has ignored a pattern of
Chinese exports in order to avoid imposing sanctions that existing
law requires. They argue that in the name of preserving a broader
relationship with China, the Clinton administration is always
leaping through loopholes in the sanctions laws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in response, says that Congress confuses
sanctions with a workable policy on trying to slow the spread of
advanced weapons, and notes that the Thompson bill sets stricter
requirements for Chinese behavior than international agreements do.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute goes to the core of one of Clinton's major arguments
in favor of normalizing trade relations with China: That a China
more economically entwined with the rest of the world will become
more cooperative on issues like stopping the spread of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that divisions with the West on these
nonproliferation issues could ultimately be bad for business,'' one
senior U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pakistan is a particularly difficult issue that runs up
against their strategic relationship, and their rivalry with
India,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of aid to Pakistan, the official said, coincided
with the tit-for-tat nuclear tests India and Pakistan set off in
1998, which the official said ``fundamentally changed the strategic
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   One congressional official familiar with the intelligence said
that the Pakistanis ``went to the Chinese and said, `We know you
have this agreement with the Americans, but we really need your
help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a
persistent flow of aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past decade Washington has imposed sanctions on
Beijing for its aid to Pakistan, once in 1991 and again in 1993. In
1994, to resolve the issue, China agreed to comply with the main
provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime and said it
would no longer sell full M-11 missiles to Pakistan.

EXCITEMENT AT THE CONVENTIONS? TRY TELECOM SIDESHOW

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When the Republicans gather here this month for
their national convention, to some it might be hard to tell the
difference: is this a political convention or a telecommunications
trade show?
</P>
<P>
   While the main event at the convention here _ and the Democratic
convention to be held in August in Los Angeles _ is, of course,
nominating a presidential candidate, a big corporate sideshow is
being planned as well. And in that effort, no single industry is
better represented than telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are writing seven-figure checks to local civic
host committees. They are spending millions more laying hundreds of
miles of telephone, cable, fiber-optic and high-speed Internet
lines at the conventions. They are handing out hundreds of
telephones, pagers and walkie-talkies to important politicians. And
they are doing this to promote their products to a captive audience
of power brokers _ along with their views on how Washington should
decide a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues facing the industry are huge,'' said Reed Hundt,
former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. ``Whether
it is Bush or Gore, there will be a whole new crop of decision
makers in government in 2001, and these new people will shape the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   More than most industries, telecommunications companies are
affected by Washington. Since the landmark 1996 Telecommunications
Act deregulated the industry, telecommunications has been
transformed from a stodgy industry to one of the fastest-growing
segments of the economy. Among the issues before the government: A
debate over open access to high-speed Internet networks, the fight
over local telephone companies' entering the $80 billion
long-distance market, the future ability of huge telecommunications
companies to pursue still more acquisitions and the rules governing
which companies can compete for the wireless spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the political conventions give telecommunications
companies a chance to showcase their latest technologies and wares,
in real time and in real life, to lawmakers and journalists. From a
marketing perspective alone, it hardly gets better than this: In
Philadelphia, there will be 30 governors, the congressional
leadership, local elected officials, fellow business leaders and
15,000 national and international journalists _ all chatting on
phones, using computers and transmitting information.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of this dazzling technology is not an option.
Telecom companies have built extensive redundancy and backup to
prevent any embarrassing technological troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every four years, we have the opportunity to showcase our
technological prowess before an important audience,'' said Tony
Cellucci, AT&AMP;T's director for the Republican convention. ``To do
that with such a large captive audience in one location is quite an
engineering feat.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has given more than $1 million to the Philadelphia 2000
host committee and a similar amount to the Los Angeles committee.
AT&AMP;T is also spending $8 million to $10 million to build new
cellular towers at the Philadelphia convention site.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also provide 500 cell phones _ with Republican
Party logos _ to GOP officials.
</P>
<P>
   A front-burner issue for AT&AMP;T is its $58 billion acquisition of
MediaOne Co., just approved by federal regulators, making AT&AMP;T the
nation's largest provider of cable, long-distance and high-speed
Internet access. In coming months, regulators will take actions
affecting how these companies unite.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, telecommunications companies are not the only ones
jumping on the promotional bandwagon. Companies like US Airways,
McDonald's, Microsoft and Pepsico provided the bulk of the $40
million in goods and services raised by Philadelphia's host
committee _ all tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, General Motors, as it has for every convention
since 1978, will lend 400 cars _ full-size models and sport utility
vehicles _ to shuttle around the powerful. ``These are
thought-leaders and opinion shakers,'' said Bill Noack, GM
spokesman. ``We turn our vehicles over to them because it's a good
way to expose our products to a diverse and influential audience.''
</P>
<P>
   For telecoms, however, all this is more than mere promotion.
Conventions are a way to make money, too. With so many people
talking on phones and using computer modems, telecom companies plan
to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some combination of civic pride and economic
self-interest,'' David Cohen, co-chairman of Philadelphia 2000,
said of the telecom companies. ``We give them a direct opportunity
to make money. That makes it easier for them to be a significant
contributor.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Telecom participation in these conventions comes on top of
campaign contributions the industry has already made to the two
parties _ a total of $16.9 million in contributions to federal
candidates and the two parties in this election cycle, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group in
Washington. Two of the biggest corporate players at these
conventions are the biggest soft-dollar donors as well: AT&AMP;T ranks
No. 1 with $2.2 million to both parties, SBC Communications comes
in sixth with $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Civic pride, too, plays a role since telecom companies tend to
be prominent players on their local scenes. In Philadelphia,
Comcast and Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, both with headquarters
here, have given $1 million each to the host committee, and so has
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In Bell Atlantic's case, the company is spending another $4.5
million to create a telecommunications network at the convention
site that equals that of a small city: 8,000 traditional phone
lines and a variety of transmission and Internet-access lines with
names like DSL, DS-1 and ISDN. An additional $200,000 is going for
promotional materials, including banners around Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposure of Bell Atlantic to the media has tremendous
value as we become a national and international presence,'' said
Daniel J. Whelan, chief executive of the company. Just last
December, federal regulators allowed Bell Atlantic to sell
long-distance services to its New York customers. Moreover, Whelan
added, Bell Atlantic ``expects to turn a profit'' from
convention-related telephone use.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, host city for the Democrats, the local phone
company is SBC Communications, which is seeking federal approval to
enter the lucrative long-distance market and sell long-distance
calling to 15 million of its Texas customers.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the parent company of Pacific Bell, is a convention
veteran. It used the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego to
kick off its wireless phones. This time, the word is ``band-width''
_ the new telephone and Internet connections being laid around Los
Angeles' Staples Center, where the convention is being held, to
allow for high-speed data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fat pipes,'' said Steve Getzug, spokesman for SBC,
referring to the high-speed connections, ``will be a pretty
incredible application. We want to show some amazing gee-whiz
technology to capture the fancy of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no company _ telecom or not _ is making a bigger splash
in Philadelphia than Comcast, the nation's third-largest cable
company. Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, is co-chairman of the
Philadelphia 2000 Host Committee. And Comcast owns the First Union
Center in South Philadelphia, where the convention will be held,
and which is being renamed the ``Comcast-Spectacor Center'' for the
duration of event. (Among Comcast's other corporate ventures are
its ownership of QVC, the television-based retailer, the 76ers
basketball team, and the E! Entertainment, Golf and Food cable
channels.)
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has its card full of activities: Its regional cable
network, CN8, will broadcast five hours of live convention
programming daily using the $10 million studio Comcast built at the
convention site for sports games. And it is dedicating 200
employees to this effort, which will be offered free to cable
operators across the country, potentially reaching 68.5 million
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast will be sponsoring a fund-raising reception for 400
people honoring retiring Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., who helped
steer the Telecommunications Act through Congress. The company is
footing the bill for a 100-page media and delegate guide for the
100,000 people expected at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   It will also install Comcast kiosks there to demonstrate its
high-speed Internet service and is thinking about selling political
memorabilia on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have to make important decisions, and
they are coming to our house,'' said Roberts, president of Comcast.
``This exposure may enhance our own credibility when we are
explaining new technologies, and it's a unique onetime opportunity
for elected officials to see Comcast. Policy makers can meet us
first and remember our names, our faces and our products. And, for
Philadelphia, it's our Super Bowl, our Olympics.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NOW THERE'S A SOUND TO THE RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: To be subbed after the game) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ C RA-A-A-CK!
</P>
<P>
   No noise in the major leagues compares to the impact of Mike
Piazza's bat with a thrown baseball. Not McGwire. Not Sosa. Not
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The collision carries to the far corners of a crowded ballpark,
and also crashes through the speakers of a television set or a
radio. That impact makes you pick up your head to see where the
ball is heading, the way Piazza's savagely clubbed three-run homer
thudded against the left-field facade Friday night. The wallop
stunned the Braves at the end of an improbable and by now historic
10-run rally in the eighth inning that allowed the New York Mets to
shock the Atlanta Braves, 11-8, at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams would go back at it again Saturday afternoon,
after barely enough time for the concussion to die down, along with
the cheers and the holiday fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that resonance is part of the deepening relationship between
two ball clubs, the Mets and the Braves, perhaps just in time for
the geniuses of baseball to realign it out of significance.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown together in the National League's East Division, the Mets
and the Braves have created their own little duel, still lopsided
in favor of Atlanta, but at least starting to take on some depth
and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Rivalries make the games mean something, give them a context.
Otherwise, they are just contests between fine athletes. When the
Giants take on the Washington Redskins on a grim autumnal
afternoon, fans reminisce about how Lawrence Taylor waved urgently
for the medics after breaking Joe Thiesmann's leg at midfield.
There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   When the faded Boston Celtics meet the resurgent Los Angeles
Lakers, there are memories of ancient series in late spring,
Russell and West, McHale and Abdul-Jabbar. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   When Italy plays France in the finals of the European soccer
championships Sunday in Rotterdam, there will be memories of the 31
times these nations have played, starting in 1910. France has won
the last two World Cup encounters, 2-0, in Mexico City in 1986 and
then the quarterfinals in St. Denis in 1996, on the dreaded penalty
kicks. My wife and I watched in a French cafe in Aix-en-Provence,
and she kicked me under the table to stop me from twitching every
time Roberto Baggio made a move. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets and the Braves are just getting interesting, but in
fact the two teams go back a ways. The Braves have their roots in a
damp and seedy little nook called Braves Field in the Back Bay
section of Boston, when they used to play the Brooklyn Dodgers and
New York Giants 11 times each, home and away.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1954 the Mets were
founded from the dregs of other rosters in 1962 and Spahn and Aaron
visited the rusted, rickety Polo Grounds. They were swept in a
doubleheader by the dismal Mets, after which Bobby Bragan, the
manager of the Braves, said he was glad to escape this ``chamber of
horrors'' _ surely a description Bobby Cox might have revived for
Shea on Friday night. The Braves and Mets have had their
differences. On May 4, 1964, in County Stadium (you could look it
up, but I was there), the clubs staged an old-fashioned dust-up at
home plate, after Ed Bailey of the Braves resented a characteristic
hard slide by Ron Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the Mets' 73-year-old manager wound up
underneath 23-year-old Denis Menke of the Braves, who had this
horrible thought: ``Oh, my God, I've killed Casey Stengel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hah. Fat chance. Writers went out drinking with Casey long after
midnight. The old boy looked a little creaky but totally denied
ever being on the field during the fray. He was still going strong
at last call, as I vaguely remember. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets beat the Braves in the 1969 National League
Championship Series. The Mets beat the Braves regularly when they
were good in the '80s. The Braves beat the Mets pretty regularly
since they got good in the '90s. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can surely remember how the Braves killed the Mets'
wild-card hopes on the final lost weekend of 1998. They certainly
can recall how the Braves put the Mets into a tailspin last
September, but then how the Mets roared back from a three-game
deficit to throw the fear of Melvin Mora into the Braves before
finally succumbing in the 11th inning of the sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the playoffs last year, the Mets had won only 9 of 32
games from the Braves in the past two seasons, going into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good rivalry,'' said Stan Kasten, the president of the
Braves, being gallant. ``The Mets are one of the two or three best
teams in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even latter-day Hunt-Bailey traces in Piazza's being
upended by Brian Jordan in the playoffs last year, but nobody duked
anybody this time around. Then there is the matter of John Rocker,
who took it personally when verbal assassins shouted ugly things at
him from the stands. Rocker's diatribe against New York (actually
against the diversity of America itself) was the reason for the
heightened police presence at Shea this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Braves will take a while to shake the memory of all
those bases on balls, the sizzle of the fuse cord leading to the
terminal explosion of Piazza's brute home run. The history grows.

POWERBOATS CHANGE PACE FOR SOME SAILBOAT OWNERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Maine., N.J., Fla., R.I.)   Herb McCormick is the editor of Cruising World magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to boating, Ken Weg is an equal-opportunity
enthusiast. In the waters by his summer place in Southwest Harbor,
Me., Weg keeps a pair of boats _ one power, one sail _ created
nearby at the legendary Hinckley Co. boat yard.
</P>
<P>
   When the breeze is up, the pharmaceutical executive from
Princeton, N.J., indulges his love of sailing aboard his classic
43-foot Sou'wester, Afterglow. But on calm mornings or when he
feels like a spin through the shallows with his young, twin
granddaughters, Weg opts for the joystick of his 36-foot Picnic
Boat, Promise, a handsome, highly maneuverable powerboat propelled
by water jets that can skim over a mere 18 inches of aqua.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to give up sailing,'' Weg said, ``but this is
the first powerboat I've ever had, and it's a nice change of
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Weg is not the only one embracing what have often been viewed as
diametrically opposed designs: the proverbial stinkpot versus the
blow boat. In the last decade, in what appears to be an
irreversible trend, boat builders whose names have been synonymous
with quality sailing vessels _ from semicustom yards including
Hinckley, Morris, Sabre, Little Harbor and Alden, to more
mainstream-production manufacturers like Freedom and Pacific
Seacraft _ have added a string of interesting, successful
powerboats to their lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love boats, period,'' said Bob Johnson, the president of
Florida's Island Packet Yachts, whose company is fitting out its
first powerboat, a versatile 36-foot cruiser called the 360
Express. ``From a corporate philosophy, it gives us a broader
market base and the potential for more growth.''
</P>
<P>
   With its twin diesel engines and standard propellers, the Island
Packet offering is a different creature from the Hinckley Picnic
Boat, whose jet-drive propulsion system allows it to carve
spray-tossed turns like a water skier and then literally stop on a
dime. But even with a price tag of more than $400,000, the Picnic
Boat has been something of a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started developing the boat around 1992, we thought we
might eventually sell 50 or 75,'' said Marnie Wright, Hinckley's
marketing director. ``But we've already sold well over 100. We just
hit it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Weg, many Hinckley Picnic Boat owners will continue to
pursue both types of boating. But Paul Petronello, the president of
Rhode Island's Freedom Yachts, focused on his more single-minded
customers when he made the decision to introduce his company's
Legacy line of powerboats.
</P>
<P>
   ``About five years ago we looked at our owner base and realized
that many of them were starting to leave sailing and switching to
power,'' Petronello said. ``And we had no product for them. So we
began to make the transition. It costs 10 times more to find a new
customer than to keep a loyal one and move them through the brand.
We had a couple of sailboat owners interested in changing, so we
used them as our spearhead to make the move.''
</P>
<P>
   An aging demographic of sailors who still wish to be active on
the water but who are no longer as interested in spinning winches
and yanking halyards is sometimes cited as the impetus behind some
yachtsmen's willingness to make the change. But to Bentley Collins,
the marketing manager at Sabre Yachts _ who said his company's
production this year would be an even 50-50 split between sailboats
and Sabreline powerboats _ that observation oversimplifies matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that a boater is a boater,'' he said. ``When
their kids are small, it might make sense to have a powerboat. When
they get to have teen-agers, sailing is a great way to enjoy a
family activity where you can also teach responsibility. Over the
years, I see a lot of boaters who go back and forth between sail
and power.''
</P>
<P>
   One boater who switched from sail to power _ but who shows no
clear signs of returning to his roots _ is Bill Parlatore, the
editor of Passage Maker magazine, whose publication caters to the
growing realm of long-range powerboat voyaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been a singlehanded sailor forever, but I went through
what's a typical pattern of evolution for a lot of sailors whose
wives want a more comfortable alternative,'' Parlatore said. ``We
started looking at bigger sailboats and multihulls, and it dawned
on us that what we were after was a motorboat.''
</P>
<P>
   For some sailors, such statements will amount to heresy. But
Weg, who never spent a day afloat he did not like, is not one of
them. ``There's nothing like the sensation of wind in your face
like you get on a sailboat,'' he said. ``But that Picnic Boat will
get you there pretty fast.''  &QL;

THE BLACKS ARE DEDICATED TO WIMBLEDON, BUT WORRY ABOUT THEIR
HOMELAND
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ They grew up well below the equator and
still reside in and represent the divided African nation of
Zimbabwe, and yet for the three members of the Black family to play
at Wimbledon is, in many ways, to play at home.
</P>
<P>
   They were raised with four grass courts of their own on the
family's 22-acre avocado farm in the suburbs of Harare, the
Zimbabwean capital. The courts were made slowly one by one, like
statues, by their father, Don Black, who played at Wimbledon in the
1950s and wanted to re-create what he termed his ``own little
Wimbledon'' and nurture future champions in a very unlikely spot.
</P>
<P>
   Don even borrowed and posted the same epigram from Rudyard
Kipling near his courts: ``If you can meet with triumph and
disaster and treat those two impostors just the same.'' At the All
England Club, those words are written above the players' entrance
to Center Court, and Don's dearest _ and rather unlikely _ dream is
that one of his children will some day walk through that entrance
on Wimbledon's final weekend and march back through it with a
singles trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extra comforting to be here,'' said Cara Black, Don's
only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting, too, because Cara's two brothers, Byron and
Wayne, together own a pied-a-terre within a long walk of Wimbledon.
Although Wayne lost in the first round and Cara lost in the second
round in singles, Byron advanced to the fourth round on Friday with
a straight-set victory over Spain's Albert Portas, and could go
quite a bit further.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the familiar signs and the reassuring surface, this
has hardly been a comforting season for the Blacks. Their country
has been in the midst of upheaval, with its president of 22 years,
Robert Mugabe, contributing. With Mugabe's approval, hundreds of
white-owned commercial farms, some of them owned by acquaintances
of Don Black's family, have been taken over by armed black
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of electoral intimidation and violence
in the run-up to last weekend's parliamentary election, won by a
narrow margin by Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front, over the opposition party, the
Movement for Democratic Change. But the closeness of the election
was still a seminal change in a country that has never had a
legitimate opposition party in its 22-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a little unclear as what's going to happen to the
land, but I feel like it's been a very closely run election, and I
just hope things calm down,'' Byron said. ``I think at this point
you have to accept the result. There is no going back now. If there
is intimidation, what do you do? I just hope the country can come
back and come together again. It's a bit torn up right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling a bit down the last couple months, obviously
with all this trouble going at home and people that you know
through other people who are getting killed and this is quite a
serious situation. And I know first hand all of my family and
friends are farmers and the troubles they are having: some of this
intimidation and people coming on to their farm and forcing them to
sign over the deeds of their farms, just forcing them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's disturbing and has had a real effect on our morale. For
me, maybe just because I'm older and have been around a bit longer
and think a lot more these days. It's really had an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron, 30, and his siblings have deliberately steered clear of
any political comments in recent months, opting _ as white members
of a society that is overwhelmingly black _ to let the electoral
process run its course. But it has been an emotional, difficult
period, said Cara, a 21-year-old with a promising all-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't directly affected our tennis, but always
subconsciously it's in the back of our minds,'' she said. ``It's
been a bit unsure the last couple months and having our parents
back home, every time you pick up the phone and call you have that
hold on you in your heart and you're just like, `I hope everything
is OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Don and his wife, Velia, who have remained in Zimbabwe, are in
no danger, according to Byron and Cara, and there has been little
violence in urban areas of the country like Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no plans to move whatsoever, no matter what
happens,'' Cara said. ``My dad is so set in his ways there. It's
where they grew up, as well. I don't think anything could move
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Byron and his wife, Fiona, feel a similarly strong attachment,
but with Fiona expecting their first child in six weeks, she has
come to London to give birth, opting for a more tranquil
environment, although only for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been going on at home has been on my mind the whole
time lately,'' Byron said. ``I just feel like I may go home and may
not have a home to go home to. My heart is back home, and I wish I
could be there. I struggle to put it into words. I feel so
patriotic about the country. We've played for our country and feel
so strongly about it and yet we can't do much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron, 30, and Wayne, 26, the pillars of their country's Davis
Cup team, which nearly beat Andre Agassi and the United States in
the first round in Harare in April, will play for Zimbabwe again
one week after Wimbledon. They are scheduled to be host to Romania
in a World Group qualifying round in the same arena in which they
played the Americans, and though the Romanians and their best
player, Andrei Pavel, have asked for a change of site because of
the political troubles in Zimbabwe, the match has not been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pavel keeps coming up to me and joking, saying, `I hear we're
playing in Romania,''' Byron said. ``It's a ploy of theirs,
obviously. They are going to use anything to try to change the
venue of the tie. Davis Cup is all about home advantage, and if we
lose that home advantage I'll be very upset.''

COST-CONSCIOUS YOUTH SAY OUTER BOROUGHS BEAT MANHATTAN FOR
AFFORDABLE SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jill Kerr and Chris Ytuarte decided to live
together, they considered moving to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But they never actually got around to looking, because whenever
they would think of people they knew _ people in their early 20s
squashed into small, expensive apartments, say, in the East 90s _
they knew they didn't want to live like that.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a new place together seemed like a good idea, but in the
end, the couple decided to live in the spacious one-bedroom,
$950-a-month apartment Kerr has been renting for two years, on 72nd
Road in Forest Hills, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr and Ytuarte each has a commute to Manhattan of about 25
minutes. Kerr manages the library at an investment firm and is
about to start a job writing reports for institutional clients in
global communications. Ytuarte (pronounced EE-to-it) is a reporter
covering fresh food for the trade publication Supermarket News.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr grew up in Floral Park, in Nassau County, right across the
border from Bellerose, Queens, where Ytuarte was raised. Both still
know a lot of friends living at home with their parents, in large
part because moving out in New York is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ytuarte, who worked at a newspaper last summer in New Hampshire,
returned to New York in September feeling he had no choice but to
go out on his own. ``I was sleeping on my dad's futon,'' he said.
He could have lived with his mother, also in Queens, but she, too,
has a one-bedroom apartment. It was a choice of futons, he said,
and ``I wanted a real bed; I wanted to be out on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for studio apartments through the fall and winter, but
found that he was spending most of his time with Kerr, whom he had
recently starting seeing, years after they had met in their first
year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   They are both 24, and people their age who live in Manhattan,
Kerr said, often seem to live in tiny spaces subsidized by their
parents. ``I don't know why people do it,'' she said. When she
began looking for an apartment, she wanted space, and light, and
air. If that meant forgoing Manhattan, she didn't mind, she said,
although Queens ``is considered out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They think they're the youngest people in their apartment
building, and they have no friends in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they like it there, though, particularly the charming
Austin Street, which has a Banana Republic, a Benetton and several
good restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartment, in a rent-stabilized building where apartments
that come on the market these days would probably rent for $1,200
or so, has high ceilings, beautiful wood floors and about 900
square feet, which gives them plenty of room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousin and her boyfriend lived in a studio in Manhattan,''
Ytuarte said. ``I don't understand how anybody can do that. I can
sit out here, and Jill can be in the bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a pleasing, leafy view. It used to be more sweeping,
encompassing the lake in Flushing Meadow, but in the spring a
10-story apartment building began rising nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great view,'' said Kerr. ``It just had a very open
feel. That's one of the best things about Queens, that you don't
feel claustrophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   They're upset by the change, but not so seriously that they want
to move. Besides, Ytuarte said, he can still see Shea Stadium,
where he goes 15 or 20 times every summer, for Mets games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the view I care about,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHENYANG, China _ For more than 40 years, Zhou Wei found success
as a Communist Party cadre in government bureaus and state-owned
enterprises, the kind of loyal official whose hard work kept the
gears of China's socialist industry turning. Colleagues and family
say he was a brilliant, if prickly, man who loved _ and still loves
_ the party.
</P>
<P>
   But today he is in a labor camp, accused of organizing illegal
assemblies and inciting unrest in this depressed industrial city.
Since the mid-1990s, Zhou, 69, has led thousands of Shenyang's
revered old Communist cadres in a mounting series of protests and
petition campaigns against the local government, loudly decrying
corruption and failure to look after the farmers, workers and
retirees it had pledged to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a campaign to gain Zhou's release has brought into public
view an extraordinary five-year struggle between the local party
and some of its most senior retired officials _ a bizarre conflict
in which the police tail old men who are heroes of the 1949
revolution that brought the party to power.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, it reflects widespread popular
disillusionment with the Communist Party over corruption and lost
ideals, even among its own rank and file. And it demonstrates the
erosion of the party's credibility and its monopoly on power in a
country where citizens are increasingly inclined to speak their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this city of ailing state enterprises, protests by
workers demanding unpaid wages are so common that road blockages
are announced on the morning news. But the complaints of the
veteran cadres go deeper to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We old cadres were outraged by the arrest of Comrade Zhou
Wei,'' said Zhang Jingcai, a youthful-looking 70-year-old perched
on the edge of a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still fervently love the Chinese Communist Party, but I hate
its corrupt elements,'' Zhang said. ``The prestige of the party is
not very high among ordinary people these days, and that makes us
old cadres very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou and his band of retired cadres were well known in Shenyang,
where hundreds of them would meet every Sunday at the Youth Park to
discuss politics. The outspoken Zhou, with impeccable revolutionary
credentials, became a sort of Robin Hood figure, a plain-living
party stalwart who stood up for the workers, peasants and old
Communists who had been cast aside in China's rush to remake its
socialist economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou joined the People's Liberation Army in 1947 at 16 and
became a Communist Party member in 1949, six months before Mao
Tse-tung proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. In the
1980s he was honored as a model worker. He and his family lived
simply, in a cement-floored walk-up flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers and factory workers are also concerned about Zhou
Wei,'' said Yuan Chongzhi, 72, another retired official. ``They
worshipped him _ called him the star of the old cadres _ because he
was struggling for justice for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou began organizing protests in 1995, for intensely practical
reasons: The Shenyang government had stopped providing the city's
20,000 old cadres who had retired from state-owned industries with
their legally guaranteed retirement benefits. Longtime party
stalwarts found themselves without full pensions or medical
coverage at a time when some local party leaders were building
villas and driving Audis.
</P>
<P>
   They rebelled. For the next three years, Zhou, bullhorn in hand,
led groups of retired cadres to government offices in Shenyang, the
capital of Liaoning Province, and Beijing, where they marched up to
deliver written petitions listing their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, their monthly benefits improved _ from about $25 a
month in 1996 to about $115 today, for example _ though they still
complain about substandard housing and medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, too, the old cadres began to tackle other problems,
helping peasants whose land had been illegally seized by the
Shenyang city government and championing the cause of Chinese who
had lost their savings when a private bank with close ties to top
local officials collapsed under the weight of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 order from the local party leaders that stripped Zhou
of his party membership states that, from October 1994 to June
1998, he organized 119 trips to petition the government, involving
17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in Chinese cities are increasingly common and
some are lawless, the old cadres say, but they insist they always
followed proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these old cadres are former factory leaders and party
leaders so they have knowledge and standards,'' said Zhou's wife,
Zhao Yan, a frail-looking woman in a print housedress. ``The
traffic police even praised the old cadres for petitioning in such
an orderly way _ not like a lot of protesters here who block roads
and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most threatening to local officials, though, was the
fact that the old cadres also decided to investigate local
corruption, and did not flinch when the trail led to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't rush in blindly,'' said Zhang. ``We were heeding the
calls of party leadership to stamp out corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   But as their efforts intensified, so did the police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou's phones were tapped in the years before he was imprisoned
and when the old cadres met on Sundays in the park, scores of
police officers listened in.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Zhou and his group traveled to Beijing to charge
that a deputy mayor of Shenyang, Ma Xiangdong, was involved in a
land speculation scheme that had illegally seized property that
belonged to thousands of peasants. On his return, Zhou was detained
for two weeks by the Shenyang Public Security Bureau and then
expelled from the party.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ma, he is now in prison, awaiting trial on charges of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, in April 1999, Zhou and his fellow retired cadres
made another trip to Beijing, this time to the Ministry of Public
Security, to expose the Shenyang bank that had bilked thousands of
depositors of almost $1 billion. And in early May 1999, they were
preparing to report on a top official in the city's construction
materials administration, who they said had siphoned off $40
million. They never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. May 6, five police cars carrying more than 20 officers
pulled up in front of the drab apartment block where Zhou lived,
his family said. They arrested Zhou, carting off his research
files, stamps, stationery and law books.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he was sent to a labor camp for two years _ a
sentence that can be imposed here by police outside of the court
system. Zhou has never been tried or convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole life he served the revolution and now he's being
persecuted,'' said his wife.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The document that expelled Zhou from the party and the one that
later led to his incarceration essentially accuse him of disloyalty
_ of not being a team player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhou Wei should have set an example of observing the party's
political discipline, conscientiously protecting the party's image
and protecting a stable and unified political situation,'' his
expulsion notice says.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's China, even devoted cadres who, as they say,
``spilled blood for the revolution,'' recoil at the notion that
loyalty to the party means blind acceptance, especially blind
acceptance of party wrongdoing and graft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the party for more than 50 years, and I've never
seen anything like this,'' said Li Baocai, 82. ``I really object to
Zhou Wei's being arrested and treated like this. I can't accept the
idea that we shouldn't try to solve these kinds of problems. We old
cadres tried to solve them because we believe in the party and the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months since his arrest, old cadres who worked with Zhou
have lodged their unhappiness in written petitions and in person,
often using the language of civil rights that has entered the
Chinese vocabulary in this era of opening and reform.
</P>
<P>
   They complained that when Zhou was expelled from the party, he
was not accorded the hearing that is the right of all party
members.
</P>
<P>
   They complained that at the court appeal of his sentencing to
the labor camp his lawyers were not even permitted to mount a
defense, and that Zhou has now waited seven months for a decision,
a violation of Chinese law. And they complained that Chinese
newspapers have not been allowed to report on his case, though
reporters have come to interview them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When Zhou Wei was in prison the first time, I went twice to
see him and they wouldn't let me in,'' said Li Yushen, another old
cadre, with a defiant air. ``What kind of human rights is this?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By now, Zhou has begun his second year of labor camp, where his
wife says her previously healthy husband has developed medical
problems, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But the old cadres continue his work. Last November, they issued
a report accusing Shenyang's mayor of protecting corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   And in early June, 43 signed an open letter to their friend,
which says: ``The darkness in Shenyang will one day pass. Our
friend Zhou Wei, you are a true Communist.''

ANALYSIS: CAMPAIGN CONTRASTS GROW STARKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush was all set and ready to go
from New York City to Detroit on Tuesday when his campaign plane
let out an enormous belch, drawing the attention of maintenance
workers and stranding him and his entourage on the tarmac at La
Guardia Airport. He seemed amused and unalarmed. ``This is an
optimistic campaign,'' the Texas governor joked to the reporters
who were sitting several rows behind but plenty close enough to see
and hear him.
</P>
<P>
   When the delay dragged on, he wandered back, chatted about
baseball and mused that a great virtue of this relatively unhurried
stretch of the presidential campaign was that he had ample time to
run and lift weights. He talked more about working out than
working. There was just one public event on his campaign schedule
for the day (although his morning was busy with several private
meetings), and it was still many hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, was in Philadelphia, and had
just finished a speech on energy and the environment that was
chock-a-block with ideas, aspirations, painstakingly emphasized
phrases and showy digressions, including a survey of transportation
in the 20th century that began with horses, buggies and the
environmental hazards they posed. ``Feed lots were crowding out
farmland,'' Gore noted. He then headed to a convention hall to
address union workers, effortlessly switching his focus from
pollution to occupational safety and quickly establishing that he
knew a lot about that, too. If he ever truly relaxed, it was not
evident. Then again, the reporters on his plane, Air Force Two, had
no glimpse of his cabin up front, and Gore never did drop by to say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in the span of several hours, it was: The stark
differences between the presumptive Republican and Democratic
nominees for president, the widely divergent images they project to
the world.
</P>
<P>
   One breezes past the tough stuff in an effort to remain forever
buoyant, and can come across as lighter than air. The other fairly
bludgeons listeners with all that he knows, and can come across as
aloof. Each candidate's appearances last week, tracked by reporters
who switched places to take a fresh look at the candidate they
usually did not cover, captured these contrasting styles, which
also happen to tap into the candidates' strengths and especially
their weaknesses, what they must take advantage of and what they
must overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's looseness and confidence may have something to do with
his edge over Gore in most polls, but they also threaten to strain
the appeal of levity to voters who undoubtedly want to look up to
their president. Gore's diligence may have something to do with his
need to catch up, but it also threatens to strain the appeal of
gravity to voters who undoubtedly don't want their president to
lecture them all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' days on the campaign trail last week also
revealed another potentially crucial difference. Bush, guarding an
apparent lead, let himself focus more intensely on fund raising
than on talking points, and collected about $9.5 million for the
Republican National Committee. Gore was more absorbed in making the
argument for his candidacy, and collected only about $1.5 million
for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore's fund-raisers, Bush's were closed to reporters, a
strategic decision by Republicans, who said they worried that any
discussion of the Texas governor and money served to reinforce
their reputation as the party of the rich and to remind voters that
Bush's candidacy has been fueled by an unprecedented sum of
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides even played down the tallies: The original estimate
of money raised at a Tuesday breakfast of 55 people was $3 million,
but the ultimate sum was $4 million. On Thursday, Bush did not have
a single public campaign event, but he held a fund-raiser for the
party in Dallas that brought in an estimated $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   His public appearances earlier in the week were scripted to
highlight the idea that he was a ``different kind of Republican,''
one who would reach out to the minorities _ Latinos, blacks,
immigrants, those with disabilities _ to whom his party had
appeared indifferent if not hostile over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But these events were so glancing and his level of engagement so
minimal that he raised doubts about his commitment to the process
of campaigning. He spoke in short spurts _ his longest event lasted
about 15 minutes _ and he gave the impression that his mere
presence was more important than what he actually said. He
frequently skipped over policy and details and implored his
listeners to vote for him, saying they should simply trust him,
even though, as he said at one point, ``until I'm the president,
it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll be more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke at a news conference about being a ``different
kind of Republican,'' he simply declared that the party was not
``anti-immigrant'' or ``anti-education,'' as some may have
believed. But he did not try to build an argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfairly but truthfully, our party has been tagged as being
against things,'' he told reporters in Cleveland. ``Anti-immigrant,
for example. And we're not a party of anti-immigrants. Quite the
opposite. We're a party that welcomes people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely,'' he concluded, ``I'm beginning to change
the imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the same week, he spent an evening in New York with
members of the Congress for Racial Equality, once a leading
civil-rights organization, now a collection of black conservatives.
Featured on the dais with Bush were descendants of Thomas Jefferson
and his slave, Sally Hemmings, as well as Barry Slotnick, the
lawyer for Bernhard Goetz, the subway shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed most comfortable not in front of audiences but
one-on-one on his campaign plane, where he sets a tone of easy
affability. There is an openness that is not possible on the more
formal and restricted Air Force Two. On Monday, as reporters filed
on board, the governor was standing in the press section scarfing
down pizza and ready for chit-chat and hands-on schmoozing. He
placed both paws on one reporter's shoulders, then pinched another
on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Gore did not banter all that much, but he did talk
and talk. He talked about the environment in front of a modernized
power plant in Philadelphia and about ``community empowerment'' in
a meeting hall in Columbus, Ohio. He talked about the scourge of
AIDS and ``Afro-pessimism,'' or the wrong-headed belief that
investment in Africa was a losing game.
</P>
<P>
   And he was, or at least appeared to be, in full command of each
of these topics. But he was also strangely unvarying in his
approach, so that his quasi-professorial,
follow-along-with-me-if-you-can tone of voice followed him
everywhere he went, even into a small fund-raiser late Tuesday
night in a penthouse apartment in Washington where only about 20
high-rolling donors had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   He shared a personal story or two with them, but he also shared
mini-tutorials on the evolution of the economy from the dark valley
of stagflation in the late 1970s to the current peak of prosperity.
He used the word now as a transition into each next point, the way
a college instructor proceeding through an outline would. His
pupils were standing at the edge of a plush living room, wine
glasses in their hands, in poses decidedly less starched than
Gore's language and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   That was late Tuesday; halfway through Thursday, the vice
president stood on the roof of a building jutting out into Lake
Michigan, with the skyline of Chicago as his backdrop. He was
pushing more federal spending on light rail, and mentioned that
Portland, Ore., had a nifty system, which he had seen himself. He
offered evidence in the form of lengthy aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each station celebrates the unique quality of life in
Oregon,'' Gore said. ``One of them has a scarecrow weather vane,
bronze rails and other things that are uniquely representative of
the rural heritage in that area. Another one, they had a contest
where the families participated in making the tiles themselves, and
each family had a separate tile and they all come together to make
up the stop. And some of them put their baby's footprints in the
tile.''
</P>
<P>
   This went on for well over a minute, before Gore finally said,
``Now, Chicago, of course, is another great national model for mass
transit.'' He had returned at last to the present place and time,
but it was unclear how many people in the audience were still with
him.

<P>
   For Some, Coattails Are Less Helpful
</P>
<P>
   Richard Vinroot, the Republican nominee in this year's
governor's race in North Carolina, seldom misses an opportunity to
link his candidacy to that of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Bush is
running ahead of Vice President Al Gore in most Tarheel State
presidential preference polls, and Vinroot, a former mayor of
Charlotte, knows a coattail when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   In polls, Vinroot is running behind his Democratic opponent,
state Attorney General Mike Easley.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Bush goes, so go we,'' Vinroot likes to say. And where Bush
goes when he shows up in North Carolina, Vinroot tries to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Easley has a different take on coattails. What he knows is this:
While Democrats may be dominant generally in North Carolina, only
one Democratic presidential candidate has managed to carry the
state in the last eight elections _ Jimmy Carter in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   What to do, then, when Al Gore shows up?
</P>
<P>
   It happened the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew in to give a morning commencement speech at Tarboro
High School, a few miles from Easley's hometown, Rocky Mount.
Easley did not show.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Gore appeared in Raleigh at North Carolina State
University, a jog down the road from Easley's office.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Easley did not show.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly ...
</P>
<P>
   He did show, but not until the speech was over and the crowd had
drifted off. Then the men had a talk.
</P>
<P>
   Easley says he is a good Democrat. There is no serious dispute
about that in his party. The thing to keep in mind, he says, is
that some races ``take on a life of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in his travels about the country, Gore has not run into
many races like that.
</P>
<P>
   A Losing Candidate Helps the Other Side
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago in Arkansas, state Sen. Mike Ross defeated
Dewayne Graham, a former television reporter, in a race for the
Democratic nomination in the 4th Congressional District. So when
might the party expect Graham to fall in line and endorse Ross,
considered by state and national Democratic leaders to be the best
hope to oust the four-term Republican incumbent, Rep. Jay Dickey?
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The party leaders were so taken with Ross and the help he might
give them in recapturing control of the House of Representatives
that they took the unusual step of choosing sides and endorsing him
before the primary vote. Graham was left fuming.
</P>
<P>
   And last Wednesday he went for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   He endorsed Dickey, saying somewhat enigmatically, ``He's one of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who once was a Republican and whose loss to Ross left
him $50,000 in debt, also said he might end up doing some campaign
consulting for Dickey _ on a contract basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be available,'' he said. But he insisted there was no
quid pro quo with Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats did not let that one pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have someone in effect who's broke and looking for a
job,'' said Vaughn McQuary, the state Democratic chairman. ``People
have to weigh how sincere his support for Jay Dickey is as opposed
to paying off his debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a Point in Cold Cash
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bernstein had a point to make.
</P>
<P>
   The price of prescription drugs had become an issue in the U.S.
Senate race in Nevada, as in many congressional races elsewhere.
Bernstein, the probable Democratic nominee, wanted to drive home
his assertion that former Rep. John Ensign, the Republican nominee
and the leader in the polls, was beholden to drug companies because
over the years he had accepted almost $100,000 in campaign cash
from them.
</P>
<P>
   So last Thursday in Las Vegas, when 20 elderly people came to
hear Bernstein commiserate about the price of pills and shots, he
opened up the dialogue by dumping $100,000 on the table. In cold,
hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign's acceptance of $100,000 in drug company money, Bernstein
declared, ``stands against working families, against seniors,
against Americans getting affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not stand on the side of the drug companies,'' he
added. ``I'll stand on the side of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Bernstein, who readily acknowledged that he had withdrawn
the money from his bank only a few hours earlier and would
forthwith return it, make his point?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's for real,'' said Trish Barrios, who was in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign accused Bernstein of using ``a bad political stunt'' to
launch ``an ugly personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Bernstein, a trial lawyer, ever accept any campaign money
from special interests, such as trial lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   There is ``good'' special interest money and ``bad'' special
interest money, he replied, arguing that lawyers seek only to help,
whereas drug companies seek only to gouge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Still Ahead, New Polls Show
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a
running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as
they become available. Last week, six new polls were added. Here is
how things stood over all when everything had been toted up:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led in 24 states, worth 263 electoral votes.
Vice President Al Gore led in nine states, worth 157 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.

PRESBYTERIAN LEADER'S RENEWED FOCUS: RECONCILING DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ill.)   (Eds.: See also PRESBYTERIANS-GAY-UNIONS)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ If an anniversary offers a convenient way
by which a person can measure life's progress, then June 24 was a
remarkable date for the Rev. Syngman Rhee. On that day, he was
elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the highest
office in the nation's largest Presbyterian denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The election occurred exactly half a century after Rhee had been
violently uprooted from his childhood home. ``Fifty years ago on
this very day, the Korean War broke out,'' he said, ``and I became
a refugee fleeing North Korea to the south. I was 19.'' He fled
with a younger brother, leaving his parents, an older brother and
four sisters, about whom he would hear nothing for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known figure in ecumenical circles, Rhee (who is not
related to the former South Korean president of the same name) is
the first Asian-American to hold the moderator's job in the 211
years that American Presbyterians have maintained the office, the
occupant of which serves a one-year term. He says he is excited
that he was elected in the same month that the leaders of North and
South Korea held their first summit, offering hope for
reconciliation between the two nations. That is a goal for which
Rhee has worked, as an official within the Presbyterian Church and,
in the early 1990s, as president of the National Council of
Churches, which represents 35 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee will soon embark on 12 months of nearly nonstop travel,
meeting and preaching among the denomination's churches and
seminaries. As moderator, he will have a national platform from
which to expound a message of reconciliation, not only for Korea
but also for the church, which has suffered a serious internal
rift, primarily over how its members should respond to gay men and
lesbians within their congregations. Three years ago, Presbyterians
amended their constitution to forbid ordination of noncelibate gays
as ministers, elders and deacons _ a decision that remains bitterly
opposed by a substantial minority within the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, reconciliation is like building a bridge,'' Rhee said
in an interview in a hotel here, across the street from the
convention center where the Presbyterians' General Assembly, the
policy-making body that elected him, was having its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to bring together opposing sides can be very
difficult, even personally painful. In describing his experiences
as an advocate of reconciliation between the Koreas, Rhee said, ``I
was called all kinds of names _ pro-Communist, North Korean
sympathizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhee, married and the father of three children, came to the
United States in 1956 and was ordained a minister four years later.
He received a master's from Yale Divinity School and a doctorate
from Chicago Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Until a merger in 1983, Presbyterians were divided into Northern
and Southern churches, the legacy of a split in the Civil War. In
the 1970s, Rhee worked for the Northern church, in a department
that dealt with Christians in the Middle East. In his travels, he
found that North and South Korea maintained embassies in the same
nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, at a friend's urging, he decided to contact the North
Korean Embassy in Egypt to try to obtain information about members
of his family who had remained in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital, at the war's outbreak. Rhee learned that his father _ a
Presbyterian minister who was imprisoned and died in the war _ had
been friendly with a man who later became a very high official in
the Communist government. Within days of the meeting, Rhee said, he
received an invitation from his father's former friend for a
private visit to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He hesitated, he said, out of concern that if word of the trip
got out, it could endanger his younger brother, a businessman in
South Korea, where the government was hostile to the North. But
after much prayer, he decided to go. ``Life depends on God, and God
must have a purpose in providing this unexpected opportunity,''
Rhee said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pyongyang, he was reunited with his sisters. He learned his
mother had died eight years earlier and his older brother had been
killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his theme of reconciliation, Rhee said that as a
young minister involved in the civil rights movement, he had
learned from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that in a
situation in which people are oppressed, they ultimately have the
initiative, rather than the oppressor. King told him, he said, that
the oppressed have a choice: to seek revenge for their hurts or to
forgive and seek a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness is fundamental to Christianity, Rhee said. ``Anyone
who is in Christ is a new creation,'' he said. ``We should not be
enslaved by the past, if we are looking for the possibility of a
new day.''

EDITORIAL: CONTROLLING DRUGS IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   Congress has granted the Clinton administration the $1.3 billion
it sought to help Colombia fight drug cultivation and trafficking.
But before final passage of the legislation, congressional
conferees stripped away some of the important human rights and
environmental safeguards added by the Senate. Without these
restrictions on the use of U.S. aid, the United States could find
itself drawn into the long war between the Colombian government and
leftist guerrillas, a war that neither side can expect to win by
military means. It will now be up to the White House to make sure
that U.S. involvement neither prolongs war nor weakens democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia produces more than 90 percent of the cocaine and about
two-thirds of the heroin that reaches the United States. In recent
years, Bogota's U.S.-aided effort to eradicate coca plants by
aerial spraying has been losing ground, in part because much of the
crop is grown in areas where government control is weak and the
guerrillas are the most powerful military force. The close
intertwining of drug-control efforts with the army's war against
the guerrillas means that unless Washington proceeds with care, it
could find U.S. prestige and even U.S. support troops at risk in a
prolonged and open-ended military entanglement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new money will go to arm, train and support
Colombia's army and police. The army, in particular, has an abysmal
human rights record. The Senate bill would have halted aid if
Colombia failed to punish abusive officers. But the conferees
authorized the White House to waive this provision by claiming that
America's national security requires action against drugs. Also
eliminated were Senate restrictions on the use of pesticides that
harm human health or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, has worked hard to start
peace negotiations with the guerrillas. Successful talks could
allow more settled conditions in Colombia's drug-growing regions
and give their inhabitants economic alternatives to coca farming.
This would do far more to fight drugs and bring stability to
Colombia than would expanded military operations. The Clinton
administration must ensure that U.S. aid reinforces democracy and
contributes to a negotiated peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a plane to Florida this year, I sat with a woman of 60, on
her way to her winter home. Her latest boyfriend, a businessman of
almost 70, had acquired a certain cachet in his peer group when
sued by a young woman employee for sexual harassment. That did not
bother my planemate so much because she believed him when he said
the woman came after him, and so did the jury at the trial. But it
troubled her mother, who is 85, and who found out about it when her
fifth husband, who is 91, saw notice of it in a business journal he
gets at his office.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that story said a lot about the advancing vitality of
old age in America. In Florida again recently, I shared it at
dinner with two friends. She is 72 and works full time, which she
started doing after getting a master's degree in her 40s, when her
children were grown. He is 76 and volunteers full time, which he
started doing when he retired from his position as a corporate
officer at 63. They were just back from a weekend visiting their
mothers. Hers, at 96, has grown depressed and withdrawn. His, at
104, still keeps her checkbook and goes out shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about that on the treadmill in a gym in Tampa, I looked
around one afternoon. The youngest people straining among the
weights were high school boys. The others, men and women taking
time out from their day, ranged from twenty- to seventysomethings.
The oldest was a woman I know of 84, who played doubles tennis
until last year and just gave up selling real estate. Her own
mother visited friends in nursing homes until she was 102. She
stopped because she got tired of trying to make conversation with
people who kept falling asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has stories like that to tell now. At least, everyone
in Florida does. At a conference on aging at the University of
South Florida not long ago, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida told about
the picnic for 45 centenarians in Tallahassee that had to be
postponed because half of them could not make it. They were away on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: At what point does the change in lives and
habits require us to redefine what we mean by old age? The answer
is now. The physical extension of life, as the Nobel laureate Gary
Becker suggested earlier this year, may be the greatest single
achievement of the 20th century, and could well prove to be the
greatest single influence on the century just begun. But
redefinitions do not come easily. For all the daily evidence of an
aging culture _ and for all the popular excitement about the map of
the human genome _ the work of reconceiving old age, and of
recrafting the language of longevity, is just beginning to find its
way.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Harris Poll conducted for the National Council on Aging
found that almost half the people between 65 and 69 now consider
themselves middle-aged. So do one-third of people in their 70s.
Eighty-four percent of the respondents said they would be happy to
live to 90. Many, in fact, seem pretty happy right now. Only about
half the number of people over 65 who called poor health a very
serious problem in 1974 say it is today. Only 4 percent think
loneliness is a very serious problem. By contrast, three times as
many people between 18 and 24 feel lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the responses of people who feel younger, healthier
and less isolated than their parents did at the same age 25 years
ago. They also retire earlier, although there are signs that trend
may be ending. Only 38 percent of people over 55 are still in the
work force today, as opposed to 57 percent in 1965. Seventy percent
of recipients draw Social Security before they reach 65. There have
been reams of stories about all this. But what to call this new,
longer, more leisured and apparently enjoyable late stage of life?
These older people who do not feel old? The term that has migrated
from Britain is ``the third age,'' but at a conference in
Washington last month, Dr. Elliott Jaques made a try at a new
phrase. It was Jaques who began to speak and write of ``midlife
crisis'' when he was 38, a psychologist seeing middle-aged patients
who had begun to agonize that they might have reached the peak of
life. Now, at 83, with ``23 to 25 years tacked onto my life by two
heart valve replacements,'' he thinks a lot about what he declines
to call old age.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested a new name, ``third stage adulthood,'' the first
being 18 to 40, the second 40 to 62, and the third 62 to 85. It
doesn't exactly capture the moment the way ``midlife crisis'' did.
But then the moment is still expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether we are pushing up against the limit of
real life expectancy, or pushing life expectancy farther out,''
said Dr. Robert L. Kahn after listening to Jaques. A professor
emeritus of psychology and public health at the University of
Michigan, with a shock of white hair, he is the co-author of
``Successful Aging,'' published last year and based on the
MacArthur Foundation's study of aging in America. His own mother
died of hypertension at 51, his grandmother at 59. Kahn takes
medication, goes to the gym three times a week, and is trim and
quick at 81. He is, in a way, at the top of his game, and he
expects to attend a lot more conferences before a new language for
(old) age falls in place.

A DAY TO REMEMBER FOR A YOUNG CATCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., N.Y.)   By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be a long time before the vivid recollections of June 6
fade from Brian Esposito's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito, a catcher from the University of Connecticut out of
New York's Staten Island, was jubilant after learning he was
selected by the Boston Red Sox in the fifth round of the
major-league draft on the first Tuesday in June.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not enough good news for one day, Esposito's
brother, Troy, a junior on the Tottenville High School baseball
team, was playing in the city championship at the home of the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was following the draft on the Internet and listening, on
the radio, to my brother actually playing in Yankee Stadium,''
Esposito said. ``I was going back and forth between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could diminish Esposito's good spirits, not even
Tottenville's falling to Monroe, 7-5, in the Public Schools
Athletic League Class A championship. ``It was a great day for
us,'' Esposito concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox monitored Esposito during his junior season at
UConn. Impressed with his combination of athleticism and a sturdy
6-foot-1-inch, 195-pound frame, the Red Sox invited Esposito for a
private workout at Fenway Park in the days leading up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito did not disappoint in the tryout, hitting seven home
runs over the Green Monster in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of scouts and instructors from the entire
organization there,'' Esposito said. ``It was a great thrill to be
on the field. Things worked out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that, if I worked hard enough, my future success would
come down to fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Esposito and Boston are continuing, but a
deal could come in the next week to 10 days. Although he is eager
to start professional ball, Esposito said he would return to UConn
if contract talks reached an impasse. Once he signs a contract,
Esposito will report to Class A Lowell in Massachusetts and will
most likely remain there for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to many scouts because of his defensive abilities,
Esposito proved he can be productive at the plate this past season,
batting .275 in 45 games, scoring 25 runs with 28 runs batted in
and 2 home runs. In three years with the Huskies, Esposito batted
.308 with 88 rbi, 84 runs and 9 home runs. Meanwhile, the Huskies
(32-17), ranked No. 1 last season in New England in Division I
baseball, finished with a school-record 32 victories and made their
first Big East tournament appearance since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's defensive skills are the best part of his game,''
UConn Coach Andy Baylock said.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito, wanting to stay close to home, was drawn to UConn,
whose baseball program had a good reputation. Still, he
acknowledges that there are drawbacks to playing college ball in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions are difficult to deal with on a daily basis,''
Esposito said. ``During the spring, it could be 30 degrees one day,
60 the next, and back to 30. Hitters can't drive the ball hard and
pitchers can't throw the ball hard. It affects the draft status of
a lot of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito is no stranger to taking the difficult athletic path;
how else to explain his settling on catcher? In fact, Esposito
never showed any desire to play anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been catching since I was 9 years old,'' Esposito said.
``When I was that age, everyone else in Little League was either 11
or 12, so while they got to play more flashy positions like
shortstop or center field because it looks cool, I thought, `Why
not be catcher?' I haven't wanted to switch positions since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he added: ``I'm in good enough shape that I don't have to
worry about minor injuries or the toll it takes playing the
position. It's not as if I mind getting hit by baseballs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of attitude that has earned him the respect of
his teammates. Normally, college captaincy is bestowed on seniors,
but Esposito was voted in by his Husky teammates as a junior, not
to the surprise of Baylock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I equate the catching position to the quarterback position
because both come with a tremendous amount of pressure and require
a lot of leadership,'' Baylock said. ``With Brian, he emanates
leadership. Even when he is in a slump, he is still an exceptional
leader. He doesn't let anything get him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even going from the captain of his college team to rookie
draft pick on a minor league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming responsibility is a big part of being a baseball
team,'' Esposito said. ``I wouldn't describe myself as a rah-rah
type of guy, but I like being one of the guys in charge and taking
a leadership position. I call it `driving the train.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Esposito hurries, he can catch the Green Line to Fenway.

EDITORIAL: THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   Now that Congress has passed the first campaign finance reform
in 21 years, Washington is filled with an air of
self-congratulation. That is understandable. But the best way to
celebrate is for principled lawmakers to press for broader
disclosure requirements and a ban on ``soft money'' to political
parties this year. The bill approved last week would force certain
tax-exempt slush funds that run campaign ads to reveal their
spending and financing sources. By the time it was approved, many
opponents had jumped on board and were actually trying to claim
credit for its passage. Their belated eagerness to get right on
this issue should now be exploited to make more progress on purging
American campaigns of special-interest money.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation restricting secret fund-raising was a
significant step forward, but its impact should not be exaggerated.
Some of the shadowy tax-exempt groups affected by the bill are now
expected to transform themselves into for-profit shell corporations
and continue their practices. Other nonprofit groups may also run
ads. It is still legal for groups without tax exemptions to raise
money and run sham campaign ads like the ones attacking Sen. John
McCain that were organized by donors to Gov. George W. Bush last
March.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to clean up the system is embodied in the
McCain-Feingold bill, which has been blocked by Trent Lott, the
Republican Senate leader. It would outlaw soft money to political
parties and prevent the use of corporate and union money for sham
issue ads close to an election. Individuals financing such ads
would be subject to disclosure requirements. Most senators support
this approach, but not enough for the 60 votes needed to break the
usual filibusterengineered by Lott and his fund-raiser in chief,
Mitch McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Once Lott dropped his opposition to the disclosure bill last
week, it sailed through the Senate by a vote of 92-6. But earlier,
when Lott was pressing Republicans to oppose it, eight Republicans
not normally in favor of campaign reform voted for it. All are
running for re-election this year, some in tough races, suggesting
their sensitivity to voters on the issue. They should not now be
allowed to go home and claim they are for clean campaigns unless
they line up for more effective legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the holiday weekend, voters encountering Sens. William Roth
of Delaware, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Spencer Abraham of
Michigan can make this point.
</P>
<P>
   As for the constitutional arguments on reform, a darkly comic
moment in the Senate last week should long be remembered for the
way it revealed the hypocrisy involved. McConnell, a self-described
expert on the Constitution, lectured his colleagues on the
purported violations of the document in the slush-fund disclosure
bill. Then, defying his own logic, he urged Republicans in tough
re-election fights to vote for a bill he had just declared
unconstitutional so they could avoid being tarred as anti-reform.
Clearly, McConnell will say anything to hold onto power and also
preserve the right of big money to buy influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The other important lesson last week lay in the shattering of
conventional wisdom. As usual, the politicians and Sunday talk-show
pundits had assured one another that the disclosure bill had no
chance this year. When will these so-called ``experts'' realize
what a disservice they do by parroting the cynical spin control of
those who live off the corrupt status quo? Again and again,
Americans are lectured by these people that campaign reform is not
a salient issue, even though McCain ignited the voters with it
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do care about campaign reform. Their desire for
financially clean campaigns is one reason for the widespread
cynicism among voters in recent years. If lawmakers want to push
some of that cynicism back, they have only to listen to the people
who sent them to office in the first place. Then we will see even
more retreating by Lott and McConnell.

THE BOSTON AREA ADJUSTS TO RENT DEREGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years after Massachusetts voters ended rent
regulation _ or, more precisely, ended it in Boston, Brookline and
Cambridge, the three cities that still had some form of rent
control _ rents have taken sizable jumps, the cities are spiffier
and less pockmarked by deteriorating neighborhoods and many poorer
people have been forced to move to communities farther from the
urban core.
</P>
<P>
   While no overall study of the effects of the end of controls on
rents has been made, a survey by a leading landlord in Cambridge
found that rents for his company's formerly controlled apartments
had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy of the Boston area booming, landlord and tenant
advocates, politicians and academics who study housing all agree
that the degree to which rent deregulation itself produced those
effects is impossible to determine. Yet, for good or ill, they all
see deregulation as a factor in the changing faces of the three
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we enjoy an especially strong rental market,'' said
Edwin J. Shanahan, the executive director of the Greater Boston
Real Estate Board. ``Demand continues to outpace supply.'' That is
caused by several factors, Shanahan said, ``not the least of which
was the 25 years when we had rent control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over those decades nobody would come into Boston, Brookline or
Cambridge to build rental housing,'' he said. ``So we essentially
ended up with 25 years of no measurable increase in supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of rent regulation, Shanahan said, ``we've seen
substantial rehabilitation of our housing stock in those three
communities, and a tremendous increase in the number of developers
looking to develop'' _ although so far there has been a lot more
interest than actual development, he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Dreier, Boston's housing director from 1984 to 1992
and now a professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los
Angeles, is not so sanguine. ``What Boston shows is that a rising
tide does not lift all boats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor and working-class families are squeezed,'' Dreier said.
``If you're a waiter, a chambermaid, even a schoolteacher or a
nurse, you have to pay half your income or more to put a roof over
your head. And if you're really poor, you're going to be doubling
and tripling up.''
</P>
<P>
   Or moving out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Dian Weaver, 31, a divorced mother of three, used to live in a
six-unit building in a poorer section of Cambridge. She was paying
$300 a month when rent control ended in 1995. By 1998, the rent was
$600, and she had to move.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who refuses to go on welfare, kept her jobs at two
restaurants in Cambridge, earning about $500 a week. She moved to
Attleboro, Mass., and now commutes to work by train, an hour each
way. The rent for her old apartment, ``last I heard,'' she said:
``$850.''
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum on Nov. 8, 1994, residents of Massachusetts _
though lacking a majority in each of the three affected cities _
ended rent regulation by a vote of 1,034,594 to 980,723, or 51 to
49 percent. The referendum had been spurred, particularly, by a
coalition of small-property owners in Cambridge, which had the most
stringent form of rent control covering most of the apartments in a
city dominated by renters. The impact of rent regulation in Boston
and Brookline had been muted in recent years by vacancy decontrol.
In all, about 100,000 units were decontrolled on Jan. 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   No comprehensive study of the effects of deregulation in the
three cities has since been conducted. But in Boston, according to
Elizabeth Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Mayor Thomas Menino, the
average rent for two-bedroom apartments hit $1,550 in 1999, up 75.1
percent from $882 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best available barometer is a study by Alex
Steinbergh, a principal of Resource Capital Group, a large landlord
in Cambridge, which used as a sample the 242 deregulated units in
the 15 buildings the company owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sample showed that as of November 1999, the average rent
for all of the previously rent-controlled units essentially
doubled, from $510 to $1,016,'' Steinbergh said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The survey also showed that 89 of the 242 formerly
rent-controlled units, or 37 percent, had the same tenant as in
January 1995. ``Now the rents of those tenants, on average, went up
from $577 to $967,'' Steinbergh said, a 68 percent increase. ``So
those tenants' rents weren't going up as much as new tenants'.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Steinbergh's apartments were already on the open market
at the time of deregulation, ``and the average increase on those
market-rate units was 31 percent, from $1,025 to $1,343,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent meandering drive through Cambridge, Steinbergh
pointed out that, ``if you pick streets at random, you'll find
rehab work on virtually every one.'' And, indeed, like rainbow
sprinkles on a sundae, bright pastel shingles in an array of shades
adorned the sides of grand old buildings _ many with turret-like
bay windows and stately porticos _ on block after block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exteriors have been fixed up, and inside there are new
heating systems, electrical, plumbing,'' Steinbergh said. ``We
think about a third of the 15,000 formerly controlled units have
done some rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar patterns of housing rehabilitation were evident in
Boston. And while Menino was proud of the facelifting and economic
rejuvenation of many neighborhoods, he was unequivocal in his
assessment of rent deregulation: ``A disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the City address on Jan. 11, the mayor declared
affordable housing one of his highest priorities. ``We have an
obligation to make sure that prosperity doesn't price people out,''
he said. ``A stable economy needs workers at every level. And a
stable city needs a variety of housing for a variety of incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Menino said: ``We're losing the middle class. I
know a situation in South Boston where this young couple has gone
up in the last year over $600 a month in rent. And there's no way
to combat that; they are at the mercy of the landlord. The affluent
are moving to our city in record numbers. But our homeless family
numbers have gone up 10 percent over the last year.'' The city's
vacancy rate is 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Menino said, ``is that there aren't any rental
housing proposals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent control came off and the housing industry said they will
help us build new housing,'' the mayor said. ``Well, it's five
years later and I'm still waiting for the industry to come forward
with new housing proposals; any kind, but affordable housing for
the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Million-dollar luxury homes; there are some of those being
built in our city,'' the mayor continued, ``obviously not for the
working person.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan of the real estate board said that the lack of
development of affordable housing ``essentially has to do with the
inordinate delays one encounters in trying to work through the maze
of permits and approvals that are required in a city as old as
Boston and with as much neighborhood activism as Boston enjoys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' he said, ``when you are looking at a 2{-year
process to find out whether you are even going to be able to play,
the game requires a significant amount of capital to be put at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the mayor responded: ``I don't believe that. If you
come up with a good proposal for rental housing in our city, we
will expedite it.''

A GIFT OF CONTEMPLATIVE DAYS FOR LIBRARY CENTER'S FELLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a year hidden away at the New York Public
Library, Paul Berman, a journalist and cultural critic, was finally
ready to meet his public, with an impressionistic lecture that
touched on religion, sex and Spanish imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong talk by Berman, one of the first 15 fellows at the
library's new Center for Scholars and Writers, focused on two Latin
American poets, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Ruben Dario. He
recited long quotations of poetry in Spanish, sometimes
passionately, then offered his own English translations. He did not
use notes. It was almost like performance art.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, no one in the small audience asked any
questions. At earlier lectures by library fellows _ one about the
letters of Arturo Toscanini, the Italian conductor, another about
the children's books of William Godwin, an anarchist political
philosopher _ there had been excited chatter and raised hands.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, 50, the author of ``A Tale of Two Utopias: The Political
Journey of the Generation of 1968,'' could not explain the
reaction, just his lecture. ``It was presented as a work of art,''
he said. ``It was presented as an adventure in poetry. It was not a
polemic. People were puzzled. What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   The awkward moment was an extreme example of the difficulties
faced by the library's new center as it tries to find a public
face. In a somewhat utopian effort to create an intellectual
community, 15 fellows were thrown together in a renovated suite of
offices on the northeastern corner of the landmark Humanities and
Social Sciences Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year residency, one of the more generously endowed
humanities fellowships in the country, comes with a stipend of
$50,000 and a housing allowance for out-of-towners. The fellows
included novelists, historians, journalists, university-based
scholars, a doctor and a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The public had only a few opportunities to learn what the
library fellows were up to. Aside from the series of five free
lectures, including Berman's in early May, the fellows mostly kept
to themselves, though early on they did ask one another, how would
the center make use of its prominent address? What would be its
public face?
</P>
<P>
   Other humanities institutes have faced the same question. ``It's
a paradox,'' said Jocelyn Carlson Baltzell, former associate
director of the New York Institute for the Humanities, a sort of
lunch club for intellectuals in Greenwich Village, and now the
associate director of the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's mixing two irreconcilable aspects of intellectual
life,'' she said. ``In medieval terms, there is a life of action
and a life of contemplation, two separate lives. How could you
possibly blend them? You get a hybrid.''
</P>
<P>
   The library fellows devoted their days to contemplating, reading
and writing in glass- and oak-paneled offices equipped with
computers and louvered hardwood blinds that snapped shut for
privacy. They shared a communal telephone and met over a buffet
lunch in the lecture room every day. Offerings from the library's
vast collections were delivered at least twice daily on a rolling
cart.
</P>
<P>
   The time seemed to melt away. On the last official day of the
program on May 26, they swapped practical advice on how to download
documents onto computer disks. They packed their books and boxes
and traded e-mail addresses. One of the more important memos
circulating was a list of the best pastry and coffee shops in
Vienna, compiled by Christian Fleck, a sociologist from Austria.
Some leftover Champagne materialized at lunch. There was a tinge of
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Prose, a novelist who is writing a book on the lives of
women known principally for having been muses to well-known
artists, said the intellectual dividends of the program will become
apparent from work produced by the fellows. ``For me, the great
beauty of it was the ability to do my work,'' she said. ``Sure,
it's nice if all that other stuff happens. But every moment I got
to be in my office working is a real blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Graham Burnett, a historian, found that having the time to
read in solitude was precious indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of scholarship is really reading,'' said Burnett,
who had a futon delivered to his office because he does not read
well sitting up.
</P>
<P>
   The center's leading donors, Dorothy Cullman, and her husband,
Lewis B. Cullman, insisted that writers be included in the mixture
of fellows to spice things up. They gave $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve fellows were named by an anonymous selection committee
after a rigorous application process. Three were chosen by the
center's director, Peter Gay, the Yale historian. The applicants
had to demonstrate that their work would benefit directly from
access to the library's collections.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the first class of fellows last year, the
library's president, Paul LeClerc, had said that he envisioned the
center ``as becoming a great intellectual spark plug in the life of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, LeClerc said that he would not abandon
the spark plug metaphor. ``A certain amount of sparks happened this
year, and we'll see more in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was shared by Gay, 77, the author of more than 20
books on subjects including the Enlightenment, Sigmund Freud and
bourgeois culture. ``We'd like New York to notice that we're here,
but they will,'' he said. ``I'm very optimistic about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some similar programs are more ambitious in their public
outreach, like the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina, which holds monthly lectures, concerts,
exhibitions and an occasional large public conference. But the
library fellowship's low profile is not a surprise to some in the
intellectual world. Stanley N. Katz, president emeritus of the
American Council of Learned Societies, said LeClerc and Gay were
``traditional and cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a fellowship program faces a delicate balancing act
when it tries to engage the public, Katz said, because fellows
``will only come to this sort of thing if they will have time
primarily to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And Baltzell said she believes such centers are elitist by their
nature. ``The idea of evangelical intellectuals is an oxymoron,''
she said. ``To go out with a missionary purpose is antithetical to
the contemplative life.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the library's 15 fellows, Andrew Delbanco, a Columbia
University professor, said he expects the center's relationship
with the public to evolve. ``In its first few months, it's finding
its way,'' he said. ``I would like to see the engagement of the
center with the larger life of the city deepened and developed for
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in private, the library fellows found that their best
intentions sometimes fell short. Earlier this year, two of them,
Anthony Holden, a British journalist and biographer, and Dr. Howard
Markel, a pediatrician and medical historian, started weekly
discussions of Dickens' ``Bleak House'' with three other fellows.
(Holden is researching a book on Leigh Hunt, the English poet,
critic and essayist, who is caricatured in the novel, and Markel
has written five scholarly papers on Dickens and medicine.)
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow, Pamela Clemit, a specialist in British Romantic
literature, had taught the novel at the University of Durham in
England. But she said she was told only belatedly about the
discussions. By then, the discussions had collapsed because of
conflicting schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The fellows often exchanged ideas over lunch. At one informal
lunch talk, Sven Beckert, a history professor at Harvard, told the
other fellows that he had decided to write a book about cotton to
get at issues of global business.
</P>
<P>
   The hands of fellows shot up. Ada Louise Huxtable, the
architectural historian and critic, offered that labor relations in
the early mill villages were coercive, that workers were virtually
indentured servants. Kathleen Neal Cleaver, a professor who was the
first woman on the Black Panthers' central committee and the former
wife of Eldridge Cleaver, noted that land was available for cotton
farming only because the Army had cleared it of Indians. The
pediatrician made a point about cotton and disease. One of the
novelists suggested a narrative about how a bale of cotton came to
be distributed. The Latin America specialist suggested a comparison
with coffee. Delbanco wondered whether coercion was too broad a
term to encompass both factory wage labor and slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, wondered about the role of the state, observing, ``It's
more complicated than you make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckert nodded politely. Later, he said: ``That was the great
thing about the center. It brought people from very different
perspectives together.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the departing fellows had no complaints. After all,
the program had given them handsome stipends and nice offices for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver, for one, said she felt part of a special group because
it was the first, and she said that the group could be quite
different five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But she could not help noting that in its first year, it was not
particularly diverse, either by gender or race. ``How could it not
strike you?'' she said. ``This is New York City. It is a raucously
diverse city, and that's not the way you would describe the
collection of scholars.''

ADS COURT BRIGHT, BORED PROFESSIONALS TO TEACH IN TROUBLED NYC
SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The advertisements, in stark black and white, began
appearing in newspapers and on Web sites in June. ``Four out of
five fourth graders in our city's most challenged schools fail to
meet state standards in reading and writing,'' they said. ``Are you
willing to do something about it?''
</P>
<P>
   With that blunt appeal, Schools Chancellor Harold Levy hopes to
persuade dozens of New Yorkers to drop whatever jobs they are doing
and teach in New York City's most troubled schools this fall. All
college graduates with at least 3.0 grade point averages can apply,
no matter how sparse their teaching experience and credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Levy will choose 250 of the applicants _ who so far
include bankers, lawyers, social workers, a speech writer, an
acupuncturist, a zoo keeper and a judge _ to join a new program
called New York City Teaching Fellows. The new teachers will work
in failing schools starting this fall, earning the starting salary
of $31,910, and the city will pay for them to get master's degrees
and will provide other support.
</P>
<P>
   Though the program is similar to Teach for America, the national
organization that places recent college graduates in urban schools,
it is aimed at slightly older people who have been working for at
least several years. Most of the applicants have already tried at
least one career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aiming for people who may have decided the job they are
doing is not spiritually satisfying,'' Levy said. ``We are drawing
in some extraordinarily gifted applicants, and it will be a great
challenge to see whether we can keep them in the system and get
their enthusiasm to be infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 people have applied so far, a number that board
officials say is promising considering that they began publicizing
the program only two weeks ago. The board is hoping to select the
250 fellows by the end of July and to put them through a rigorous
one-month training session (board officials call it ``boot camp'')
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal is to help the city meet a new state
requirement that only certified teachers work in failing schools,
known as ``schools under registration review.'' Last year, New York
City violated the requirement by hiring nearly 600 uncertified
teachers to work in its 99 failing schools when it could not find
enough certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the teaching fellows would be uncertified at first,
they would complete the required course work at the City University
of New York over the next two years, a plan that Levy hopes will be
acceptable to the state Board of Regents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The program is also a test of sorts for a larger effort to
recruit people from other fields to teach in all 1,100 city
schools. The regents are to vote in August on whether to allow such
programs in school districts statewide.
</P>
<P>
   If the teaching fellows program works, it might be the model for
a permanent ``alternate route'' program for New York City teachers.
But the board is also considering other possibilities, like
training prospective teachers itself instead of having them take
courses at City University.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said in an interview that he wanted to lure teachers from
other professions mostly because the state's education schools were
not turning out nearly enough teachers to meet the city's needs.
This year alone, the Board of Education hired 9,000 new teachers,
60 percent of whom were uncertified.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy also said he believed that ambitious, talented people
from other fields could be an asset to the school system and bring
fresh ideas. ``The challenge,'' he said, ``will be getting our act
together enough to support these people once they're in the system
instead of leaving them out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The board plans to spend about $4 million on the program in the
coming school year, most of which will cover the cost of graduate
courses for the new teachers. The board has also hired the New
Teacher Project, a consulting group affiliated with Teach for
America, to help advertise the program, select the fellows and give
them adequate support during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks know how to bring in talented people, how to keep
them enthusiastic, how to train them to do a good job in the
classroom,'' Levy said. ``We need their help because, with the best
intentions, the system currently does every conceivable thing to
make it difficult for them to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 99 failing schools where the teaching fellows will
be working _ mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx _ have the highest
teacher turnover rates in the city. Young, inexperienced teachers
are the most likely to leave, frustrated by the lack of resources
and guidance, the intense pressure to improve student performance
and the daunting array of problems that their students bring to
school.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the teaching fellows' situation would be different
because they would have constant support. Taking a cue from Teach
for America, the program will provide each teaching fellow with a
mentor _ possibly a senior teacher, although such arrangements have
had only limited success in the past. Teachers from City University
will periodically observe each fellow on the job. And all 250
fellows will meet every few months to discuss their experiences and
offer advice.
</P>
<P>
   The New Teacher Project was responsible for the eye-catching
advertisements for the Teaching Fellows program and made sure they
appeared in places where young professionals were likely to see
them: in The New York Times and The Village Voice, for example, and
in Time Out, the weekly entertainment magazine. In the coming
weeks, the ads will also appear on popular Web sites like
Citysearch.com and Zagat.com. In addition, the New Teacher Project
is sending mass e-mail messages to college alumni organizations and
volunteer groups.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At an informational session on Wednesday night, about 150
would-be teachers, most in their 20s and 30s, packed into a
conference room at McKinsey &AMP; Co., a consulting firm on East 53rd
Street that donated space for the event. Were the neighborhoods
where they would be teaching safe, they wanted to know. Would their
classrooms have computers? Would applicants who attended New York
City schools have an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Robbyn Hasberry, a corporate recruiter, said she had recently
realized that the business world ``is not my calling.'' Hasberry,
who is black and majored in education at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook, said part of the reason she wanted to
teach in New York City was to help make the the city's teaching
force more racially diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because
she did not want her employer, a financial services company, to
know that she was applying to the program, said she was earning a
lot of money _ about three times the $31,900 starting salary for
city teachers _ but that her job was unfulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to an office every day and do these projects and they
all start to blur,'' said the woman, who is 35 and lives in
Greenwich Village. ``And you start looking for something with more
value. I saw the ad and it answered the question, `What can I do to
make the world a better place?' I would be completely remiss to not
at least check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people conceded that they did not know whether they
could get by in the city on a teacher's salary, and that it might
prevent them from joining the program. But Levy _ who until
recently made more than $500,000 a year as a corporate lawyer and
now makes $245,000 as chancellor _ said he believed that the lower
pay would not be a major deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people want a sense of satisfaction that what
they are doing is important to the larger social order,'' he said.
``This is an opportunity for people with dedication and social
conscience and drive to make good on their altruistic impulses.''

HOW THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR TROUBLES AT HOME DURING EURO 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ While mourning their country's early exit from the
European championships on June 20, Germans also had reason to heave
a sigh of relief. It was a victory of sorts that the poor play of
the German team and not the rowdy behavior of German hooligans had
been the dominant topic of conversation during the first round of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that our team did not perform well at Euro 2000,''
said Rainer Lingenthal, spokesman for the German Interior Ministry.
``But off the field, our security measures to keep hooligans away
from the tournament proved very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of how success at major soccer events is gauged
these days. The indelible memory left by Germans at the 1998 World
Cup was that of the brutal attack on a French gendarme by four
hooligans. Determined to avoid a repeat of this type of incident at
the European championships, the German government enacted drastic
measures to keep hooligans out of the co-host countries, Belgium
and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the start of the tournament, the German
parliament amended a law that forbids foreign travel to citizens
who pose a ``significant threat to national interests and image''
to expressly include soccer hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of local police departments, the Interior Ministry
created a list of 3,000 hooligans whom it felt were likely to
travel to the tournament merely to engage in violent behavior. The
police visited these hooligans, labeled Category C, at home and
told them their presence at the games was not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, 508 of the Category C hooligans were
informed by mail that they were legally barred from traveling to
Belgium and the Netherlands. The letter stated that failure to
comply with this ban could result in a one-year jail sentence. The
German government says it feels validated in the measures it took
to keep the tournament as hooligan free as possible. While there
were still instances of hooliganism by Germans, they were far fewer
than had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to keep known troublemakers away from the
tournament,'' Lingenthal said. ``We feel we did that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the fans cited by authorities was Dirk Wunram, 30, a
native of Berlin. He wanted nothing more than to attend the
tournament, but instead was one of 215 people forced to sign in at
his local police precinct on days Germany had a game.
</P>
<P>
   Wunram is clean-cut and does not give off any signal of being a
dangerous man. But a six-page police document chronicling his
activities on the German hooligan scene tells of dozens of acts of
violence at and around soccer matches in Germany and abroad since
1993. After his most recent arrest for his involvement in a bloody
brawl after a soccer match in Berlin in May 1999, Wunram was given
a two-year ban from all German soccer stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Far from making apologies for his violent past, Wunram, an
unemployed carpenter, considers himself a victim of circumstances.
He fails to understand why people find his ``hobby'' so distasteful
and calls the times he spent as a soccer hooligan ``the best of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooliganism is a sport,'' Wunram said recently, speaking
openly for the first time about his decadelong experiences on the
scene. ``There's a lot of strategy and tactical planning involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep people like Wunram in Germany, security was
tightened at border crossings into Belgium, the Netherlands and
France. Thorough searches of vehicles meant milelong traffic jams
but yielded 158 potential hooligans who were sent back to Germany.
Hans-Juergen Goldmann of the German border police said these
searches succeeded in keeping ``most of the bad ones'' from leaving
the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The English government, in contrast, chose not to increase its
powers to keep hooligans at home during the tournament and
experienced a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by the Belgian police, more than
half of the 503 people arrested before the Germany-England match in
Charleroi, Belgium, on June 17 were English, about 140 were German
and 80 were from Belgium. Before a loss on June 20 eliminated
England from the tournament, UEFA, the governing body of soccer in
Europe, had considered removing it from the competition as a result
of the problems caused by British hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the German Interior Ministry, its strategy for
maintaining order at the tournament was created on a
person-by-person basis in close consultation with state police
units specializing in sports-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Friedrich Loesel, a German hooligan expert, helped his
government create psychological profiles of hooligans. He said
Wunram was typical of the older and more sinister type of hooligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older ones like him are particularly dangerous because
they assume a leadership role,'' Loesel said. ``They tend to be
more intelligent and demand that their young recruits go to lengths
to prove how violent they can be. That is how things spin out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Wunram casually narrates his evolution from soccer fan to soccer
hooligan, fondly recalling the spine-tingling sensation of seeing
his first game at the Berlin Olympic Stadium when he was 11. The
pure joy of sitting in a sold-out soccer stadium, cheering on the
home team, did not last long, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the game just became secondary,'' Wunram said.
``The things going on around the game were much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Those things were fights between rival hooligan factions,
sometimes involving battles between hooligans with allegiances to a
particular team and sometimes involving alliances of hooligans
representing a geographic region of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think of these people as fans of the game is ridiculous,''
Loesel said. ``Although some may start that way, they all end up as
fans of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wunram's actions at a German national team exhibition match in
1996 in Poland cemented his reputation as one of the country's more
infamous hooligans. The report on Wunram by the Berlin police
identifies him as a member of the drunken mob that chanted, ``We've
marched into Poland to thrash the Jews again,'' one of many taunts
that precipitated a postgame brawl. According to the report, this
incident tarnished Germany's image and was grounds enough to keep
Wunram away from the European championships.
</P>
<P>
   With a strange sense of moral relativism, Wunram adamantly
defends his hooliganism. He even hopes to return to it once his
stadium ban ends, regretting only that government restrictions are
making it hard for older hooligans to groom ``young talent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me that what I did was wrong,'' Wunram said.
``Nobody can say that I didn't live my life to the absolute fullest
during these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Loesel, concerned about sports-related violence in all its
manifestations, has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our psychological profiles indicate that about 25 percent of
hooligans are clinically psychopathic,'' Loesel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a higher percentage than one finds among inmates in
German prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   When Germany was eliminated from the European championships,
Wunram woke up the next morning thinking he was a free man. Then he
found another letter in his mailbox informing him that the police
are maintaining the travel ban on him until the tournament
concludes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is leaving nothing to chance. It and South Africa have
emerged as front-runners to play host to the 2006 World Cup. The
winner will be chosen on Thursday in Zurich.

NEW YORK APPLE TOURS BUSES RETURN TO MANHATTAN STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Apple Tours' red double-decker buses
returned to the streets of Manhattan this weekend for the first
time in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's 63 buses were out by 6 a.m. Saturday in
the second day of operation since a panel of state court judges on
Monday rebuffed efforts by the city and state to sideline the buses
while regulators tried to shut the company down permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has been cited for hundreds of regulatory and
safety violations in its nine years of carrying tourists around the
city, became a target of city and state authorities after an
accident on May 22 when an Apple bus struck and killed a
71-year-old actor at 45th Street and Ninth Avenue in Hell's
Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki issued an order pulling the registration of
the company's 63 buses pending the outcome of an administrative
hearing that the city had started before the accident in an attempt
to shut down New York Apple Tours. The city was acting on
complaints that many New York Apple drivers did not have a
commercial driver's license, that the buses were not
environmentally certified and that they were being driven illegally
along cross streets.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple challenged the order, saying it violated the
company's rights to due process, and on June 14 a state Supreme
Court judge in Manhattan agreed, reversing the governor's order and
appointing a former city official to monitor the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the city and state appealed, keeping the buses off the
streets _ and hundreds of New York Apple employees out of work _
until the appellate court ruling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square Business Improvement District and New York City
&AMP; Co., the convention and visitors bureau, had removed New York
Apple brochures from their offices and from information packets
given to tourists. Community advocates in Hell's Kitchen said they
were planning to post flyers to warn tourists about New York
Apple's problems in the West 40s and 50s between Avenue of the
Americas and Ninth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning Saturday, the buses _ packed with foreign
tourists and others from across the country _ were winding along
crowded streets in neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and the
Rockefeller Center area.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers did not know _ or even care _ about New York
Apple's troubles with the authorities. They were just there for the
ride, snapping pictures and looking up at skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   John Avery, 62, a tourist from Birmingham, England, got on a
tour bus at West 57th Street and was dropped off downtown on West
Fourth Street. His only complaint was about the bumpy Manhattan
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be able to see everything,'' he said. ``And you
can't do that from the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fisher, a Hell's Kitchen community advocate who lives on
45th Street and Ninth Avenue, said he was disheartened as he woke
up Saturday morning to see a New York Apple bus on his block.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy, as can be expected,'' he said. ``The one
thing that people need to understand is that this operation has not
been given a clean bill of health. So, we'll see.''

ON COVETED MANHATTAN SITE, CANADIAN DEVELOPER PLANS SKYSCRAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After more than two years of rumors, squabbling and
legal wrangling, a Canadian developer has finally bought one of the
most sought-after corporate corners in Manhattan, and plans to
build a 35-story skyscraper there.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the planned 1.2 million-square-foot tower
near Grand Central Terminal, at the southwest corner of Madison
Avenue and 42nd Street, will become the new home of the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, according to real estate executives. It
would be the latest headquarters project among a handful of major
office towers under construction or in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Clark, the president of Brookfield Properties Corp.'s
operations in the United States, confirmed that the company closed
the deal with Credit Suisse First Boston on Friday. He said it was
a complicated process that required the signing of 190 documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' Clark said. ``This gets us going again. It'll
be a great addition to the 42nd Street corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he was in negotiations with a major financial
institution, although he would not identify it. But real estate
executives who know of the plans said that the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, the largest bank in Canada, was expected to take
at least two-thirds of the space in the tower. In what has become a
routine demand by the city's most profitable corporations, the bank
has asked the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for millions
of dollars in tax breaks for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, CIBC was planning to move into 7 World Trade
Center when the current tenant, Salomon Smith Barney, suddenly
decided to stay put. The bank, which owns a stake in Brookfield,
looked at other possible locations before focusing on Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks north of the Brookfield site, Bear Stearns &AMP;
Co. is building a tower at Madison Avenue and 46th Street, while to
the west, workers are digging the foundation for the Ernst &AMP; Young
Building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. Morgan Stanley is
building its third tower in the Times Square area on Seventh Avenue
between 49th and 50th streets.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition has already begun on the world headquarters for AOL
Time Warner Inc. in the twin-towered Columbus Center project at
Columbus Circle. And The New York Times recently signed a
nonbinding letter of intent with state and city officials to pay
about $85 million for control of a site on Eighth Avenue between
40th and 41st Streets, for a new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Brookfield's proposed tower at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street
has been a long time coming. The complex $150 million deal involved
buying the 22-story, 87-year-old building at 300-310 Madison Ave.
and two town houses, as well as air rights from three adjacent town
houses, the Rogers Peet building and nearby Grand Central Terminal.
Demolition of the office building, which is largely vacant, is
expected to begin soon, according to Brookfield. Clark said
construction should begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The project would be the first of several new office towers
planned by Brookfield, which owns a large development site on Ninth
Avenue at 31st Street and is one of several developers vying to
build the New York Stock Exchange project in Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 42nd Street deal is a new beginning for Brookfield,
it is an exit ramp for another developer, Harry Macklowe. Macklowe
had put the site together for his own comeback project, a large
office tower. But he ran into trouble with his lenders, Credit
Suisse First Boston. After a long tug of war, First Boston took
over the site and hired Macklowe to buy several adjacent parcels.
Brookfield was supposed to buy the site last fall, but a new battle
erupted between Macklowe and First Boston, delaying the sale for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Brookfield now has control and is using Macklowe's old
architect, Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, if not his designs.

LAORETTI READY TO CALL IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ The ovation at the final green Friday afternoon
was subdued and short, a dramatic contrast to the summer of 1992,
the last time the former club professional Larry Laoretti completed
a U.S. Senior Open at Saucon Valley County Club. Laoretti was the
winner that day, outdueling such prominent golfers as Jim Colbert,
Dave Stockton, Gary Player and Al Geiberger. He had made quite an
impression. Friday, the only thing he made was an early exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it goes sometimes,'' said Laoretti, who
recorded a 9-over 80 to miss the cut by five shots and finish 19
behind the second-round leader, Bruce Fleisher, who held a one-shot
advantage over Jim Thorpe and two-shot edge on Hubert Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying,'' Laoretti said. ``I didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   That much is evident. Laoretti, in fact, seemed a good bet for
the weekend until he started to hack away on the back nine,
recording seven bogeys, one double bogey and only one par en route
to an abysmal 44.
</P>
<P>
   The par-5 12th symbolized his failure. One shot after another
ended up in the rough. A double bogey put him at 5-over for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to make a seven,'' said Laoretti, who had
registered a respectable opening-round 72. ``I had to make an
8-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Laoretti, 60, who was an all-star athlete during
his high school days in Mahopac, N.Y., seemed in decent spirits on
Friday after he concluded his round. The Open, after all, was only
his fourth start of the season. He lost his exempt status this year
after dropping out of the top 70 on the career money list, and
failed to qualify last fall. He won't try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done; I'm going to go home and relax,'' said Laoretti, who
resides in Palm City, Fla. ``I'm not going to go to school anymore.
What am I going to prove? I've got my retirement coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how could Laoretti, making his first trip back to the
scene of his glorious triumph, ever duplicate what happened in July
1992? Though he wasn't a total unknown _ he had recorded nine top
10 finishes in 1991, placing 15th on the money list _ his victory,
he admitted, ``shocked everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, perhaps, except for Laoretti, who had been playing
well heading into the week.
</P>
<P>
   On that Sunday, he played better than well, hitting 11 of 14
fairways and 17 of 18 greens in a 68 that propelled him to a
four-stroke victory over Colbert. Others applied pressure on the
untested Laoretti. It didn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had all the chances in the world to fold and he didn't,''
Stockton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, however, did not make Laoretti a consistent
contender on the senior tour. In fact, he has never won again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd play a lot better,'' he said Friday. ``It wasn't
meant to be, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes with his disappointing finish this week, though,
as a fellow competitor Joe Inman points out, it shouldn't diminish
what Laoretti accomplished eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made his senior tour career,'' Inman said. ``That's
something he'll have the rest of his life. Whether he did well this
time or not is not the point. He won the Senior Open and you can
never take that away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Laoretti, of course, also has wonderful memories from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I remember the most was when I made the putt on
18, my wife Susan came running across the green,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ran across the green this time.

SAMPRAS, IN PAIN, MANAGES A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A parade of past champions glided across a
red carpet during an uplifting ceremony on Center Court Saturday
while the missing Pete Sampras sat in a training room with his left
shin tethered to an electric stimulator.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 minutes before his match, and Sampras was squeezing
each second out of his treatment time for tendinitis before facing
the dangerous windmill motions of the 6-foot-5-inch Justin
Gimelstob. Almost an hour later, a distressed Sampras took a peek
at two of the lingering legends perched as spectators in the Royal
Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw Bjorn and the Rocket,'' said Sampras with
a tinge of awe when he referred to Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver. ``In
that first set, I wasn't too proud that they were watching. They're
my idols. So you know who is there. At one point, I wanted to throw
my racket up there; and they could play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been two days since the tendinitis sneaked into his shin,
two days since he had felt the court beneath his feet and the
racket handle in his hand. For one shaky 24-minute first set, it
was as if Sampras was trapped in an awkward meeting with a former
flame. He was uncomfortable, disconcerted and timid in his approach
to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ice was broken. Once he understood how much pain there
would be, once he found his old rhythm again, Sampras was able to
prop himself up with his serve and steady his attack with a series
of delicate half-volleys in a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 display of
third-round resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   With the reality of Sampras' march onward in front of him, the
animated Gimelstob gamely kept trying. Early in the third set, as
he furiously charged forward for a delicate shot by Sampras, it
looked as if Gimelstob jackknifed as he skidded to a stop and
tumbled over the net. By the end of the set, he had slipped on the
grass, slammed his hand on the lawn, and watched Sampras scamper
for a lunging half-volley that cut a perfect angle across the net
for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   All Gimelstob could do was smile in the absurdity of it all. If
Sampras did not undo Gimelstob with his touch, he was blowing holes
in his confidence with a serve that reached a high of 131 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came out of his mother's womb, God spent a little
extra time on his right shoulder,'' said Gimelstob, a native of
Morristown, N.J., who actually served more aces (12) than Sampras
(11). ``He just touched it. So that helps. He's got a beautifully
smooth action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen him lose when he steps on the court? If you
have to think about it, that's pretty good. Doesn't really matter
if he's injured. He's a great player. He seems to thrive on playing
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andre Agassi eased by with a straight sets victory,
another of Sampras' challengers, Gustavo Kuerten, did not hold up
as well on the sixth day of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   In need of a shot of Nyquil, a stuffy and achy Kuerten did not
have the energy to produce an encore to his French Open title.
Kuerten, seeded fourth, was upset by 114th-ranked Alexander Popp,
7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-1, on Court 2, known as the graveyard for elite
players at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The seeded women remained on track Saturday. Lindsay Davenport,
Venus Williams and Monica Seles all held up to advance to the round
of 16. There was little uncertainty along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere around Sampras was different. He was playing a
hard server with great net coverage, but normally Sampras' match
against the 99th-ranked player on the tour wouldn't drum up such
intrigue. But with Sampras chasing Roy Emerson's Grand Slam record,
with a quirky back that has put him face to face with his tennis
mortality, the addition of tendinitis to his list of ailments was
unsettling. The first set only added to the drama, albeit
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``My racket felt like a foreign object,'' Sampras said. ``It
doesn't happen that often.''
</P>
<P>
   Without practice time for two days, Sampras was testing his pain
threshold throughout the first set. Slowly, his reaction time
improved. Eventually, he got his footing for some clever returns of
serve to break Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore, and it will continue to be sore,'' said Sampras,
who will play Jonas Bjorkman in the fourth round on Monday. ``I
just need to find a way to play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   To escape one match did not firm up Sampras' belief in his
endurance. A week ago, his confidence was in much better shape than
it was even after his victory today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in the tournament,'' Sampras said. ``I have a day
off, and then I play Bjorkman. I'm here to complete the tournament,
win or lose. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed dispirited more than re-energized. But sometimes with
the hangdog Sampras, it is hard to decipher his real mood. There is
a sense of determination, though. After all, Kobe Bryant managed.
Bryant's ability to play with a sprained ankle in the NBA finals
did not escape the notice of Sampras, a Lakers season ticket
holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing hurt is something I've learned to deal with,'' Sampras
said. ``Everyone, at times in their career, whether it's Kobe
Bryant in the finals, plays hurt. I use him as my inspiration. This
is Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where his place in history is greatest. So as Sampras
stayed alive in his attempt to break Emerson's record and to tie
William Renshaw's mark for most men's titles at Wimbledon (seven),
it was fitting that Borg and Laver were witnesses to his chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have been part of it,'' Sampras said of
the parade of champions. ``I was doing whatever I had to in order
to play. It would have been an honor.''

TO GORDON, BEING BOOED MEANS HE IS AT THE TOP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ More than a thousand race fans gathered in
the rain and mud Friday to try to snag T-shirts thrown by a man on
stilts and to catch a precious glimpse of a young driver buried
deep in the NASCAR Winston Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
   A mother with kids in tow stood behind a barricade and patiently
waved a piece of cardboard with a hand-lettered message for Jeff
Gordon: We drove 1,600 miles to see you.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite clear that Gordon is still adored by half of all
stock-car racing fans. The big difference is that Gordon is not as
hated as he used to be by the other half. As he headed into
Saturday night's Pepsi 400, a race with many subplots, Gordon has
been working harder than ever to change that.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be the old Jeff Gordon. He wants to be the Jeff
Gordon who other drivers eyed jealously, who was booed for
sometimes making it all look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not booing near as much,'' he said, smiling. ``I want
them to boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Being booed, at least to Gordon, means that he is the class of
the field again. Gordon was booed as much as Dale Earnhardt, the
official Winston Cup bad guy, during a magnificent four-season
stretch in which he won three championships.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is in 10th place in the Winston Cup standings entering
Saturday night's race. He has finished lower than eighth in only
one season in his seven-year NASCAR career, and that was in 1993,
his first full season.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other drivers have zoomed to the front. With a
points system every bit as mystifying as that used by college
football's Bowl Championship Series, NASCAR rewards drivers who are
consistently good more than it rewards drivers who win a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bobby Labonte, who has won one race this year,
leads the standings. Earnhardt, 49, who has not won at all, trails
Labonte by just 67 points. Gordon's team owner, John Hendrick, and
first-year crew chief, Robbie Loomis, said they have abandoned
hopes of winning another championship and simply hope to finish in
the top five. This represents quite a comedown for Gordon, who does
not turn 29 until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he could get on a roll right now, and who knows what will
happen?'' Hendrick said. ``This team is coming together. It just
takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Gordon's mantra. When the crew chief, Ray Evernham, left
the team last year to start his own team, Gordon was expected to
struggle, just not this much. He considers this season to have been
his most challenging, but he also conceded that struggling has been
good for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to see you be challenged,'' he said. ``It
looked like it came so easy, so fast. It's been a year where I've
really learned a lot about myself. But I think it's brought me
closer together with the team.''

NEW YORK TEACHERS UNION BLOCKS REPLACEMENTS AT SCHOOL FOR THE
DEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City teachers union thwarted a plan last
week by the principal of the city's School for the Deaf to replace
35 teachers who are not proficient in American Sign Language with
those who are, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Florsheim, the principal, created a firestorm among union
leaders on Tuesday when he told 35 teachers that they would be
working at new schools in the fall, said Randi Weingarten,
president of the United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives quickly intervened, tentatively
negotiating the number down to about 10, said Weingarten, who
complained that principals did not have the authority to remove
tenured teachers. Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the New York
City Board of Education, said officials were investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim's efforts are representative of a larger debate about
the education of deaf students.
</P>
<P>
   The average deaf 18-year-old American cannot read above the
fourth-grade level, according to some statistics. Some advocates
for the deaf say that the literacy problem lies in the fact that
American Sign Language, called signing, bears no relationship to
English in syntax, grammar or spelling. Weingarten said last week
that methods other than sign language to teach deaf students should
be explored. But proponents of sign language, like Florsheim, who
is deaf, say the problem is not with sign language, but with the
people teaching it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education made American Sign
Language, or ASL, the primary language of the deaf school in 1998,
after complaints from some parents about the quality of teaching
there. The school, also known as Junior High School 47, teaches
students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Fass, a deaf mother of two deaf daughters, Esther, 7,
and Adele Idy, 4, was one of the complaining parents. Both children
attend the school. Fass said on Friday that she was disappointed
that Weingarten had prevented Florsheim from replacing the
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely disagree with Randi Weingarten's comment that
there are other methods of teaching,'' Fass wrote in response to a
question. ``ASL is a language, and how is that possible for her to
say that there are other methods? Is she fluent in ASL, and if not,
what right does she have?''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the board,
spearheaded the effort to make sign language the primary language
at the school. She said on Friday that, though she was not familiar
with what happened on Tuesday, she was aware of on-going staffing
changes to ensure that students were well educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each of our public agenda meetings, a group of parents
would come to testify because their children were getting poor
educations,'' Thomson said. ``Some were being taught through sign
language interpreters who were not teachers, and the quality was
poor. We heard from students, who told of failing tests. Many said
they felt isolated going to school, walking around with sign
language interpreters. What they cried out for was a program where
they could be taught in their home language _ ASL.''
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim, the first deaf principal of the school, has mostly
hired teachers fluent in sign language to his staff of 87 since
becoming principal in 1996. The school has about 300 students.
</P>
<P>
   American Sign Language had been banned from schools for more
than a century. In the late-1960s, William Stokoe Jr., a linguist
at Gallaudet University, a university in Washington, D.C., for
students with hearing loss, worked for it to become recognized as a
language.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the number of technology jobs grows, and as medical
technology is making it possible more often for deaf children to
gain partial hearing through surgical implants, some parents and
educators are pushing for broader forms of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Anther method of communication for people with hear loss is cued
speech, which can supplement sign language. It breaks words into
syllables and conveys them with hand signals and lip reading, so
that a deaf person can link visual signs and sounds to the language
as it is written and spoken. Other methods of communication include
oral-auralism, which essentially is lip reading with the help of
hearing aids; signing exact English, which is using a type of sign
language to depict English just as it is spoken; and auditory
verbal therapy, which teaches the maximum use of hearing aids
without the lip reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exasperated by this situation,'' Weingarten said of the
incident at the school. ``Here's a school designed to help kids who
are deaf or hard of hearing, and one of the approaches is supposed
to be ASL. Florsheim believes that ASL is the only way. It's a good
method, but it is not an exclusive method. There are some kids who
will benefit from others. That is not something he understands.''

PEROT TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF THE RUNNING BUT WANTS NO ONE TO TAKE HIS
PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By notifying the Reform Party that he does not intend to run for
president this year, Ross Perot has apparently ended an improbable
political career that has sparked widespread interest in
third-party alternatives to Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's letter to the chairman of the Reform presidential
nominations committee, which was delivered Friday night, suggested
that even from behind the curtain, he was still trying to exert a
degree of influence over the primary process of the party he
founded, largely at the expense of its leading contender for the
nomination, the former Republican presidential candidate and
television commentator Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Perot proposed that in place of having his name on the ballot,
which he earned through petition signatures collected on his
behalf, a line would read ``No Endorsement,'' giving primary voters
the chance to express dissatisfaction with other candidates, as he
said, who ``do not represent the principles of the Reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Farris, chairman of the president nominations committee,
said Saturday that he did not know how the three-member panel would
decide the issue. The party constitution recognizes the possibility
of making no endorsement but does not discuss how that decision may
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed abundantly clear to many party leaders that
Perot's request was directed at Buchanan as a rebuke of his agenda
as antithetical to the party platform and as a serious effort to
undermine his support on the eve of primary voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform candidate is selected by mail and Internet voting,
starting on Wednesday and concluding on Aug. 9. The winner will be
announced at the party convention that week in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely cynical approach,'' Bay Buchanan, chief
campaign strategist for her brother, said of Perot's request,
asserting that he and his supporters were using the request ``to
protest Pat Buchanan, and the appeal is the way they are going to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she added, ``We will dominate the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, a spokesman for Perot, said the request was not
specifically aimed at Buchanan, but rather as a way for voters to
reject anyone who would draw the party away from its traditional
roots. They include silence on otherwise divisive issues like
abortion rights and homosexuality, which Buchanan addresses often
on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reading more into it than they should,'' Verney said
of Buchanan supporters who feel disturbed by the request. ``This
was not to support or oppose any one candidate. It was to allow
members to clearly express their opinion, and a lot of them told
Ross it was better to have no person as a candidate than the wrong
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said he did not know if the nominating rules permitted
the party to accept Perot's request. But if they did not, he said
Perot would not change his mind and run.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign has asked the nominations committee to
insist that the other candidate in the race, John Hagelin, not be
placed on the ballot unless he promises not to seek the nomination
from another party if he fails to win the Reform endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, a physicist, has run for president before as the
nominee of the Natural Law Party, winning less than 1 percent of
the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider him a major threat,'' Bay Buchanan said.
``But our argument is that if you put him on our ballot, he gains
lots of prestige and national attention. Then if he loses and goes
to another party, he uses the prestige of the Reform Party against
us. That's a rule or ruin approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the Buchanan challenge, Hagelin sidestepped the
issue and charged that Buchanan was raising concerns only because
he felt his lead slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Perot ran for president in 1992 and 1996 under the banner of the
Reform Party, which he formed out of growing disenchantment with
the political mainstream and brought new focus to old issues like
trade and campaign finance reform that some voters continue to find
troubling.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fidel re-nurtured
 &HT;    For release July 2, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Every once in a while, the Cuban-American community here
is smitten by erroneous reports that Fidel Castro has died. No such
thing. After 40 years of total control of Cuba, he is as alive as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   He's got his Elian back, he's got the Republican-led U.S.
Congress pushing through legislation to ease segments of the
embargo, he's got the Miami exile community in the most depressed
(and foul) mood it's even been in.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Rasputin quality to Fidel Castro. He can mesmerize
you into believing that he is a paternalistic messiah,
self-anointed to lift the values and lives of the world's oppressed
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he is one of the world's greatest oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   Many can be swayed by the sight of hundreds of thousands of
mothers in Havana marching in support of the return of Elian
Gonzalez, or of that entire school of children at the airport last
Wednesday to welcome Elian home.
</P>
<P>
   But there are cold, harsh truths about the rule of Fidel Castro,
truths that reach beyond just the thousands who take to rafts in
search of greater economic opportunity, truths that penetrate the
walls of his prisons where dissenters are incarcerated, where many
of the basic freedoms Americans take for granted (and celebrate
Tuesday) do not exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is granted that the Cuban exiles, particularly those that
dominate Miami, sometimes can be their own worst enemies, that many
of the things they say and do hurt their cause more than help it.
Certainly, the Elian Gonzalez saga was one of them; wrong battle,
wrong battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But to those of us who have lived among them all these years,
there is a greater understanding, a better knowledge of what drives
their passions. No paramount ruler since Adolf Hitler has been able
to enchant both his people and others as has Castro.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, he has taken advantage of the embargo first
imposed upon him by the Eisenhower administration, plus a series of
military and political foibles by John F. Kennedy, to blame all his
failures on U.S. policy. Nevermind that for the first three
decades, the Soviets were his sugar-daddies who kept him well-armed
but poorly fed and industrialized. Nevermind that since the Soviet
collapse, other nations have moved in and gone into joint venture
with Castro in re-establishing Cuba as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the help he has received from elsewhere, the island
still is dominated by 1957 Chevys; i.e., nothing has trickled down
to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the exile community often exaggerates the hardships of
Castro Cuba; they really aren't starving to death down there,
they're just not eating as well as those over here. And education
has improved since the Batista years; so have medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba remains a closed society; no dissension, no free
enterprise, justice denied, no free press and only recently, a
slight lifting of religious oppressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian period, where Miami's exiles came out looking loony to
the rest of the United States, has given new verve to Castro. He,
as did Khrushchev decades ago, speaks with new bravado of burying
American capitalism, of continuing the crusade against us.
</P>
<P>
   And now, elements of the embargo are about to be lifted which
Castro will tell his people is a victory for their cause, when in
truth it is nothing more than lobbying American farmers and
pharmaceutical companies trying to create a new market for their
goods.
</P>
<P>
   How much has Castro left us incoherent and irrational? On the
day that Elian was returned to Cuba, exiles here continued (and
accelerated) their condemnation of the Clinton administration,
saying the return was but an effort by Clinton to improve relations
with Castro. At the same precise time, their hated Clinton was
standing at his podium in the White House saying that there never
could be a normalization of Cuba during his administration because
of the murder of Cuban-American fliers near Cuba several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This twisted discord, not goods, is what feeds the Rasputin of
the Caribbean.

CASTRO SAYS HE WILL PURSUE EFFORT TO CHANGE U.S. POLICY ON CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANZANILLO, Cuba _ After the return of Elian Gonzalez, President
Fidel Castro vowed in a statement Saturday to pursue efforts for
changing American policy toward Cuba, but suggested he did not
expect immediate success with either of the candidates to succeed
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of them inspires any confidence whatsoever,'' Castro
said in a written message that was read at the first
government-organized rally since Elian returned home on Wednesday.
``Whoever is the next president of the United States should know
that here is Cuba with its ideas, its example and the
rebelliousness of its people; that all aggression and all attempts
to asphyxiate us or put us on our knees will be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd estimated by officials at 300,000 packed the plaza of
this town on the southern shore in the eastern portion of the
island. They heard a succession of speakers criticize the American
trade embargo, which they said encouraged immigration, and the
Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members were reminded that they should channel the same
energy they used in the last seven months to support Elian's return
into a renewed fight against American policies, the speakers said,
that have weakened Cuba's economy and led people like Elian's
mother to take to the sea in risky attempts to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now begins the second stage that will also be triumphant,''
said Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's brother and minister of the armed
forces, in rare 15-minute news conference after the rally. ``What
other solution do we have? What other solution do the Americans
have? Invade us? I would not like to see that because we would pay
a terrible price. But they would pay as terrible a price as we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that there would be no change in Cuba's
political system despite the speculation about what might happen
when the 72-year-old Cuban president dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they talk about the famous transition,'' Castro said. ``I
have read hundreds of articles about that famous transition. Who
will come after Castro? Will his brother be able to control the
situation? Here, anybody can control the situation. You cannot
cover the sun with your finger.''
</P>
<P>
   That theme has been sounded often during the last seven months,
as the Cuban government found, for the first time in many years,
that it had the overwhelming support of its people on the emotional
issue of uniting a motherless boy with his father. Most of the
people who attended the rally here bore tiny pictures of Elian in
the arms of his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Behind the crowd, a
billboard of the two featured a quote from Jose Marti, the poet and
nationalist leader from the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am son of my son,'' read the quote. ``In him I am reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   And through the Gonzalez family, officials apparently hoped to
ensure the future of their revolution, which in recent years had
seen many people chafe under hard-line policies and a sense of
uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumors that Gonzalez would be at the rally, he was said
to be in a seaside Havana home where his son and several friends
were adjusting to being back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials have insisted that they will not use
Elian in any public appearances. But they have invoked the family
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who thought we would get tired have learned the
reality,'' said Felipe Perez Roque, the foreign minister,
addressing the rally. ``On a day like today, we affectionately
congratulate Juan Miguel Gonzalez, an exemplary father and son of a
people who struggled for a noble cause, not just for his son, but
for the fact that you cannot use a child for political
manipulation.''

3 TOUR RIDERS BANNED AS ARMSTRONG BEGINS TITLE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Four hours before its start Saturday, the
87th Tour de France was rocked by an announcement that three of its
180 riders had been disqualified for failing to pass a blood test
that indicates the use of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With no immediate right of appeal, the riders were suspended
from the sport for 15 days. About a half-dozen riders have been
similarly punished each year since the blood tests were introduced
in 1997, but this was a first in the Tour de France, the world's
most prestigious bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the suspensions overshadowed an exhilarating
performance by unsung British rider David Millar, who won the first
stage, a 16.5-kilometer (10.3 miles) time trial, Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Malta-born 23-year-old Millar, who burst into tears after
realizing that he had finished just ahead of last year's Tour
champion Lance Armstrong in the time trial, will wear the overall
leader's yellow jersey in Sunday's second stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream. I can't even talk,'' he cried as soon as
Armstrong had crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   Millar, who lives in the surfing resort of Biarritz, France,
beat Armstrong by just two seconds while Frenchman Laurent Jalabert
was third 13 seconds behind, and 1997 winner Jan Ullrich was fourth
a further second back.
</P>
<P>
   After having recovered and put on several different colored
jerseys for different category leaders, Millar reflected on his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fairly incredible. I'm going to sleep in the jersey
tonight, and, in fact, I'm not going to take it off for years!''
said the son of a Royal Air Force pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' he said, ``I don't know what nationality I am
because I was born in Malta, my family is Scottish and I was
brought up in Hong Kong, which is where my father still lives as
well as most of my friends _ and my mother is in London,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials made no immediate public comment about the
drug suspensions. A drug inspector reported that Jean-Marie
Leblanc, who directs the race, had been shocked by the news and
then said, ``I'm glad the cheaters were caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, officials were dispersed across the plains of
Futuroscope, a technology theme park, as they prepared for the
start of the three-week, 3,660-kilometer (2,274-mile) Tour. The
race was disrupted and nearly collapsed in 1998 when a drug scandal
resulted in the expulsion of one team and the withdrawal of five
others to protest police searches for illegal performance-enhancing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The riders disqualified Saturday were Sergei Ivanov, 25, who won
the Russian national championship last Sunday for the second
consecutive year; Rossano Brasi, 28, an Italian, and Andrei
Hauptman, 25, a Slovak. Ivanov rides for the Farm Frites team from
the Netherlands, Brasi for the Polti team from Italy and Hauptman
for the Vini Caldirola team from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to avoid this,'' said Hendrik
Redant, a sporting director of Ivanov's team. `'And still it
happened. I can't explain it.'' Under another sponsor, TVM, the
Farm Frites team was heavily involved in the 1998 scandal and some
of its previous officials still face trial in France on charges of
transporting illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the three disqualifications followed by a
day a public warning by Leblanc that any rider tempted to use drugs
in the Tour was ``playing with fire and risking his reputation.''
Although blood tests can be administered at any time during the
race, the one Saturday was part of the official schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test was no surprise, no secret,'' said Martin Bruin, a
Dutchman who heads the drug inspection team sent by the
International Cycling Union, which governs the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors, whom the riders always refer to as ``the vampires,''
arrived at each of the 20 teams' hotels between 7 and 8:45 a.m.
Saturday to draw drops of blood. They are tested to determine the
hematocrit level _ the number of red corpuscles. A level higher
than 50 percent sends a rider home for two weeks ``to regain his
health,'' as the rules put it since the international union insists
that the inspection is a health test, not one for drugs.
Nevertheless, in the public mind, a hematocrit level above 50
percent indicates the use of EPO, an artificial hormone that
increases red corpuscles, which carry oxygen to muscles and thus
increase performance in endurance sports.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable blood test exists to confirm the presence of EPO,
which closely resembles a natural hormone. Although a urine test
for EPO is under development at the French national drug-testing
laboratory, it has not been deemed foolproof and was not approved
for use in the Tour.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, summery heat will expand from the Plains
into most of the Eastern states. Disturbances in a vigorous jet
stream at the northern periphery of the hot air mass will set the
stage for recurrent thunderstorms from the northern Plains to the
interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity will begin to increase in the Northeast Sunday as
breezes from the southwest develop. Sunshine will be dimmed
occasionally by high clouds, especially from the eastern Great
Lakes to New England.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt where a surge of sultry air
intersects a front in the northern Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes states. Areas of heavy rain will heighten the risk of local
flooding, especially where the ground is saturated from recent
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Some strong thunderstorms will occur near a front in the
northern Rockies. The Pacific Northwest will stay rather cool.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TEMPERATURE ERROR
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the correct air temperature can be difficult. Last
week after studying readings from nearby instruments, technicians
determined that the official thermometer at St. Paul was reading
consistently high. Most erroneous thermometer readings are too
warm. Thermometers must be carefully placed five feet above the
ground and must remain always in the shade. In addition, the
instrument must be properly ventilated and situated away from
surrounding objects that might radiate additional warmth.

FOR THE CLASS OF 2000, RENTING 101 
</HEADLINE>
   By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The annual migration to New York of new college
graduates, degrees in hand, entry-level jobs on the horizon, seems
as inevitable as the changing of the seasons. Just as predictable
is the sticker shock they face when they plunge into the hunt for
an apartment, when they realize that what they might pay for an
entire house in Birmingham or Boise is barely enough for a studio
here.
</P>
<P>
   That of course has been true, to one degree or another, for
years, but the price tags presented to the class of 2000 seem
particularly breathtaking, even compared to those of last year when
the market was already torrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cycle of soaring rents has to break somewhere, but we've
been saying that for years and years and it only gets more
incredible and more shocking every year,'' said Michael Shapot, an
associate broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy in Manhattan who
has many young people among his clients. ``It is a landlords'
market. They are demanding, demanding, demanding _ and getting,
getting, getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Supply and demand, with a New York twist, are part of the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the booming economy in general and the demand for
co-op apartments in particular, ``co-op owners who once rented
their apartments are now selling them because they are getting top
dollar and are choosing not to rent any longer,'' Shapot said.
``There are some new buildings, but they are selling out or renting
out incredibly quickly at prices that the class of 2000 is
unwilling or unable to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   So unless the graduates have trust funds or six-figure salaries,
they are finding themselves scaling down the visions they brought
to the city: trading in elevators for walkups, banding together
with more roommates than they had planned on, putting up temporary
walls to carve bedrooms out of living rooms or relinquishing the
idea of Manhattan altogether and finding haven in Brooklyn, Queens,
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they are making further compromises, like giving up a
quick walk to a subway stop. Some, defeated altogether by the size
of their paychecks relative to the going rents, return to the nest
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wealthy city, and it is starting to shape up that
only kids with silver spoons can be here,'' said Andrew Heiberger,
president and owner of Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage
company that rented 5,400 apartments in Manhattan last year and
caters to what he described as ``upwardly mobile professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even a silver spoon, inherited or earned, may not be
sufficient. Consider the case of Chip Krotee of Minneapolis, who is
about to begin a job as a trader with Merrill Lynch, and Arjay
Jensen of St. Louis, who will work for Goldman Sachs. Roommates at
Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, where they received
their masters of business administration degrees in May, they
figured they would find a place to live with relative ease. The
moving allowances their companies gave them included payment of
brokers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brokers we called suggested we come to New York three or
four weeks before we were ready to move and bring lots of cash,''
Krotee said the other day from his home in Minneapolis, where he
was packing. ``We came up on May 24 figuring we'd be safe if we
brought two months' rent. We were hoping to find a two-bedroom
apartment somewhere on the West Side below 90th Street for $3,500 a
month for the two of us.''
</P>
<P>
   They were shown six or seven apartments, two of which they
deemed ``tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were willing to take them outright, but we were rejected,''
Krotee said. ``We were told we needed assets of $1 million, and
even with those assets landlords wouldn't look at us unless we had
worked in New York City for two years. We also needed a guarantor
in the tristate region with income 100 times our rent.''
</P>
<P>
   They did find a two-bedroom apartment in a prewar building on
West 73rd Street. ``There the management was fine,'' Krotee said,
``but because we had no New York City guarantor, we had to put six
months' rent, or $24,000, in a security deposit and had to take out
loans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have MBAs, six-figure salaries, perfect
credit ratings and fixed assets that are not too shabby didn't
matter,'' he said, looking back on the painful search.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Blase Boyd of Kearny, N.J., felt much the same way after
he began looking for an apartment to share with three friends from
Georgetown University: Benjamin Meyer of Kansas City, Kan., Nathan
Swem of Shellbourne Falls, Mass., and Nicolina Kuh of Arlington,
Texas They all graduated last month and have jobs at investment
banking firms like ING Barings and Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a place on East 57th Street that was a steal at
$4,900, a 35th-floor penthouse with three bedrooms and two
terraces, and our four salaries covered the rent,'' Boyd said.
``But they only wanted two people signing the lease and there were
no two of us whose salaries covered 40 times the rent.'' (The
annual income _ including salary, dividends and interest _ that
landlords require of tenants can vary, Heiberger said; 40 to 52
times the monthly rent is usual.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boyd said, they were limited to one guarantor, and
they had no one individual who could fill that role.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Boyd grew so frustrated by endless red tape that,
he said, ``even though I love the three people I'll be living with,
friends since freshman year, I seriously contemplated dropping out
and going to Hoboken or Jersey City by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pondering what it takes to make landlords become almost as picky
as co-op boards, he said: ``We have gone to a better school where
we've all graduated with honors. I was only cum laude, the other
three were magnas. We are financially responsible. I paid for a
year of Georgetown out of my own pocket and we all have well-paying
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have signed a lease on a sublet on West 106th Street
between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue for $4,100 a month. No
guarantor was required, but they are awaiting approval from the
board of the co-op building. ``If they turn us down, I don't know
who they want in that apartment,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The rents being paid by Krotee, Boyd and their roommates do not
seem out of line with current prices in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the income requirement of nine out of 10 buildings, a
salary of 50 times one months' rent, someone earning $60,000 would
barely qualify for a $1,200 studio,'' Heiberger said. ``And a
$1,200 studio is the bottom of the barrel in the city. It would be
a fifth-floor walkup or on the first floor facing an alley with a
view of the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The minimum for most studios is $1,500 and they go up to
$2,200,'' he continued. ``One-bedrooms that you can convert to two
are $2,400, and two-bedrooms that you convert to three are around
$3,600. Once you get into three bedrooms, the prices jump greatly
to $6,000 and you're competing with couples with families who are
raising kids in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, landlords, who tend to prefer older and presumably
more settled tenants, are raising the bar higher in other ways. For
example, the requirements for guarantors, without whom many
landlords will not consider a renter right out of school, are
tightening up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guarantors are required to make 75 times the monthly rent,''
Heiberger said. ``They must submit their own financial information
that is more onerous than a mortgage application to prove that they
are able to support their own obligations plus the obligations of
the tenant. Six out of 10 landlords require the guarantor to be
from New York State, eight of 10 that they be from the tristate
area and 10 out of 10 that they be from the United States. Kids and
their parents are being forced to pay more than their tuition for
their senior year of college in advance just to get the key.''

<P>
   Indeed, the fact that their nest may be empty no longer
automatically ends parental financial obligation. Ryu Suzuki, who
will start as an associate for UBS Warburg on July 5, came to New
York in May right after graduating from Oberlin College. He would
not have been able to move into the apartment he found _ a
$2,000-a-month condo studio in Murray Hill _ had his parents, who
flew here from Tokyo to make sure that he found a safe place, not
been willing to put up a year's rent, $24,000, in advance. ``Having
recently purchased a new house in Tokyo, they were not shocked
about the prices,'' Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a medical degree does not ensure safe passage through the
roiling rental waters. ``It seems to me that if someone is starting
out as a physician in New York and has the credentials, landlords
would bend a little,'' said John Lemery of Saratoga, whose son, Dr.
John M. Lemery, just graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and
started work last week as an intern in emergency medicine at the
Bellevue Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed something reasonably close to Bellevue because he
will work 12-hour shifts and undergo all that goes with being an
intern,'' Lemery said. Lemery found a 300-square-foot studio in a
doorman building on East 47th Street for $1,675 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to pay the first and last month's rent on a two-year
lease, security deposit and brokerage fees which came to more than
$8,300,'' Lemery said. ``It all had to be deposited in certified
funds with the broker. They wouldn't take a personal check, and I
had to guarantee the lease, provide them with a copy of selected
information on my income tax return and get a letter from my bank
saying that we are creditworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing advance payments, bank records, tax forms,
references and guarantors, apartment seekers must be prepared to
make snap decisions or almost inevitably forfeit opportunities even
in less desirable apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Bercovici, a new graduate of the New School for Social
Research in Manhattan, is moving to Williamsburg in Brooklyn
because the apartment he occupied for two years in Park Slope has
been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told there was a new building in Williamsburg, and when
I called, a woman told me there were eight apartments left,'' he
said. ``When I went to see it, there were only two left. So many
apartments had been pulled out from under my feet that I was ready
to take it on the spot. It was close enough to what I was looking
for and I didn't feel like going crazy. There was a guy in line
behind me, and once I said I would take it, the broker turned to
him and said, `Now there is only one left,' so he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bercovici, a painter who is looking for a teaching job, was
scheduled to move in with a roommate July 1, and together they will
pay $1,775 a month for a 1,400-square-foot loft. ``Everything else
in the neighborhood was at least $500 more,'' he said. ``There is
no gas in the building yet, which is why it is so cheap.'' The
building is being converted from commercial to residential status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, $2,000 a month is a steal,'' said Annie Livingston of
Portland, Ore., who graduated from Yale last year, is now the
assistant public relations director at Swann Galleries in Manhattan
and has been renting a room in a friend's co-op.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She and her Yale roommate, Sarah Karnasiewicz of Southbury,
Conn., an operations design assistant at the Whitney Museum of
American Art, spent their lunch hours and evenings since the
beginning of May pursuing an apartment, and said they had probably
tramped through 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   They made every effort to avoid using the services of a broker,
Livingston said, because brokers ``charge 15 percent of the year's
rent and don't do much,'' but in the end, they found their new home
last Tuesday through an agent, Adam Feingold of New York City
Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was love at first sight when they saw the apartment
_ which has two bedrooms, two baths, a living room and an eat-in
kitchen _ in a newly renovated four-story town house on 78th Street
east of Second Avenue. Especially because the rent is $2,200 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The search was an education for the women, who just last weekend
were told by a broker that it was unlikely they would find a decent
two-bedroom apartment for less than $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started out, I thought that paying $1,000 a month was
ridiculous,'' said Karnasiewicz, who has been camping out with
friends, ``moving from floor to floor depending on the kindness of
strangers'' since the start of the search. ``Now I think we are
getting a great deal for the money. To get anything halfway decent
or clean for less than $2,500 seems like a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would be in a palace, but I expected to find
something small, clean and comfortable and would go where the
prices took me, anywhere where I would feel safe,'' she said.
``Then when we started looking, I realized we are definitely not in
a position of power. No matter what state an apartment is in, it
will be rented, probably to people making twice as much money as we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   They got their apartment by getting to it first _ after they had
begun to consider leaving Manhattan. ``We had been looking for
weeks,'' she said. ``On Tuesdays at 1 p.m., when the new Village
Voice listings come online, the day before the paper is printed, I
go through them and make calls. I was the first person to call _ 20
minutes after the listing was posted_ and we raced over there right
from work. We knew within minutes that this was it.''
Karnasiewicz's father is the guarantor.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the draw of communities outside Manhattan was
directly proportional to their proximity to subway or PATH commuter
train stations, but even that is changing with rising demand.
``People are not so insistent any more on being right at the No. 7
subway stop,'' said Scott Cooper, a broker with Cooper Real Estate
in Woodside, Queens. ``Since apartments here are in such great
demand, people who used to want to be no farther than four blocks
from a subway now consider 10 blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what locales were the most popular alternatives to
Manhattan, Heiberger listed Hoboken, Jersey City and Fort Lee in
New Jersey, Astoria in Queens, Long Beach on Long Island, and
Williamsburg, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But what is considered reasonable one year can become pricey the
next. As rents rise in Park Slope, which once got the spillover
from Brooklyn Heights, Windsor Terrace is becoming more popular.
Rents there are 10 to 15 percent lower than in Park Slope, said
John P. Burke Jr., a broker with John P. Burke Realty. A
two-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace would be $1,650, compared
to $2,200 in Park Slope, he said. ``There has been more demand for
two-bedrooms this year over last,'' he said, ``mainly because few
people can afford to live alone and must share to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents in Astoria have been escalating as well. A one-bedroom
apartment there that would have averaged $750 to $800 a month a
year or so ago is now $900 to $1,000, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Which communities are considered likely to be the next magnets
for the young? The graduates are not as willing as suburban
homeowners to travel more than a half hour to reach the city,
brokers say, but migration east in Queens to Bayside seems to be
starting, and boundaries are beginning to stretch to Staten Island
and Great Neck on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Great Neck, that affluent North Shore community? ``Yes,''
Heiberger said. ``you can still get a one-bedroom apartment there
for $1,200.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts University class of '99 graduates Sarah Rosen, an
assistant producer at Dateline NBC, and Chelsea Switzer, an events
coordinator at Chelsea Piers, barely considered Manhattan, even
though that was where they wanted to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be impossible,'' Rosen said. ``We wanted to
find something for $1,500 a month and with one bedroom that we
could subdivide. We each wanted our own room and were not willing
to have someone living in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   They registered with an apartment listing service that provided
them with addresses of places in their price range. ``Nothing they
sent us to was in Manhattan,'' Rosen said. They also responded to
newspaper ads, through which they found a two-bedroom third-floor
walkup in Park Slope that was $450 above their budget. ``We saw it
and said, `We will kick ourselves if we don't take this,' and then
the rent went up another $50 a month because we had them build a
wall,'' she said. ``We immediately decided we needed a third
roommate.''
</P>
<P>
   Through an ad they put on the Tufts alumni Web page, they
recruited Stefan Kimball, a new graduate of Penn State, who has a
job as a paralegal with Latham &AMP; Watkins and who was scheduled to
move in July 1. The fact that the apartment is not in Manhattan
doesn't seem to matter to Kimball, whose family lives in Finland.
``I like the idea of living in New York, not New Jersey,'' he said.
``Park Slope is pretty cool, and we have a nice view of Manhattan
from the window. I'm paying $800, and for someplace like Park
Slope, that seems like a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   For those unshakable in their resolve to be in Manhattan, Gus
Perry of Stein-Perry Real Estate in Washington Heights said, ``We
are absolutely seeing more young people up here, and in Inwood and
the north Harlem areas. This is the only place you can find a large
one-bedroom for under $1,500 on the island of Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Argyres, a book editor who graduated from the University
of Michigan four years ago, and David Gordon, who graduated from
its school of music in April, are moving to Inwood in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to choose whether we wanted a good location and a
really small apartment or live in Brooklyn or the Bronx,'' Argyres
said from Ann Arbor. ``We knew that David would be studying at the
Manhattan School of Music, which is near Columbia, so we wanted to
try to be in Manhattan. To live elsewhere would be a huge
commute.''
</P>
<P>
   They found what is termed a ``junior four'' (one large bedroom
and one small) for $1,300 a month. ``It's spacious in a great
location 20 minutes from downtown on the express and there is lots
of green,'' Argyres said happily.
</P>
<P>
   How much farther young people will be willing to commute to work
and play in Manhattan remains to be seen. And what current trends
portend for the post-college generation of the future is an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   As Lucy Martin Gianino, an actress who is also a real estate
broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy, put it: ``If I could give
my children one gift, it would be a co-op.'' Gianino has three
children, Gemina, 30, a teacher who is about to enter the Harvard
Graduate School of Education, Antonia, 27, a stage manager for the
play ``Rent,'' and Gian-Murray, 22, a new graduate of Wesleyan
University who will be an intern for a year with the Actors Theater
of Louisville in Kentucky. ``It is my big concern as the parent of
three children who are all in the arts or education,'' Gianino
said. ``Will they be driven out of the city as everyone here
becomes an investment banker? Will they have to leave professions
they love to earn a buck so they can put a roof over their heads?''

 &HT;    Digital-age phones bring out stone-age manners in some users
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ruby Owens has a bumper sticker that says ``If we
were meant to be talking on the phone while driving, we'd be
driving phone booths.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens is one of the growing horde of people who have had
unpleasant encounters with people who have turned on their mobile
phones and clicked off their brains.
</P>
<P>
   In her case it was a guy in a dark blue Mercedes ``with a
Budweiser in one hand and a cell phone in the other, driving with
his knees'' on northbound Interstate 75 approaching a dangerous
interchange.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said the man was carrying on a lively conversation as he
swerved from side to side, nearly forcing her and her van full of
children off the road. ``I was saying 'Oh my God! I'm dead and my
children are dead.' He only missed us by a couple inches,'' Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got where I was going in Tipp City, I was still shaking
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimates
there are about 94 million Americans with wireless telephones right
now, and another 46,000 people sign up for new mobile phone service
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, within a pool that large, there will be a few jerks
like the guy in the dark blue Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schafer said he recently had a head-on encounter with a car
driven by a young woman who laughed and talked merrily on her phone
as she exited Interstate 70 using the entrance ramp from Ohio 48.
She apparently never realized her mistake even after Schafer
screeched to a halt and blared his horn at her.
</P>
<P>
   Don McGee said he recently saw what appeared to be a businessman
in a shiny black sport utility vehicle turn left with the thumb and
index finger of his left hand holding a sheet of paper against the
steering wheel while using his other hand to hold a phone to his
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he thought he was
productive/efficient/chic/connected/cool,'' McGee said. `` . . .
but, to those of us who watched him make that turn, he will always
be just a self-absorbed moron.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving while talking on a mobile phone is illegal in England,
Israel and a few other countries. The Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn
last year became the first American city to start ticketing
motorists for using a handheld phone while driving, and other
cities have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures across the country have debated the issue,
but none have banned mobile phone use in cars.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine published a study in 1997
that said a driver using a cell phone was four times more likely to
be in an accident than drivers who were not talking.
</P>
<P>
   And the study indicated that phones that a driver could use with
both hands free were no less dangerous than phones that had to be
held. Apparently it's the distraction of holding a conversation
while driving and not the problem of having one hand occupied that
causes problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Keller is a waitress at a restaurant that serves breakfast
and she said, ``People get so wrapped up in their cell phone
conversation, they don't even realize you're standing in front of
them trying to take their orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said she had her worst restaurant mobile phone experience
as a customer at a restaurant three years ago. ``There weren't many
people there, but there was one guy talking on his cell phone like
he was the only person in the building,'' she said. ``We had to ask
to move to a different table further away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really sad is when the business you're in makes you so
busy that you can't even interact with the people around you.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hume, owner of the Pine Club in Dayton, said his staff has
had to quiet people who were disturbing others at his restaurant
with their mobile phones, but it happens rarely. Hume said he
personally is known for using his cell phone frequently while
running his business, and he understands the need for some people
to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody has a phone that rang loudly or he was talking,
we're really tuned into that sort of thing, and we would talk to
him about it,'' Hume said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But really the bigger issue is common courtesy. Some people
have cell phones that instead of ringing they play Beethoven's
``Fifth Symphony'' or something. Having that go off in a restaurant
is inappropriate and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the same token, if somebody is at a table using loud,
aggressive language that, too, is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   TALKING TASTEFULLY
</P>
<P>
   ``Cell phones in restaurants are rude,'' said Sue Fox, an author
and consultant on business etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of courtesy is making people feel comfortable, and
when you're sitting at a table talking on the phone, you're putting
everybody around you in an awkward position,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said she worked for Apple Computers for more than 10 years
and says she got firsthand exposure to every business etiquette
mistake possible. She still works in Silicon Valley, but now she
runs Etiquette Survival Inc. in Los Gatos, Calif., and conducts
seminars in business etiquette and international protocol.
</P>
<P>
   She said mobile phone use became a status symbol years ago in
Southern California, and restaurants and other public businesses
have had to ban mobile phone use to curb inconsiderate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said mobile phones, e-mail and other technologies became
popular so quickly that there wasn't time for rules of etiquette to
be established for their use. But she said common sense and
consideration for others dictate how wireless phones should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some courtesy rules for mobile phone use:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't take a mobile phone to dinner with you if you can avoid
it. If you are a doctor or someone else who must be reachable in an
emergency, use a phone that vibrates instead of ringing.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are expecting a call that can't be postponed until
after dinner, tell your dining companions ahead of time. When the
call comes in, excuse yourself and answer the call in a place where
you will have some privacy. ``You can't help but overhear if
someone nearby is talking on a cell phone,'' Fox said. ``Remember
that nobody wants to hear your conversation, so talk where no one
will be forced to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If you know you're going to have to be on the phone a lot,
stay at home. It's unfair to others to interrupt a meal, a meeting,
a sermon or other public event with constant phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you receive a call while driving, pull off the road if you
have to answer it. If you have to initiate a call while driving,
park first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never talk on a mobile phone while in a social setting with
others. You put your companions in the awkward position of not
being able to talk freely among themselves for fear of disturbing
you. If you're dining with only one other person, that person has
no one to talk to at all while you're on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your voice down. Occasionally you may be forced to take
an emergency call in a public place such as in a store. Move to a
secluded area if possible and talk quietly. Under no circumstances
should you shout, curse or otherwise display anger during a public
phone call. Save your histrionics for a time when you have privacy
and won't embarrass or offend others.

MARYLAND OFFICIALS BLAME BACTERIA FOR DEATH OF CHESAPEAKE CARP 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS BRANDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the
Clean Water Act, which in just a few years made the Potomac River
one of the nation's top largemouth bass fisheries and returned the
ospreys, bald eagles, great blue herons and other elegant birds to
this beautiful, sprawling river.
</P>
<P>
   But, since May, thousands of adult carp, a bottom-feeding fish,
have died in the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, and in the
many tributaries that flow into the two. In some places along the
Potomac, in just 100 feet of shoreline, 25 or more dead carp, from
18 inches to 4 feet long, have been found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dead and diseased carp have been found in virtually every tidal
and freshwater tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as
reservoirs, since the second week of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise against eating diseased or dead carp,'' said Charles
Poukish, an environmental specialist with the Maryland Department
of the Environment, who is involved in researching the deaths.
``Look at the gill tissue and if they are not their normal pinkish
red, don't eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, carp are one of the most popular eating fish,
though in the United States their culinary popularity is still
evolving. Carp were first extensively stocked in the United States
in the 1830s, when Europeans coming here wanted them to be part of
their diet.
</P>
<P>
   The carp deaths are caused by a bacterial gill disease thought
by environmental officials to be induced by flavobacterium.
Although bacteria are common in freshwater habitats around the
world, and there have been carp deaths in other parts of the world,
there have never before been deaths of this magnitude in the United
States. Usually the bacteria have little effect on fish unless
their resistance is lowered by other factors. Other fish besides
carp can be affected, and some catfish have died as well.
</P>
<P>
   Poukish said he believed that one factor was a sudden increase
in air temperature that quickly raised the water temperature from
the 50s to the 70s, which then triggered aggressive spawning among
the carp. The first occurrences of carp deaths were in the
Chesapeake, then moved into the Potomac and other waterways. The
spreading of bacteria from one fish to another occurs primarily
during spawning, which also lowers their disease resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spawning stress, population density and weather conditions _
particularly the sudden hot spell during the second week of May _
seem to be the most plausible factors involved with reducing
tolerance to this ubiquitous pathogen,'' Poukish said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no formal carp population count, and some
researchers said they suspected that the carp population had
reached a critically high density. Some fishermen have said they
believe the deaths may be helpful to the overgrown carp population
and give other species better access to food.
</P>
<P>
   Poukish also suggested that the carp might have been more
vulnerable because of reduced dissolved oxygen levels and organic
pollution, particularly high nitrites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the carp deaths, most other fish throughout the bay
region seem to be healthy. But there is still concern by
environment officials that other fish could become vulnerable to
bacterial stress factors, so testing continues, including testing
for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural part of the environment, and a natural
thinning process _ maybe,'' said Ana Baya, a fish disease expert at
the University of Maryland researching the carp deaths. ``The
catfish are also affected to a lesser extent and, like the carp,
are also bottom-feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   All freshwater fish species can be affected, or killed, by the
bacteria suspected, environment officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who live relatively close to the waterways,
pollution is a significant factor, so don't fertilize your lawn,
which can reduce oxygen levels and increase organic pollution,''
Baya said.
</P>
<P>
   Baya and Poukish said they believed the ospreys, bald eagles and
the great blue heron _ all fish-eating birds _ were not affected by
the carp deaths at this point. Part of the birds' protection is
that the bacteria that kills the fish are soon consumed by other
bacteria. Still, because all freshwater fish species can be
affected by the bacteria, ``this is raising a red flag to us,''
Poukish said. Moreover, carp breed all summer, so transmission may
continue.

<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ We could call this story Martina's World.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis is young and pretty and the No. 1-ranked women's
tennis player in the land. She earns millions a year, owns homes in
Florida and Switzerland, travels to glamorous cities every week and
strikes seductive poses for international magazines regularly.
</P>
<P>
   She's dated a handful of tennis players, a Tampa Bay hockey
player and recently declared her newest squeeze _ second-ranked
men's player Magnus Norman _ ``very shaggable'' in a London
tabloid. He called her ``my rock.''
</P>
<P>
   But when professional tennis arrives on its biggest stage of the
year at the All England Club, Hingis is looking over her shoulder.
Fellow inhabitants of this world are trying hard to unseat her from
every aspect of her dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Wise Lindsay Davenport wants Hingis' ranking; tease Anna
Kournikova wants her endorsements; newcomers Venus and Serena
Williams want her Grand Slam titles; ingenue Alexandra Stevenson
wants her spotlight; tell-all author Nathalie Tauziat wants it all
to end, all but the tennis talk, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Romance, jealousy, intrigue, beautiful women, hunky men and
outrageous parents. Add in charges of hazing, racism, arrogance and
even hetero-sexism, plus a few racy newspapers, and suddenly the
sport of tennis turns into a maze of intertwining and neverending
storylines more fit for ``The Young and the Restless'' than the
sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soap opera's certainly the right word for it,'' said veteran
tennis writer and NBC commentator Bud Collins. ``We don't have
anything like it in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ROMANCES
</P>
<P>
   It begins when 128 men and 128 women come together for a
tournament _ each with their egos, coaches, parents, friends and
families.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes the grandest Grand Slam for many reasons: royal
traditions, agonizing rain delays, questionable food, limited
practice facilities, less than ideal lodgings and, most
importantly, tabloid journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlike any other tournament,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers trail players. Reporters aren't far behind,
sniffing for ``background'' stories because readers will already
know the match winners by morning, said longtime tennis writer John
Roberts, who works for The Independent, a regular daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just a sporting event,'' Roberts said. ``It's
the one time of the year that women who stay at home, their
husbands' shirts don't get ironed. It becomes like a serial. The
players become the characters for a fortnight. And the scores are
the least of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this doesn't lead to fights, it might lead to love.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis and Norman, the highest-ranking couple on the tour,
aren't the only ones finding romance and making headlines in
England. Pete Sampras recently got engaged to actress Bridgette
Wilson, and she's been besieged by photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi doesn't talk much about girlfriend Steffi Graf, but
they've been on practice courts together and she watches his
matches from the stands. Kournikova coldly disallows any discussion
of her love life, even though she's wearing a big diamond on her
left hand and has been photographed waltzing around London
hand-in-hand with NHL player Sergei Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   Younger players involved in relationships haven't yet mastered
interview evasion skills. Belgian Kim Clijsters fretted about
missing her beloved Lleyton Hewitt's first-round ejection. Jennifer
Capriati admitted her Belgian love, Xavier Malisse, has helped her
serve and her off-court mentality.
</P>
<P>
   But even love can divide in this competitive world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I see things and my eyes light up. 'Whoa, I didn't
know,'' Serena Williams said, laughing but adding that it probably
won't happen for her. ``I'm really focusing on my career, trying to
keep that No. 1 in life. It's really hard if you get involved in a
relationship. Next thing you know, your game goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis took exception to that, although it wasn't aimed
specifically at her. She zinged back that Williams isn't any sort
of an expert on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my game went down so far,'' the top seed said.
``I'm happy with my relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Uniting men and women at Grand Slam tournaments makes tennis
player love affairs easier. Playing in a city with such devoted
reporters makes public knowledge unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's guided by tabloid journalism,'' Collins said. ``We all
like a good romance, and there have been some good ones here: the
lovebird double with Chrissie (Evert) and Jimmy (Connors) in 1974.
There used to be a lot of romances because it was a co-educational
circuit until about 1972 so you didn't have to stray far for
romance.''
</P>
<P>
   REVELATIONS
</P>
<P>
   But you also don't have to stray far for bad blood, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Tauziat published a book earlier this year _ in French
only so far _ criticizing the Women's Tennis Association for its
role in promoting Anna Kournikova for her beauty more than its
higher-ranked players for her ability. A few players got upset,
Tauziat said, but others appreciated what she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Kournikova. I think she's a nice girl,'' she said.
``But what I don't like is the whole system about people talking
only about her because she's sexy. There are other girls who are as
good or better players and they don't talk about them as much as
about her.''
</P>
<P>
   She named Davenport, Mary Pierce and Conchita Martinez as
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, however, has not changed her approach. An
advertisement featuring picture of her in a sports bra beside the
words ``Only the ball should bounce'' has been plastered all of
London for the past month. She contends her promotional work
doesn't distract her from her tennis career, although she remains
titleless in 68 career tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it must somehow take away something from me
being a tennis player,'' she said. ``I think I can help a lot of
people by doing that. I think it's very important for young women
to get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport politely questioned Kournikova's motives, however, and
how much it helps her tennis to dominate the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what her goals are. I would think it is
being a better tennis player,'' she said. ``Obviously she likes the
attention but I think she would want to win a Grand Slam title
before all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova _ who lost in the second round and woke up to
headlines like ``Kournikover! Anna said she was more than just a
bimbo, but oops she's out again'' _ insists tennis takes
precedence. She avoids reading about herself and focuses on
practicing instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have thick skin,'' the Russian said. ``You guys are
all making everything around, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is the only top women's player truly absent from the
tabloids this year. She doesn't read them and doesn't care that
she's left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those papers aren't exactly the type of publications I'm dying
to be in,'' she said, smiling. ``I can let that go.''
</P>
<P>
   Martina Navratilova, back this year in doubles, didn't want to
comment specifically on Tauziat's book because she hasn't been on
tour recently enough. But she thought the WTA ``was pushing
hetero-sexism a little bit,'' although they've backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the guys posing with just a flag in front of the
important parts,'' the nine-time singles champion said. ``There is
a double standard, always has been. We play a damn good game,
period. If we're sexy on top of that, fine. It should not be the
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern were the situations involving Damir Dokic,
father of 17-year-old rising star Jelena, and American Alexandra
Stevenson's charges of racism and hazing in your first year on
tour. Dokic was taken away by police after berating reporters and
smashing a cell phone. Observers said he appeared drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Pierce was pretty bad,'' Collins said, referring to Mary
Pierce's father. ``But this guy Dokic is a menace, it seems. He
needs help, which is sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, meanwhile, marred her second trip to the All England
Club, a second-round loss, with her comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt badly for Alexandra Stevenson,'' Collins said. ``I
think the mother said, 'Well, let's give them something to write
about.' ``
</P>
<P>
   It worked, and while Venus and Serena Williams agree the tour
isn't immune from racism, they won't discuss names or details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here can't think in the new millennium mind,'' Serena
said. ``There is still something out there.''
</P>
<P>
   EGOS UNCHECKED
</P>
<P>
   Just plain jealousies crop up too, though, and garden-variety
disagreements _ like the argument about a practice court that led
Anne-Gaelle Sidot to tap Samantha Stevenson's cap a few weeks ago
or when John McEnroe told British TV viewers some of the women
could use a bit of humility.
</P>
<P>
   The targets, again Venus and Serena Williams, handled the
criticism well, although Venus used a bit of bravado when
discussing her reaction to McEnroe's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Serena and I are very polite,'' she said. ``But
I believe also most of the time when Serena and I lose a match,
it's because we beat ourselves, not because the other player beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, meanwhile, again sounds like a pal down the street
more than a member of ``Martina's World'' on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players need a little bit of arrogance and some players
don't,'' she said. ``I've never believed that I need to tell people
that I'm a great tennis player. But some people like to do that or
need to do that and need to feel that recognition. Everybody's
different. I see things differently from a lot of players.''

CONCERT TURNS TO HORROR AS EIGHT ARE CRUSHED TO DEATH

<P>
   ROSKILDE, Denmark _ Just 10 hours after she had watched eight
people get crushed to death at a rock festival here on muddy
farmland, Tina Rasmussen was still shaking Saturday, her eyes red
from tears and lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing another human being die is the worst thing in the
world,'' said the 19-year-old Danish student, shivering under a
relentlessly overcast sky, tugging gently at the stud that is
pierced through her lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   It had rained all day on the 50,000 mostly young people who
gathered Friday on this farm about 25 miles west of the Danish
capital Copenhagen, on the second day of the four-day annual rock
festival. But the rain only added to the festive atmosphere at
this, one of Europe's longest-running and biggest music shows,
which drew 170 performers and the likes of Willie Nelson, Lou Reed,
and Iron Maiden.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight, the carnival mood turned to horror after
the Seattle band Pearl Jam took the stage. Thousands of fans surged
forward. Eddie Vedder, the band's charismatic lead singer,
recognized the danger immediately, urging the crowd to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was screaming, he was scared,'' Rasmussen said. ``There was
just a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen said people began slipping and falling on the muddy
ground in front of the stage. But while the crowd screamed and the
band screamed, the human tide surged forward inexorably.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the crush of bodies left eight young men dead, three
fans seriously injured, and 26 more requiring hospital treatment.
Among the dead were Danish, German, Swedish, and Dutch victims,
police said. They were all in their teens or 20s. The
identification and notification process was going slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy _ one of rock 'n' roll's deadliest _ cast a pall
over Denmark on what was supposed to be the biggest celebration
here in years. Saturday, the Queen of Denmark and the King of
Sweden formally opened a new $2.7 billion bridge that links their
countries for the first time and links Sweden to mainland Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With its high standard of living and low crime rate, Denmark is
an unlikely place for a tragedy of Friday's proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this don't happen in Denmark,'' said Lise
Christiansen, a hotel receptionist. ``People are walking around,
just stunned. It is hard to comprehend the horror of it. As a
parent, you see your children go off to these concerts all the time
and you think nothing of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danish prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, told Danish TV
that ``it was a terrible and tragic accident. It is very difficult
to put words on the fact that so many young people have lost their
lives in such sinister circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival here was first held in 1971, modeled on the 1969
Woodstock concert, and it is widely known as one of the most
enjoyable of its kind in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Carsten Iversen, the festival's security chief, said the
promoters ``always have said that they wanted it to be the safest
festival, and that is very visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam canceled its Sunday show in Belgium, the last leg of
its 10-week European tour that had taken them to 26 cities in 18
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Schueremans, promoter of the Werchter rock concert near
Brussels, said Pearl Jam's members were too upset to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the band had issued a statement on its Web site saying
it was devastated by the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so painful,'' the band said. ``We are all waiting for
someone to wake us and say it was just a horrible nightmare. There
are absolutely no words to express our anguish in regard to the
parents and loved ones of those precious lives that were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Festival spokesman Leif Skov said the show by the British band
The Cure, which was to follow Pearl Jam, was canceled ``out of
respect for the dead.'' But Skov said music continued on the
festival's six other stages and that the festival would go on and
conclude Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is stronger than death,'' said Skov.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Rasmussen and her friends, meanwhile, were torn over
whether to stay here or go home. Saturday, they lighted candles for
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what shows more respect, staying here or going
home,'' the Copenhagen teenager said, tears welling up in her raw
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a friend she hadn't seen since the disaster
struck approached her tentatively and the two teenage girls hugged
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're alive!'' Rasmussen cried through her sobs. ``You're
alive!''

   OFFTHECOURT _ Tennis' greatest players are competing for a grand
slam at Wimbledon, but the best entertainment is off the court.
There's sex, romance, jealousy, anger, confrontations. The men's
and women's tours are a weekly soap opera and the show is in a
perfect setting in the next two weeks with London's tabloids
battling for headlines. Kournikova's looks and lovers. Tauziat's
criticisms of Kournikova. Sampras' engagement. Steffi and Andre.
Mary Pierce back with her father . . . or not? Jennifer Capriati
touting dad. Richard Williams touting Venus and Serena. Players are
linked romantically. Coaches are sniping. Parents are whining and
players are pouting. Tennis, anyone? (Clarke, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a Supreme Court term of surpassing interest,
rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder of the court's power
to scramble settled expectations, put old questions to rest and,
ultimately, to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The justices stood by some precedents and repudiated others.
They invalidated four federal laws, continuing on the path of
subjecting the exercise of congressional authority to close and
skeptical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   During the term that began last Oct. 4 and ended June 28, the
court decided only 73 cases, the fewest of any term since the early
1950s. Although small, the docket ranged over almost the entire
constitutional landscape. The First Amendment alone, with its
provisions governing association, religion and free speech,
injected the justices into state electoral systems, high school
football games and sexually explicit cable television programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the court's most important rulings were
statutory: the invalidation of the Food and Drug Administration's
regulation of tobacco and a decision keeping many medical
malpractice cases against health maintenance organizations out of
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO decision was unanimous, as were more than a third of the
court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual,
with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases
were decided by 5-4 votes, a higher proportion than in most recent
years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and
prevailed in 13 of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The four more-liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted as a
group in the majority in only one 5-4 case, the decision striking
down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by O'Connor.
The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the
case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit
programming on cable television, Thomas, who often displays a
libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Kennedy, who almost
always adopts the free-speech position, were in the majority to
strike down the regulation, while Breyer, often sympathetic to
government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the court this term were O'Connor, who cast
only five dissenting votes; Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Kennedy,
who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the
center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the
court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's
most frequent lone dissenter before President Ronald Reagan chose
him ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for example, on criminal law, Rehnquist's vote is a fair
indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Scalia,
who dissented 15 times this term, and Thomas, who dissented 12
times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision
that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left,
Stevens dissented 28 times and Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from
equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture
this court. ``Which cases were most visible to the public this
year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and
former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration,
asked rhetorically the other day. ``Probably school prayer,
abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,''
Roberts said. ``The conventional wisdom needs to be taken
skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the
justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such
as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the
court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices
have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been
sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee
is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's
own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of
governmental power in general, both among the branches of the
federal government and between Washington and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the
general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful,
too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke
University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck
down state incursions into the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead
``the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal
government, we need it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly
drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take
it next.
</P>
<P>
   One logical path, Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian
direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against
government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment
doctrine against the uncompensated ``taking'' of private property,
for example. But Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as
his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite
succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally
questionable as a ``regulatory taking'' for which landowners must
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about
the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer.
Even a casual look at the term's 5-4 decisions shows what could lie
ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies,
if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing
federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents
if they gained another vote, while at the same time, Thomas and
three other conservative justices _ minus O'Connor _ who came up
one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid
to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that
direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much
prologue as last word.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a Supreme Court term of surpassing interest,
rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder of the court's power
to scramble settled expectations, put old questions to rest and,
ultimately, to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The justices stood by some precedents and repudiated others.
They invalidated four federal laws, continuing on the path of
subjecting the exercise of congressional authority to close and
skeptical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   During the term that began last Oct. 4 and ended June 28, the
court decided only 73 cases, the fewest of any term since the early
1950s. Although small, the docket ranged over almost the entire
constitutional landscape. The First Amendment alone, with its
provisions governing association, religion and free speech,
injected the justices into state electoral systems, high school
football games and sexually explicit cable television programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the court's most important rulings were
statutory: the invalidation of the Food and Drug Administration's
regulation of tobacco and a decision keeping many medical
malpractice cases against health maintenance organizations out of
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO decision was unanimous, as were more than a third of the
court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual,
with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases
were decided by 5-4 votes, a higher proportion than in most recent
years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and
prevailed in 13 of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The four more-liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted as a
group in the majority in only one 5-4 case, the decision striking
down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by O'Connor.
The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the
case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit
programming on cable television, Thomas, who often displays a
libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Kennedy, who almost
always adopts the free-speech position, were in the majority to
strike down the regulation, while Breyer, often sympathetic to
government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the court this term were O'Connor, who cast
only five dissenting votes; Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Kennedy,
who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the
center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the
court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's
most frequent lone dissenter before President Ronald Reagan chose
him ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for example, on criminal law, Rehnquist's vote is a fair
indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Scalia,
who dissented 15 times this term, and Thomas, who dissented 12
times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision
that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left,
Stevens dissented 28 times and Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from
equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture
this court. ``Which cases were most visible to the public this
year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and
former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration,
asked rhetorically the other day. ``Probably school prayer,
abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,''
Roberts said. ``The conventional wisdom needs to be taken
skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the
justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such
as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the
court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices
have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been
sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee
is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's
own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of
governmental power in general, both among the branches of the
federal government and between Washington and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the
general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful,
too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke
University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck
down state incursions into the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead
``the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal
government, we need it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly
drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take
it next.
</P>
<P>
   One logical path, Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian
direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against
government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment
doctrine against the uncompensated ``taking'' of private property,
for example. But Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as
his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite
succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally
questionable as a ``regulatory taking'' for which landowners must
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about
the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer.
Even a casual look at the term's 5-4 decisions shows what could lie
ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies,
if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing
federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents
if they gained another vote, whie at the same time, Thomas and
three other conservative justices _ minus O'Connor _ who came up
one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid
to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that
direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much
prologue as last word.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion
opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically
appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot
constitutionally be banned. The 5-4 decision, Stenberg vs. Carhart,
No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of
30 other states unconstitutional as well. Breyer wrote the majority
opinion; the dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas and,
surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a
``no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the
free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not
to go through with their abortions. Stevens wrote the opinion in
Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   By the 5-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's
increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal
and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of
one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated
the application of the federal age discrimination law to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a
straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law _ as opposed
to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority _
the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act
case, United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ``the
Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil
damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by
victims of crimes ``motivated by gender.'' The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the same 5-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to
make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority,
O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age
discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the
Constitution and looked only to Congress' intent in ruling that
Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False
Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Scalia wrote the
opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No.
98-1828, with Stevens and Souter dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights
challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that
bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives
and automobile owners. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno vs.
Condon, No. 98-1464.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of
federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one,
Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion
by Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the
former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state
business from companies that do business with that nation's
repressive military regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's
safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its
coast. Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701.
</P>
<P>
   Due Process &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in
their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court
ruled 6-3 that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a
judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's
objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel vs. Granville, No.
99-138, invoked the Constitution's due process protection for
parental child-rearing decisions, but failed to agree on a
definitive approach. O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion that
Rehnquist, Breyer and Ginsburg joined. Souter and Thomas provided
additional votes on the parents' side. Kennedy, Stevens and Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's 7-2 reaffirmation of Miranda vs. Arizona, in an
opinion by Rehnquist, was the leading criminal law case. The court
said in Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525, that because
Miranda ``announced a constitutional rule,'' Congress was not free
to replace the famous Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of
whether a confession was voluntary. The decision invalidated a 1968
law, known as Section 3501, by which Congress had purported to
overrule Miranda. Scalia and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down New Jersey's hate crime law, ruling 5-4
that the Constitution requires the jury to make the central
finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of whether a crime was
motivated by bias. The New Jersey law left this job to the judge.
The decision, Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, cast doubt on
federal and state laws in which judges make the crucial findings
that determine sentences. Stevens wrote the majority opinion; th
dissenters were O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy, along with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other criminal law cases were a mix of
search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law
restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.

restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 5-4, that flight at the mere sight of a police
officer can often _ although not always _ be suspicious enough to
justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Rehnquist
wrote for the majority in Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036,
upholding the search of a man who bolted from the sight of police
cars converging on a Chicago street. Stevens dissented, joined by
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defendants prevailed in two other search cases.
Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court that an anonymous tip that a
person is carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk
search in the absence of some indication that the information is
reliable. The case was Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993. And the court
ruled 7-2 that, without some particular suspicion of wrongdoing,
law enforcement agents cannot walk down the aisle of a bus
squeezing passengers' overhead carry-on bags to see if any might
contain contraband. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, in Bond
vs. U.S., No. 98-9349, while Breyer and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, a 1996 law in which Congress limited the rights of state
inmates to challenge their convictions in federal court by means of
petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the court made clear that
federal judges still have an important role to play despite the new
law's limitations. Applying the new law, the court overturned death
sentences in two cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the court was unanimous in ruling that a Virginia
death row inmate, Michael Williams, should not have been penalized
by the state's failure to provide needed evidence. Kennedy wrote
for the court in Williams vs. Taylor, No. 99-6615.
</P>
<P>
   A second ruling under the 1996 law, also confusingly called
Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, was more convoluted, producing
two controlling opinions. First, the court interpreted a provision
barring federal courts from setting aside a state court decision
unless the state ruling was an ``unreasonable'' application of
federal law. The question was the meaning of ``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because a decision was wrong did not make it necessarily
unreasonable, O'Connor wrote in a 5-4 portion of the ruling that
was joined by Rehnquist, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. In dissent,
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer said federal judges should not
have to defer to state court decisions they regarded as incorrect,
even if plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But by a 6-3 vote, in a portion of the opinion by Stevens, the
court then granted relief to the inmate in this case, Terry
Williams, on the ground that he had not received effective
assistance of counsel. Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled that documents produced in
response to a broad subpoena under a grant of immunity cannot be
used as evidence if the prosecutor did not previously know of the
documents' existence. The case, United States vs. Hubbell, No.
99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L.
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion
charges. In an opinion by Stevens, the court ruled that Hubbell's
production of thousands of personal financial records was a
``testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement.
Rehnquist dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Free Speech &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6-3 to
reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign
contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be
valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was
from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of
federal campaign law. Souter wrote the opinion, joined by
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Kennedy, Scalia
and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority,
wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's
entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect
student activity fees even from students who object to particular
activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student
organizations' viewpoints. Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of
Regents vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of
Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-3
vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa.,
that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string.
O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Rehnquist, Kennedy
and Breyer, while Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the
ordinance. Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie
vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court voted 5-4 to strike down a federal
law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours. Kennedy's majority opinion,
U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by
Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Rehnquist, Breyer, Scalia and
O'Connor dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Association &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom
of association, Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which
all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose
candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of
their right to political association, Scalia said for the 7-2
majority in California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401.
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.

documents' existence. The case, United States vs. Hubbell, No.
99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L.
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion
charges. In an opinion by Stevens, the court ruled that Hubbell's
production of thousands of personal financial records was a
``testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement.
Rehnquist dissented.

   In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6-3 to
reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign
contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be
valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was
from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of
federal campaign law. Souter wrote the opinion, joined by
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Kennedy, Scalia
and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority,
wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's
entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered
in the future.

<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect
student activity fees even from students who object to particular
activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student
organizations' viewpoints. Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of
Regents vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of
Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-3
vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa.,
that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string.
O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Rehnquist, Kennedy
and Breyer, while Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the
ordinance. Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie
vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court voted 5-4 to strike down a federal
law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours. Kennedy's majority opinion,
U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by
Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Rehnquist, Breyer, Scalia and
O'Connor dissented.

<P>
   The court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom
of association, Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which
all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose
candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of
their right to political association, Scalia said for the 7-2
majority in California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401.
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.

MIRACLE 2: METS MAUL MADDUX IN SECOND INNING
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets have had to be creative to beat the
Atlanta Braves. Whether it is a 15th-inning, bases-loaded single
over the outfield wall or nine two-out runs to complete a huge
comeback, the Mets are only just a little better when they win.
Everything they get is a struggle, and that is a pattern of the
Braves, the National League's reigning superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever team I've been with,'' said Mets pitcher Mike
Hampton, ``the Braves have been a contest _ always close games.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the Mets did something different, grabbing a lead and
continuing to pile on. This time, it was a Mets starter who was
masterful, and a Mets offense that did all the pounding. The Mets
prevailed, 9-1, and they can move into a first-place tie with the
Braves with a victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter outdueled Greg Maddux, and there wasn't much
competition. Leiter worked seven innings, allowing six hits and
striking out 12, a season-high. Derek Bell had four hits, including
two doubles and a home run, and for the second game in a row, a
home run by Mike Piazza punctuated a decisive two-out rally.
</P>
<P>
   A hit batsman, passed ball and bases-loaded walk helped Atlanta
score the game's first run on Friday, and the first run Saturday
was also unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux showed off his agility, leaping to snare a check-swing
grounder from the leadoff batter Melvin Mora. Derek Bell bounced a
double over third base, and after a ground out, Mike Piazza fanned
on a sinker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitch was wild, getting away from catcher Ferando Lunar,
and Bell raced home, sliding in headfirst as Piazza beat Lunar's
throw to first. The Mets led, 1-0, and they had only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had boasted during spring training that after so many
seasons, he had finally found his swing. A .103 career hitter,
Leiter declared that this was the season he would belt his first
home run. He has not done that yet, and in fact he has been awful,
with just two singles in 31 at-bats (.065) before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But after Benny Agbayani smoked a two-out bases-empty home run
into the left-field bullpen, giving the Mets a 2-0 lead in the
second, Leiter flared a single to left. Maddux had failed to retire
the pitcher, and by the time he got another out, the Mets had
scored five more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mora lashed a double into the left-field corner, and Leiter
stopped at third. Then Bell doubled to the same spot, two runs
scored to put the Mets ahead by 4-0, and Bell clapped his hands at
second base. The right fielder has been streaky this season, but he
is officially hot again, with a 12-game hitting streak and 11 games
in a row with a run scored _ the latter a Mets record.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo came up next, and the second baseman _ who has
overtaken Houston's Craig Biggio as the leading All-Star
vote-getter at his position _ delivered. Down in the count by 0-2,
Alfonzo roped a single to left to score Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Backing up for a play at the plate, Maddux wiped his brow as he
slowly walked back to the mound. His pitches were high and he
seemed exhausted, perhaps because of the virus that had caused him
to miss Thursday's start.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching coach Leo Mazzone visited the mound, but he did not
tell Maddux to do what happened next. Maddux's first pitch to
Piazza wound up clanging off the pavilion for the center-field TV
cameras, a two-run homer that made it 7-0 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   For Piazza, the home run was his 23rd of the season, and the
runs batted in gave him 70. He now has driven in runs in his last
14 games, three games shy of the major league record held by Ray
Grimes of the 1922 Chicago Cubs. Piazza also has a 19-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux would bat in the third, but he was through on the mound.
Maddux is having another fine season, and in a few days he will
most likely be named to his eighth All-Star team. But this was his
shortest outing in four years, as he allowed seven runs on seven
hits in his two innings. &QL;

5 RETESTED AFTER QUESTIONABLE SCREENINGS SHOW SIGNS OF CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  By SHERRI DAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five women who are believed to have received
second-rate mammograms from two radiologists whose licenses have
been suspended showed signs of breast cancer after being retested,
state health officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The women are among more than 11,000 patients who were examined
in the last five years by the doctors, Steven J. Bier and Mario
DiBlasio, who provided government-financed breast cancer screenings
to poor women in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia Novello,
suspended their licenses in May, accusing them of conducting
inaccurate diagnostic tests and billing for services they did not
provide.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspensions, the State Health Department said it would
try to find the doctors' patients and retest them at state expense.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2,100 of the 11,000 patients have been screened.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 400 need additional testing, including the five who
showed strong indications of breast cancer, officials said. Those
five women must now have biopsies to determine if they actually do
have cancer, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Bier's lawyer, Barry Berke, said that his client had ``always
had the health and welfare of his patients as his highest
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Dr. Bier is concerned with the best interest of his
patients, he has been assisting and locating patient records to
review and has been conducting his own review of the actual
facts,'' Berke said. ``He is confident that after a full
examination of the facts as opposed to ambiguous and unreliable
statistical inferences he will be completely vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBlasio, when reached by telephone Saturday, said that he had
been unaware of the findings involving the five women _ which were
reported Saturday in The Daily News and The New York Post _ but
would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier interviews he said that he was being unfairly
maligned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, a spokesman for the Health Department, said it was
not clear if the five women whose tests displayed indications of
breast cancer developed their conditions before or after the two
doctors screened them. But, he said, the poor quality of Bier's
mammograms was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through law enforcement we received about 300 mammograms done
by Dr. Biers' office, and our experts have reviewed those and
basically found them to be totally inadequate, which raises other
concerns,'' Signor said.  &QL;

GUARDIAN ANGELS SHIFT FOCUS TO CHILDREN AND INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Guardian Angels, once known for patrolling the
New York subways and making citizen arrests, are entering their
third decade with several updated programs, including a patrol that
monitors the Internet, crime prevention for young children and a
squad that wears, instead of the trademark red beret, crimson
bicycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Angels are even available in the in-line skater version, in
Central Park on weekends, according to group organizers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Guardian Angels began patrolling the ``Muggers
Express,'' also know as New York's No. 4 subway train, in 1979,
they drew the animosity of the transit police and of public
officials, who called them vigilantes. Their credibility was hurt
when Curtis Sliwa, head of the group, said that they had faked
several of their crime-fighting exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, calls from the public have centered more on keeping
children out of trouble with gangs or drug dealers, Sliwa said, so
the Angels' 150 patrollers are no longer the group's main focus.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberangels, the group's Web site, fields ``a group of highly
skilled and highly motivated volunteers over the age of 18, who
virtually patrol the Internet looking for child pornography,
stalkers, child predators, groups advocating child abuse and
pedophilia, hate and bigotry sites and scam artists,'' according to
the site, www.cyberangels.org. In all, 5,000 volunteers work on the
site, Sliwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Urban Angels program, the group mentors children
ages 8 to 15 teaching them character development and communication
skills, and arranging for them to do volunteer work in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is no longer teens, but kids ages 8 to 15, and
what to do to keep them from becoming troublemakers,'' Sliwa said.
``We could continue with the patrols, but that's not where the need
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian Angels have branched out, with chapters in Japan,
Sweden, England _ where an all-woman contingent patrols the London
subway system _ and 28 cities in the United States, Sliwa said.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Angel recruits are still trained in self-defense
and physical conditioning, legal issues, and first aid, including
CPR. No alcohol, drugs or weapons are allowed, and a young man in
an Angels T-shirt routinely frisks Sliwa, and others, when they go
in to the group's headquarters on Eighth Avenue near 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still focus on the adversarial reaction people had to
us earlier, and say, `Are you still vigilantes?''' Sliwa said.
``Clearly, we're not,'' he said.

WATCH OUT FOR THE ROCKET'S RED GLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM LUBELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those patriotic fireworks displays of light, color and noise may
also be explosions of toxic particulates, an environmental magazine
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth Island Journal, a quarterly magazine published by the
San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, says in an article in
its summer issue that aerial displays can generate increased levels
of airborne arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, copper, zinc and
chromium. Citing a Swedish technical journal, the article links
airborne chemical particulates to lung cancer and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the most noted study of the effects of
fireworks displays on public health was conducted by the
Environmental Protection Agency on July 4, 1976, in St. Louis.
Taking atmospheric samples near the site where a large fireworks
display was held that night, the EPA found the total concentration
of fine particulate matter in the air after fireworks was about
twice that of the morning's measurement. The level of arsenic was
found to be more than 28 times the level detected 12 hours before,
and the level of the toxic element antimony about 200 times the
previous level.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists differ on how to interpret such data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a threat,'' said Philip K. Hopke, chairman of the
chemistry department at Clarkson University and a member of the
EPA's Strategies Advisory Committee. ``For those susceptible, it
could be another insult that could really hurt them. It's a real
possibility.'' Those susceptible include people with
cardiopulmonary illnesses or asthma, and children, whose immune
systems may not be able to fight off the effects of short-term
exposure to airborne particulates.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says Jonathan M. Samet, co-author of a report
by the Health Effects Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which studied
the correlation between microscopic air pollutants and
cardiopulmonary-related deaths in 90 American cities, ``We don't
really know what the effects are of short-term exposure for these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks makers strongly object to charges about their
products' safety. John Steinberg, president of the Pyrotechnics
Guild International, said that the industry is ``very highly
regulated'' and that ``fireworks made in or imported into the
U.S.A. must exclude harmful chemicals.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ C RA-A-A-CK!
</P>
<P>
   No noise in the major leagues compares to the impact of Mike
Piazza's bat with a thrown baseball. Not McGwire. Not Sosa. Not
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The collision carries to the far corners of a crowded ballpark,
and also crashes through the speakers of a television set or a
radio. That impact makes you pick up your head to see where the
ball is heading, the way Piazza's savagely clubbed three-run homer
thudded against the left-field facade Friday night. The wallop
stunned the Braves at the end of an improbable and by now historic
10-run rally in the eighth inning that allowed the New York Mets to
shock the Atlanta Braves, 11-8, at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams went back at it again Saturday afternoon _ and
Piazza had another home run in the Mets' 9-1 victory _ after barely
enough time for the concussion to die down, along with the cheers
and the holiday fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that resonance is part of the deepening relationship between
two ball clubs, the Mets and the Braves, perhaps just in time for
the geniuses of baseball to realign it out of significance.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown together in the National League's East Division, the Mets
and the Braves have created their own little duel, still lopsided
in favor of Atlanta, but at least starting to take on some depth
and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Rivalries make the games mean something, give them a context.
Otherwise, they are just contests between fine athletes. When the
Giants take on the Washington Redskins on a grim autumnal
afternoon, fans reminisce about how Lawrence Taylor waved urgently
for the medics after breaking Joe Thiesmann's leg at midfield.
There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   When the faded Boston Celtics meet the resurgent Los Angeles
Lakers, there are memories of ancient series in late spring,
Russell and West, McHale and Abdul-Jabbar. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   When Italy plays France in the finals of the European soccer
championships Sunday in Rotterdam, there will be memories of the 31
times these nations have played, starting in 1910. France has won
the last two World Cup encounters, 2-0, in Mexico City in 1986 and
then the quarterfinals in St. Denis in 1996, on the dreaded penalty
kicks. My wife and I watched in a French cafe in Aix-en-Provence,
and she kicked me under the table to stop me from twitching every
time Roberto Baggio made a move. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets and the Braves are just getting interesting, but in
fact the two teams go back a ways. The Braves have their roots in a
damp and seedy little nook called Braves Field in the Back Bay
section of Boston, when they used to play the Brooklyn Dodgers and
New York Giants 11 times each, home and away.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953 the Mets were
founded from the dregs of other rosters in 1962 and Spahn and Aaron
visited the rusted, rickety Polo Grounds. They were swept in a
doubleheader by the dismal Mets, after which Bobby Bragan, the
manager of the Braves, said he was glad to escape this ``chamber of
horrors'' _ surely a description Bobby Cox might have revived for
Shea on Friday night. The Braves and Mets have had their
differences. On May 4, 1964, in County Stadium (you could look it
up, but I was there), the clubs staged an old-fashioned dust-up at
home plate, after Ed Bailey of the Braves resented a characteristic
hard slide by Ron Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the Mets' 73-year-old manager wound up
underneath 23-year-old Denis Menke of the Braves, who had this
horrible thought: ``Oh, my God, I've killed Casey Stengel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hah. Fat chance. Writers went out drinking with Casey long after
midnight. The old boy looked a little creaky but totally denied
ever being on the field during the fray. He was still going strong
at last call, as I vaguely remember. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets beat the Braves in the 1969 National League
Championship Series. The Mets beat the Braves regularly when they
were good in the '80s. The Braves beat the Mets pretty regularly
since they got good in the '90s. There is a history.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can surely remember how the Braves killed the Mets'
wild-card hopes on the final lost weekend of 1998. They certainly
can recall how the Braves put the Mets into a tailspin last
September, but then how the Mets roared back from a three-game
deficit to throw the fear of Melvin Mora into the Braves before
finally succumbing in the 11th inning of the sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the playoffs last year, the Mets had won only 9 of 32
games from the Braves in the past two seasons, going into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good rivalry,'' said Stan Kasten, the president of the
Braves, being gallant. ``The Mets are one of the two or three best
teams in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even latter-day Hunt-Bailey traces in Piazza's being
upended by Brian Jordan in the playoffs last year, but nobody duked
anybody this time around. Then there is the matter of John Rocker,
who took it personally when verbal assassins shouted ugly things at
him from the stands. Rocker's diatribe against New York (actually
against the diversity of America itself) was the reason for the
heightened police presence at Shea this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Braves will take a while to shake the memory of all
those bases on balls, the sizzle of the fuse cord leading to the
terminal explosion of Piazza's brute home run. The history grows.

MOB BOSS VINCENT GIGANTE CONVALESCING IN FORTH WORTH HOSPITAL
PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vincent Gigante, the former boss of the Genovese
crime family who used to roam the streets of the New York's
Greenwich Village wearing pajamas and a robe _ trying to show he
was mentally incompetent to stand trial, according to prosecutors _
is spending his days in a hospital prison in Fort Worth, Texas,
said one of his lawyers, Michael Marinaccio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been there for several months now,'' Marinaccio said.
``He has the same health problems he always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems include a heart condition that has required two
open heart surgeries, plus mental health problems, Marinaccio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of his physical health has always been frail, plus
he is suffering from dementia, so they have to monitor him both
physically and psychologically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gigante is serving a 12-year prison sentence for racketeering
and murder-conspiracy convictions.

   HURRICANE-TAMER _ Imagine a ferocious hurricane reduced to a
summer squall. Think Hurricane Andrew on Prozac. Peter Cordani says
he can make it happen. The Palm Beach Gardens resident insists a
simple soil moistener will disrupt, if not destroy, hurricanes.
Laugh if you want, but Cordani, 39, says his idea can save your
life or your house. ``This is a very serious thing,'' he said from
his office in a warehouse that serves as the headquarters for his
privately held Dyn-O-Mat Inc. ``This could change the world.''

   NURSING-HOME-WORKERS _ WASHINGTON _ A nursing home in Palm Beach
County, Fla. wants to hire workers to assist elderly residents eat
but has been blocked by a federal regulation. Nursing homes in Ohio
and several other states also want to use ``single task'' employees
to assist residents in eating and to push their wheelchairs from
one place to another. The feds have stopped them. Patient rights
advocates support the government, claiming single task employees
won't solve the problem of understaffing in nursing homes. A bill
is pending in Congress to overturn the regulation blocking single
task workers. (Lipman, Cox News Service). With photos from Palm

   SCHOOLS-DISABLED _ WASHINGTON _ Disappointed by how slowly their

young people at a two-day meeting here demanded a bigger say in how
they are educated in public schools. In candid replies to the
students and their advocates, a dozen Clinton administration
officials explained why the law passed in 1997 to give students
that right is under-enforced, and why it will probably take many
years for most schools to do a better job of coordinating their
education programs with the services provided to the disabled by
other state, local and federal agencies. (Mollison, Cox News

   SOUTH-INFLUENCE _ As the South enters the next century, the

a relatively simple matter to determine the handful of companies,
along with the Farm Bureau or some other powerful, state-based
organization, which held sway in each South legislature. The new
economy and the rise of public-interest lobbying have dramatically
changed this picture. We look at data on political contributions

yearly ranks the state's most influential lobbyists. (Baxter,

   MEXICO-ELECTION _ MEXICO CITY _ The curator of the Emiliano
Zapata Museum is proud of his country's revolutionary past. But on
Sunday, he's voting against the political party that sprung from
that bloody upheaval 80 years ago. ``We're going for change,'' he
said without hesitation. ``Enough of corruption.'' Whether Mexico's
ruling party _ which has controlled this country's presidency for
71 years - loses or wins, Mexican politics will never be the same
after this Sunday. This is a country of striking wealth and
poverty, with the world's longest-reigning political party. It is
the fifth-largest oil producer in the world, but half the nation
lives in poverty. Sunday's election will determine whether the
ruling party will be jettisoned - or remain in power for another
six years. After decades of legendary PRI fraud, this election is
supposed to the cleanest ever. Yet it has already been tainted by
allegations of pressure tactics, vote-buying and lingering media
bias (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and map-graphic

are much too complex. The stuff that follows in the wake of

without help. The immobilized wrestlers symbolized Microsoft today
_ its powerful programming skills and enormous market power in
danger of being toppled and left helpless by a government antitrust
action. But the court battle back in Washington hardly seems to
have registered here in the Seattle suburbs. Pressing ahead to make
its products more all-encompassing than ever, the company's high

life as a young man in New York when he hung around with an
aspiring teenage actor named Robert DeNiro and caught the eye of
William Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is
often hypnotic in its imagery (``. . . a wind hits and streaks of
snow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a
white-out.''), the other a recollection of another life and another
world entirely. Of DeNiro he writes: ``When he's unhappy his
parents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly angry, as if the
responsibility he takes for keeping in touch with them, in order to
keep in touch, identifies him as their cause for being apart. An
only child's trial.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26.

   BOOK-REVIEW-TS _ From the first days of the Colonies, the United
States has been something like a mutt in search of its pedigree.
Nothing illustrates the point more clearly than our poetry. What's
more American: W.S. Merwin's ``The River of Bees'' or Langston
Hughes' ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,

 &HT;    Reducing hurricanes to thunderstorms?
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Imagine a ferocious hurricane reduced to a
summer squall. Think Hurricane Andrew on Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cordani says he can make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   He insists a simple soil moistener will disrupt, if not destroy,
hurricanes. Laugh if you want, but Cordani, 39, says his idea can
save your life or your house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious thing,'' he said from his office in a
warehouse that serves as the headquarters for his privately held
Dyn-O-Mat Inc. ``This could change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Wayne T. Crowder of Greenberg Traurig, is more
cautious, but no less excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a hurricane threatens, people begin to wonder what it's
going to mean to them,'' Crowder said. `` `What about my wedding or
my picnic or my business?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any good science experiment, we have to take this to the
next step. Will this be commercially exploitable? I doubt it very
much. But what a great gift to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordani demonstrates the process in his office using 1 1/2
gallons of water and two tablespoons of Soil Moist, polyacrylamide
granules that are spread around plant roots to keep them from
drying out. Most local lawn and garden stores carry 3-ounce bags of
the moistener for about $3.
</P>
<P>
   Cordani has piqued the interest of a prominent hurricane expert,
who is used to hearing such ideas as placing giant windmills along
the coast to blow away hurricanes or firing liquid nitrogen
torpedoes into storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of this stuff from people who are just plain
loony,'' said Hugh Willoughby, director of the hurricane research
division at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration office in Miami. ``But he's really thinking. He's
hit upon something that's within the realm of physical
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Cordani envisions: spraying or dropping a large
quantity of Soil Moist from airplanes into a hurricane while it's
over open water.
</P>
<P>
   Cordani says Soil Moist will absorb at least 250 times its
weight, turning the storm's moisture into a gel that falls into the
ocean. Once it hits the saltwater, the gel returns to a liquid
state and dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes Soil Moist, Cleveland-based JRM Chemical
Inc., says it won't hurt the environment. Other brands of soil
moistener could prove to be as effective, Cordani said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordani has applied for a patent on the hurricane application of
Soil Moist and eventually hopes to license it to the government,
which, in turn, would be responsible for determining when to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said the idea sounds promising, but scientists must
conduct research and experiments to determine how practical it is.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Willoughby said, scientists might need to dump at
least 1,000 tons of Soil Moist an hour into a hurricane to
significantly reduce its effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this worked, it probably would be worthwhile only in the
most intense hurricanes,'' said Willoughby, who has flown into
nearly 400 typhoons and hurricanes. ``If you have a hurricane like
Andrew, that may be the only time it would really pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hurricane experts have similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting hypothesis,'' said Chris Landsea, a
research meteorologist with NOAA. Landsea previously worked with
William Gray, the Colorado State University professor renowned for
predicting the number of named storms each hurricane season, which
stretches from June 1 to Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But while Landsea believes Cordani's theories have merit, he
points out that hurricanes are incredible forces of nature that
generate new moisture quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My offhand guess,'' Landsea said, ``is that if you did remove
all the moisture from a storm _ which would be a huge task _ it
would be replaced in a matter of a few hours again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sheets, former director of the National Hurricane Center in
Coral Gables, agrees that it would be difficult to disrupt a storm
that spans 1 million cubic miles of atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major problem that most people with ideas about how to
modify a hurricane (have) is that they do not comprehend the size
of the storm,'' Sheets said in an e-mail message. ``Also, exactly
how the introduction of (Soil Moist) might modify clouds in a
hurricane or even in simply a single tropical cloud or thunderstorm
would require considerable research.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviets claimed they could use
standard cement powder to make clouds collapse. U.S. scientists,
including Sheets, began testing the theory by dropping cement
powder into the upper parts of growing clouds over tropical waters.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment ended when there was no noticeable effect on the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Other hurricane-modification efforts _ including cloud seeding,
which involved forming a second hurricane eyewall that could
strangle the first _ also have failed. In 1998, the American
Meteorological Society said ``there is no sound physical hypothesis
for the modification of hurricanes, tornadoes or damaging winds in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cordani, who used to install underground pipes for country
club homes, is far from discouraged by the lack of historical
precedent. He insists he's not trying to take on the entire
hurricane _ just the all-important eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you do that, you kill the heart of the storm,'' he said.
``I don't expect to shut down the whole storm, and then 20 minutes
later it's sunny again. But this stuff will reduce the impact
considerably so that all we're dealing with is a thunderstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Cordani started Dyn-O-Mat, a 24-employee company that
manufactures and distributes environmentally safe cleaning
products, including bilge balls, which absorb hazardous fluids,
including gas and oil, from the bilges of pleasure boats. The
business is named for its first product _ a thick black rug made of
polypropylene that absorbs anything that drips on it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he worked with Soil Moist for about two years before he
realized the possible effect it could have on hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he was gardening at his parents' house and used the
granules around the plants' roots. At the same time, he was working
on a water scooter, and he noticed that his hand, which was oily
from applying Soil Moist, became clean when he touched the salt
water in the scooter.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, as he was watching television footage of a
hurricane hitting land, he wondered whether a large amount of Soil
Moist could disrupt a storm. So he and his wife, Lisa, conducted a
test in their garage using Soil Moist, bottles of salt- and fresh
water and a blender to simulate high winds.
</P>
<P>
   It worked exactly as he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, we freaked out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with JRM Chemical, Soil Moist's owner, said they never
knew their product might be used so creatively. They have discussed
its application during the past two years with Cordani and wish him
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless him,'' JRM Vice President Scott Wiesler said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordani has kept his theory under wraps while he and his
attorneys applied for a patent, which is pending, and discussed
their next move. NOAA's Willoughby has put Cordani in touch with
officials who will test the theory with storm clouds. That's
expected to take place this month in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Critics might point out that it's risky to fool with Mother
Nature. But except for providing rainfall, hurricanes havalue, said
Landsea, the NOAA meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say that science can be that simple,'' said attorney
Crowder. ``But I think it can be that simple.''

3 TOUR RIDERS BANNED AS ARMSTRONG BEGINS TITLE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for updating thruout) 
By SAMUEL ABT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ With a strong but not dominating ride,
Lance Armstrong opened the defense of his championship Saturday in
a Tour de France that was shaken just hours before the start by the
ouster of three riders for failing a blood test that hints at the
use of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of all three time trials in the last Tour, Armstrong
finished second Saturday. The man ahead of him, by two seconds over
a 16.5-kilometer (10-mile) flat course, was David Millar, 23, a
Scot riding in his first Tour de France. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Millar, who rides for the Cofidis team in France, was both
thrilled and overwhelmed by his victory, bursting into tears when
Armstrong, the U.S. leader of the U.S. Postal Service team and the
last man to start, crossed the line. ``I don't believe it,'' Millar
said, looking sincere in his disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot not to believe as the 87th Tour began its
three-week, 3,660-kilometer (2,274-mile) journey counterclockwise
around France. The three disqualifications and the shadow they cast
over the Tour ranked atop the list.
</P>
<P>
   With no immediate right of appeal, the riders were suspended
from the sport for 15 days by the International Cycling Union,
which governs the sport. About a half-dozen riders have been
similarly punished each year since the blood tests were introduced
in 1997, but this was a first in the Tour de France, the world's
most prestigious bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, who directs the race, said: ``I'm glad the
cheaters were caught. This shows that the rules are working.''
Similar views were expressed by other officials, who seemed
determined not to have the case blight opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The race was disrupted and nearly collapsed in 1998 when a drug
scandal resulted in the expulsion of one team and the withdrawal of
five others to protest police searches for illegal
performance-enhancing drugs. Since then, the Tour and the sport
itself have attempted to regain public confidence by developing new
tests to detect drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The riders disqualified Saturday are Sergei Ivanov, 25, who won
the Russian national championship last Sunday for the second
consecutive year; Rossano Brasi, 28, an Italian, and Andrei
Hauptman, 25, a Slovene. Ivanov rides for the Farm Frites team from
the Netherlands, Brasi for the Polti team from Italy and Hauptman
for the Vini Caldirola team from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the disqualifications followed by a day a
public warning by Leblanc that any rider tempted to use drugs in
the Tour was ``playing with fire and risking his reputation.''
Although blood tests can be administered at any time during the
race, the one Saturday was part of the official schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test was no surprise, no secret,'' said Martin Bruin, a
Dutchman who heads the drug inspection team sent to the Tour by the
International Cycling Union, which governs the sport. ``The test
was scheduled and everybody knew we were coming to test them.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors, whom the riders always refer to as ``the vampires,''
arrived at each of the 20 teams' hotels between 7 and 8:45 saturday
morning to draw blood from the crook of each rider's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The blood is tested to determine the hematocrit level _ the
number of red corpuscles. A level higher than 50 percent sends a
rider home for two weeks ``to regain his health,'' as the rules put
it since the International Cycling Union insists that the
inspection is a health test, not one for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a hematocrit level above 50 percent indicates the
use of EPO, an artificial hormone developed for patients on kidney
dialysis to increase their red-blood corpuscles. These carry oxygen
to muscles and thus increase performance in such endurance sports
as bicycle racing, rowing, marathon running and long-distance
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 180 riders tested Saturday morning was, of course,
Millar, who is an outspoken advocate of clean racing. He is also a
fine time-trialer and was among a handful of favorites for this
first of 21 daily stages since he won a similar race against the
clock _ flat and nearly the same distance _ two weeks ago in the
Route du Sud, his final preparation race.
</P>
<P>
   Just Friday night, having a beer with some friends, he was
marveling at the size and scope of the Tour de France, which he was
seeing for the first time. ``I can't believe it,'' he said,
unknowingly rehearsing his speech before he donned the leader's
yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Scot, who was born on Malta and reared in Hong Kong because
his father is a commercial airline pilot, said afterward that he
hoped to stay in that jersey at least through the team time trial
on Tuesday. ``And we've got a strong team, so we should do well
there, too,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the stage in 19 minutes 3 seconds and said he was
hoping to break 18 minutes over the straightforward course in cool
and overcast weather. Armstrong was two seconds slower, with
Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, third, 13 seconds behind
the winner, and Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom who won the Tour
in 1997, fourth, 14 seconds late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed,'' Armstrong said, ``but I'm happy
that David won. He's a good friend of mine and a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the favorites who lost more than a minute were Franck
Vandenbroucke, a Belgian with Cofidis; Bobby Julich, an American
with Credit Agricole; Michael Boogerd, a Dutchman with Rabobank,
and Richard Virenque, a Frenchman with Polti. Marco Pantani, an
Italian with Mercatone Uno and the winner of the 1998 Tour, lost
more than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two familiar faces were missing from the race. Chris Boardman,
an Englishman with Credit Agricole and the winner of three opening
races, was not entered by his team because of illness. And Mario
Cipollini, an Italian with Saeco and the king of the sprinters, did
not show up either, enabling his replacement, Daniel Atienza, a
Spaniard, to finish in 158th place among the 177 starters.

ARMLESS-LANDSCAPER-COX-- Even among people who have never met him,
Marty Ravellette is unforgettable. Past the initial shock, it is
amazing to watch the 60-year-old landscaper as he earns a living,
without arms. Ravellette, born without arms, is the owner of Hands
on Landscaping in Chapel Hill, N.C. ``I have learned to accept
myself,'' he says. ``You should be able to accept me.''

Only about one-third of the nation's immigrants have obtained
citizenship, the smallest proportion in the past century. Critics
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say the decline was
caused by policy changes that made it more difficult and more
expensive to become a citizen. Immigrants take the oath of
allegiance as they are sworn in as U.S. citizens at the INS
building in downtown Atlanta. (Rich Addicks/The Atlanta

Plains. Despite an economic boom throughout much of the U.S., all
that remains for Warsaw, North Dakota's 40 or 50 citizens,
descendants of Polish immigrants, is the one bar, Tork's Polski

Minnesota and the Canadian border down through Nebraska into Kansas
and Oklahoma, the nation's long run of growth and prosperity has
blown right by. In Ardoch, N.D., population 49, the city hall is

Mountain, N.D., the forces of decline have chased away the

prices in 30 years and seven years of ruinous drought and floods,
the inertia of decline has begun to intrude on small town life
throughout much of the Great Plains. Leslie Geir, 47, with two of

Five prisons operate in Youngstown, Ohio, with about 40,000

time to ponder long lists of regrets, with their children, often
little known and less seen, at the top of those lists. At the
Northeastern Ohio Correctional Center, a new social experiment is
underway. Sharing thoughts and meals, prison officials and inmates
tested a program, as merciful as it is experimental, to let 11

SOME MATCHES TURN INTO MARATHONS; CAPRIATI CAN STOP THE MUSIC;
SELES HAS BEEN THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The witnesses to two epic matches Saturday
left the All England Club with their tennis appetites sufficiently
stuffed. Just after Mark Philippoussis broke the tension on Court 2
by winning with a near record 20-18 fifth set, Martina Navratilova
exited the grounds after losing the final set of her wrenching
mixed doubles match, 18-16.
</P>
<P>
   Each match dripped with drama. The end to Philippoussis' day
finally arrived when the backhand return by Sjeng Schalken died
into the net to end a 5 hour 1 minute match that was over after a
fifth set that lasted 2:15.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the longest match in memory to be played on one
day, the finish fell short of the 46 total games for a set that
Nicola Pietrangeli and Nikki Pilic needed to end a second-round
match in 1962. The epic third-round victory by Philippoussis ended
with this mind-boggling score: 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (4), 20-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hung in there, and stayed mentally tough,'' said
Philippoussis, who served 44 aces in the match. Afterward, Tim
Henman, who won in straight sets Saturday, smiled as he asked
Philippoussis, ``What took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   The length of the day was far more than Navratilova bargained
for when she decided to return to Wimbledon after a five-year
absence to play doubles. Earlier in the afternoon, she and her
doubles partner, Mariaan de Swardt, won a three-set match. As
darkness fell, Navratilova and her mixed doubles partner, Mahesh
Bhupathi, were locked into a three-hour drama against Jan Siemerink
and Miriam Oremans. On match point, Bhupathi sent a backhand into
the net to finish off the evening 6-4, 6-7 (5), 18-16.
</P>
<P>
   The break for Philippoussis came at 18-18 when he converted on a
triple break point with an inside-outside forehand down the line.
He then served out for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered myself a fighter,'' said Philippoussis
who will play Henman in the next round. ``That was a good match for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   CAPRIATI CAN STOP THE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   As a band played during a nearby Center Court ceremony, an
irritated Jennifer Capriati was morphing into the parent of a teen
on Court 3: Hey, turn it down. She could not concentrate on Yayuk
Basuki.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 5-2 in the first set of her third round match, Capriati
called for a referee and asked that someone cut off the band that
was escorting in the past champions during a parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `What's going on? Can they turn off the
music?,''' Capriati said. ``He said they were pretty much done in
10 minutes. I said, `Well, in 10 minutes, I could be down a set and
a half already. I don't have 10 minutes to spare.' He just said
that he'd do his best.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the music stopped, and Capriati began to play.
She staged a blistering rally to take over the match and barge past
Basuki 7-6 (4), 6-0. Basuki told reporters from Indonesia that she
was displeased when Capriati interrupted play to call a referee,
and believe she showed disrespect by breaking her momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fair,'' Capriati said. ``I have every right to call the
referee. It was on a changeover. It's as important as calling for
an injury timeout to me. It stopped the music, so I'm not concerned
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is concentrating on recouping her game after her
first-round exit at the French Open. Her next step will be
difficult. In the round of 16, she will face second-seeded Lindsay
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous time I played her, I came close,'' said Capriati,
who lost to Davenport 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 in February.
</P>
<P>
   SELES HAS BEEN THERE
</P>
<P>
   Although she is considered one of the best-liked players on the
Tour now, Monica Seles can somewhat relate to the hazing
experiences Alexandra Stevenson said she encountered during her
rookie year on the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my first year, there were two players on the Tour, and
for whatever reason, they didn't like me,'' Seles said without
naming names. ``They were the players who talked a lot on the Tour
to other players. I was 14 or 15, really in my own shell. I just
said, `Hi,' and `Bye,' and looked down at the floor. I was very
shy. I think that's how people perceived me in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I was 18, they realized I was different. I changed
probably as a person, too. I was much more open. I wasn't as shy as
I was when I was 14.'' &QL;

   (NYT11) CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- July 1, 2000 --
ARMLESS-LANDSCAPER-COX-- Even among people who have never met him,
Marty Ravellette is unforgettable. Past the initial shock, it is
amazing to watch the 60-year-old landscaper as he earns a living,
without arms. Ravellette, born without arms, is the owner of Hands
on Landscaping in Chapel Hill, N.C. ``I have learned to accept
myself,'' he says. ``You should be able to accept me.''
Ravellette's disability affects an estimated 2,000 people in the
United States, according to the National Center of Health

   (NYT10) ATLANTA, Ga. -- July 1, 2000 -- IMMIGRANTS-CITIZENS-COX
-- America has more immigrants, but fewer are becoming citizens.
Only about one-third of the nation's immigrants have obtained
citizenship, the smallest proportion in the past century. Critics
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say the decline was
caused by policy changes that made it more difficult and more
expensive to become a citizen. Immigrants take the oath of
allegiance as they are sworn in as U.S. citizens at the INS
building in downtown Atlanta. (Rich Addicks/The Atlanta

towns of the West that turned to shells once they were stripped of
their gold, new ghost towns are sprouting over much of the Great
Plains. Despite an economic boom throughout much of the U.S., all
that remains for Warsaw, North Dakota's 40 or 50 citizens,
descendants of Polish immigrants, is the one bar, Tork's Polski
Dom, and at the corner of two county roads, the surreal
100-year-old St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church. Irene Durey has
been taking care of the sacristy in Saint Stanislaus since 1984.

Minnesota and the Canadian border down through Nebraska into Kansas
and Oklahoma, the nation's long run of growth and prosperity has
blown right by. In Ardoch, N.D., population 49, the city hall is
padlocked, its windows boarded, its electricity meter still, its
clapboard facade unpainted for decades. Ardoch is among the
withering rural communities in the northeastern corner of North

   (NYT5) MOUNTAIN, N.D. -- July 1, 2000 -- DYING-TOWNS-3 -- In
Mountain, N.D., the forces of decline have chased away the
optimistic spirit of America. Buffeted by debt, the lowest wheat
prices in 30 years and seven years of ruinous drought and floods,
the inertia of decline has begun to intrude on small town life
throughout much of the Great Plains. Leslie Geir, 47, with two of
his three children, Chris, 15, left, and Laura, 10, on their farm
in Mountain, N.D., established by his great-grandfather. To make
ends meet, Geir's wife Delores is an aide in the home for the
elderly, and daughter Diane works there part time. All the Geirs
still have hope. Chris intends to be a farmer, and Diane hopes to
settle on a farm. ``There is no better place to raise a family,''
says Leslie Geir. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)

SECRET STATUS ROARS TO WIN IN MOTHER GOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her name is Secret Status, a daughter of A.P. Indy
and grand-daughter of Seattle Slew and Alydar, and the last time
she ran was two months ago when she charged from 13th place into a
six-length victory in the Kentucky Oaks. Secret Status showed her
powerful closing ability again Saturday when she roared through the
homestretch at Belmont Park to win the Mother Goose, the second
race in the Triple Tiara series for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was not as great as in the Oaks, but Secret Status
still got there first by the length of her neck over Jostle, who
won the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico. Jostle had a length and
a half on Finder's Fee, who three weeks ago won the Acorn, the
first race in the Triple Tiara.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Secret Status carved out a solid claim to championship
honors for 3-year-old fillies, and her trainer, Neil Howard, said
she would continue her campaign next in the Coaching Club American
Oaks at Belmont on July 22 and in the Alabama at Saratoga on Aug.
19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the other fillies measured turning for home,'' said Pat
Day, who has ridden Secret Status five consecutive times. ``But
once we straightened away, she didn't seem too concerned about
putting Jostle away. I gave her a couple of taps and, inside the
sixteenth pole, she really took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, the jockey on Jostle, observed that his filly ``ran
a dynamite race.'' But he added: ``It took a Kentucky Oaks winner
to beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, who trains Finder's Fee, said that she ran a
good race but ``she just wasn't good enough today.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status, who is owned by Will Farish, has won six of her
10 starts overall and has finished in the money nine times. She ran
the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48, returned $3.40 for a $2 bet to win and
earned $150,000.

TERRY FORRESTAL, 52, STUNTMAN IN BOND FILMS AND ``BRAVEHEART''
</HEADLINE>
   (No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Forrestal, a British stuntman who staged and performed
action sequences for such Hollywood blockbusters as ``Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves,'' ``Braveheart'' and ``Titanic,'' died on June
10 in a jumping accident in Norway. He was 52 and lived in
Berkshire, England.
</P>
<P>
   Forrestal died while attempting what is known as a base jump
from the 3,000-foot Kjerag cliff in Lysefjord, Norway, The Times of
London reported. In base-jumping _ an acronym derived from Bridge,
Antennae, Span, Earth _ jumpers leap from a fixed point, like the
top of a building, bridge or mountain, for a relatively short drop,
using a special parachute.
</P>
<P>
   After completing seven successful jumps in Norway on an
expedition that was his own but was being documented by a
television crew, Forrestal jumped from Kjerag and landed awkwardly
on a ridge, possibly breaking his legs. Eleven hours later, while
waiting to be rescued, he apparently attempted a second jump from
the ridge using his reserve parachute, which failed to open.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading stuntmen in the film industry since entering
the field in the mid-1980s, Forrestal jumped, dived, crashed and
fought his way through some of the major action films of the last
15 years, from the James Bond episodes _ ``A View to a Kill,''
``Moonraker'' and ``Octopussy'' _ to ``Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom'' and ``Titanic,'' in which he played the ship's doomed
chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was pulled from the River Clyde during the filming
of the a television show, when a motorcycle stunt went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Philip Julian Forrestal was born in Chesterfield and
studied medicine for a year before joining the army, serving as a
senior noncommissioned officer in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, he began to work for films, specializing in
depicting urban guerrilla and jungle warfare. His last job was
``Rebel Heart,'' the BBC program about the 1916 uprising in
Ireland, for which he organized lance charges and ambushes.

PAUL ERDOS, AUTHORITY ON MAIL SURVEYS DEAD AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Erdos, a long-time market research executive who
was an authority on mail surveys, died on Wednesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos and Arthur Morgan founded Erdos &AMP; Morgan, a
Manhattan-based market research firm, in 1947. It was the first
marketing research organization to specialize in mail surveys. In
1988, Advertising Age called it ``one of the best-known names in
print audience research.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Erdos, Don Dillman, the Thomas S. Foley Distinguished
Professor of Government and Public Policy at Washington State
University, said, ``I was always impressed with how `people
oriented' he seemed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillman, who is also the president-elect of the American
Association for Public Opinion Research, said Erdos seemed to be
``treating each recipient of his mail questionnaires as someone
from whom he needed help, rather than using the utilitarian
approach of `How can I get them to do what I want them to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from Morgan, Erdos wrote a book, ``Professional
Mail Surveys.'' It was first published in 1970, when Erdos &AMP;
Morgan's long-standing clients included The National Geographic
Society, Time Inc., Dow Jones and U.S. Steel. In 1988, Advertising
Age called it ``the best-selling, most authoritative text on mail
survey research.''
</P>
<P>
   On Page 1 of the book, Erdos wrote: ``The basic distinction
between mail and other types of surveys is the fact that in
surveying by mail there is no person to ask the questions and guide
the respondent. This gives rise to important differences in survey
design, questionnaire construction, and various other aspects of
the survey. These differences result in some advantages and some
shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Erdos and Morgan won the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award,
a market research honor awarded by the Philadelphia chapter of the
American Marketing Association and the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, an article in a publication of the Philadelphia
chapter said the two men had done ``pioneering work in mail survey
methodology.'' ``Erdos and Morgan were selected for the Parlin
Award on the basis of their techniques which have made mail survey
data gathering effective, establishing new standards for response
rates,'' the article added. ``On their mailings, they average a 60
percent response rate, and in some instances have received over 80
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Morgan resigned as executive vice president of Erdos &AMP;
Morgan, and it was acquired in 1988 by Jerome Kossoff, owner and
president of Beta Research Corp. of Syosset, N.Y. Erdos stayed with
the firm and retired several years later.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos was born in Budapest and grew up there. He studied at the
University of Heidelberg, Germany _ where he met Morgan _ and at
universities in Switzerland, France and Britain. In 1937 he
received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Pecs,
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing Hitler's army in World War II, Erdos moved to New York
in 1939 after working in publishing in Hungary and Italy. In New
York he held jobs as a literary agent, in market research,
publishing and data processing and was with Fact Finders Inc., a
market research firm, from 1942 to 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos and Helen Mero were married in 1950, and she died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos is survived by a stepdaughter, Kathleen Mero Mogul of
Newton, Mass.; and three grandchildren.

 &HT;    Philippoussis survives, Sampras and Agassi advance
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ When Tim Henman took the court for his
third-round match Saturday afternoon at Wimbledon, Mark
Philippoussis and Sjeng Schalken were just beginning the fifth set
of their match.
</P>
<P>
   When Henman walked off the court a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 winner against
Hicham Arazi, Philippoussis and Schalken still were playing that
fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, five hours and one minute after they'd started, 10th
seed Philippoussis emerged the victor of the second-longest men's
singles match on record. He won 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-4),
20-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came off at 16-all,'' Henman said after his one-hour,
47-minute win. ``I just said to Philippoussis, `What took you so
long? I played my match in one set of yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian chuckled as he recounted the story later, but
when it happened, he wasn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bleeding, had blood on my shorts, felt like I'd just
been punched to death for five hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis survived the closest call of the day, as top seed
Pete Sampras, second seed Andre Agassi, eighth seed Tim Henman and
12th seed Patrick Rafter all advanced into the fourth round. Fourth
seed Gustavo Kuerten was the only player upset.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras entered his match with Justin Gimelstob amid questions
about his health but afterward remained the favorite to win the
title. He had limped through his second round because of an
inflamed left shin tendon, then spent two straight days icing and
treating the injury.
</P>
<P>
   When he took Centre Court, it showed that he also hadn't been
near a court in two days. He started with four straight
doublefaults and lost the set 6-2 in 24 minutes before surging back
to win 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in two hours, seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I was really out of sorts in the beginning,'' Sampras
said. ``I looked up and saw (Bjorn) Borg and the Rocket (Rod
Laver). At one point I wanted to throw my racket up there; they
could play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Borg and Laver, heroes of Sampras as a child, had attended
an earlier Champions' Parade celebrating the 2000 championships;
Sampras had skipped it because he needed to ice his leg. He joined
a briefer ceremony later with other players who had been on the
court for the main program.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also won easily, defeating Jerome Golmard 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
He next meets David Prinosil. Sampras plays Jonas Bjorkman in the
fourth round. While Sampras expects to struggle with the leg injury
for the rest of the fortnight, Agassi said he's playing more
purposefully this year than he was a year ago, when he lost the
final to Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was riding momentum,'' the 1999 French Open winner
said. ``This year I'm building a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, on the other hand, next plays Henman, the great
British hope. He isn't concerned about recovering physically from
his five-hour match and isn't haunted by the injury he sustained
last year on Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis had won the first set from Sampras in a
quarterfinal match and looked on course to win the match, when he
tore knee cartilage in a freak injury. He's forgotten that this
year, he said, and instead relies on the knowledge of his increased
devotion to practice and his career overall as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the training I've done paid off,'' he said in relief.
``That got me through the match. It's simple.''

 &HT;    S.C. moves Rebel flag amid anger
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a solemn, symbolic ceremony that sparked
heckling and whistle-blowing, South Carolinians lowered the
Confederate battle flag Saturday from atop the Statehouse dome,
while raising another nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The political compromise that Gov. Jim Hodges and many state
legislators had hoped would end South Carolina's flag fight instead
brought out more than 1,500 people eager to vent their disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see in the future is a continued struggle and
debate in South Carolina centered on that flag,'' said State Rep.
Joseph Neal, chairman-elect of the legislative black caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat from Hopkins is among black legislators who say the
Confederate flag is a racist symbol. They say it is undeserving of
display on the Statehouse grounds, especially in a location as
prominent as where it was placed Saturday by legislative mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In the noon ceremony broadcast by statewide television, a dozen
Confederate re-enactors marched from the Capitol to a recently
erected flagpole behind the Confederate soldiers' monument, at busy
Main and Gervais streets. As they raised the new flag, two Citadel
cadets were marching inside the Capitol with the flag they had just
removed from atop the dome.
</P>
<P>
   The cadets delivered it to Hodges in the second-floor lobby. The
governor handed it to two representatives of the South Carolina
Museum Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The old flag will now go on display in the state museum in
Columbia, 38 years after the legislature raised it above the dome
as part of a Civil War centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the flag's defenders believe it should have remained
atop the Statehouse. Some vow that the legislature will raise it
again somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing it down, said state Sen. Bill Branton (R-Summerville),
was ``the biggest mistake the General Assemby ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   But other supporters reluctantly agreed to the flag's removal as
long as it was replaced by the smaller, square version flying at
the Confederate soldiers' monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flag that we are putting up is the flag they fought
under,'' said Buck Carpenter, 55, of Trenton, S.C., one of the flag
bearers. ``It was their rallying point.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the legislature agreed to the flag plan in May and Hodges
signed it into law, the NAACP is threatening to intensify its
economic boycott of South Carolina until the flag is removed from
the Statehouse grounds. That threat angered legislators who crafted
the compromise, partly in reaction to the NAACP's boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainstream of South Carolina supports it,'' said state
Sen. Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston). ``The only people we leave
behind are the hardliners on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The discord spilled out Saturday, as it has earlier this year,
on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   State Law Enforcement Division chief Robert Stewart said police
had reported no violence during the ceremony. ``We are making
progress,'' he said, as officers urged groups shouting at one
another to move along early in the afternoon. Associated Press
reported one arrest for assault.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, police separated dozens of people who were
jeering one another over the raising of the new flag on the
30-foot-tall pole behind the soldiers' monument.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing plastic whistles and waving yellow signs that said
``Shame,'' some protested that the new flag is too visible. ``Now
it is more in our face,'' said Pat Yeary, a NAACP member from West
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, she was among an estimated 750 people who
marched silently in a NAACP vigil through downtown Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   As the methodic thumping of a drum led the procession up Gervais
Street, the Confederate flag was visible, fluttering gently above
the hilltop capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Hoots and yelps and Rebel banners propped in the back of pickup
trucks greeted the marchers. A group of flag supporters waving
flags and wearing the red-white-and-blue emblem from head to toe
ran along side, until police stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our heritage; this is our flag,'' said Gene Custer,
44, a warehouse worker in Easley, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   His 54-year-old brother, Simpsonville, S.C., truck driver James
Custer, said the NAACP won't be satisifed until it erases
Confederate symbols from the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blacks, the African-Americans do not know when to quit,''
Custer said. ``The war is not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the calm of the capitol, Robert Ford, a black senator
from Charleston who sponsored the flag legislation, predicted
emotions will calm in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are going to start talking to each other,''
Ford said, ``and that's when people are going to start respecting
each others' heritage and culture.''

NEW BRIDGE LINKS SWEDEN, DENMARK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN _ When Queen Margrethe of Denmark and King Carl
Gustaf of Sweden met Saturday in the middle of a new $2.7 billion
bridge and tunnel complex, it marked the first time since the Ice
Age some 7,000 years ago that their two countries have been linked.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, and his Swedish
counterpart, Goeran Persson, looked like long-separated brothers
when they greeted each other on a man-made island called Peberholm
in the 10-mile stretch of water that divides the countries.
</P>
<P>
   But while the royals and the politicians are literally embracing
each other as the last piece of Europe becomes linked to the
mainland, getting ordinary Danes and Swedes to enthusiastically
embrace the concept of Nordic and European unity is a little
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that bridge will bring us is more drunken Swedes,'' said
Jens Olesen, a street sweeper in Copenhagen, as he sat in a bar
here Thursday night, watching Italy defeat Holland to gain a spot
in Sunday's European soccer championship final against France.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the Danes and Swedes fought each other, feeding
ancient animosities that seem anachronistic today when both
countries are affluent, influential members of the 15-nation
European Union. Scania, the southwest region of Sweden that is now
linked by the bridge, was part of Denmark for 800 years until 1658.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes and Danes share a skepticism about the single
European currency that led them to join Britain as the only
European Union members purposely to stay out of its launch last
year. But Scandinavians love to tell you how different they are
from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lotte Vandel, an ethnologist who studies the differences between
ethnic groups in Scandinavia, said Swedes and Danes are equally
prejudiced against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotypes are well worn,'' she said. ``Swedes are
boring, stiff and always drunk. The Danes are happy, funny and
informal. We make an excellent couple because we embrace the
stereotypes of each other so enthusiastically. This is a very
impressive bridge, but a bridge can't eliminate stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by any measure, the bridge they call Oeresund after the
strait of water that both separates and unites Denmark and Sweden
is a remarkable achievement. It took seven years to build and is
the 10th longest bridge in the world, linking the Danish capital
with Malmoe, Sweden's third largest city. The bridge has created a
new European region, called Oeresund, which with 3.5 million people
ranks in size with the Hamburg, Barcelona, and Amsterdam regions.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is the central part of an ambitious physical and
psychological effort to bridge the last gap between continental
Europe and Scandinavia, an experiment in how far the European
Union's determination to mix and blur national identities of its
members can go without stirring up resentment that could doom the
goal of European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the magnificent mock-Renaissance city hall called
Radhus, Copenhagen Mayor Jens Kramer Mikkelsen predicted the bridge
will be a success. He said that while Danes and Swedes have a
tendency to dwell on what divides them, they are more like each
other than they might care to admit. Both descend from Viking
stock, and from a culture that regarded men and women as equals
long before others. Both have a generous social welfare system, and
high taxes to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Mikkelsen said those who live in the Copenhagen and Malmoe areas
speak different languages, but in a dialect that they both
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak the same language, really,'' he said. ``We read each
other's newspapers. What we have to do now is to build mental
bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilmar Reepalu, chairman of Malmoe's city council, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a poll and found that 85 percent of Swedes and 74
percent of Danes think this bridge is a positive development. We
have to exploit this optimism. People here have got to see
themselves as residents of the Oeresund region, not just of
Copenhagen and Malmoe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the bridge could bring an economic windfall to the
region, its steep toll prices are seen by some as prohibitive. It
costs about $33 for cars one-way and about $100 for trucks,
although a train ride costs about $8.
</P>
<P>
   Mette Kirk, a Danish ethnologist who interviewed hundreds of
people on both sides of the bridge, said the politicians are overly
optimistic about the bridge's ability to bring ordinary Danes and
Swedes together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict a majority of the population will not visit the
other side, simply because it is too expensive to cross the
bridge,'' said Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial that the politicians recognize the cultural
differences. Ignoring them would be one sure way to fail this
integration effort,'' she said. ``Swedes think that eating from a
plate in Denmark is dangerous because Danes don't rinse the dish
soap away. In Sweden, you don't forget to take your shoes off when
entering a Swedish home, and you don't ever ask for an ashtray at a
dining table. In Denmark, you don't say hello to a cashier. And you
must enjoy a beer at work on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   While Danes frequently dismiss Swedes as drunks, Kirk said
European Union figures show that the Danes drink more and die more
from alcohol abuse than Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most stereotypes, the ones we hold about each other are
frequently not backed up by facts,'' said Kirk. ``But it
underscores that we have been socialized differently. You can't
expect this to be an easy integration because we are different.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ferry, Swedes profess a nostalgia for the old days. Petra
Glimiker, a photographer, said many Swedes, who pay among the
highest prices for alcohol in the world, love the ferry because
alcohol is half-price on the seas. ``Touring'' is a euphemism for
drinking on the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken touring away from us,'' Glimiker said. ``It's
terrible. My uncle is so depressed. He loved to go touring.''

 MEXICANS VOTE  Sunday IN WHAT COULD UPSET 71-YEAR PRI RULE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For months, 60 million voters in this country have
been told repeatedly that this year's presidential election will be
the cleanest and fairest in Mexico's corruption-riddled history.
</P>
<P>
   Now they'll know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexicans go to the polls Sunday to decide their closest
presidential race in a century, they know there is more than just
political pride at stake. The vote will also be a testament of how
far Mexico has come as an open democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my candidate and I'll vote for him,'' said Rosa
Munguia, 28, a marketing assistant who chose to keep her preference
a secret. ``But the most important thing is that the process be
clean, and I think it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Many share Munguia's hopes for a relatively fraud-free vote,
mostly because of the confidence they have in a new electoral
agency and tribunal that are independent from the government and
responsible for keeping things clean Sunday. Both the agency and
tribunal have assured voters they will be impartial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there will be more than 4,000 national and
international observers and thousands more domestic and foreign
journalists who will be closely monitoring the balloting process.
</P>
<P>
   But there continued to be some lingering doubt, even in the
final days leading up to Sunday's vote, over whether Mexico's
political machines were trying to coerce voters.
</P>
<P>
   Alianza Civica, the nation's largest watchdog group, said in a
report released Friday that its observers had received 288
complaints of pressure tactics by Mexico's three largest parties.
More than three-quarters of the complaints were against the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report issued last week by the Atlanta-based Carter
Center concluded that the chances for widespread fraud were slight.
</P>
<P>
   But, the study added, episodes of small-scale fraud could affect
Sunday's vote by one or two percentage points, a significant amount
given that recent opinion polls have shown the race a statistical
tie between PRI candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa and Vicente
Quesada Fox, the leading opposition candidate of a center-right
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading candidate, former Mexico City mayor Cuahtemoc
Cardenas, of the center-left coalition, is expected to place a
distant third, followed by two less prominent candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past presidential races in Mexico, which seemed more like
well-choreographed charades to keep the PRI in office, this year's
campaign has been unusually competitive and nasty, due mostly to
the battle between Labastida, a former interior minister, and Fox,
a former Coca-Cola executive and governor of Guanajuato state, who
has the best chance of breaking the PRI's 71-year grip on the
National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates themselves have been nearly invisible since
Wednesday, when Mexican electoral law required them to end their
campaigns, including all print, radio and television advertising.
Media outlets have also been prohibited from showing images of the
candidates, so that they do not appear to show favoritism for one
party over the others.
</P>
<P>
   But the corruption drama continued. Saturday, the Mexico City
daily Reforma reported that a PRI governor, Victor Tinoco Rubi of
Michoacan state, ordered $80 million in public funds to buy votes
in his state. The newspaper published parts of what it said were
transcripts of telephone conversations between Tinoco and a leading
national party official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deny that completely,'' Tinoco told a group of foreign
correspondents via telephone during a press conference Saturday
morning. ``Reforma is only interested in tarnishing the electoral
process.''
</P>
<P>
   A prospective voter, Jesus Nunez, was preparing a batch of pork
tacos in the southern part of the capital Saturday. He shook his
head slowly in disgust when asked his reaction to the latest
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, but I am sad,'' he said, wiping his hands
on a stained white apron. ``I think it shows how desperate the PRI
is, but it also shows how some things haven't changed.''

 &HT;    Three riders suspended for suspected drug dopingBy Suzanne
Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Last year's Tour de France was dubbed the
Tour of redemption by director Jean Marie LeBlanc, who wanted to
distance this popular international event from a drug scandal that
almost ruined it the summer before.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's Tour still got off to a poor start Saturday
morning when three riders were suspended for two weeks because of
suspected blood doping.
</P>
<P>
   The riders suspended were Sergei Ivanov, a week removed from his
Russian championship; Italy's Brasi Rossano and Slovakia's Andrey
Hauptman.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tested all 180 riders Saturday morning. The three who
failed the test weren't notified until six hours before the start
of the first stage, a 9.9-mile prologue through Futuroscope.
</P>
<P>
   The tests of the three showed abnormally high levels of
hematocrit, meaning that their percentage of red blood cells was
more than 50. This percentage usually indicates the use of the
banned hormone and blood booster EPO.
</P>
<P>
   All cyclists provided a urine sample last week. The samples are
now frozen and will be examined by a new method that supposedly can
detect the unquestioned use of EPO. These tests will get underway
in three weeks, after the Tour concludes. Officials had hoped that
the new test would be available for the start of the Tour, but knew
that the test, even scheduled now after the end of the event, would
keep cyclists from using illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's positive test was especially troubling to those in
cycling circles. He rides for Farm Frites, a team that was not
invited to last year's Tour as a result of doping allegations in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   TOUR BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   2:05: the margin in minutes that defending champion Lance
Armstrong owns over 1998 Tour victor Marco Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   12: the number of seconds that Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service
Team collectively owns over ONCE after the first day. USPS, which
currently has the best collective time over the rest of the 19-team
field, will be the final squad in competition in Tuesday's team
time trial if it holds its lead.
</P>
<P>
   13: the number of consecutive stages in which Armstrong owned
the overall lead, dating back to July 11, 1999. It was snapped
Saturday when Armstrong, the defending Tour champion and Austin
resident, finished second to Britain's David Millar.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING THE FIELD
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, Centre Presse, polled a variety of experts
on who they thought would be on ``the podium final'' on the last
day. Armstrong was the overwhelming favorite, garnering 16 of the
21 first-place votes. He was named second or third on five others.
Johan Bruyneel, the USPS director sportiff, declined to put his
three choices in order, but included Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Ullrich, who won the 1997 Tour and finished second in 1996
and 1998, was the predicted winner on four ballots with Pantani
receiving the other first-place vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bernald Hinault, a five-time Tour winner or ``vainqueur,''
predicted an Armstrong victory.
</P>
<P>
   TOUR TRAVELOGUE
</P>
<P>
   Futuroscope is an amusement park with a scientific theme. The
relatively new park, which was the site of last year's final time
trial, attracts about 3 million people a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the park is surrounded by history. Nearby Poitiers,
population 85,000, is the ancient capital of Poitou. Famous figures
who have passed through Poitiers include Joan of Arc and Richard
the Lion-Hearted. Because the city is on a hilltop overlooking the
Clain and Boivre rivers, it proved to be valuable strategic spot in
so many wars. Charles Martel won a battle for the Christians when
he chased away the Muslims here in 732. Edward the Black Prince of
England and King John of France battled here in 1356 as part of the
Hundred Years War. England won, with its archers using longbows to
vanquish the French.

   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Lance Armstrong seemed in such a hurry
late Saturday afternoon. He tucked in his chin and willed his legs
to pump out one final sprint so he could whip past the
balloon-festooned finish line and end his 9.9-mile performance to
kick off the first stage of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending Tour champion kept riding as a cluster of
European photographers buzzed toward him, much like a swarm of
mosquitos spotting a new victim.
</P>
<P>
   He talked to no one as he successfully dodged the crush of
cameras and sped to an awaiting gray bus painted with the stars and
bars logo of his U.S. Postal Service Team. From that point,
Armstrong could enjoy his privacy, get a much-needed massage and
eat a quiet dinner before heading to bed so he can start it all
again this afternoon with a 120 mile trek to Loudun.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 14 stages, dating back to a time trial in
Metz, a city in eastern France, another rider stepped on the podium
to accept the famed Tour leader's yellow jersey and all the
pressure that comes with wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   While Armstrong rode away to his hotel, a fresh-faced Brit
received the customary bouquet of yellow zinnias and daffodils to
commemorate his winning of stage one.
</P>
<P>
   David Millar, a 23-year-old Tour rookie, became the toast of
Great Britain after his performance in the near 10-mile time trial.
Millar, the lone English rider in the Tour who represents the
French team Cofidis, won the event in a time of 19 minutes, three
seconds. He negotiated through Futuroscope, a scientific-themed
amusement park, at nearly 32 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was in a hurry to get away from the chaos, Armstrong
was hardly disappointed with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   He was in second place, only two seconds behind Millar with a
nice cushion over his main rivals, including past Tour champions
Marco Pantani and Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have won,'' Armstrong said about two
hours after the race. ``But it's a big responsibility to have the
yellow jersey. Between now and the team time trial, it's probably
better that I don't have the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Millar, I like him,'' he said. ``But I'm happier
that I beat the ones who are my main threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had the fastest opening split and was ahead of
Millar's time until the last gentle stretch of pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 riders in the field of 177 (three riders were suspended
before the race) broke the 20-minute barrier, with Millar and
Armstrong the only two who threatened to eclipse 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert, the French rider who publicly said that
Armstrong had peaked too early in his training, was third, 11
seconds behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, the defending world time trial champion, was fourth, 12
seconds behind Armstrong. Alex Zulle, another Tour contender, was
sixth at 19:22.
</P>
<P>
   This year's traditional prologue was lengthened by almost four
miles to give it more bite. Winning the prologue does not guarantee
a victory stroll in Paris on July 23, but it can gut a rider's
chances if he performs poorly.
</P>
<P>
   That's what seem to happen to Pantani, who won the Tour in 1998.
Pantani finished in 21:19, 2:04 behind Armstrong. He'll hope to
make up the gap once he gets to the mountain stages.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani's rust was clearly evident Saturday. He left cycling
last summer after flunking a blood doping drug test on the next to
last day of the Giro d' Italia. He had a hefty lead at the time of
his suspension. He did not start competing again until May at the
Giro after receiving a private audience with Pope John Paul II .
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service, nicknamed the Posties, fared extremely
well Saturday. Vjatceslav Ekimov's time of 19:24 held up for about
one third of the race. He finished seventh. Tyler Hamilton was
ninth at 19:36.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Kevin Livingston was 24th at 19:59 Benoit Joachim was
34th at 20:08.

 &HT;    CARTER SAYS OPPOSITION CONCERNED ABOUT ABUSES
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ELECTION, moved in advance.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that
opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to
coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said at a news conference that two top opposition
candidates had told him they would accept the results of the
election _ which could be very close _ if the balloting is deemed
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two opposition parties have expressed to us their deep
concerns about some of the events that they say have occurred in
the pre-election process (and) with what they say is improper use
of government resources and influence,'' said Carter, who is in
Mexico to observe the elections with the Atlanta-based Carter
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the government is headed by a major party that has been
in power now for more than 70 years,'' Carter said, ``this is
grounds, I think, for concern and for careful observation.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival here Friday, Carter met with opposition
candidate Vicente Fox of the Alliance for Change, who opinion polls
show stands a chance of defeating, for the first time in 71 years,
Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also met with opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of
the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, running third in the
polls, and with PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who raised
concerns that his opponents might not accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that depends on the quality of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the voting process and the counting of the ballots and the
reporting of the results are deemed to be transparent and without
flaws of any significant degree,'' Carter said, ``they indeed will
accept the results of the election _ even though they retain the
right to criticize some previous activities during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter praised Mexico's ``superb'' new balloting system and said
that attempts at fraud on election day would probably be ``minimal
and reportable, if it does occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not categorize Mexico as a democracy 10 years ago,''
Carter said, but advances in election reform have been substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, allegations have been mounting that PRI government
officials are doling out social aid in exchange for votes or
telling social-aid recipients to vote for the PRI or lose their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, if there is evidence of wrongdoing it should
be punished,'' said Labastida spokesman Javier Trevino in response
to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma published a
transcript of what it said was a taped telephone conversation of
the governor of Michoacan state mentioning hiding state funds and
funneling money to PRI candidates in local elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is defamation,'' said Victor Tinoco, the governor, in
response to the report, challenging Reforma to prove the tape was
real.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an executive at the government-owned Mexican Oil
Company said a pressure campaign existed inside the company to
recruit PRI votes. Carter met with the executive and his wife, who
is also an employee.
</P>
<P>
   A special section of Mexican attorney general's office is
investigating this allegation and others. But the opposition is
complaining there is little time before the election to resolve
cases and punish perpetrators.

HELP WANTED: LAKERS LOOKING FOR POWER FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The NBA ungagged its general managers,
players and agents at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, but instead of a
cacophony of wheeling and dealing, the public hears only the sound
of silence. And it will be that way, more or less, for the next 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent season opened just after midnight Friday, but the
league has designated July a dead month for signing players, so the
results won't be known for some time _ until contracts can be
signed Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there will be no shortage of deals reportedly
reached, not necessarily with the facts to support them. And the
defending-champion Lakers will again be at the center of much
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, last July one media outlet had them supposedly signing
Charles Oakley and later Lorenzen Wright. Done deals, both of them.
Yet come August, neither player was wearing the purple and gold.
</P>
<P>
   So it will go again this month, with Glen Rice probably heading
elsewhere, and the Lakers again seeking a starting power forward
and/or backup center.
</P>
<P>
   All Laker decisions will eventually come back to Rice, who was
an awkward fit in coach Phil Jackson's system. Before the Lakers
can decide what to spend and what to seek in the free-agent market,
they'll need to decide on one of three options with Rice: re-sign
him (unlikely), let him walk away as a free agent (possible) or
sign him and trade him (most likely), perhaps for another small
forward, such as Philadelphia's Toni Kukoc, or a power forward,
such as Miami's P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   By now, talks with Rice and agent Jeff Wechsler are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the first thing we'd like to address,'' Lakers
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``However, we'll address other
issues at the same time. ... We're going to make a bunch of phone
calls, and we'll have to juggle as best as we can and keep two or
three other things going at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the Lakers enter the free-agent season largely
intact. Eight players are under contract, and the team holds an
option on Ron Harper, who they expect to return. It's almost a
given that Brian Shaw will be re-signed as well. Add recent
draftees Mark Madsen and Cory Hightower, and the Lakers will have
12 players committed for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But the work won't end there. They still need a starting power
forward to replace A.C. Green, ideally someone who can also play
some center.
</P>
<P>
   The top free agents who fill the bill _ San Antonio's Tim
Duncan, Portland's Brian Grant, the Clippers' Maurice Taylor _ are
virtually unattainable because the Lakers are far over the salary
cap and will have only the $2.25-million cap exception to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Grant's a wish list,'' Jackson said. ``I mean, that's
Santa Claus coming and visiting, if there's a possibility for Brian
Grant to be here. But Brian Grant turned down $41 million that's
left on his contract, and I'm sure that he's not planning on coming
here for $2.5 or whatever the exception is. Maybe he is. Maybe we
can work that out, some deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a nice golden retriever that he can have, he can
drive a car that I have that's an extra car. I might even encourage
him to meet my daughter, who I think is a terrific gal,'' Jackson
said with a laugh. ``We have to be realistic about what we can do
and the reality of what our needs are and what we have as far as
the salary structure.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers will look to the second tier of free-agent big
men. Among the potential bargains, they have shown previous
interest in Golden State's Adonal Foyle, and they also have an eye
on Toronto's John Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Others who could sign for the exception include New York's Kurt
Thomas, Boston's Danny Fortson and Orlando's Bo Outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a very attractive team to come and play
for,'' Lakers executive Jerry West said. ``I think somebody can
look, that there's playing time here available at that position,
and again we're hopeful something like that will happen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to build around Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
That's our task. To say it's going to be easy, that's not the
case.'' &QL;

POWER IS ALL THE RAGE IN NATIONAL LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All-Star games aren't about turning double
plays, making diving catches, laying down bunts or moving runners
over.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star games are about homers off the light towers, homers out
of stadiums, and more homers and more homers and more homers.
(There's also some great pitching thrown in, but that just makes it
tougher to hit homers, so let's not worry about that.) Therefore,
here's the National League All-Stars as they should be:
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE: Mark McGwire, St. Louis. While McGwire continues to
pound baseballs farther than anyone, many folks think Colorado's
Todd Helton deserves the nod. But Helton must be judged in two
categories, home and away. He's played one more game at Coors Field
than on the road, and the altitude pays off huge. At home, he's
hitting .459 with 14 homers and 43 RBI. On the road, he's hitting
.305 with seven homers and 25 RBI. McGwire is hitting .300 with 29
homers and 62 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE: Jeff Kent, San Francisco. There's plenty to chose
from in Jose Vidro, Eric Young, Luis Castillo and Kent, but none
are better than Kent. He's a fixture in the middle of the lineup,
and without his .355 average, 21 homers and league-leading 78 RBI,
Barry Bonds doesn't have 28 homers batting ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP: Barry Larkin, Cincinnati Reds. He missed time with a
hand injury and is involved in a contract squabble that certainly
has his days with the Reds numbered as they look to perhaps go with
youth at shortstop. But Larkin is still one of the premier
shortstops. It's not a deep position this season, but Larkin's .313
average with eight homers and 28 RBI means something despite
missing three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE: Chipper Jones, Atlanta Braves. He's having a down
year hitting in the clutch, which, of course, doesn't explain why
he's still batting .322 with 19 homers, 60 RBI and playing his
usual defense. Jones is doing at third for the Braves what every
other club would like to see from its third baseman. That's why the
bidding will be out of control if he tests the free-agent market
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER: Mike Piazza, New York Mets. Maybe the Dodgers' Todd
Hundley would have given Piazza a good run if he didn't miss four
weeks with an injury. But Hundley did, Piazza didn't. And just
think of it this way: All those folks still bitter about Piazza
getting run from the Dodgers over Chase Carey's hurt pride can take
solace in knowing the change of environment had no affect on
Piazza. He's still the game's best offensive catcher, hitting .361
with 23 homers and 70 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD: Gary Sheffield, Dodgers. He wanted the left-handed
bat behind him in the lineup, and now everyone knows why. Sheffield
is hitting .337 with 27 homers and 70 RBI and certainly is among
the early candidates for the MVP. He's third in the league in
homers, second in RBI, eighth in runs scored (62) and fourth in
total bases (188). Bonds is good, but he's no Sheffield to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: Jim Edmonds, St. Louis. The Angels couldn't sign
him to along-term deal so they moved him to the Midwest. Now, he's
the best center fielder in the league, and that includes the guy in
Cincinnati. Edmonds has scored 72 runs and is hitting .341 with 22
homers and 50 RBI. He also is on base seemingly every time McGwire
bats.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: Vladimir Guerrero, Montreal Expos. Good thing the
Dodgers didn't think he had enough talent to sign him when he was a
kid (presumably above the age of 16). Now, he's the best right
fielder playing in obscurity. Guerrero is hitting .365 with 22
homers and 67 RBI, though someone should explain his existence to
the people in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING PITCHER: Randy Johnson, Arizona. Let's see. He's 12-2,
has a 1.57 ERA, 177 strikeouts in 131 innings and has allowed 88
hits. Any other questions?
</P>
<P>
   RELIEF PITCHER: Byung-Hyun Kim, Arizona. He's 21, but he's
emerged as the toughest closer. His awkward submarine style has
baffled hitters, who have just 20 hits in 37 innings. Kim is 2-2
with 14 saves and a 1.91 ERA. He also has 67 strikeouts. &QL;

GWYNN NOT READY TO GIVE UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tony Gwynn opted to have knee surgery and thus all but end
his 2000 season _ he could return in September when San Diego
figures to be well out of the playoff hunt _ his focus was on
getting better for next season. And maybe the following one.
</P>
<P>
   And Gwynn also made it clear he would like to continue playing
with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I plan to keep playing for at least the next couple of
years, this is what I have to do,'' Gwynn said before the surgery.
``I want to be an everyday player. And this is where I want to
play. So to put myself in position to be an everyday player again,
I'm having the surgery now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought my only option was to be a designated hitter in
the American League, I could go do that now. But that's not what I
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres orthopedist Jan Fronek said loose material was cleaned
from Gwynn's knee and surfaces where the femur and tibia meet were
smoothed over. Gwynn also had bone-to-bone rubbing in his knee, and
floating pieces of broken cartilage were removed.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of a season for Gwynn, who had the knee drained
seven times and received injections of a cartilage-enhancer on
other occasions. Even so, Gwynn, 40, was hitting .323 before
undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   THE A-ROD CHASE: The Mets signed shortstop Rey Ordonez to a
four-year, $19 million deal in the offseason, but the key was not
giving in to a no-trade clause. Now, with Ordonez out for the
season and the club playing fine without him, they're prepared to
dump him in the offseason if they can sign free agent-to-be Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets are prepared to pay anything for him, which it
might take since $150 million contract numbers are being talked
about throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING ON OBJECTIVITY: For years, opponents have complained
about Atlanta's pitchers getting the outside corner of the plate
from umpires, and when a TBS camera showed the catcher's box at
Turner Field wider than the rules allow, it created quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Braves president Stan Kasten, upset about it, banned TBS
announcers Skip Caray, Don Sutton, Pete Van Wieren and Joe Simpson
from the team's charter flight to Montreal. Kasten and Turner
Sports president Mark Lazarus discussed the situation, and the
announcers were allowed on the charter from Montreal to New York
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `Birds in their little nest agree, 'tis a
shameful sight when children of one family bite and chide and
fight,''' Caray said.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful irony is that the Braves and TBS are both owned by
Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: The pinch-hit home run by Arizona rookie first
baseman Alex Cabrera, 28, made him the 78th player to homer in his
first major-league at-bat. ... Atlanta's Andruw Jones has 21 homers
and Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga have 19 apiece. The last
time the Braves had three players with 20 homers at the all-star
break was 1973 when Hank Aaron (27), Darrel Evans (27) and Davey
Johnson (23) did it. They're the only three teammates to hit 40 in
the same season. ... Houston right-hander Jose Lima, who went 21-10
last season, set a franchise record with his 12th straight loss.
Lima's 1-12. ``It has been a year I'd rather forget,'' Lima said.
``Everything has gone wrong.'' &QL;

MAGNANTE HAPPY WITH HOME AWAY FROM HOME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Oakland Athletics pitcher Mike Magnante had to let go
of one dream in order to achieve another.
</P>
<P>
   Magnante, a former standout at Burroughs High in Burbank,
Calif., and UCLA, missed the chance to continue pitching in his
hometown, as he did last year with the Angels, but offset his
disappointment by signing the first multiyear contract of his
10-year major-league career during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland signed the 35-year-old left-handed middle reliever to a
two-year deal, with a team option for a third year, and even though
Magnante recently suffered through a 32-day stint on the disabled
list, the Burbank resident feels right at home with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife gets to come home (to Burbank) when I'm on the road,''
Magnante said. ``It's an hour flight, it's nothing, and my parents
can come up to see me and see a game whenever they want, so it's a
very good situation for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was obviously the ideal situation, but if it can't
be ideal, this is about as close as I can get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnante, who broke in with the Kansas City Royals in 1991 and
spent two years with the Houston Astros, had a successful season
with the Angels in 1999, when he appeared in a career-high 53 games
and had a 3.38 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   When Magnante's contract expired at the end of the year, the
Angels were without a general manager, and although he wanted to
stay in Anaheim, Magnante was impressed by the Athletics and their
two-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come back to Anaheim, and I didn't hide it, that's
for sure,'' Magnante said. ``Before I even filed for free agency,
we faxed a letter to the Angels basically saying, 'I want to come
back, but since there's nobody in place I have to protect myself
and file. As soon as you get a GM, please call,' and stuff like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland had been calling since the day I filed, and I know the
Angels were in a tough situation, but I felt I couldn't wait. I'd
never had a two-year deal in my whole career, and there I was,
looking at it dead in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of security, it's close to home, it's a
great organization, a great group of guys and a team that had a
good chance to win, so I knew I had to jump on it.''
</P>
<P>
   This season has been a mixed bag so far for Magnante, who has
appeared in 22 games with a 4.96 ERA. The A's entered Saturday's
game against the Angels one-half game behind Seattle in the
American League West, but Magnante missed all but one game in June
because of an extraordinary run of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really three injuries,'' Magnante said. ``I started out
with a sprained ankle and did not go on the DL, and I believe that
by changing my mechanics because of the ankle, I caused the pulled
hamstring. I knew it was a risk not going on the DL, but I always
worry about my arm, not my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as Magnante prepared to return to Oakland, he pulled
a muscle in his forearm during a rehab assignment with Triple-A
Sacramento, which kept him out of action another two weeks.
Magnante finally returned Tuesday and allowed one run in two
innings to help preserve an Oakland victory over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating,'' Magnante said, ``because before I
signed, we talked about how one of my advantages was that I've
always been healthy. Sure enough, you come in, and the next thing
you know, you're down with an injury and you're out for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily it didn't hurt the team, but at the same time, you
want them to get what they're paying you for. My brother tells me
that bad things happen in threes, so hopefully I've used up all my
bad luck for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnante, now 100 percent healthy, will leave Anaheim tonight as
Oakland travels to Texas, but the pitcher doesn't harbor any
regrets about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of tough, because I still have a lot of friends over
there,'' Magnante said as he gestured toward the Angels' clubhouse.
``I got to stay in my own house and commute during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still sad that it didn't work out, but I'm not unhappy
with the results. I had two great options, and in either place I
would have been extremely happy.'' &QL;

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush camp cuts deal on abortion
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush have cut a deal with
conservatives to preserve untouched the GOP's hardline
anti-abortion plank in return for a platform that moves the
Republican Party decisively toward the center on such issues as
education, women's health, public transit and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is aimed at preventing the kind of ideological
bloodletting that damaged the re-election bid of Bush's father in
1992 and Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP abortion plank calls for enactment of a constitutional
ban on the procedure and for abortion-based litmus tests of
judicial nominees; this conflicts with Bush's opposition to litmus
tests and his support for such exceptions as protecting the life of
the mother, rape and incest. But, said a key Bush aide: ``This is a
fight that is a loser, and the loser is always the nominee. We
ain't going to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   POLL: COURT NOMINATIONS IMPORTANT
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of registered voters say the kind of
Supreme Court appointments a presidential candidate would make will
be important in deciding how they vote, according to a poll
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six percent said the appointments would be very important
and another 37 percent said they would be somewhat important.
</P>
<P>
   The positions on abortion likely to be held by the next
president's Supreme Court nominees will be very important in
deciding the votes of 43 percent of voters and half of registered
women, the poll found. Of voters surveyed, 62 percent said they
favored the appointment of judges who would support the abortion
rights guaranteed under the court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Survey Research Associates poll of 752 adults,
conducted Thursday and Friday, has and error margin of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   POLL OF POLLS SHOWS BUSH AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a
running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as
they become available. Last week, six new polls were added. Here is
how things stood when everything had been totaled up:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led in 24 states, worth 263 electoral votes.
Vice President Al Gore led in nine states, worth 157 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ASSAILS DRUG MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the pharmaceutical industry for engaging in
``corporate chutzpah'' and for ``gouging the consumer unfairly,''
Vice President Al Gore said Friday that he would take on the drug
manufacturers this week at campaign stops in battleground states
from California to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times, Gore said that while he
is not ``a basher of the pharmaceutical companies,'' he cast
himself as a longtime critic of what he said were the industry's
excessive prices and profits. The record raises questions, however.
</P>
<P>
   As a young Tennessee congressman in the early 1980s Gore played
a crucial role in defeating legislation that would have granted
drug companies patent extensions on lucrative medicines. Still,
some of the same drug makers that Gore now criticizes have hired
his friends and advisers to represent them as lobbyists. Gore also
has also been a strong supporter of the biotechnology industry,
which through collaborations and mergers is becoming part of the
prescription-drug business.
</P>
<P>
   THE INSTIGATOR QUOTIENT
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sounded a new refrain in his support for Al
Gore over George W. Bush last week, casting his vice president as
the more intelligent choice for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking Friday night in Philadelphia to a union
convention and a Democratic Party fund-raiser, punctuated his
praise for Gore with some version of this line:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think we ought to have somebody in the Oval Office
that really understands this stuff and all the complications of it?
I do. I really think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, in a White House news conference, Clinton
refused to express an opinion about whether Bush is smart enough to
be president, laughing off the question as ``a dead bang loser.''

AL WEST IS LOOKING GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The AL West was supposed to be a mediocre division
with no clear-cut winner. And while there is still no clear-cut
winner, it is far from mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the combined record of every team in the division, the
AL West is the best division in the majors at 25 games over .500
(through Friday). The Mariners and A's both established themselves
as contenders in June, the Mariners going 20-7, and the A's going
18-7. The Angels are lurking close behind and figure to have a say
in who wins the division, and even the Rangers are starting to get
hot again.
</P>
<P>
   So who's the favorite?
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia was asked which team was better,
Seattle or Oakland. And Scioscia, who has become quite good at
answering questions without actually answering them, was
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle has a better bullpen, Oakland has a better everyday
lineup,'' Scioscia said. ``Seattle has more ways to manufacture
runs, Oakland likes to get guys on base for the big guys to slam.
They're two different clubs, but they both have good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   As is custom for managers, A's manager Art Howe won't admit to
scoreboard watching at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this early, it's not even the second half of the season
yet,'' Howe said. ``I'd say August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're talking about the Yankees of old when they were
up 20 games by the All-Star break, then it might be over. That's
why when I was a kid I wasn't an American League fan. There was
never a pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has been a contender in recent years, winning the
division in 1995 and '97. But Oakland hasn't won the division since
the end of their dynasty years in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in a building process the last eight or nine
years,'' said former Athletic and current Angel Scott Spiezio.
``They've got some good young talent added with some good veterans.
They've brought in pitching, which has solidified the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was there they had hitting. Now they've added
pitching with guys like (Mark) Mulder and (Tim) Hudson and (Jason)
Isringhausen. They've done a good job. ... Us, we're trying to hang
on and get a hot streak going. We're starting to get some injured
guys back, so when the rest of us get hot, we'll be right there.''
</P>
<P>
   NO JUSTICE: Cleveland's trade of David Justice to the Yankees
might have seemed a bit strange, considering the rivalry between
the two teams. But the Indians were looking beyond the surface of
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is making $7 million this season, and Ricky Ledee, whom
the Indians acquired, is making $240,000. By trading Justice, the
Indians cleared room on their payroll to acquire much-needed
pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are circulating the Indians are interested in the
Phillies' Curt Schilling, but general manager John Hart says he
isn't planning to rebuild the team. Hart talked about injuries that
have hurt the club, but he won't get any sympathy from Angels fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying the injuries are the only reason we are where
we are,'' Hart said, ``... but what would happen to the White Sox
if you took Bob Howry and Keith Foulke out of the bullpen, and
James Baldwin and Mike Sirotka or Jim Parque out of the rotation,
and Frank Thomas out of their lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's essentially what's happened to us. We've got nine
people on the DL. No one seems to realize what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   PASS THE BUCK: Orioles owner Peter Angelos certainly would be
the one to hoist a championship trophy and take the credit if his
club won anything. But with the Orioles struggling and on their way
to their third consecutive losing season, Angelos passed the buck
in an interview with The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `once-proud Orioles' never won a damn thing from 1983
until we got here,'' Angelos said. ``We almost got to the World
Series twice in '96 and '97.''
</P>
<P>
   About the makeup of the team, Angelos said, ``These are not my
decisions.'' And the only blame he accepts is hiring ``the people
who picked the teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelos also said he might become more involved in the
day-to-day operation of the club. &QL;

CALCAVECCHIA SETS GHO PACE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ As opposed to Tiger Woods, who reportedly
raised the bar in professional golf, Mark Calcavecchia &AMP; Co. have
lowered it at the Greater Hartford Open, turning this week's PGA
Tour stop into a limbo contest.
</P>
<P>
   How low can you go?
</P>
<P>
   Try a course-record 9-under 61, said Kirk Triplett, whose
scorching third-round performance at TPC River Highlands enabled
him to hurdle 26 players into a share of third place at 13-under
197, tied with Edward Fryatt (66).
</P>
<P>
   Quite impressive, said Calcavecchia, who had very little problem
slipping beneath the bar himself. He shot his second straight 64,
opened a three-shot lead, and was able to match Triplett's record
with one of his own: a 54-hole, 17-under total that smashed the
previous best by two.
</P>
<P>
   Bright red numbers, to be sure, the sort that left poor Notah
Begay wondering if he were holding the correct end of the club.
After all, he made five birdies, shot 67 _ and fell from a share of
first to solo second, three back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my only major concern is I'm glad I just didn't get
blown out of the tournament today,'' said Begay, who is coming off
a stirring victory at last week's FedEx St. Jude Classic. ``I mean,
Mark came out of the gates just overwhelmingly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay is not exaggerating because Calcavecchia, tied with Begay
at 11 under to start the day, ripped a 9-iron to 12 feet at the
first hole and drained that birdie to set the stage for another
brisk effort. When he made a ``miraculous birdie'' at the second, a
40-footer after driving into the rough, Calcavecchia was two shots
clear of Begay and in a rush to go even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to stay aggressive because these guys are good,''
said Calcavecchia, who has won nine times on Tour, though it's been
more than two years since his most recent one.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly had it pushed to overdrive as he got to the turn
with birdies at the par-5 sixth, par-4 seventh, and par-3 eighth,
the second time in three days he has ripped off three straight
birdies at the stretch. He was 16 under, four in front of Begay,
with Triplett rushing in from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep waiting for (the greens) to get hard,'' said Triplett,
``but they're receptive. The fairways are firm. No wind, low
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   How low? Consider that more than half the field (47 of 82)
posted subpar rounds and that the scoring average was 69.157, a
shockingly low figure on what they call ``moving day'' out here on
the PGA Tour. Indeed, it was a day to move, though it resembled
more of a rush to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett's birdie fest was most noticeable _ three straight
starting at the second, three more beginning at the 15th, nine in
all _ as he rifled past all those players he had fallen behind
because of a second-round 72.
</P>
<P>
   A 72? Triplett conceded the Friday score had really gotten him
steamed. ``I was very discouraged after the second round,'' he
said, knowing 72 is like 82 on a course that has been defenseless
all week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a 61 can help you forget that 72, though even
Triplett's effort was overshadowed later in the day when
Calcavecchia kept up the pressure with birdies at the par-3 11th
and par-5 13th to get to 18 under.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Begay had joined in the fun, having shaken off some
early mental mistakes that were ``uncharacteristic of me.'' He was
referring to a missed par attempt from inside 3 feet at the par-4
second and a three-putt bogey at the par-3 fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They happen once in a while, but you hate to see it when
you're trying to make up some ground,'' said Begay, who made the
turn four shots behind Calcavecchia, then fell five back when the
leader made birdie at the par-3 11th.
</P>
<P>
   But Begay, who played his final 13 holes bogey-free, drove the
296-yard, par-4 15th, two-putted for birdie, and picked up a shot
against Calcavecchia's par-saving putt from 6 feet after his drive
came up short right and his second shot went through the green into
a swale.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was losing control, but Calcavecchia did make his
only bogey of the day, electing to hit an ``easy 7-iron'' instead
of a ``hard 8-iron'' into the 17th green. It went long and he could
not get it up-and-down, a situation that allowed Begay to get
within three shots thanks to a solid par.
</P>
<P>
   All of which put these two gentlemen together again, in Sunday's
final pairing, and the philosophy hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just after birdies again,'' said Calcavecchia, who knows
there are lots of them out there.

<P>
   Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder is spending more than
$100 million on player salaries, leaving many to wonder how this
record-breaking figure can be tucked and stuffed into the $62.5
million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are doing it by giving out big signing bonuses and
prorating them over a long term, which is basically the way every
team does it. Snyder is just doing more of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you know your Salary Cap 101, you know the first year of any
huge contract is normally the least expensive. In fact, the
Redskins have crafted this so well, they have even budgeted $10
million signing bonuses for No. 1 draft picks Chris Samuels and
LaVar Arrington and figure on $5 million or so for running back
Stephen Davis, a franchise player who will likely have a new deal
in place by the time the Redskins begin charging $10 a head at
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   According to someone close to the Redskins' salary cap
situation, ``Everybody thinks they're going to be in trouble if
they don't win it all, but they've done this pretty well. The
salary cap is going to expand quite a bit over the next few years''
_ it will be as high as $80 million in about three years _ ``and
much of that increase will absorb the salaries. They won't have
major cap worries for the first two years at least.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if older players like Bruce Smith, Darrell Green, and
Deion Sanders play only one or two years of their very large
contracts, Snyder will be in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Former Pittsburgh Steelers director of football operations Tom
Donahoe, who ran a team that didn't have deep pockets and that had
to build through the draft, thinks it's a great risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggressive,'' said Donahoe. ``It's a bit shortsighted,
particularly in relation to the salary cap. It's a decision you
have to make. You take a shot now or build a couple of years down
the road. If it's the right approach, time will tell. One thing to
consider, when you put together high-priced veteran players,
there's always an issue of chemistry. Nobody can determine what
that will be until you get out there on the field. It'll be
interesting to watch. They'll certainly have a bull's-eye on their
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying big money to older players goes against the grain of most
NFL teams, and that's why Snyder is being criticized by other
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also has been influenced by his new personnel man, Vinny
Cerrato, formerly of the 49ers, who has been accused of
overspending to the point that the 49ers had to get rid of almost
$50 million in payroll the past two years, leaving the once great
franchise in a hole. The 49ers did win a championship during their
free-spending years, so their predicament may have been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the 49ers and Redskins is that the salary
cap wasn't climbing as quickly when the 49ers were spending.
</P>
<P>
   If things do work out and the Redskins win a Super Bowl, then
the strategy worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, who last won a Super Bowl in 1991, have an
incredible blend of young and veteran players. The NFL public
thought it insane when Washington signed the 40-year-old Green to a
five-year, $10-million deal, but the feeling is Green is in such
great shape (he ran a team-best 4.24 40-yard dash in late May), he
can play three years as a nickel back. Anyway, Snyder, a lifelong
Redskins fan, said he gave Green the money as a ``lifetime
achievement'' contract. Along with Irving Fryar, 39, and Smith, 37,
there are players the rest of the team looks up to. But there is
also a growing corps of young superstars like Champ Bailey, and
Arrington and Samuels, both of whom will start barring prolonged
holdouts, and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big-name team, and now we have to produce big-name
results,'' said Fryar. ``It's going to be fun out there playing
alongside great players, but fans want to see results. I think it's
going to make us hungry to show the fans that we are a great
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins certainly have excellent clubhouse leadership in
fullback Larry Centers, quarterback Brad Johnson, Green, Smith,
Sanders, and Marco Coleman, and they've even made allowance for the
injury-prone Johnson going down. They signed Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   Too many leaders? Too many egos? We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, when talent and future Hall of Fame players are
handed to you on a silver platter, the coach must produce. Norv
Turner's future has certainly been in doubt the past two years, but
a poor start now will mean that he is gone, especially with Ray
Rhodes around as the defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The thought on Turner is that he must at least make it to the
Super Bowl. Anything less wouldn't sit well with Snyder, who is
spending more time in the Redskins' front offices now that he has
sold his Internet empire. Last year, Snyder was a coach's
nightmare, often calling Turner in the middle of the night to
criticize the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Defense was a huge problem the past few years, and Rhodes was
brought in along with Foge Fazio, the former defensive coordinator
of the Minnesota Vikings. Rhodes can't help but look better than
his predecessors. He is already afforded the luxury of Smith as a
pass rusher and Arrington, who may be one of the best pass rushers
to come out of college in years. Chasing the quarterback should
help Sanders and Bailey make plays in the secondary, and Mark
Carrier is one of the hardest-hitting safeties in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes's biggest job may be to get the most out of the
high-priced interior line of Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson,
who have not lived up to their billing. Still, it's not a bad way
for Rhodes, who was fired following an 8-8 season at Green Bay, to
take a step back as a defensive coordinator before he returns to
the head coaching ranks.
</P>
<P>
   What has made the resurgence of the Redskins possible is
Snyder's deep pockets and the huge revenue stream resulting from
the new stadium. Once the two high-profile rookies and Davis are
signed, Snyder will have shelled out about $50 million in signing
bonuses. Smith got $4.25 million; Sanders, $8 million; George, $2
million; Carrier, $3 million. Arrington and Samuels will be
collecting around $10 million each, and Davis close to or exceeding
$5 million. In addition, the Redskins will retain their vital free
agents, issuing a $1.6 million signing bonus to Centers, $3 million
to Coleman, $2 million to Green, $750,000 to guard Keith Sims, and
a few other sub-million bonuses issued to players such as center
Jay Leeuwenburg, tackle Andy Heck, center Cory Raymer, and safety
Matt Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The signings of the major free agents and the rookies should
affect the cap by about $7 million in 2000 and much higher than
that as the contracts get into their second and third years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have about a two-year window to win it all before their
situation becomes horrendous,'' said one NFL source.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins will score points. When healthy, Johnson is one of
the most efficient passers in the league and can get the ball to
speedy receivers Albert Connell, Michael Westbrook, and Fryar, who
never seems to age and should be an even bigger part of the team
this year. The Redskins signed veteran Adrian Murrell just in case
Davis holds out, which nobody really anticipates, and they also
have Skip Hicks around.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are confident their depth will get them through
times of injuries, and they also anticipate being very strong on
third downs, offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Redskins are putting themselves out on a limb.
Snyder isn't afraid of the consequences, or he wouldn't have
attempted to put together an all-star team. Down the road in
Baltimore, Orioles owner Peter Angelos has taken the same approach
with little results. To Washington observers, Snyder's philosophy
is similar to Angelos's and to that of Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, who has been hugely successful after spending
lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder especially feels in competition with the Baltimore
Ravens. Despite the fact the Ravens don't have quite the on-paper
talent, some believe they may be the better team. That would
irritate Snyder to no end.
</P>
<P>
   Most owners are hoping the Redskins fail miserably.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably saying their prayers,'' said Donahoe. ``If it
works, you'll have coaches fighting with owners all over the
league, but the strong owners have a philosophy and they have an
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say if it's right or wrong. It can work, or it can
blow up in your face. I don't know if there's a right way or a
wrong way. What we did in the '90s worked. We just lost too many
players. The one negative is you're almost penalized in this league
for having too many good players. You should be rewarded for good
drafts. That doesn't seem to be the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have drafted future All-Pro players in Bailey,
tackle Jon Jansen, Arrington, and Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime talent scout said of Arrington, ``If he's not the
best player in the league since Lawrence Taylor, I don't know
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Snyder doesn't know anything, either. But what if he does?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Powerful words
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello confirmed it was commissioner Paul
Tagliabue who suggested that Ray Lewis speak to 250 players at the
annual rookie symposium in San Diego sponsored by the league. Every
year, the league runs the four-day event in hopes it can advise
young players how to conduct themselves on and off the field. The
messages usually go in one ear and out the other, but the feeling
is if Lewis's words don't sink in, none will. Lewis, who was
acquitted of double-murder charges, came to the symposium
unannounced, spoke briefly, and, according to one league official,
``stunned everyone who was there. Nobody made a sound when he
walked into the room.'' The players hung on Lewis's every word,
just what Tagliabue hoped for. Last year, a panel of NFL rookies
spoke to the incoming players. One of them was Jets offensive
lineman Jason Fabini, who just days later was arrested for his role
in a barroom brawl. Fabini was later fined by Tagliabue. Lewis's
message centered around the dangers of hanging around with the
wrong people and of being in places you don't belong. Let's watch
for the outcome . . . The first of the preseason football
publications is in. Athlon Sports picks the Patriots second in the
AFC East to the Indianapolis Colts and has New England making the
playoffs as a wild-card team. Athlon picks the rest of the
division: Miami, Buffalo, then the Jets. The publication picks
Washington, Tampa Bay, St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Denver as the
other divisional winners. It also predicts Jacksonville over Tampa
Bay in the Super Bowl . . . The Patriots are going to wait and see
how things work with Bill Belichick's enormous workload, which
includes responsibilities as defensive coordinator, head coach, and
personnel director. Belichick has gone by the title of just head
coach for a reason. If things work out on the personnel side and
the combination of Belichick and Scott Pioli produce results, then
you may see more titles. If not, a personnel guy may be brought on
board . . . With a shortage of defensive linemen, some of the NFL
Europe players are getting attention. Agent Mike Clohisy reportedly
fielded several calls on defensive tackle Chartric Darby, who
played at South Carolina State and who had 8 1/2 sacks for
Barcelona, before settling on Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vital information
</P>
<P>
   The reason Patriots national scout Lionel Vital left the Jets to
come to New England is because his voice will be heard by
Belichick. In New York, Bill Parcells didn't pay him much heed. In
next year's draft, Vital, who scouted the Southwest for the Jets,
should have a huge role in setting up the draft board with
Belichick and Pioli . . . Despite needing a player of his size, the
Patriots are out of the bidding for Gilbert Brown, the often beefy
defensive lineman who is a free agent and has so far eaten his way
out of the NFL. The Packers still have an interest in re-signing
Brown at a minimum contract, as do the Seattle Seahawks, but other
teams have shied away based on Brown's ongoing battle with weight
problems . . . Standing together chatting at a USA soccer game at
Foxboro Stadium last week: Belichick and Doug Flutie . . . One
intriguing possibility for Ben Coates is teaming with Shannon
Sharpe in Baltimore. The Ravens are said to be interested in making
this happen, but so far Coates hasn't found any deal or situation
to his liking, though there are still several teams in need of
another tight end . . . Former Boston College coach Jack Bicknell,
who coaches the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe, is back in his New
Hampshire environs and appears duly impressed with three Patriots
who played for him. On nose tackle Garrett Johnson: ``He just keeps
his mouth shut and plays. He'll give you everything he has on every
play. He's a football player.'' On wide receiver Sean Morey: ``I
think the kid is going to be a star. This kid wants to play all the
time, and he'll do anything to get out there. Honestly, he was hurt
the entire year with an ankle problem, but he always wanted to play
even though he wasn't 100 percent. The only game he was OK, he
caught nine passes. We had to hold him out the last game because
the doctors feared his ankle would swell so much we wouldn't be
able to get him home.'' On Fall River linebacker Marc Megna:
``Tremendous strides. He basically came out of nowhere because he
used to be a nose tackle in college (Richmond). For Marc, it was
like sitting in algebra class. He had a lot to learn about playing
outside linebacker. I really like him. I don't know if he'll be
able to come as far as the Patriots want him to come in a short
time, but Marc, like most of the kids here, will be a very good
special teams player.'' . . . Bicknell (we really miss this guy)
would obviously be the natural choice to coach the Boston franchise
of the XFL, if that gets off the ground in two years. ``I keep
hearing I would be in consideration, but I haven't spoken to anyone
from that league. It would certainly be flattering, but I'm not out
there looking,'' said Bicknell . . . Interesting that back in the
early '90s, Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell had whittled his
selection of head coaches to two: Belichick and Bill Cowher. He
went with Belichick, who struggled with peaks and valleys, while
Cowher went on to great success in Pittsburgh . . . We are often
reminded of Bob Kraft's incredible charitable side. Columbia
University now will benefit from his $5 million gift of the Robert
F. Kraft Family Center for Jewish Student Life . . . Our
condolences to Pete Carroll and his family on the passing of his
mother . . . Fullback Rob Konrad ran a 4.49 40-yard dash recently
in Miami. Konrad, the former Syracuse star from North Andover, is
expected to become a bigger part of the Dolphins' offense this
season.

SAMPRAS IN FINE FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pete Sampras declined to tread upon the red carpet
rolled out at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club Saturday
for 65 surviving champions and finalists from Wimbledon's first 113
years. He was trying to make sure that the hallowed green carpet of
Centre Court wouldn't be rolled over him. Meanwhile, the man
considered one of his main challengers, Gustavo Kuerten, was on
nearby Court 2 being rendered ineligible for future honor rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's absence was excused for medical reasons, and he proved
they were legitimate. He looked as if he might become a Wimbledon
relic, too, as he stumbled early in the first test of the
tendinitis in his lower left leg that has afflicted him since
Wednesday. But after spotting feisty fellow American Justin
Gimelstob the first set, during which, he recalled, his racket
``felt like a foreign object,'' he gradually regained his familiar
form and ground out a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 third-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   That keeps the top seed and defending champion on course to
achieve more of the pomp and circumstance of which he was unable to
partake on this occasion. He's advanced to the second week in his
march toward a record-tying seventh Wimbledon crown and
record-setting 13th Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras insisted he meant no disrespect, and in fact, he headed
directly from his postmatch press conference to the royal box at
Centre Court, where he was belatedly honored with a commemorative
plate and took his place in the pantheon-for-a-day that included
Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Margaret Court Smith, Billie Jean King, and
John Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't join them for the initial march, Sampras explained,
because he wasn't in much shape to walk, bow, or do anything except
receive treatment for the injury he suffered while warming up for a
draining four-set victory over Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have been part of it,'' Sampras said.
``For the hour before I played, I was doing whatever I could to
play. Getting treatment, warming it up, taping it, do whatever I
can, making sure I'm as comfortable as possible out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As comfortable as possible meant not very. Even though he'd been
given an extra day to rehabilitate because his match had been
postponed by rain and darkness, he summed up his condition in one
word: ``Sore.''
</P>
<P>
   His first-set performance also could be summed up in one word:
Sour.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a man who hadn't touched a racket for 2 1/2 days,
which he hadn't, Sampras double faulted three times in losing his
first service game and double-faulted again on set point. Looking
up at the royal box, which for this one day was filled with
tennis's royal family, Sampras felt unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Borg and the Rocket (Laver),'' he said. ``When I was
playing the first set, I wasn't too proud that they were
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished they could have been helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, I wanted to throw my racket up there,'' Sampras
said. ``They could play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Sampras shook off the cobwebs and the pain, and
Gimelstob was cooked. On this celestial day, he offered a fitting
assessment of Sampras's superiority: ``Probably when he came out of
his mother's womb, God spent a little extra time on his right
shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the constellation who had business on their
agenda _ matching No. 2 seeds Lindsay Davenport and Andre Agassi _
found time to join the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the women's defender, strolled past Paola Suarez,
6-4, 6-2. World No. 1 Agassi, who had avoided extinction against
Todd Martin only 24 hours earlier, was moved up to the head of the
walk of fame to give him time to prepare for his 6-3, 6-3, 6-4
victory over Jerome Golmard.
</P>
<P>
   On the snake pit that is Court 2, Kuerten became the latest
entry on a dishonor roll of prominent casualties including, among
many others, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Agassi, Boris Becker,
Conchita Martinez, Michael Stich, Virginia Wade, and Richard
Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten took the court with a terrible cold, and that was the
best he felt all afternoon in a feeble 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, 6-1 sweep by
114th-ranked Alexander Popp.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten requested an injury timeout while trailing, 3-2, in the
second set. The trainer came to his chair and massaged his left
calf and lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I was) just sore a little bit,'' said Kuerten. ``I have a bad
cold for a few days. I didn't feel enough power to see myself with
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about panaceas: Kuerten won one game the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get some help there, but wasn't too helpful,'' he
observed with grim accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten thus completed a dubious double for French champions,
joining Mary Pierce, who like him ruled Stade Roland Garros three
weeks ago _ on the sidelines here.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch Popp, 23, is a German whom the British press
continually tries to recruit for the local Davis Cup team because
his mother is an English native.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the nicest day of my life up to now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not nice enough to persuade him to stay here after this
tournament. Popp steadfastly professed loyalty to his native land.
Like Sampras, he resisted the British red carpet treatment.

WOLTERS CATCHES UCONN FEVER IN WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The woman who calls herself ``Big Girl'' is back,
front and center, where she wants to be. It might be difficult to
imagine Kara Wolters not being anywhere but front and center, given
her 6-foot-7-inch frame and outgoing personality.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters was the center on that fabulous University of
Connecticut team and then . . . and then what? After a brief stint
playing in Hartford for the now defunct ABL, what happened? Wolters
often pondered that same question.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Wolters, who turns 25 next month, saw the best and
worst of pro basketball: She had a reserved seat on the bench of
the WNBA champion Houston Comets and soon she will even get a ring
to commemorate her limited time and minimal contributions there.
</P>
<P>
   When she receives that ring, however, it will only serve as a
reminder of her days as a bench warmer for the Comets. Wolters is
now back to doing what she does best, playing like a real,
honest-to-goodness center, as she stars for the Indiana Fever, one
of four WNBA expansion teams. The Fever selected her in the
expansion draft last December and gave Wolters a chance to play
regularly again. She is Indiana's second-leading scorer and
rebounder while averaging more than 26 minutes a game. She's among
the league leaders in field goal percentage, free throw percentage,
and blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, she feels she has arrived at UConn, The
Sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I'd ever get that feeling again,'' she said
after a recent practice at Conseco Fieldhouse, where the Fever play
their home games. ``I feel like I'm in college again, which is
exactly what I wanted to feel like, to relive those glory days of
UConn. The people here have confidence in me as being a go-to
player again. That's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, she wondered if she ever would get that feeling
again, but it's her nature not to think she wouldn't. The only
questions in her mind were when and where? She had left UConn in
1997, part of a four-year run highlighted by that 35-0 NCAA title
team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities in women's basketball were there in 1997, which
did not exist even a year before. The WNBA was starting up. The ABL
was entering its second season. Wolters decided to join the ABL's
New England Blizzard, and stay close to her Holliston, Mass., home.
In her first season, she led the league in blocked shots and was
named to the first All-ABL team.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: She wasn't progressing as a player.
K.C. Jones was the Blizzard's coach, and, well, after four years of
Geno Auriemma at UConn, this was a little different. Auriemma once
threw her out of practice and when she tried to come back, he threw
a basketball at her. The laid-back, cruise-control Jones was the
anti-Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really coached in New England,'' Wolters said. ``K.C.
Jones wasn't at the point of his career where he was coaching
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in her second season, the ABL folded. In May 1999, Wolters
was selected in the WNBA draft by the Comets, who were preparing
for what would be their third straight title. It was a marriage
that never worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets run a system based on their three terrific perimeter
players _ Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper, and Tina Thompson.
Centers, such as Wolters, are deemed excess baggage. As she put it,
``Their idea of post play is, screen for me, get me the ball, and
then get the heck out of my way. I'm a scorer. That's not the
situation for me. Then I hurt my knee. It was one thing after
another. It was a very down time in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in 10 games, averaging 4.1 minutes. She got into
two playoff games for a total of five minutes. She then went to
Comets coach Van Chancellor, who had no use for her as a player,
and asked to be put in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, 15 players were selected before her, including one
Houston teammate. She was still seen as a questionable performer.
We won't even get into her pregame routine (very loud Van Halen) or
her superstitions (rubbing a gold basketball around her neck 52
times) or her inherent skepticism (Elvis is alive). This was a
woman who needed to be seen, not heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just wasn't a proven pro at the time,'' said Kelly
Krauskopf, the Fever's CEO. ``It had been awhile since the ABL
folded, and our league is mostly one of guards and perimeter
players. That's what teams were looking for. But Kara is still
young, and centers are hard to find. We thought she had a lot of
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   And has it worked out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even better than we thought,'' Krauskopf said. ``When I tell
people what Kara is doing, it's almost like they act surprised. It
had been so long since Kara had been on a team where she could be
that kind of player. This can be her team.''
</P>
<P>
   As for now, Wolters has two main goals: continue improving and
stay healthy. Easier said than done. In the last 10 days, she has
injured her back during practice and was knocked unconscious for a
minute last Sunday when she was the recipient of an accidental
uppercut to the nose. She had hoped to return to action Saturday
night at home against Miami, but sat out after being suspended
without pay for one game and fined $500 by the WNBA for leaving the
bench when a teammate was flagrantly fouled Friday. She went on the
court after Rita Williams was fouled by Liberty guard Jessica Bibby
during New York's 72-70 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Before those travails, however, she was on her way to
establishing herself as one of the league's true inside presences.
In one five-game stretch, she averaged 16 points and 7 rebounds.
The Fever, however, lost four of them; they are an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   But their coach, Anne Donovan, is 6-8, a Hall of Famer, and
knows what she has and what she wants. The Fever want Wolters to be
an integral part of their system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kara has a lot of ability and talent, but she was never on a
team that utilized it,'' Donovan says. ``Her game is improving and
evolving as teams try to attack her now. I will say this: Kara is
one of the most motivated athletes I've ever been around. This is a
girl who has the will not just to play, but to improve and be the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan and Wolters are a mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne Donovan is a post coach. She can totally relate,''
Wolters said. ``She's a two-time Olympian, a Hall of Famer, I feel
like a sponge. There's so much I can learn from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a big person, you can be either totally useful or
totally useless. There's no middle ground there. You have to get in
the right system when you're big. You're very dependent on your
guards and your system when you're a post player. It was just a
matter of fitting into the right system. I never for once doubted
myself. I think I lost a little confidence along the way, and I
definitely went through an emotional roller coaster the last year
and a half. But it never got to the point where I wanted to give it
up and go work at 7-Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been another perk for Wolters. Last December, after
months of practicing and traveling with the 2000 Olympic team on a
no-guarantee basis, she was formally added to the Sydney squad. Of
course, it doesn't hurt that the Olympic coach, Nell Fortner, will
take over as the Fever's head coach next season. Or that Auriemma
is an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters was told of the decision a week before it was made
public, but also was told to keep it a secret. She told her parents
by giving them a pair of gift-wrapped plane tickets to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics was my dream even before there was a WNBA,''
Wolters said. ``People told me I was crazy to go through this long,
tryout process when they're not committing to you. Well, I told
them, `When you have a dream, you'll do anything.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never missed a trip with them. That was a good sign. They
always called me back. That was a great sign. But yet they would
never commit to me. So I said, `OK, I have to make them realize
they need me.' It's a lot of work. It still is. For the last seven
months, I've been playing with the best players in the world every
day. I think I've gotten better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Girl is big _ and back _ again.

<P>
   As the free agency recruitment period began Saturday, Danny
Fortson was feeling ``kind of nervous and scared.'' Fortson and his
agent, Raymond Brothers, cautiously answered questions about the
process that started at 12:01 a.m. Although he would not divulge
the names of any teams interested in his client, Brothers received
10 calls from organizations in both conferences during the first
day of the free agency period, most coming just minutes after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most gratifying thing about this is that so many teams
called right after midnight trying to get a jump on Danny Fortson
because a lot of them believe that Danny may be the best power
forward out there,'' said Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that several teams expressed interest did little to
diminish the anxiety Fortson felt. He knows cap room is scarce and
he desperately wants to join a team that will give him playing
time. Fortson believes the right fit with an organization will
allow him to be the top rebounder in the NBA and a real
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gotten a chance to play in the NBA yet,'' said
Fortson, still disappointed about the not-so-significant minutes he
got as a Celtics forward last season. ``I've got all the ability
locked inside of me ready to go out there and play. I've been
playing behind Antoine Walker and Antonio McDyess for my whole
career. If I get to the right place, I'll be just fine. I need a
chance to play myself. I could be just as good as those guys. You
never know, and nobody's given me a chance yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of depression because I got hurt and didn't get
into the lineup right when I thought I should've gotten into the
lineup. I felt I was more than ready to play and produce. I could
have helped the team. You never know what could have happened if I
was in there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Fortson doesn't re-sign with Boston, he still prefers
East Coast living. Given a choice, he would like to play in
Philadelphia (where he was born), New York (a favorite team from
childhood), or somewhere close to Pittsburgh (where he went to high
school).
</P>
<P>
   After learning a few lessons about criticizing the Celtics when
he was nearly traded to Toronto last season, Fortson praised the
efforts of associate coach Jim O'Brien and spoke affectionately
about his teammates and the organization's support staff. He
understands that the decisions Boston makes could greatly affect
his future, that part of the process is some of what makes him
nervous about free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not dead,'' said general manager Chris Wallace of
working something out with Fortson. ``We're looking at Danny on all
fronts now. We're looking at signing him. We're looking at who's
interested out there. Is there any way we could do a deal with
them? Because we drafted Jerome (Moiso), I wouldn't rule him out
and I wouldn't rule him in either. We want to get something there
that works for the Celtics; who knows how that fits in with his
timetable?''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are keeping all options open with respect to Fortson
and the other free agents available as they search for a veteran
backup point guard, someone who can play out on the perimeter at
second guard or small forward, and an athletic defender. The Boston
brass spent Saturday making calls, but it's still early in the
process for the home team. The decisions of Orlando and Chicago
will dictate the market to a large extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the majority of the league, we're there with exceptions
and sign-and-trades,'' said Wallace. ``That doesn't usually go
right out of the box. But we've had some chats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people we have pegged as possibilities to be at the
exception. Right now, it takes them a little while to come to the
exception. They just can't be there the first day. Then, because
there are more players than there is cap room, somebody of
significance could get stuck with the exception and fall down to
that level.''

PETTYS TRY TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Kyle Petty was in London attending an
equestrian event with his 14-year-old daughter, Montgomery Lee,
when he got the phone call every parent fears most.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer and senior vice
president, was on the line from New Hampshire International
Speedway with the devastating news that 19-year-old Adam Petty,
Kyle's son, had been killed driving his Busch Series car during
practice May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Helton reported Adam had been killed when the throttle of his
car had apparently become stuck as the vehicle entered Turn 3. With
virtually no time to react, Adam was sent into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in an interview in the lounge of his team's hauler at
Daytona International Speedway, Kyle Petty put on a brave face and
remained remarkably composed as he discussed a wide range of
topics, all related to his late son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it something I dread? No, I don't dread it,'' said Petty,
of discussing the accident. ``I mean, I like to talk about Adam. In
a lot of ways, when I talk about him, then I feel like he's still
here. I don't have that problem. It's not like I don't want anybody
to talk about him, because I don't want you to not talk about him,
in any way, shape or form. I don't dread it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty talked about the future of Petty Enterprises, the
difficult decision to return to the track and drive Adam's No. 45
Sprint-sponsored Busch car for the remainder of the season, the
impact of Adam's death on a family that has suffered a string of
tragic events in the last year, his thoughts on the NASCAR Winston
Cup race at NHIS next Sunday, and the struggle to make it through
each day while shepherding his racing team and his family through
this difficult period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up in the morning and I look to the afternoon, and once
I get through the afternoon I look to the night,'' he said, while
wearing a black No. 45 cap as a reminder of his son. ``Once the
night comes, I'm looking to the next morning. I'm not thinking that
far ahead on where I'm going next week or where I'm going in two
weeks or three weeks. It's just, `Where am I going to be tomorrow?'
I know for the next two or three days I'm going to be here (at
Daytona), and then I'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving in Saturday night's Pepsi 400 at Daytona, Petty
flew to Milwaukee, where he is scheduled to drive Adam's No. 45 car
in a Busch Series race Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's a day-to-day proposition. Petty is focused on
the precious present. The needs of his wife Pattie, his 18-year-old
son Austin, who is spending the summer working as a lifeguard at a
camp for sick children 30 miles south of here, and Montgomery Lee
have superseded all others, even his own. Family decisions now
dictate the course of his day and his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he has not allowed himself to be consumed with
thoughts about a return next Sunday to NHIS, where his son was
killed. Adam would have celebrated his 20th birthday July 10, the
day after the Loudon race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about it, and I know that sounds bizarre, to
think that we haven't thought about it, but we really haven't
because, like I say, I think a lot of factors go into what we do,''
Petty said. ``It goes into what I do every week.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as of now, NHIS is not even registered on Kyle Petty's
radar.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he'll cross that bridge once he gets to it.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, Petty told the story of a former
garagehand who worked at Petty Enterprises, Bruce Owens, who was
killed on North Carolina Highway 62 while driving to the Krogh
Brothers Busch shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I travel Highway 62 every day and once every couple of months
I think about him when I cross the bridge where he got killed,''
Petty said. ``Do I look at it and do I say, `Well, when I go back
to New Hampshire I will think about it?' I don't know, because I
don't think about it every time I go there; I just cross this
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I think about it every lap? Or will I think about it the
first time I get there? Or will I think about it on the last lap,
or on the first lap, or will I think about it 20,000 laps down the
road? I don't know. I can't answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he really want to go back to New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't talked to any of the doctors or the nurses
(in Concord, N.H.) that were at the hospital with Adam, and I
haven't really talked to any of the guys from the rescue squad who
were there,'' Petty said. ``I'd really like to talk to all of those
people and tell them, just knowing they were there, how important
it was to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (NHIS owner) Bob Bahre from the racetrack; he
called a couple of times. He's an incredibly nice man. If all
Winston Cup promoters were as nice as he was, it would probably be
the greatest sport in the world, not one of the greatest sports.
Everybody in New Hampshire has gone over and beyond everything. The
people in New Hampshire have always been incredible race fans, and
I like the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the racetrack and say, `That's what killed
Adam.' I don't look at the state of New Hampshire and say, `That's
what killed Adam.' I don't look at any of that. That's not the way
I look at it. Eventually, I know it could've happened here (at
Daytona) or at Charlotte or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just a sobering reality of the sport, but of life in
general.
</P>
<P>
   That much has hit home with the Pettys in the last year, a
trying time that has put their faith through the ultimate test.
Last year, Pattie's father died. Then, last summer, their beach
home near Charleston, S.C., burned to the ground. Three days after
Adam made his Winston Cup debut at Texas Motor Speedway, becoming
the family's fourth generation driver, Lee Petty, the 85-year-old
patriarch, died April 5 after he had been in failing health
following abdominal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever questioned, `Why did this ever happen
to us, God?' '' Petty said. ``If you're going to question, you have
to (ask), `Why, God, did you ever put us in racecars to begin with?
Why did you bless our family in so many different ways?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When bad things happen, people question their faith, or they
question what went wrong. But when something good happens, they
never question it. You've got to look at both sides, and I think
you've got to think about things like that. I think I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at a lot of things that have happened since the
accident, in a lot of ways I look at it that it was a blessing
(Adam) was here for 19 years, and that we had him here (for) the
time that we had him. I don't think Pattie, I don't think Austin,
or Montgomery Lee, has ever questioned why did this ever happen to
our family or why this even happened, period. We just didn't look
at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle and Pattie wrestled with the decision to continue with
Adam's Busch program, but when they discussed it with team members
and their primary sponsor, they all came to the same realization:
Adam would have wanted them to continue racing. ``Personally,
Pattie and I said from the beginning that we would've had an
incredibly hard time seeing somebody else get in Adam's car,'' Kyle
said. ``I don't care who it was. I don't care if you put Jeff
Gordon or Dale Earnhardt, it doesn't make any difference to us. If
somebody else was in that car, it would always be Adam's car to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Kyle made the wrenching decision to drive Adam's car for the
remainder of the season. After sitting out The Winston and the
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, Kyle returned to the track for the
first time at Dover, where the crowd stood on its feet and treated
him to an ovation when he took the track and qualified Adam's car.
At Michigan, as he was leaving the track, Petty was stopped by an
autograph seeker. He obliged not just that fan, but everyone who
asked, receiving in return words and stories about Adam that seemed
to console him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes when I go talk to fans, I'm looking for
something,'' Kyle said. ``I don't know what I'm looking for; I
don't. Maybe there's a hole there that I feel like they can fill,
because a lot of fans have stories about when they met Adam . . .
Maybe that's what I look for a lot of times with fans now, to some
degree. I don't know what it is, but there's something that kind of
draws you and makes you want to talk to them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty acknowledges that it hasn't gotten any easier with each
trip to the track. The littlest thing can trigger a memory of Adam.
A trip to Pocono, where Adam had never raced, touched off a strong
emotional reaction when Kyle arrived at the track on Thursday
afternoon. It was a quiet time, Kyle remembered, he often shared
with Adam at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trip to New Hampshire looms and Kyle Petty is uncertain
about whether he'll make it and, if he does, how he'll react when
he takes the track for the first time and passes the same corner
where his son lost his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, it's like crossing that bridge on 62,'' Petty
said. ``Sometimes you think about it, and that's why I say, `Do I
want to go back?' Yeah, I want to go back at some point in time
just to tell everybody how much I appreciate everything they did
for Adam . . . I want to go back and I want to go back and race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, yeah, that's going to be a hurdle for me. It's going to
be a hurdle for Pattie, and for all of us. It's got to be a hurdle
for them, too, for me to go back and race on that racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, Adam's death, intellectually, is easier for
me to deal with than it is for Pattie or Austin or Montgomery Lee,
because I know what it's like to drive a racecar. I know what it's
like to be on a racetrack, I know what it's like to ride around out
there. They don't know what it's like to be in a car. They don't
know what it feels like. They don't know what the sensation is.
They don't know what it's like to be in a wreck; they don't know
any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all an unknown, and I think that's what scares people in
the first place: It's the unknown. So, for people to say, `OK,
they're sending their father or their husband back to the place
where Adam was killed,' it would be hard on them. So I think it's
an emotional step for them, too, that they've got to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one for all of us.''

REVOLUTION LEARN FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ A year ago, the Revolution had momentum and
optimism as they traveled to a midseason game in Dallas. Their
commitment and physical style threatened to overwhelm the Burn in
the blazing Texas sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas regrouped. Leonel Alvarez, then the Burn's midfield
leader, calmed the tempo and encouraged his team to maintain
possession. The Revolution soon spent most of their energy, and
Dallas took a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will be in a similar situation when they visit
Miami Tuesday. This time, though, Alvarez is on their side. And,
the Revolution have evolved to the point where they understand the
importance of a possession game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand how to manage the rhythm of the game,''
Alvarez said Saturday. ``The important thing is to have the
mentality of a winner. We have to play this game like it is a
championship game, the final game, like Juventus against Lazio. We
have to take responsibility for our errors and learn from them. We
can make mistakes but not like the ones we have made in the past.
And, we have to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez joined the Revolution last August, after the team's fate
was nearly sealed and morale was sinking fast. Now, the Revolution
are rejuvenated, tied for first place in the Eastern Division under
coach Fernando Clavijo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing with more joyfulness and we are playing
together,'' Alvarez said. ``We are all in this together with the
goal of making the playoffs. The coach gets the credit _ he has
bonded us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was recruited to the MLS to bring guidance to a
fledgling league. Alvarez has been an excellent example this year
by maintaining a physical condition that has enabled him to become
one of the Revolution's most durable players. He also has emerged
in an outspoken leadership role. After the Revolution were
defeated, 3-1, in Columbus, Ohio, last week, Alvarez called a
meeting in the locker room in an attempt to regroup the team. The
Revolution concluded that game with six players age 24 or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young players here all like to work and they are very good
players,'' Alvarez said. ``They play with a lot of heart, they are
in good condition, and they are hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have not played since the Columbus game and will
not have a home match until they meet the MetroStars July 15.
Clavijo has appealed to Alvarez, John Harkes, and Mauricio Wright
to provide direction.
</P>
<P>
   This is usually slump time for the Revolution. Last year, they
went from May 23 until the June 25 loss at Dallas without a
regulation-time defeat. But after a 3-2 win over the MetroStars on
Independence Day, they went on a seven-game losing streak and never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are attempting to add a forward, but Alvarez is
not in favor of Spanish striker Jose Luis Morales, who trained with
the Revolution last week, mostly because of Morales's lack of
physical conditioning. Morales has not played for a month, since
the end of the Spanish Liga.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo is expected to return from Uruguay and meet the
Revolution in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Monday. He said his mother,
Irma, 77, is near death in their hometown of Maldonado.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Gritty. Hard-nosed. Overachieving. Those have been the
trademarks of the Sons of Jimy Williams these last two years. You
could outscore the Red Sox with your talent, but you could not beat
the soul out of them. The Sox played blood-and-thunder baseball for
nine innings and they did it every day.
</P>
<P>
   Not Saturday. The sight of the inimitable Izzy Alcantara
quitting in the middle of an eighth-inning rundown will stand as
the defining moment of a slide that has seen the ``This is the
Year'' Red Sox reduced to a .500 club as midseason nears.
</P>
<P>
   When the 7-2 beating (three more errors) was over, Williams
called a team meeting, then refused to take questions on the game,
stating only, ``U-G-L-Y, that's it on the game. Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The room was quiet after that. Food went untouched as players
dressed and left. Jeff Frye called it ``embarrassing,'' Carl
Everett stated ``We sucked,'' and Jason Varitek said ``Maybe we
need, as a team, the appearance we're playing harder. Despite
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   They can start by finding a new home for one Israel Cristostomo
Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Joggin' Izzy. Izzy is as Izzy Does. Everybody do the Izzy
Shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Five games into his big-league career, he's already a Red Sox
legend, right there alongside Dwayne Hosey, Bobby Sprowl, and Bob
``Beetle'' Bailey. Izzy only knows one speed and it's half-speed.
He plays defense like Sam Horn and styles like Chris Canty.
Saturday it looked like he quit like Tony Eason. Why do I suspect
he's one of those secret Statman Projects brought to general
manager Dan Duquette by meter reader Mike Gimbel?
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to blame everything that's happening to this
ball club on a 27-year-old Dominican who worked 10 long years to
get to the majors and has a limited grasp of English. But Alcantara
plays a game that is foreign to the Red Sox of the last two
seasons. His presence in the everyday lineup tells us how low the
Sox have sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night he hit his first major league homer and styled
around the bases even though the Sox were trailing, 4-1. He also
stayed back in right field and let a ball drop for a hit when it
could have been caught.
</P>
<P>
   The clever White Sox know a good thing when they see it and went
at Izzy with a vengeance Saturday. They took advantage of a
mismatch in right.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is generally not conducive to such strategy. In
football you try to isolate Randy Moss when he's guarded by Tebucky
Jones. In hoops you pound the ball inside to Shaquille O'Neal when
he's posting up Mark Jackson. Baseball doesn't allow such
exploitation, but the White Sox figured out how to go at Izzy.
</P>
<P>
   Sox rookie righthander Paxton Crawford (wearing Heath Irwin's
old No. 63 jersey) retired the first eight batters he faced and we
were thinking about Billy Rohr at Yankee Stadium in April of 1967.
Then he walked No. 9 batter Mark Johnson. You know what all those
coaches say: The walks will kill you.
</P>
<P>
   After the walk, Ray Durham drilled a single to right. Because
the count was full, Johnson was running. Because Alcantara was in
right, Johnson scored. That's right. The catcher scored from first
on a single to right. Shades of Enos Slaughter in the 1946 World
Series (Slaughter actually scored from first on a double, but Harry
Walker's hit became a single in decades of retellings _ sort of
like ``Play it again, Sam,'' which is never actually uttered in
``Casablanca'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to cut the ball and get to the cutoff,'' said
Alcantara. ``I think I did my job.''
</P>
<P>
   No. He should have gotten to the ball quicker and made a
stronger throw to Frye. Neither mistake was of the forgivable,
physical variety.
</P>
<P>
   Next batter. Same problem. Jose Valentin hit a looping single to
right-center, but again it became a double because of the Izzy
Shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Alcantara committed a routine error, juggling a
ball hit to right-center. In the eighth, he singled to lead off the
inning, then found himself at second with Frye at first and two
out. When a pitch got away from Johnson, Frye broke from first and
had second, but Alcantara froze off second and was dead meat. He
didn't put up any kind of a fight. Like an Iraqi soldier in the
Gulf War, he threw down his weapon and surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only had one way to go,'' said Frye. ``He said it was his
fault. But I don't see anybody not hustling.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took a while for Everett to bring Alcantara's hat and
glove to the outfield for the start of the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me to discuss with you guys what I feel about the
effort,'' said Everett. ``It's not the media's business. It's gonna
happen. He has to pick himself up and don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that it appeared Alcantara wasn't trying very hard, Everett
said, ``That's what they used to say about me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said it about Williams's Red Sox. Not until
Saturday. That's why there was a meeting. That's why Jimy wouldn't
talk about his team. This was not a day when Williams could recite
the mantra about ``kids playing hard.'' This was an unprofessional
effort by a professional ball club.
</P>
<P>
   And the players knew it.

PROS OUTWEIGHED CONS FOR NEWCOMER HOWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was easy to lose count, considering the number of people from
whom he accepted congratulations, but the word ``sir'' was used
many times Thursday as Charles Howell stepped away from the final
green after his first round as a professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, sir,'' he said to a reporter at the Greater
Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' he said to a young fan who had requested an
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, I appreciate it,'' he said to a volunteer who had
followed his group.
</P>
<P>
   A mere 48 hours had passed since the 21-year-old Howell had
announced his decision to change his life forever, and though he
had shot a 1-over-par 71 and was seven strokes behind, he stood
amid a crowd of folks wanting to know even the slightest of
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir'' he said. ``It was nerve-wracking. A little
uncomfortable, though I had more butterflies last night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' he said. ``It hasn't sunk in yet. It hasn't hit me
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the thought occurred that in the days and weeks and
months and years to come, Howell may well grow tired of all the
attention, all the tugs at his time, all the requests, all the
questions. Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Too difficult to predict, said Debbie Howell, though she knew
one thing: ``He'd better always be nice or he's gonna have his
mother after him.'' Good round, bad round _ it didn't matter, she
said. ``He'd better always be polite.''
</P>
<P>
   The proud, but somewhat overwhelmed mother stood to the side
Thursday as her son made his way through the crowd that had
gathered. Debbie Howell knows ``a birdie from a bogey,'' but not
much else about golf, except that her son has been captivated by
the sport since he was 7 and watched a neighbor hit plastic golf
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the house and asked, `Can I take golf lessons?'
'' said Debbie Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Golf? The parents were not sure. Debbie has never played and
will never play, she said. ``I don't have the temperament for it.''
Her husband, Charlie, a pediatric surgeon, started playing when his
son showed an interest, but he soon quit because he doesn't have
the time, she said. Brother Ben, 17, is a wrestler and a boxer and
has no interest in slapping around a little, dimpled white ball.
</P>
<P>
   But if young Charles wanted to, they figured, why not?
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history. Within five years, Howell was
a junior golfer of great promise, a student of famed instructor
David Leadbetter, and fairly determined that golf would be his
life. Cross-country junior golf trips, a scholarship to Oklahoma
State, and an amateur career culminating with last month's
record-smashing NCAA championship victory put even more polish on
the star.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of marquee amateur events, starting with the Northeast
Amateur at Wannamoisett CC in Rumford, R.I., was on the horizon.
Then came a detour when he least expected it _ a sponsor's
exemption to play in a BUY.com Tour stop in Greensboro, N.C.
Instead of battling collegiate archrival Luke Donald in Rhode
Island, Howell nearly caught Kent Jones in North Carolina. He twice
shot 63 and finished second, which would have been worth $43,200
had he been a pro.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip from North Carolina to Hartford, where he was to
play in the GHO as an amateur on a sponsor's exemption, Howell was
left to ponder even more evidence that his pro stock was at its
highest, so when he got to Connecticut he called home. ``He was
talking about it,'' said Debbie. ``We were saying, `Charles,
wouldn't you rather have your mom and dad there with you for this,'
but he said, `No, I want to do this by myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Charles Howell went to bed an amateur, woke up a
professional, and walked in to TPC River Highlands with a check for
the entry fee. There was, however, a dead giveaway that he was a
novice at this procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady told him it was the first time anybody had paid their
entry fee with a check signed by a mother,'' said Debbie Howell,
author of that check. She was laughing, but when asked her feelings
about her son forgoing his final year in college, she was adamant:
``If he's happy, we're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   At 21, he is fearless, possesses a swing that can whip a 2-iron
250 yards, and drives well over 300 yards, so why shouldn't Howell
be happy? He's not silly enough, however, to think that this is the
same type of golf he played in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every shot is important out here,'' said Howell. ``That pretty
much is the biggest difference.'' He learned that the hard way
Thursday, when he made a double bogey at the par-4 first hole (his
10th). His drive found the rough and his second shot came up short,
leaving him a long putt over a mound on a sloping green. Howell
putted it off the green, chipped back on, and took two more with
the flat stick.
</P>
<P>
   Not a pleasant memory, but he was kidded that he could not have
possibly thought he'd go his entire pro career without a double.
``No, sir, so it's good to get that out of the way,'' he said,
laughing. Howell, however, shot a 3-under-par 67 Friday to make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor's exemptions have come forward from the B.C. Open, the
John Deere Classic, and The International, events with
million-dollar purses, courtesy cars, exquisite golf courses,
premier treatment, and the chance for TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Life certainly has changed for this youngster who grew up in the
shadows of Augusta National, the most hallowed ground in golf. He
has played there with members, but you could say that he has taken
one step closer to a dream _ teeing it up in the Masters. A
heartwarming, almost incomprehensible thought, said Debbie Howell,
who didn't want to get ahead of herself. There was, after all, a
more pressing problem, she said after watching Round 1 of the GHO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to seeing him in his orange (Oklahoma State)
hat,'' she said, turning her attention to Charles, who stood nearby
wearing a blue Ping hat, signing an autograph for a marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The marshal thanked Howell, who, in turn, said, ``You're
welcome, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprise endings
</P>
<P>
   Two tales from the world of amateur golf that demonstrate the
fragile nature of this great sport. In Florida, Justin Biggs
started the final round of the state's amateur championship 10
shots off the lead and was looking to move up a notch or two on the
leaderboard. When he posted a 6-under 66_287 at Pine Tree GC in
Boynton Beach, things got interesting, particularly since the
54-hole leader, Kevin Mock, made two double bogeys going out, then
completed his round with three straight bogeys to shoot 78_289. The
player two shots behind Mock at the start of the round, Brendan
Takacs, also made a pair of double bogeys and shot 76_289, and on
it went until Biggs's 1-under 287 proved good enough to win. In
Arizona, there was a comedown, not a comeback as Mark Johnson was
disqualified from the state's mid-amateur championship at a point
in the competition when he held an 11-shot lead with nine holes
left. It seems Johnson's son, Seth, was working as caddie,
accompanied by his friend, Derek, and a rules official spotted
Derek reaching into Johnson's bag and removing the player's putter.
Derek reportedly handed the putter to Johnson, while Seth carried
the bag to the green. A violation of Rule 6-4, said the official,
who cited Johnson for using more than one caddie. ``The toughest
call I ever had to make in my 25 years,'' said the rules official,
whose decision was made even worse by two twists _ the DQ took
place on Father's Day and on Seth's 14th birthday, and the decision
to caddie was his idea of a gift to his father . . . John Daly, to
the crowd at Monday's charity golf event hosted by Tom Lehman at
Minneapolis GC: ``I think it's time you guys get a PGA Tour event.
I'm sure the US Open's probably coming to (nearby) Hazeltine,
although I probably won't be playing in that one.'' At least right
now, Hazeltine is not on the list as US Open sites, but it is down
for a future Ryder Cup, though that, too, is an event Daly
shouldn't count on . . . Overseas this weekend, the Murphy's Irish
Open will be decided Sunday, though the easy winner of the event is
Ballybunion, which is arguably one of the world's greatest golf
courses. Surprisingly, Irishman Padraig Harrington had never played
Ballybunion before this week, and Seve Ballesteros was seeing it
for the first time, too. ``It made me feel the same way as when I
first saw St. Andrews,'' said Ballesteros. Told that he was the
overwhelming 6-1 favorite to win, Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland
scoffed: ``I wouldn't put a penny on myself at that and I wouldn't
put anything on at 60-1, either.'' . . . Brad Faxon has a
scheduling conflict that he says is unsettling and given his loyal
nature, you can understand why. After being sidelined with a broken
hand last year, Faxon returned in style to Endicott, N.Y., by
winning the B.C. Open in September and he very much wants to defend
that title. But the PGA Tour schedule-makers pushed that event up
to July this year, where it is opposite the British Open. After his
CVS Charity Classic at Rhode Island CC July 9-11, Faxon will head
to Great Britain to try to qualify for the British Open, ``but if I
miss, I'll come back for the B.C. Open,'' he said, adding that the
overlap was unfortunate . . . Mark Calcavecchia has missed just one
GHO since 1981, that being in 1985 when, after four years on Tour,
his career had still not taken off. He earned just $15,957 that
year and ranked 162d on the money list, yet he still found that he
was wanted at the GHO. ``(Tournament director) Ted May gave me an
exemption that year, and I always remember the people who were good
to me.'' Calcavecchia pointed to his tie for 12th in 1986 as a
springboard to a season that saw him jump to 58th on the money list
and he hasn't been outside the top 60 since. ``Ted can ask me and
I'll do anything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The right call
</P>
<P>
   So, how exactly did Wendy Ward know her ball moved ever so
slightly last Sunday as she lined up a key putt in the final round
of the McDonald's LPGA Championship? Simple. Like many golfers, she
puts the ball down an exact way each time she lines up a putt, in
her case with the ``RULE 35'' on her Callaway looking directly at
her. Why? ``It's reminding me to enjoy the game, as their
philosophy goes.'' Of course, by calling the one-shot penalty on
herself (the ball rolled slightly after she soled her putter), it
was a little harder to enjoy the game, but she deserves a great
deal of credit for the way in which she handled the situation. Yes,
she missed a playoff spot by one shot . . . Heather Daly-Donofrio,
who recently resigned as golf coach at her alma mater, Yale, shot
an even-par 71 at Inniscrone GC in Avondale, Pa., to qualify for
next month's US Women's Open. Among those who also advanced were
LGPA Tour regulars Kathryn Marshall and Joan Pitcock, while 1997 US
Women's Amateur champ Silvia Cavalleri also made it. Pam Kerrigan
of Franklin, a rookie on the LPGA Tour, fell short, as did Kelly
Robb of Concord . . . The brightest picture at last weekend's
McDonald's LPGA Championship? The bright, flamboyant red, white,
and blue golf bag of Pat Bradley, the US captain for October's
Solheim Cup matches . . . A familiar name was tied for 14th at the
Northeast Amateur: Billy Haas, son of longtime PGA Tour star Jay
Haas. ``He loved it,'' said Jay, who played in the event when he
was a collegian. Billy Haas will also follow his father's footsteps
and enter Wake Forest this fall, giving dad two programs to follow
come September because Jay Haas Jr. plays golf at Augusta State.
Jay Haas, a nine-time winner on Tour, will be paired with Peter
Jacobsen at the CVS Charity Classic.

BRUINS WINGING IT ON DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no mystery that the Bruins are coming off a lousy season.
It's also no mystery that their No. 1 need is on defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the strong possibility that veteran Don Sweeney, an
unrestricted free agent, will land somewhere else, the only
experienced blue liners sure to be back this fall are Hal Gill,
Kyle McLaren, and Darren Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much out there among free agents _ the pickings on
defense are ultra slim _ and that is a cause for worry among Bruins
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' said president/general manager Harry Sinden.
``I think it falls short of what we need both in depth and in depth
of quality. McLaren, Gill, and Van Impe are fine, but we need three
more. If we had three more like them, we'd be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Sweeney would be a big blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming through the year we had, there were very, very few
players, if any, who performed,'' said Sinden. ``He may be the only
one who did. He's only so good, he's not a great player. He's only
so good and he performed right up to his expectations and his
level.''
</P>
<P>
   That is to say the others didn't. McLaren was hurt for much of
year and Gill often looked confused and out of synch. Van Impe was
inconsistent and because of the injuries, was asked to do more than
he could.
</P>
<P>
   The upside for Gill is how well he played for Team USA in the
World Championships, but Sinden said that didn't make any
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gill was just one member of a team that played well below what
we thought they could do,'' he said. ``He's no different _ no worse
or no better _ than almost every other player on the team except,
perhaps, Sweeney.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the Bruins to go out and grab a big-ticket
defenseman, it isn't going to happen. Sinden said they're looking
to make less dramatic changes through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of them could help us, but there isn't anything
out there that is going to make a huge difference to this team,''
he said. ``They could make a slight difference, though, and we
should be looking to make slight differences.''
</P>
<P>
   An unknown is whether the young players in the system can make
that difference. One is Jonathan Girard, who is offensive-minded,
and the other is Martin Grenier, who came in the deal for Ray
Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Girard) is an enigma,'' said Sinden. ``He's like (Scott)
Niedermayer in New Jersey. I think he's going to come close this
year to really making it. He's just way out of his league (in
juniors). Under the rules, he went back, but he would have been
much better off if we could have sent him to Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Grenier has not signed with Boston, but the club could use his
6-foot-5-inch, 231-pound frame and hard-nosed approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably like Girard, he's a totally different type of
player, but he probably could come close to making it,'' said
Sinden. ``He brings something we need, just like Girard brings
something else. Whether he's ready or not, that's a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   The team had high expectations for defenseman Nick Boynton, last
year's first-round pick. However, a diabetes diagnosis followed by
family problems and a serious shoulder injury hindered his
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through nobody's fault, I don't think he had anywhere near the
development he should have had in his first year,'' said Sinden.
``Next year, he likely won't be faced with a couple of crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he and his staff are optimistic that two of their
draft picks, both defensemen, taken last weekend, could make
contributions in the same way forward Mikko Eloranta did last year.
</P>
<P>
   One is Jarmo Kultanen, taken at No. 174. He is 6-2, 198 pounds,
27 years old, and considered a late bloomer. He has been playing in
the Finnish Elite League the last several seasons. In the ninth
round, at No. 268, the Bruins took a chance on Pavel Kolarik, a
27-year-old native of the Czech Republic. He played last year with
Slavia Praha of the Czech Elite League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they could come close to making the team,''
Sinden said. ``Whether they improve it or not is another question.
Whether they do enough to improve you or whether they're a little
too old to bother is another question. We have two there and both
come highly recommended. I would imagine they're as good as
Boynton, Girard or Brandon Smith or Mattias Timander. They're in
that class, but does that improve our team? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said if they make as much of a contribution as Eloranta
did in his first season, the club would be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I didn't count on Eloranta doing anything more than
hanging on to the team, I'm not counting on these guys at this
point either,'' said Sinden. ``The fact they've had experience over
there and they've both been substantial members of their teams is
kind of an indication they've got a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A painful decision
</P>
<P>
   Rough-and-tumble forward Wendel Clark called it a career
Thursday after 15 seasons. His spirit was still willing but his
body, ravaged by injuries, had had enough. Clark, who has the heart
of a lion, began his career as a Maple Leaf (his first of three
stints in Toronto) when he was taken first overall in the 1985
entry draft. After many stops, he ended his journey in the same
place it began. ``The timing right now just seems right,'' said
Clark, who reached the 30-goal plateau five times. ``I started as a
Leaf and now I can end as a Leaf. No matter where I played, this
has always felt like home.'' It was an emotional decision for
Clark, who tearfully made the announcement. ``He cried more here
than at our wedding,'' said Clark's wife, Denise . . . Nice to see
that sometimes there is justice. When the ruling came down in the
Ottawa Senators' favor, saying that bratty forward Alexei Yashin
owes the club one year of service before becoming a free agent
(hooray for common sense), the Senators announced they'd be happy
to welcome him back. It had to be hard for general manager Marshall
Johnston and majority owner Rod Bryden, both of whom showed a lot
of guts in waiting out Yashin, to keep from grinning ear to ear.
Yashin, who sat out an entire year because he thought $3.6 million
was too paltry for his services, has lost all leverage. Now, if the
Senators elect to trade him (a likely scenario), they're going to
have more options. Had the ruling gone in Yashin's favor, he would
have become a restricted free agent. Yashin has maintained he won't
play for any team for $3.6 million, so the saga continues. It
doesn't seem possible, despite the Senators' welcome mat, that
Yashin will play for the Senators, and at least one of his
teammates says good riddance. ``They've got to decide what's best
for the team, but he did refuse to play for us,'' said center
Vaclav Prospal. ``It's going to be difficult if he ends up here. I
think we were a better group without him.'' Reportedly, Yashin
recently received a speeding ticket for going 93 miles per hour in
a 62-m.p.h. zone. If Yashin wants to explore his options, slowing
down and growing up would seem appropriate . . . Former Bruins
assistant coach and all-around good guy Cap Raeder will be back
behind the bench this fall. He was hired as an assistant by the San
Jose Sharks, for whom he had been a scout . . . When the Columbus
Blue Jackets took defenseman Lyle Odelein in the expansion draft,
it was considered a risk because he was scheduled to become a
sought-after unrestricted free agent. However, the Blue Jackets
came to terms with the tough blue liner on a multiyear deal.
``Signing Lyle Odelein was a major priority for us coming out of
the expansion draft,'' said Columbus president and general manager
Doug MacLean. ``A lot of people thought we took him simply to get a
compensatory draft pick, but we took him to sign him. He will be an
anchor on our blue line and a real leader for our team. He is one
of the fiercest competitors in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low, will he go?
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound that former Edmonton coach Ron Low might be
heading behind the Rangers' bench, which would reunite him with
former Oilers president Glen Sather, now in charge of cleaning up
the mess in Gotham. Low walked away from the Oilers last year after
Sather offered him a new contract for the same money he had made
the year before. Viewing that as a no-confidence vote, Low stepped
down. ``We're in the middle of talking, but that's all there is to
it right now,'' said Low. ``There's nothing there yet. So, take
everything you hear with a grain of salt and then add some
pepper.'' . . . Pretty shocking, isn't it, to see that the Montreal
Canadiens are for sale? Molson has decided to get out of the
business and has put the Habs on the block. Once again, the
financial strain of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar has
caused another north of the border franchise to decide it is tired
of losing money. Some reported to be interested in purchasing the
club are a group headed by former GM Serge Savard and
communications giant BCE . . . For a while it looked as if it were
a fait accompli that GM Lou Lamoriello, whose contract was up,
would be leaving the Devils. Because of the change in ownership, it
was rumored that Lamoriello was going to the Rangers, Phoenix,
Edmonton, and even Boston. But when the franchise is officially
turned over to YankeeNets July 12, Lamoriello will be at the helm.
That also means that coach Larry Robinson, who helped lead New
Jersey to the Stanley Cup, will be back . . . It took Mark Parrish
a while, but the former Florida Panther has warmed up to the idea
of playing for the New York Islanders. Parrish was part of the
multiplayer swap that set the stage for Islanders GM Mike Milbury
to select former Boston University goalie Rick DiPietro with the
No. 1 pick overall in draft. ``I wasn't exactly told I was on the
trading block,'' said Parrish, who is 23 and was traded for the
first time after two years in South Florida. ``I'll get a chance to
play a bigger role on an up-and-coming organization and I'm very
excited about it now. The way I described it to a friend of mine,
it's almost like you're breaking up with your first girlfriend. You
don't know how to react.'' Parrish said he might actually be a
better fit with Islanders coach Butch Goring, as opposed to
Florida's Terry Murray. ``Terry Murray is a good coach and he's
been known to make the playoffs a lot, but he's also not a young
players' coach,'' said Parrish. ``He likes his older guys. I've
heard nothing but great things about Butch and how he brings along
young guys and lets them just play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow removal?
</P>
<P>
   Wrentham native Garth Snow won't be staying in Vancouver. Snow,
an unrestricted free agent, wants to go to a team where he can play
more. ``(Canucks GM) Brian Burke and (assistant GM) Dave Nonis have
treated him great, but it's time to move on,'' said Snow's agent,
Steve Mountain. ``It's time to see if he can be a starter somewhere
else.'' Snow made $1.4 million US last season and was due to make
$1.9 million US this year, had the Canucks picked up the option on
his contract. Vancouver reportedly offered Snow a two-year deal
worth $1 million a season, but the goalie declined . . . Remember
Wes Walz, the former Bruins draft choice who signed the first
one-way contract Sinden ever agreed to? Well, he's back. Last week,
Walz signed with the Minnesota Wild. The 30-year-old, who was
drafted in the third round in 1989, played six games with Long
Beach of the IHL last year with an eye toward making an NHL
comeback, but decided to return to the Swiss Elite League, where he
had been the last several seasons. He helped Lugano win that
league's regular-season title with 10 goals and 15 assists in 18
games. Walz played 73 games for Boston in 1989-90 and '90-91,
notching 21 points, including nine goals. He also played for
Philadelphia, Detroit, and Calgary before heading overseas.
Calgary's GM when Walz was there was Doug Risebrough, now the
Wild's GM . . . Sixty-seven days to training camp.

CUP HAS ALTERED ITS COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the briefest of moments, oh somewhere around the early 1980s
and the dawning of the Dennis Conner era, people actually discussed
the America's Cup in terms of an ``Olympic-style'' sport.
</P>
<P>
   That was code for ``equal opportunity,'' and it rested on the
uncomplicated faith that the America's Cup _ symbol of supremacy of
yacht design, building, and the seamanship to sail such creations
better than anyone else _ was open to all nations on a roughly
egalitarian basis.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if this ideal were ever even worth applying to the
nation's oldest sporting trophy, it disappeared entirely when in
mid-May, the world's modern high-tech barrons began plundering Team
New Zealand and dividing up the spoils of _ no, not a victory on
the water _ but of another game called: ``Who wants to be a sailing
millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know Team New Zealand was not as squeaky clean and
pristine as it seemed on that March day when Russell Coutts turned
the helm over to the fair-faced understudy, Dean Barker, and said,
in effect: ``You take it from here, kid. Win one for the
motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barker did. And Team New Zealand, by virtue of its virtue,
it seemed, had crushed all the high-rollers in the world in
embarrassing fashion. And since no potential competitors even had a
clue how to get to where TNZ was in the year 2000, how would they
possibly figure out how to get to where it would be in 2003?
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seemed as if a dynasty was at hand for at least a
couple of Cup cycles, especially when the Team New Zealand
leadership made, as a final gesture, something like a blood oath
that filthy lucre would never break up the very solidity from
whence TNZ's magic powers seemed to flow.
</P>
<P>
   By now even casual Cup observers know what this spring has
wrought on New Zealand. A posse of the world's billionaires, which
descended on the island largely as spectators last fall and has not
only plundered Team New Zealand but has reset the entire landscape
for the next Cup backward.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday in Monaco, an unofficial meeting took place of the
challengers of 2003 to swap some informalities about the next Cup,
sponsored by The Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Series. The Louis
Vuitton Cup is the four-month series of races among all the Cup
challengers to determine which team will challenge the Cup
defender. Last time, Prada won the Louis Vuitton Cup and got waxed,
5-0, by New Zealand for the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one has officially challenged (deadline is next March),
the meeting in Monaco was not an official Challenger of Record
Management committee meeting, and yet many of the alignments
already are clear. Even owing to the inevitable attrition that
takes place as we get closer to Cup deadlines, here is a rundown of
those participating in the Monaco non-meeting:
</P>
<P>
   New York Yacht Club/Team Dennis Conner; Seattle Yacht
Club/OneWorld Challenge, backed by Craig McCaw; the Corinthian
Yacht Club/Seattle Challenge, backed by Russell Belden; Australian
Challenge, backed by Syd Fischer; Le Defi Francais, returning; FAST
2000 from Switzerland, returning; Ernesto Bertarelli from
Switzerland, with New Zealand's Coutts and Brad Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   Missing in action because of the French airline strike were Dawn
Riley's America True and Japan's Nippon Challenge, both returnees.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of the meeting, according to Louis Vuitton's Bruno
Trouble, was a discussion of the world audience and the events
leading up to the next Cup, one to sail in the Med, another in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the old Olympic hey-everyone-jump-in spirit _ a look
at the lineup makes it pretty clear that the great divide will come
between those groups that have to beat the bushes for corporate
funds and civic bake sales and those with unlimited funding who can
hit the ground at full speed. This is no five-year waiting period,
as was the last Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly absent from the Monaco list is Prada boss and
owner Patrizio Bertelli _ perhaps not in the billionaire's club at
$650 million, but he won't get snubbed. Bertelli bought the hard
goods developed by Young America. The intellectual properties
remain a question.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the takeover of the Cup by billionaires is really a step
backward, and is perhaps traceable to Bill Koch in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Cup was fought for world sailing supremacy by
bitter rivals whose grandfathers had fired cannons at each other in
the War of 1812. So, for the captains of the industrial revolution
with names like Astor, Morgan, and Vanderbilt, to take on the
British sea supremacy _ even in the hour of the Empire's decline _
was far more serious than a summer regatta among friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup did go through its clubby period as the post-war racing
started up in 1958. Conner, and his two-boat,
leave-no-stone-unturned approach to enlisting corporate backing
took the Cup in a very new direction, the outward appearance of
which has been rued to this day by purists: all that damn
advertising on the hull, the sails, the racing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort to keep the corporate logos in some sort of
good taste, clearly a corner had been turned.
</P>
<P>
   And now, if the richest men in the world turn the entire sailing
pool into a free agency draft for a very finite supply of top
players (witness the NBA and Major League Baseball to see the same
effect), the Cup will very surely have turned another corner.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever loses, it will not be the sport of sailing _ 2003
promises to be great stuff.

BOGGS BALKS AT TRYOUT OFFER

   No stars and stripes for Boggsie in Sydney after all.
</P>
<P>
   Though former Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs is headed for the
Hall of Fame, US Olympic baseball officials wanted him to spend a
couple of weeks with an independent minor league team to make sure
he could still put his bat on the ball. No thanks, said the
41-year-old Boggs, who said he didn't want to spend a fortnight in
the bushes with no guarantee of making the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun for a while to actually think about playing in the
Olympics,'' said Boggs, now a special assistant in the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays front office, in a St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times report
last week. Though retired major leaguers are eligible for the
Games, only a handful _ like Terry Steinbach _ are both willing and
able to play. Most of the squad, which will be chosen in late
August, will be minor leaguers.
</P>

   Political backflips
</P>
<P>
   Team coordinator Bela Karolyi has his doubts about the
four-person committee that will choose half of the six-member US
Olympic women's gymnastics team at next month's trials at the
FleetCenter. ``I am the only one who watches them since January,''
said Karolyi, who has convened the top contenders for monthly boot
camps at his Houston ranch. The rest of the committee _ 1984
Olympian Tracee Talavera, judge Marilyn Cross, and gymnast Chari
Knight _ will have to see them in competition this month. Not that
anybody expects that all votes will carry equal weight at selection
time, even though they're supposed to. Karolyi, who has been to
every Games since 1976, is the sport's all-time backroom politician
. . . Rough reentry for gymnast Shannon Miller, who's trying to
make her third Olympic team at 23. After an encouraging camp
performance in May, she had a dreadful outing at a recent meet in
Ontario, falling twice from the beam (where she won gold in
Atlanta) and once from the bars. ``Different ballgame,'' said
Karolyi, who chalked up Miller's miscues to adjusting her 1996
skills to 2000 realities. ``She knows now where she is at.''
There's good news on the men's side where Jason Gatson, who tore
his ACL last year, is rounding into form. ``His knee is not quite
100 percent, but we think he'll be ready to go,'' said coach Peter
Kormann. ``He's tumbling and he's vaulting and he looks like he's
on track to be a major contender.'' . . . New Zealand sculler Rob
Waddell suffered his first loss in two years at the recent World
Cup rowing event in Vienna. Waddell, the two-time world champ, was
beaten in the semis by defending Olympic gold medalist (and former
Brown oarsman) Xeno Mueller of Switzerland, who hadn't won a race
in two years. ``It's a long way to the Olympics, and I haven't
peaked yet,'' said Waddell, who's odds-on to win in Sydney. The
sample-sized US flotilla had a promising showing _ a silver medal
from the men's lightweight four and bronzes by the men's quad and
the women's double of Ruth Davidon and Norwood's Carol Skricki. The
Yanks will send virtually all hands (except for the eights and
possibly sculler Don Smith) to this month's event in Lucerne,
Switzerland, which follows the last-chance Olympic qualifier there
. . . There'll be no return ticket for all three US Greco-Roman
wrestlers who won Olympic silvers last time. Matt Ghaffari, Brandon
Paulson, and Dennis Hall were all beaten at last weekend's trials
in Dallas. So all eight team members will be rookies. The freestyle
team returns only Melvin Douglas (and injured Les Gutches, if he
beats Charles Burton in their challenge), but has two former world
champs in Terry Brands and Sammie Henson.

   Family first
</P>
<P>
   Why wasn't Sheryl Swoopes, named last week as the final member
of the US Olympic women's basketball team, one of the first 11
picked? She had taken herself out of the running because family
commitments kept her from participating on the team's lengthy
exhibition tour. Swoopes, who was the third-leading scorer in
Atlanta and has sparked the Houston Comets to three straight WNBA
titles, is leading the league in scoring . . . Ticklish choice
upcoming for US Olympic women's tennis coach Billie Jean King, who
has to name her squad a week from Monday. Does she pick doubles
specialist Corina Morariu to go with Lindsay Davenport and hope
they regain their championship form? That would mean leaving off
Serena Williams, which might provoke sister Venus into staying
home. Or does she use the Williamses as her doubles unit?
``Somebody is going to be left behind,'' said King. ``It is not
fun.'' If she could name five players, as the men can, she wouldn't
have a problem. But since the Women's Tennis Association has chosen
not to have Olympic results count toward its rankings (as the men's
ATP does), it gets one less player per country . . . It was a
double dip for diver Mark Ruiz. He qualified for the US Olympic
team on both springboard and platform last week. The 21-year-old
Ruiz could have had a walk-on if he'd chosen to compete for his
native Puerto Rico, but he has lived in Florida since he was 12.
David Pichler could also have doubled, but he splattered his final
springboard dive and ended up fourth. Also on the team are 1996
veteran Jenny Keim, Troy Dumais, Michelle Davison, Laura Wilkinson,
and Sara Reiling. The Americans, who didn't make the podium at the
last world championships, have won a medal at every Olympics since
1912 _ 127 in all . . . Life begins at 40 for the US Olympic
dressage team, which will average 42 at Sydney. On the squad for
the fourth time is Robert Dover (44), who will be joined by
Christine Traurig (43), Sue Blinks (42), and Guenter Seidel (39) .
. . Back within Olympic medal range is the US men's volleyball
team, which breezed unbeaten through its World League qualifying
group on the way to next week's finals in the Netherlands. The
squad, ranked fifth in the world, plays its final Olympic tuneup at
the Springfield Civic Center July 22 against the Bulgarians, who
knocked them out of medal contention four years ago in Atlanta . .
. A complicating factor in US Olympic men's soccer goalkeeper Adin
Brown's return from last week's second knee arthroscopy is that
he's a Christian Scientist, which limits his treatment options and
may delay his rehab. Brown, who plays for the Colorado Rapids, is
expected to be sidelined for up to three weeks . . . Why will the
Edmonton organizers end next year's world outdoor track and field
championships with the men's 4 x 100 relay instead of the 4 x 400?
To set the stage for a last hurrah for Olympic gold medalist
Donovan Bailey and his mates, who'll be ending their careers on
home soil . . . Washington outbid Vienna and Hamar, Norway, for the
2003 world figure skating championships, which will be held at the
MCI Center. It'll be the 11th time a US city has hosted the event
and the first time since 1998, when the site was Minneapolis.
Vancouver will stage next year's championships, with Nagano hosting
in 2002 . . . After an eight-year absence, the World Cup luge
circuit finally returns to the States next February for not one but
two events. They'll not only be sliding on the Olympic track in
Salt Lake City, they'll finish the season on Lake Placid's new run.

MORE STOPS MEAN FEWER BREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ NASCAR reached the halfway point of the
grueling 34-race Winston Cup schedule with Saturday night's Pepsi
400 at Daytona International Speedway. Next Sunday's race, the
Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway, will mark
the unofficial start of the second half of the season. If this were
the Boston Marathon, the field of Winston Cup drivers would be
chugging along Route 135 in Wellesley, with Heartbreak Hill ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the NASCAR Winston Cup Series is a marathon of a different
sort that covers tracks coast to coast. By season's end, drivers
log enough race miles (13,365.8) to cross the country in their
3,500-pound stock cars at least five times.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the circuit will be even more grueling when NASCAR
expands its schedule to 36 point races with the addition of events
at Chicago and Kansas City, Kan. When you count the two exhibition
races (the Bud Shootout at Daytona in February and The Winston in
Charlotte in May), that means Winston Cup teams will be on the road
38 out of 52 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers and owners have expressed concern about the burden
it will place upon their crew members. ``Everybody says, `Well,
it's only a couple of more weekends we're throwing out,' but the
problem is you're still gone Friday, Saturday, Sunday,'' said Bill
Elliott. ``And, normally, Thursday is a travel day and part of
Monday is a recovery day, so that's four or five days a week, (but)
I don't write the rules. I just go to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of NASCAR's expansion to key markets in the Midwest
raised concerns about whether teams are being pushed past their
breaking points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is concern,'' said Mike Helton, NASCAR's
chief operating officer and senior vice president. ``You have to be
sensitive to that becoming an issue. We have to be concerned about
finding more time in the schedule to have more races.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the way I see it, we need to figure out a way to help the
crews from the standpoint of wearing them out every week,'' Elliott
said. ``The one thing I see, being from the owner's side of this
deal _ I'm wearing an owner's hat now _ is that I have to hire not
just two or three more people but a lot more people to overcome the
amount of traveling and what these guys go through week in and week
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the drivers? What kind of time constraints will they
likely face next season when two races are added to an already
jam-packed schedule?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a time-management situation that people are
going to have to handle and accept _ everyone in NASCAR to some
degree,'' said Mark Martin. ``Another thing is I don't plan to do
this for another 10 years. I've put 26 years of my full focus and
my full life into this and as it continues to grow and require
more, I continue to look and plan for retirement. Whereas, if it
(were) a 25-race schedule I might plan to race another 10 or 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with it the way it is and with the level of success that
I've been able to achieve, it just makes me look long and hard at
how long I want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate step by NASCAR, which is not only expanding its
schedule, but also its media exposure when a $2.47 billion TV
contract with NBC, Turner Sports, Fox, and FX kicks in next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you had an ideal perfect world, maybe one of the
races currently on the schedule at a track that has two (Winston
Cup dates) could be cut back, so you're not really at another event
on an extra weekend,'' said Ricky Rudd. ``We'll manage and we'll
cope. We're excited about going to areas like Chicago and Kansas
City; but by the same token, hopefully, by not dropping any tracks,
at least we're not forgetting the fans who have supported us over
the years.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bodine's destiny
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine, the 51-year-old Winston Cup veteran from
Chemung, N.Y., returned to Daytona this weekend for the first time
since his horrific truck crash in February. Bodine cashed in a chip
as provisional starter, earning the last spot in the field for
Saturday night's race. ``This has been a very positive experience
for me,'' said Bodine. ``You might think I'm crazy, but I wouldn't
change anything that happened here at Daytona. I survived. I
survived in front of millions of people. I'm a living testament of
God's power that He has over our lives. He also protected me where
I wasn't hurt bad enough that I couldn't race again. I'm back. I'm
racing. He blessed me there.'' . . . Michael Waltrip said if he had
his druthers he might not have run the Boston Marathon after
driving at Talladega the day before. ``That wasn't one of the more
sound decisions I've ever made,'' Waltrip said. ``The race at
Talladega was going well. We'd run up front all day and were
running fourth and got in that wreck. We loaded up that night and
flew to Boston and got up the next morning and did the Boston
Marathon.'' Waltrip said he is training to run one more marathon in
December in Tampa. ``I really want to make it in less than four
hours. That's my only goal, to finish one in less than four hours,
and I'm definitely in better shape now than when I went to Boston,
because I've rededicated myself to running and preparing for the
next marathon.'' . . . NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series regular Andy
Houston will drive the No. 82 Channellock Chevrolet for Team Sabco
in the NASCAR Busch Series Die Hard 250 at the Milwaukee Mile
Sunday. It will be Houston's second career Busch start in the event
at Indianapolis Raceway Park; in 1996, he finished 24th. ``I love
racing anything that has wheels on it and take advantage of any
chance I can,'' said Houston . . . Pfizer Inc. announced Friday it
was stepping up as primary sponsor of Martin's No. 6 Ford Taurus,
replacing Valvoline, which declined to pony up the money Roush
Racing was demanding to run the 2001 Winston Cup season. Martin
will now drive the No. 6 Viagra Ford. ``It's a perfect fit for
me,'' said Martin, who served as a spokesman for Pfizer's Men's
Health Tune-Up For Life Program. ``I've been an advocate for men's
health concerns. Now I have a sponsor whose company goal is to help
people live longer and healthier lives.'' . . . While many teams
unveiled new paint and logo schemes for Saturday's race, the most
notable was the significant switch at Petty Enterprises, whose No.
43 Pontiac is no longer sponsored by STP. Saturday night, John
Andretti piloted the blue and yellow No. 43 Cheerios/Betty Crocker
Pontiac. ``We were talking about that in Sears Point with my sister
Rebecca,'' said Kyle Petty. ``I was 14 when she was born and
Rebecca has never seen that car painted any other color but blue
and orange with the No. 43 and STP on it. There's a lot of Winston
Cup fans who have never seen that car any other way. In a lot of
ways, it's like Coca-Cola changing their logo. It was almost like
43 STP was the logo, now it's 43 Cheerios. I think it shows how the
sport has changed. There's not many sacred cows left in this
sport.'' . . . The Tyler Jet Motorsports crew took a different
tack, switching back to the plain white paint scheme it had on
Johnny Benson's sponsorless Pontiac in the Daytona 500 after Lycos
reneged on its sponsorship deal after 16 races. So instead of
applying new decals to Benson's No. 10 Pontiac, the team spent
Friday afternoon removing them. ``There's the good ol' saying that
wider is better with Pontiac,'' Benson said. ``But now this team
has its own saying that, `Whiter is better.' We're just hoping that
it works out well.''

   Jerry Marquis of Broad Brook, Conn., was able to negotiate
lapped traffic in the final laps of last Saturday's Carquest 150 at
Seekonk (Mass.) Speedway to win his second NASCAR Featherlite
Modified event of the season over Mike Ewanitsko of North Babylon,
N.Y. In other Seekonk races last week: Wayne Dion of Warrick, R.I.,
took the NASCAR Weekly Racing Pro Series event over Bryan Souza,
the pole-sitter from Somerset, Mass.; James Lawrence, also of
Somerset, captured the checkered in the 25-lap Exide Sportsman
Division feature over Ken Spencer of Taunton, Mass.; Kevin Casper
of Fall River, Mass., won the Seekonk Sports Truck 25-lapper over
Mike Brightman of New Bedford, Mass., and Jason Heroux of Johnston,
R.I., won the Mini Cup feature over rookie Josh Lima of Cranston,
R.I. . . . Thompson (Conn.) International Speedway has rescheduled
its July 20 NASCAR Featherlite Modified race to Aug. 17. The Pepsi
125 was moved to August after it was preempted by the May 21
rainout of the Bud Kick Off, which will now be held July 20. After
staging the Pepsi 125, Thompson will host the Busch North Series
Aug. 27.

   The 2000 NBA draft is history. The courtship of free agents has
begun. It's time to take a look at the teams, see how they did, see
what they need, and see where they're staying over this Fourth of
July weekend.

   ORLANDO: ``We're loaded and ready to go,'' coach Doc Rivers said
on draft night. Boy, is he right. The Magic were the undisputed
winners, getting one of the top prospects (Mike Miller) and trading
their other two picks, along with two players, for future
first-round picks. Those deals, say Orlando executives, enable the
team to make not only a hard run at the big free agents, but also
to keep valuable free agents Bo Outlaw and Ben Wallace. They have a
plan, that's for sure. Tim Duncan is the key. If he can be
convinced to sign with the Magic, it will trigger a second wave of
interest among the other desirables. Who wouldn't want to play with
Duncan and for Rivers? They'll still do well, but the whole plan
revolves around Duncan. If they can't get him, no one can. He'll
stay in San Antonio.

   DALLAS: We all should know by now that owner Mark Cuban isn't
afraid to do anything. He opened a drawer in his foyer and took out
$3 million to send to the Magic. The Mavs upgraded in the
department that needed the most upgrading: rebounding. They drafted
Etan Thomas (a poor man's Buck Williams) and added Donnell Harvey
via a trade with New York. Harvey is ready to rebound now. They
also got a scorer in Courtney Alexander, although he plays the same
position as Ironman Michael Finley. The Mavericks finished the
season strong. They still need a center, but who doesn't? And wait
until they get into the serious free agent market once they unload
millstone Shawn Bradley.
</P>

   CHICAGO: They had reservations at the Ritz, but when they got
there, it was booked. They basically took Marcus Fizer to thwart a
Clippers-Magic trade that would have given Orlando Darius Miles.
How Fizer fits with Elton Brand will be interesting. Then they
drafted a center (Chris Mihm), but traded him to division rival
Cleveland for a point guard with 17 games of college experience
(Jamal Crawford). Then they drafted another center (Dalibor
Bagaric) who likely will stay overseas. They had better hit the
free agent jackpot, and we don't mean Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY: New honcho Rod Thorn resisted inquiries and took the
best player in the draft. Was Kenyon Martin crying because he was
happy or because he is going to play for the Exit 16Ws? But Jersey
is staying here only on a weekend rate because it lost Jayson
Williams (retirement) and may lose Kerry Kittles. Martin fills a
huge hole _ we can't see him taking any, er, stuff, from Stephon
Marbury _ and if Kittles can make it back, the Nets could move up a
notch. New coach Byron Scott apparently has all the right stuff,
which he's going to need.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: How did Olumide Oyedeji slide into the second round?
Wasn't Dallas going to take him at 12? Didn't the Celtics bring him
back for a second look? There must have been some 11th-hour scare,
because no one pegged him there prior to the draft. But if he can
be cleared to play, the Sonics got two great athletes in Oyedeji
and Desmond Mason, a true senior. Either could be insurance if
Rashard Lewis bolts, which may happen because the Sonics are locked
into what they can pay. But what Seattle needs more than anything
is for Vin Baker to stop whatever he's been doing the last two-plus
years, lose the weight, and be the player he was in Milwaukee.

   VANCOUVER: The Grizzlies may have gotten the best player in the
draft because Stromile Swift is two years younger than Martin. In
addition, he wants to be in Vancouver (which is, by the way, a
beautiful city, even if it is in what Kenny Anderson called a
foreign country). The Grizzlies have a nice, young nucleus, which
may mesh in a year or two. By that time they'll be in Nashville or
New Orleans and be good enough so that Dick Versace can take over
the coaching duties.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX: Why do I think that if anyone is going to extract Jake
Tsakalidis from Greece, it will be Jerry Colangelo? It's a wonder
Tsakalidis lasted as long as he did (No. 25); surely he'll be in
the NBA sooner than later. He's young, he has an NBA body, and if
he can be half as good as Arvydas Sabonis, the Suns will be happy.
Surround him with good players, which Phoenix has, and he could be
even better.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Bucks released Tractor Traylor from George Karl's
doghouse and shipped him to Cleveland. They then got Joel Przybilla
via a draft-night trade with Houston, which, if he develops, could
be a coup. At worst, they got a shot-blocking center. They also got
Jason Caffey, who was a disappointment at Golden State. Their big
chore is re-signing Tim Thomas. The feeling is that Milwaukee,
already shelling out big bucks to Big Dog Glenn Robinson and Ray
Allen, won't go to the max for Thomas. But someone (Chicago?) will,
although he's not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Speedy Claxton would have helped the Sixers in the
playoffs after Eric Snow went down. They also got a serviceable
player in local favorite Mark Karcher (Temple) in the second round.
But the ongoing dilemma is the relationship between Larry Brown and
Allen Iverson. Do the Sixers really feel they can win with Iverson,
who was on time for one practice during the playoffs? And what will
they do with Toni Kukoc? We can't see Brown taking in Glen Rice,
because Brown likes guys who play (or try to play) defense. Then
again, Kukoc doesn't do much at that end of the floor, either.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: OK, we still don't get the Traylor trade, although it
mostly was about moving Bob Sura and his salary. But the Cavaliers
did get Mihm, which, given their interior woes, was a nice
addition. He may turn out to be Danny Schayes Part 2, but the soft
label seems more convenient than fair. Brad Daugherty was supposed
to be soft, too, remember? He turned out all right. We just wonder
if the Gund Arena practice floor can take Traylor guarding Shawn
Kemp.

   BOSTON: The Celtics would have been relegated to the Milner
Hotel had they traded three first-round picks for Jermaine O'Neal.
(The last time that happened, it was for Bob McAdoo.) But Portland
wouldn't bite and Jerome Moiso is now aboard. He speaks three
languages, which will come in handy when his legendary passivity
riles Rick Pitino. ``The questions for him are strength and
toughness,'' said his UCLA coach, Steve Lavin. ``But it's
refreshing to work with someone like him because he's not a prima
donna or have an overstated opinion of himself.'' He was a good
pick at 11 _ most had him gone before then _ and the Celtics did
need to get more athletic. But he also plays the same position as
Antoine Walker, who generally stays on the floor.

   TORONTO: The Raptors still need a point guard, but they weren't
enthralled with what they saw in the draft. In Morris Peterson,
they got a ready-for-service wingman who can step in for the
soon-to-be-departing Tracy McGrady. Toronto has a Hall of Fame
coach in Lenny Wilkens, a superstar in the making in Vince Carter,
and one of the most attractive free agents in McGrady. It looked
for a while as if the Raptors were on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Hawks said DerMarr Johnson was the guy they wanted
and he's an improvement over their last shooting guard, a guy named
Rider. Hanno Mottola was supposed to be a first-rounder, but he
fell into the second.

   LA LAKERS: Gee, do you think they'll survive the loss of A.C.

   NEW YORK: Just what the Knicks needed, another point guard. They
made a decent draft selection in Harvey and then traded him to
Dallas for Erick Strickland. Did they think it was Rod?

<P>
   DETROIT: Let's hope the Pistons are as happy with Mateen Cleaves
as he is with them. Scouts didn't like his size, speed, or shot. He
should have showed them his NCAA championship ring. The Pistons
have bigger, more immediate concerns, in Grant Hill. If he leaves,
can you spell lottery?

<P>
   CHARLOTTE: What position don't they need? Power forward. What
position does Jamaal Magliore play? Yup. Now, if they can move
either Anthony Mason or Derrick Coleman, this pick might make a
little more sense.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Maybe there isn't much of a difference between
Przybilla and Jason Collier. The Rockets obviously didn't think so.
They also got a No. 1 out of the deal. But Collier is not an
interior-type guy and Przybilla is.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO: The Kings like those Euros. Actually, their guy is a
Turk (Hidayet Turkoglu), but he supposedly can play a little. They
also got a backup center (Jabari Smith) in the second round, which
is better than getting one in the first.

   MIAMI: Pat Riley got a couple of second-rounders (Eddie House,

Heat the possibility of free agent shopping next summer. Now all
they have to do is get Tim Hardaway's name on a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN STATE: The Warriors' pick was in February and it was
Larry Hughes. Not bad. They also got Sura and Vinny Del Negro in a
pre-draft, three-team deal.
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND: The guess here is the Blazers could have had the first
10 picks in the draft and still won't recover from that monumental
meltdown in Game 7 against the Lakers. Then again, given the way
they played in March and April, no one figured them to get that
far. They have to find out what gives with Brian Grant and then
deal with the O'Neal situation. It's hard to believe they turned
down three No. 1s for O'Neal, who wasn't good enough to get off the
bench in the playoffs.

a reserve on his club team and his numbers have gone down the last
three years. Why didn't they just pass?
</P>
<P>
   DENVER: The Nuggets actually made a trade to get a late
first-rounder (Mamadou N'diaye). What were they thinking?
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Timberwolves hosted the draft and didn't have a
first-round pick. But they made sure to reward all those who
persevered with their second-round selection of point guard Igor
Rakocevic from Red Star Belgrade.

PEREZ NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The better Carlos Perez pitches, the fewer
alleged prospects the Dodgers will be tempted to package in a deal
at the trade deadline to acquire the veteran starter Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone talked of the day Orel Hershiser was
waived.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? If Perez pitches well enough, maybe the Dodger
won't need to make a deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who matter, Perez threw two bad pitches
Saturday against San Francisco, and he's progressing nicely.
</P>
<P>
   According to what matters, though, those two pitches resulted in
four runs and a 4-1 Giants victory at Pac Bell Park. It's the first
time in five games the Giants have beaten the Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants lefty Kirk Rueter (6-4) won his fourth straight by
holding the Dodgers down for six innings. Four relievers, including
closer Rob Nen, pitched the final three innings. The once-vaunted
Dodgers lineup has turned sporadic and inconsistent, scoring three
runs or less in 11 of their last 28 games. They've lost all 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Perez) has been pitching better lately, but we didn't get him
any runs,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He pitched out of
some jams, he competed. I felt like we would win that ballgame if
we just hang close.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has spent the first three months of the season looking
over his shoulder at what's chasing him, be it Eric Gagne, Orel
Hershiser or the minor leagues. None of those are issues any more.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's here, Hershiser's not, the minor leagues are out and
Perez said he had such stiffness in the right side of his neck that
he couldn't turn his head. Or look over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day; the problem with my neck, feeling sick the
last two days, fever and other kind of stuff, but I'm the kind of
guy that likes to play,'' Perez said. ``It was tough for me to
pitch inside. I tried to go inside twice and gave up a homer a
double. I was glad to have good command with my fastball, and I
used that to get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a win for the Dodgers, but it wasn't an abomination.
And in Perez's case, not to mention the Dodgers', that's paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was coming off a pair of strong relief appearances in
which he allowed one run in 8 innings. It was enough to place him
back in the rotation and Hershiser into limbo. Yet, Perez hasn't
won since May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good game for the way I feel right now,'' said
Perez, who pitched six innings. ``I didn't think I was going to go
six innings. When I woke up, I didn't think I was going to be
available to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   While Perez pointed to the two pitches that resulted in two-run
homers by Ramon Martinez in the third inning and Rich Aurilia in
the fourth, it's not as if he didn't make other mistakes that led
to his unnerving during those innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Calvin Murray grounded to Kevin Elster at
shortstop, but the Dodgers were slow in turning a double play and
Murray was safe. Perez then balked Murray to second before Martinez
hit an 0-2 split-finger fastball over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos isn't going to shut many people out, but he kept us in
the ballgame. That's all you can ask,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric
Karros said. ``(The balk) hasn't been called all year. That may
have got him rattled. I think the fact we were unable to turn the
double play kind of got to him a little bit. It was a combination
of the two, and give any team opportunities like that, and
eventually you're going to get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia's homer made it 4-0, and unlike the night before when
the Dodgers pounded Giants pitching for nine runs, they got little
going offensively.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the first three innings, the Dodgers grounded into
inning-ending double plays. Their only run came on F.P.
Santangelo's shallow sacrifice fly to right center in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to start the runners, but (Rueter) also has a great
move,'' Johnson said. ``The jumps we were getting, if we started
them it wouldn't have made any difference.'' &QL;

RED SOX LACK FIRE IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hit bottom? Don't be so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it looks like we're in free fall and there's no end
in sight,'' Red Sox second baseman Jeff Frye said after a 7-2 loss
to the Chicago White Sox so unspeakable, manager Jimy Williams's
public postmortem was reduced to a single four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   ``U-G-L-Y, that's it on the game. Ugly,'' Williams said, arms
crossed and face flushed with the same anger he showed his team
immediately after the game, when he kept the clubhouse door closed
while giving his players an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him upset, pretty fired up before,'' shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra said after a game in which the Sox were charged with
three errors, allowed four unearned runs, and committed other
blunders that did not show up in the box score but were seared onto
Williams's brain plate. ``He was upset today, and he has a right to
be. He's right, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox dropped to .500 (38-38) for the first time since April
14 after losing for the ninth time in their last dozen games, their
second straight loss to the White Sox assuring them of not winning
a series for the seventh straight time. Since May 19, when they
were 25-13 and 12 games above .500, the Sox have lost nine series,
won two, and split two, both against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embarrassing,'' Frye said. ``We didn't pitch good, we didn't
hit good, we didn't field good. We made mental mistakes, we made
physical mistakes, anything we could do wrong we did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to watch? Imagine playing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't raise his voice, pitcher Bryce Florie said. He
didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was due,'' Florie said. ``We needed it. Some guys on the
team were already thinking of doing something, but he beat us to
the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said we were playing with our heads up our butts.
It's one thing when you're getting beat and putting everything on
the line. But when you're making mental mistake after mental
mistake, you can't put up with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at (the White Sox). They were making all the plays,
taking the extra base. That's what made this team what it is,
playing hard whether we're up by 10 runs or down by 10 runs.
Everybody knew that's what they got when they played the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you get in a situation like this, everything gets
magnified. People start mentioning things, guys start saying, `Why
did you do this?' That's when the finger-pointing starts. I've been
on those kinds of teams. You start losing, the bad vibes get going.
That's why we have to nip this in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   The one player spared Williams's wrath was rookie pitcher Paxton
Crawford, who did a credible job filling in for the best pitcher in
baseball, the injured Pedro Martinez, in a debut that was big
league in name only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I didn't make him mad,'' said Crawford, a guileless
22-year-old from Plummerville, Ark., a hamlet of 500, some of whom
almost certainly could have played a better right field than Izzy
Alcantara did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was intended or not, Alcantara displayed a maddening
nonchalance both in the field, where he allowed a catcher (!), Mark
Johnson, to score Chicago's first run from first base on a single,
and on the basepaths, where he was caught in a rundown between
second and third after coming to a halt for no discernible reason
on what should have been a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara, who also played Jose Valentin's single into a
run-scoring double for the second White Sox run, later was charged
with an error when he picked up Chris Singleton's leadoff single in
the sixth, then dropped it as he prepared to throw, allowing
Singleton to take second. New third baseman Ed Sprague, who somehow
was not charged with a throwing error on the first ball hit his
way, followed with a two-base error when Carlos Lee's ground ball
clanked off his glove. The White Sox went on to score four runs in
the inning, three on Valentin's bases-loaded triple off Rich
Garces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ugliest game I've been a part of since I've been
here,'' said catcher Jason Varitek, who threw wildly into right
field after bumping into plate umpire Mike Van Vleet, an error that
led to the third Chicago run, scored in the third inning. ``Any
manager would be upset. Guys are upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were held to four hits in eight innings by lefty
Mike Sirotka, all singles. Brian Daubach singled home Boston's only
run off Sirotka, but even that play wound up tainted, as
Garciaparra was erased at the plate trying to score from second on
a terrific throw by Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to fail,'' Garciaparra said. ``We've always had a
club where everybody knew the demeanor of the club, how you've got
to play. Everybody picked each other up. We're not doing that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got to look in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will they see? Varitek, whose ninth-inning RBI double
in the ninth was Boston's only extra-base hit of the game, is
hopeful they'll see the essence of what has made them winners in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough time for a lot of people,'' he said. ``We
really need to dig deep and trust in our abilities when we go out
there. If we play hard and concentrate, good things are going to
eventually happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't all of a sudden say, `Today's the day we're
going to make it happen.' You have to keep grinding, game after
game after game.''

WOOD WON WITHOUT PLAYING A SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Suppose they gave a Wimbledon final _ and nobody showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen quite that way. But sort of, smiles 88-year-old
Sidney Wood, the most _ shall we say, mature? _ of the champions
who Saturday paraded across the fading lawn of Centre Court where
they had spent glorious afternoons of dashing and bashing and
making names for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a millennial reunion, an extraordinary celebration of
bygone (and present) prowess, a convention of sneakered gods,
dripping with auld lang syne. Some were decrepit, others as sleek
as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, fetching as Steffi Graf and
Evonne Goolagong.
</P>
<P>
   Henry ``Bunny'' Austin, the English humanitarian who liberated
the male knee by introducing shorts, arrived in a wheelchair.
Although he finished second to Americans Ellsworth Vines in 1932
and Don Budge in 1938, and is ``doing better'' with his walking at
home, Austin says that, despite the abysmal state of British
tennis, he's not contemplating a comeback. He will be 94 next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits may have lost their Empire, but not their touch in
stylish presentations, laced with pomp and circumstance. They know
how to do these things, rolling out a red carpet, a scarlet-coated
brass band of the Scots Guards, and a spare duchess to preside.
She, the Duchess of Gloucester (not Gloucester, Mass., I'm told),
handed out mementos to the 65 champs and runners-up in a ceremony
that kept the packed-in audience of 13,812 applauding for almost an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the noise meter were the house record-holder Billie Jean
King (20 titles overall), double-Grand Slammer Rod Laver, Bjorn
Borg, Andre Agassi, John McEnroe, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova,
Goolagong, Becker, Graf, and the last English champ, Virginia Wade
(23 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Borg got an extra hurrah as he stooped to kiss a baseline where
he spent most of his time in winning five titles. But no one was
slighted in acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   While the band played ``God Save the Queen,'' as archaic as such
may seem, for a moment you felt touched, and removed to 1877, the
year the Big W commenced, when London was the center of the
universe and Victoria ruled a worldwide Empire. Ruling Wimbledon is
still tantamount to holding the world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our most important tournament,'' says an American named
Pete Sampras, who missed the parade. Icing and other treatment for
his inflamed left foot and shin took precedence before he went onto
Centre Court to struggle for almost an hour against Justin
Gimelstob. Presently ``the adrenaline kicked in'' and the champ
joined the last 16, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up at the royal box, and saw Borg and Laver,'' he
laughs, ``and I was embarrassed to play so bad in front of them. I
wanted to throw my racket up there and let them play.'' Sampras got
his commemorative platter from the Duchess later.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Betz Addie, the doyenne of female champs as the 1946
victor, continues playing regularly in Washington at 80. The widow
of a baseball writer, Bob Addie, who covered the hapless Senators
(long since vanished from the American League) for the Washington
Post, she recalls his colleagues ribbing him. They said Pauline was
the only winning athlete he associated with.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Wood, a lively New Yorker, the champion of 1931, finally
got his Centre Court recognition _ a little late, but ``worth
waiting for.'' Friskily he approached the Duchess, properly bowed
his full head of ashen hair, and you thought he might be asking her
(about 45 years his junior) if she'd like to step out in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   You see, there was no presentation on his great day. No final,
in fact. Wood is the only major champ to win by default. It wasn't
that he appeared on court, looked around, and said, ``Where's
Frank?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I knew the day before that I was the champion. My pal,
Frank Shields _ you know, Brooke Shields's grandfather later in his
life _ was supposed to play me for the title. But he sprained his
ankle in the semis, beating Jean Borotra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, Frank wanted to play, and could have played. You
won't believe this, but the US Davis Cup committee wouldn't let
him. We were going to play the Brits the following weekend in the
semifinals at Paris. Sam Hardy, the captain, and the rest of the
committee, said the Davis Cup came first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine that happening today, expecting a guy to give
up a shot at the Wimbledon title just to be ready for a Cup match?
We lost anyway, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were amateurs then, and the USTA (US Tennis
Association) had the power of life and death over us. Frank and I
thought it was a terrible affront to Wimbledon to leave them
without a men's final, but that's the way it was. We felt we were
co-champs. Wimbledon gave me the small trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   He grins, ``Here's what we did. I told Frank that the next time
we played a grass court final the winner would get the Wimbledon
trophy. That happened the following year here, at the Queen's Club
tourney. I beat him, 12-10, 6-0, and kept the trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, a child prodigy with racket, first played Wimbledon as a
15-year-old (a male record for precocity). ``I wore white knickers
because they said I was too young for long pants. That was 1927. I
drew Rene Lacoste, the champ of 1925, in the first round. We were
on Centre Court, and I got four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Shields and I didn't feel too bad about that
non-final because we were so young. I was 19, he was 21, and at
that age you feel you'll have plenty more chances at the title.''
</P>
<P>
   They never came close. But Wood was on Centre Court again, where
he didn't win the title but got credit for it, anyway.

JUSTICE TRADE OUT OF LEFT FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says no one can keep a secret anymore?
</P>
<P>
   With virtually the entire baseball universe (outside of
Rockerville) focused on the Yankees' pending deal for Sammy Sosa,
the Cleveland Indians slipped in unnoticed and cut their own deal
with the Bombers. Sammy stayed home, where that other Chicago icon,
Jerry Springer, would just love to put the whole dysfunctional Cubs
family squabble on the air. David Justice, who thought he was just
minding his own business and quietly having a fine season for the
Tribe, suddenly found himself decked out in pinstripes, as swift a
costume change as any his ex-wife, Halle Berry, ever had to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came together so quickly,'' Indians assistant general
manager Mark Shapiro said, ``and we were all working so hard the
last couple of days that hardly anyone left their offices, and only
a few people were in the loop _ it caught the world by surprise.
That made it kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who already had failed to coax Juan Gonzalez to
come to the Apple on their terms, were never enchanted with the
idea of giving up five prospects for Sosa. Were they serious about
their pursuit of Sosa? Absolutely. Did their better judgment
override George Steinbrenner's enthusiasm for the Cubs slugger? It
appears so, especially after the Boss summoned all his lieutenants
to Tampa for a summit meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in the end, did not want to make a commitment to a
player who too many in their organization felt was too
one-dimensional to command the kind of ransom the Cubs were asking.
Great hitter, great box office? Without a doubt. But the answer to
all their prayers, when their pitching staff remains in shambles?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the same conclusions, of course, the Red Sox
apparently reached.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Indians received a phone call from the Bombers,
asking if they'd consider dealing slugger Manny Ramirez, the free
agent-to-be. ``They asked if Manny Ramirez was a guy we would talk
about,'' said Shapiro. ``That kind of led to where we ended up. We
just happened to match up very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, by trading Justice, lose a $7 million salary that
gives them extra cash to throw at Ramirez after the season. The
Yankees get a battle-tested veteran with a championship pedigree in
Justice, who won't flinch at the New York spotlight and will slide
gracefully into left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee gives the Indians another corner outfielder to add to an
already sizable collection that includes Richie Sexson, Alex
Ramirez, Russell Branyan, and Jacob Cruz. One or more of that group
can now be turned around and used by the Indians to go out and get
a pitcher by the trading deadline _ assuming they haven't been too
crippled already to make a run this season _ or reload for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also receive two minor league prospects to be named,
their talent level no doubt to be determined in part by how great a
contribution Justice makes to the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   It has all the earmarks of a win-win deal. And Shapiro insists
that no one should regard the trade of Justice as a signal from
Cleveland that the Indians feel they're already out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal gives us a lot of flexibility, but in no way should
there be a perception that we're ready to blow this thing up and
running up the white flag,'' he said. ``There's no way we'll do
that. We're looking at whether we have to retool either this year
or next year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   So-so interest
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who now find themselves in the untenable position of
having a high-priced superstar they no longer want and who no
longer wants to be with them, were hoping for a phone call from Dan
Duquette. But the Sox have not jumped back into the Sosa
sweepstakes, and there was little indication that they would.
Arizona, which had expressed passing interest earlier, called
Friday, and the Cubs had the obligatory scout in place at Bank One
Ballpark that night. But while owner Jerry Colangelo has the
reputation of having deep pockets that rival only Steinbrenner's,
the D-backs are already top-heavy in investments in high-priced
veterans, and may only be trying to gauge how desperate the Cubs
are to rid themselves of Sosa. ``Nobody has a feel yet about how
strong their interest is,'' said one National League executive of
Arizona, ``but I think they're in it.'' With the emergence of
Korean Byung-Hyun Kim as closer, the D-backs may be disposed to
move arbitration-eligible Matt Mantei and perhaps Travis Lee, who
is playing out of position in right field . . . The atmosphere in
Chicago has been so poisoned, incidentally, that one of the game's
most charismatic players is now referred to as ``Sam-me-me-me'' by
one local columnist. ``This might be the time to find out if the
Cubs would take less to get a deal done,'' said one American League
executive. ``But I don't think Dan is trying at this moment.'' Any
deal with the Sox would still almost certainly include Trot Nixon.
``I think Sosa is on the Red Sox' wish list,'' said one party close
to the Sosa dealings, ``but I think there are some extenuating
circumstances that probably would not make Sammy a very good fit in
Boston.'' Hmmm. Is that a hint that the Sox' clubhouse wouldn't be
big enough for Sosa and the brothers Martinez? . . . The Sox are
still looking for hitting help. They've asked about Pittsburgh's
Kevin Young, the 31-year-old first baseman/outfielder who has
driven in 100 or more runs in each of the last two seasons and hit
26 and 27 home runs, respectively, and is on a similar pace this
season (11 home runs and 54 RBIs through 75 games). The Reds, who
could do no better than a split against NL Central-leading St.
Louis last week, are approaching the point where they'll be looking
to next year. They're rapidly approaching the position where they
may be willing to unload everyone on their roster outside of Junior
Griffey, Pokey Reese, Sean Casey, and closer Danny Graves. The Sox
have long had interest in switch-hitting outfielder Dmitri Young,
outfielder Michael Tucker also is available, and GM Jim Bowden can
expect loads of calls if he decides to move pitchers Denny Neagle
and Pete Harnisch. One of the huge questions facing the Reds is
whether icon Barry Larkin returns after this season. Larkin wants
Craig Biggio money to come back; the Reds are already beginning to
prepare for the possibility he may not return and are scouting
second basemen, with the idea that Reese would go to short . . .
Whatever dwindling interest the Red Sox had in Orioles righthander
Scott Erickson all but expired when the Sox bombed him Thursday
night in Fenway Park . . . Count Nixon among Ricky Ledee's
boosters. ``I played against him here and in the minors,'' Nixon
said, ``and he's a real good player. The Yankees' front office
didn't have much faith in him, but give him some security and I
guarantee he'll hit .300 with at least 20 home runs.'' . . .
Pawtucket pitcher Tomo Ohka was one of only two players in the Sox
system to be named to Baseball America's minor league all-star
teams. The other was Single A Augusta outfielder Lew Ford. Former
Northeastern star Carlos Pena was named to the Double A team. He's
playing first base for Tulsa in Texas's system and came into the
weekend batting .306 with 17 home runs and almost an RBI-a-game
pace (70 RBIs in 79 games) . . . One scout on the Brian
Daubach-Curtis Pride-Jeff Frye outfield the Sox used last week:
``Not exactly Ellis Valentine, Warren Cromartie, and Andre Dawson,
was it?'' . . . Next time you're in Asheville, N.C., to see the
Single A Asheville Tourists, the Colorado Rockies' affiliate, be
sure to check out the steaks at Il Paradiso. Tell owner Victor
Giancola that Gary Hughes sent you. Hughes is the longtime scout,
now working for the Reds, who recently signed Brett Gray, the
Frontier League phenom (that's the league that gave us Morgan
Burkhart), who last month struck out 25 batters in a game. Hughes
signed him the next morning. ``Jim Bowden called and said, `What do
you know about this guy?' '' Hughes said. ``I told him, `Nothing,
except he struck out 25 guys last night.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Radke off the market?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there won't be an auction for Brad Radke after all.
Reports out of Minnesota are that new Twins CEO Chris Clouser may
strike a deal on a contract extension for the righthander that will
pay him $36 million over four years. Radke and his agent, Ron
Simon, apparently have made some concessions on their insistence
that Radke have the right to demand a trade after the 2001 season.
Initial indications are that he'll still be able to demand a trade,
but only under certain conditions . . . The Blue Jays were among
the teams that believed they were in a strong position to deal for
Radke. Toronto, by the way, already quietly is making plans to take
a run at free agent Chipper Jones after the season . . . How bad
has the atmosphere gotten around the Cubs during L'Affaire Sosa?
``With this circus going on, it's tough for me to think about
anything else,'' said veteran Mark Grace. ``I wish he would find
out whether he was staying or going. It's killing him and killing
the rest of us.'' . . . Justice's trade to the Yankees is historic
for a dubious reason. His $7 million salary puts the Yankees'
payroll at more than $100 million, making the Bombers the first
team to crack that barrier. Another year, and the Yankee payroll
could zoom over $120 million. Derek Jeter ($10 million) and Mariano
Rivera ($7.25 million) are up for new contracts, and you know the
Yankees will make at least one major free agent signing this winter
. . . The Yankees reportedly have Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling
on the top of their wish list for a deal before the trading
deadline. Schilling gave GM Ed Wade a list of teams to which he'd
accept a trade: the Yankees, Mets, Braves, Indians, Cardinals, and
Diamondbacks. Schilling is signed through next season, and at least
two baseball executives say Schilling just wants some attention . .
. Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said he plans to begin talks with
agent Barry Axelrod after the All-Star break on a new contract for
Jeff Bagwell. McLane insists the club has no intention of trading
the native New Englander, who is eligible to become a free agent
after the 2001 season. ``Anyone who says we're trying to get rid of
Bagwell and (Craig) Biggio, that's absolutely untrue,'' McLane told
the Houston Chronicle last week. ``They are the cornerstones of our
franchise. The White Sox'' _ who have the best record in the majors
_ ``got rid of a lot of players, but they kept Frank Thomas because
he's their cornerstone. I'd take Jeff over Frank Thomas any day.
We're going to start talking about (Bagwell's contract), and we're
going to do everything we can to sign him. I still see Craig and
Jeff finishing their careers in Houston. We're totally committed to
those guys.'' That would kill any fantasies Red Sox fans have of
Bagwell coming home to finish his career. Bagwell has said he'd
like to remain in Houston, but only if the club has a chance to
contend . . . Want a reason why the Mariners were at the top of the
AL West beginning play Saturday? Manager Lou Piniella said he
hasn't had a bullpen like this since the days of the Nasty Boys
(Rob Dibble, Randy Myers, Norm Charlton) in Cincinnati. Kazuhiro
Sasaki had converted his last five save opportunities, Jose
Paniagua had allowed just one run in 17 games, lefthander Arthur
Rhodes had 12 straight scoreless appearances, and the much-maligned
Jose Mesa had an ERA of 1.78 for the month. New pitching coach
Bryan Price is winning kudos from the staff . . . With 128 hits
through 79 games, Angels outfielder Darin Erstad is on a pace for
262, which would break George Sisler's major league record of 257,
set in 1920. No player has had more than 240 hits in a season since
1930 . . . The Cubs, who already were forced to wait until 5 a.m.
for their charter flight from Pittsburgh to Milwaukee Thursday
night, had their night turn even longer when the team bus crashed
into a commuter plane near the runway. ``It shattered our
windshield and glass was flying everywhere,'' said infielder Jeff
Huson. ``Our driver didn't even hit the brakes. Glenallen (Hill)
was screaming. It was hilarious.'' . . . Phillies pitcher Andy
Ashby, subject of numerous trade rumors, didn't make any friends in
Philly after his last start, when he gave up six runs in six
innings, raising his ERA to 6.36. On his way to the dugout, Ashby
reportedly responded to the boos directed his way with a few
profanities. The headline in the Philadelphia Daily News the next
morning: ``Ashby makes an Ash of himself.''

U.S. WINS, ADVANCES TO FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ Chris Oeding, who is the incoming men's
and women's water polo and swimming coach at Long Beach (Calif.)
City College, won't be able to be with his teams when school
begins.
</P>
<P>
   His excuse, though, is valid. When classes begin Aug. 14, Oeding
will be about a month away from concluding his chase for another
trip to the Olympic Games before he can ``hang up my suit and put
on my hat.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Oeding and his teammates continued their march
toward the Sydney Olympics in September by outlasting Italy 8-5 in
a physical game that concluded the team's round-robin play. The
victory propelled the Americans into the championship game in the
UPS International Cup at the U.S. National Aquatics Center.
</P>
<P>
   The physical play, most of which was generated by Italy, was
what the U.S. team (3-1-1) expected in a game that determined who
would play Yugoslavia (4-1-0) in today's 3 p.m. PDT championship
game of one of three pre-Olympic tune-ups for the Americans. The
U.S. had 13 man-advantage situations, converting on only four;
Italy's Alberto Angelini was kicked out of the game early in the
second period for a flagrant foul; Italian assistant coach
Ferdinando Pesci received a red card for arguing and two-meter man
Roberto Calcaterra didn't climb out of the pool afterward until he
was finished chirping at the American players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens all the time with them, especially towards the
end of a tournament,'' said Wolf Wigo, who led the U.S. with three
goals. ``It was average. I didn't see anybody bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was sluggish in the beginning, trailing 1-0 after one
period, but Wigo got things going with consecutive goals late in
the second period. Chi Kredell and Chris Humbert added
second-period goals to give the U.S. a 4-1 halftime lead and the
Italians never got any closer.
</P>
<P>
   Oeding's contribution to the victory didn't show up in a box
score that listed him with one shot attempt and no goals. The
28-year-old Cal graduate, who serves as the team captain, makes his
contributions as a playmaker, defender, tactical leader in the pool
and spiritual voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you can see I'm not one of the biggest guys in the
pool,'' said the 6-foot-1, 185-pound driver, who played for U.S.
National team coach John Vargas at Corona del Mar (Calif.) High and
has scored two times in five UPS Cup games. ``(Vargas) taught me to
really learn and understand the game tactically. I let my
experience help me bring the guys together in the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Oeding's role was just a little bit different as he
scored 11 goals as a member of the U.S. team at the Atlanta
Olympics. Only Humbert, who scored 14 times, had more goals for the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   His trip to the Olympics came three years after his career
nearly ended. Oeding was fresh off finishing a sterling four-year
career at Cal, during which he was a three-time All-American and
three-time member of a NCAA champion. A year later, however, he
suffered rotator cuff damage to his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a career-ending injury,'' Oeding said. ``You could
literally put a pinkie (finger) on my hand and I couldn't push it.
It was a huge struggle for me both mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he wasn't ready to quit. After surgery and nearly a
year of rehab, he was back in the pool working his way to Atlanta.
The Olympic dream didn't end there, though, as a disappointing
seventh-place finish wasn't satisfying enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because I want a medal,'' Oeding said. ``Sure there's
a risk involved by putting your life on hold for four, eight or
even 12 years before you can rejoin real life. It's also exciting
as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a lot of understanding. Oeding credits support
from his wife, Eden, whom he married in 1999, and his family for
understanding the 7:30 a.m. workouts and world travel for
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   And he looks forward to jumping in full time at Long Beach as a
physical education instructor and aquatics coach after spending
last year as a part-time instructor and men's water polo coach at
Orange Coast College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water polo has opened a lot of doors for me,'' Oeding said.
``I was able to attend Berkeley which I would never have been able
to do and have traveled around the world. It's been a fantastic
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   An Olympic medal would be a nice finish to the experience.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA 6, YUGOSLAVIA 4: The game meant little for the
Yugoslavians (4-1-0) in the standings but, for obvious reasons, it
was still an emotional contest. However, it was Croatia (3-2-0)
scoring the game's first four goals and holding on for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA 10, TEAM UPS 6: Omar Amr had two goals and Chris
Aguilera 12 saves for Team UPS (0-5-0) but Australia (2-2-1) swam
away with the win. &QL;

WHITE'S RETURN REMAINS UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The pitching rotation, for better or worse, is
down to five pitchers for five spots. The middle of the order is
never-changing, and in another few weeks even talk of suspensions
should be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. What else could there be?
</P>
<P>
   With time seemingly sorting everything out, Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson began talking about the return of leadoff hitter and
center fielder Devon White. Last week, White disclosed
season-ending surgery wasn't needed on his left shoulder, which
leaves Johnson looking forward to a return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping he can have the kind of effect on us as he did in
Florida,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel for which Johnson is striving is in reference to
1997, when White returned from a calf-muscle pull in late July and
the Marlins went on to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping White returns before August, but he's
still not hitting live pitching, and he still has pain in his left
shoulder. Not only could he give the stagnant top of the lineup
life, but he remains the best center fielder on the roster, team
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With White in the lineup, that gives me more options,''
Johnson said. ``I have a problem resting guys like (Gary) Sheffield
and (Shawn) Green. With injuries and stuff, (Geronimo) Berroa and
White out, that's a lot of depth missing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, before the Dodgers get too gung-ho about White's
return, he's yet to face live pitching. White continues to hit off
a batting tee, and while he's progressing nicely from the left
side, he said he can only hit a few days a week right-handed
because of pain and discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   White suffered a partially torn left rotator cuff diving for a
ball May 2 against Atlanta and has been on the disabled list since.
In his place, Todd Hollandsworth and F.P. Santangelo have played in
a platoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my main focus is trying to get my shoulder strong and
ready, so when I do get back in there, it's not 80 percent or 90
percent,'' White said. ``There's no way I'm going to be 100
percent, but I'll be close. It's going to be like spring training
again for me. The main thing is me being back to help the team
close those four games (in which they trail Arizona).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm itching to come back, but they tell me I just can't come
back because I feel good. I have to come back and say I can play
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   AILING ADAMS: With right-hander Jeff Shaw already on the
disabled list, the last thing the Dodgers need is an injury to
another reliever. But right-handed set-up man Terry Adams continues
to experience stiffness in the back of his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   While Adams maintains it's not enough to land him on the
disabled list, the pain was sufficient enough to merit a cortisone
shot Friday in hopes of relieving the irritation. Johnson said he'd
like to give Adams a rest until Tuesday in San Diego, but Adams
could pitch today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's tightness in the shoulder, it's dangerous,''
Johnson said. ``It's tight for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Even though right-hander Gregg Olson reported no
problems in his Friday rehab stint, he'll be making a few more
before getting consideration for a return to the roster. ``I think
he needs to prove he can get up to two innings, no problem,''
Johnson said. ``I think we have to be that safe, that cautious.''
Olson is hoping to return after the All-Star break. ... Gene Orza,
general counsel for the players association, said decisions have
yet to be made on whether to appeal the suspensions of Sheffield,
Carlos Perez and Santangelo. The players association wants to
appeal Sheffield's five-game suspension, but the union and the
Dodgers hope to talk Perez out of his appeal. Santangelo said he'll
fight his ``all the way to the Supreme Court.'' ... Shortstop Kevin
Elster left in the seventh inning with a sore left hamstring, but
he said he plans on starting the series finale today. ... Johnson
said he'll probably sit struggling Green, which, with Monday's off
day, would give him a pair of days off. Green has started all 79
games, but the last time Johnson thought of sitting him, Green
talked him out of it. &QL;

US WOMEN TOP CANADA AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It doesn't matter where they play _ in Taipei,
in Port-au-Prince, in Sydney, in Winnipeg, in Worcester. When the
US women's soccer team meets Canada, it's a guaranteed KO.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again Saturday night in Muhammad Ali's hometown, as
the world champions got two first-half goals from Shannon MacMillan
and took out their northern neighbors, 4-1, at Papa John's Cardinal
Stadium for the 21st straight time.
</P>
<P>
   The victory earned the US a rematch in Tuesday night's Gold Cup
final in Foxborough with Brazil, which upset China, 3-2, in
overtime in Saturday's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans hadn't lost to Canada since 1986, back when their
makeshift national team played a year's worth of matches in three
July weeks. So they were hardly complaining when the toss of the
coin that decided their group allowed them to duck the Chinese
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians had been blown out twice by the US this spring,
losing, 4-0, in the US Cup and 9-1 in the Pacific Cup. ```We wanted
to prove that the 9-1 score wasn't indicative,'' said Canada keeper
Nicole Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody was disputing that the Americans were by far the
better side. ``We are not at that quality,'' conceded coach Even
Pellerud, who'd coached Norway to the 1995 world title and was
brought in this year to resuscitate the Canadian program after the
team failed to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The US wasted no time affirming the point, storming the Canadian
end from the opening whistle and getting three corner kicks in the
first three minutes. Then, a dozen minutes in, midfielder Nikki
Serlenga lofted a long crossfield ball for MacMillan, who dribbled
across the box and blasted a goal into the upper corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans nearly had another in the 25th minute, when Mia
Hamm dribbled through the Canadian defense and found Tiffeny
Milbrett open at the penalty spot. But keeper Karina LeBlanc (who
alternates with Wright) gathered in Milbrett's bid.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc did the same to Kristine Lilly in the 35th minute, after
Serlenga had launched another cruise missile to MacMillan, who
served Lilly for a point-blank shot straight on.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, though, MacMillan took no chances. Three minutes
later, with three red-shirted defenders around her, she cocked and
fired from 25 yards and caught LeBlanc flatfooted. Then Milbrett,
denied earlier, took a deft through ball from Julie Foudy, sprinted
into the area and fired a 12-yarder past LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
   So it was 3-0 at halftime, but US coach April Heinrichs wasn't
concerned about the score. What she'd wanted was for her side to
play with creative dominance, no matter who was in the lineup. No
issue there Saturday night. The only question was whether the
Americans, who hadn't allowed a goal in the tournament, would hang
up another clean sheet.
</P>
<P>
   That chance ended in the 58th minute, when defender Kate Sobrero
pushed Charmaine Hooper in the penalty area. Hooper, Canada's
all-time scorer, drilled her kick low and left past keeper Siri
Mullinix and the US scoreless skein was snapped at 486 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything else changed. The US got the goal back within
seven minutes as Foudy set up Hamm for a top-of-the-box boomer.
Then it was time for curtain calls, as Foudy came out for Lorrie
Fair and Hamm came out for Susan Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So the US and Brazil, who tied, 0-0, Tuesday at Foxboro Stadium
when keeper Andreia blocked Lilly's last-minute penalty kick, get a
chance to pick up where they left off. And this time, there'll be
no coin flip.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cidinha knocked in a penalty kick in the final minute
of the first overtime to push Brazil past the favored Chinese. The
Brazilians, who lost to China in the Olympic semifinals, had come
from behind to take the lead on Roseli's goal in the 60th minute.
And after the Chinese equalized on Qiu Haiyan's chip shot in the
75th, Brazil had a chance to win on Sissi's free kick in injury
time, which keeper Gao Hong stopped. ``We won the game on Brazilian
hustle,'' declared coach Jose Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, playing without star forward Sun Wen, had struggled
earlier in the tournament, beating Canada only 3-2 and needing two
goals in the final five minutes to put away Mexico, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They struck quickly though, as Shui Qingxia hooked in a free
kick from 20 yards in the 9th minute. But Brazil drew even two
minutes later when Katia da Silva, who scored six goals here
against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, headed in Cidinha's free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides squandered golden chances to take the lead. China's
Pu Wei, alone 10 yards from the goal, shot directly at Andreia in
the 22d minute. And in the 23d, Roseli hit the post on a breakaway
with keeper Gao Hong out.
</P>
<P>
   Roseli came storming back, though, to slam in a rebound after
Gao had blocked her breakaway. And she had another chance to win it
four minutes into overtime but Gao blocked her point-blank shot.
``Whoever has more luck wins the game,'' shrugged Chinese coach Ma
Yuanan.

GOING THROUGH LAKERS WITHDRAWLS? TRY THESE ALTERNATIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An avid reader (OK, my cousin) calls to complain
that the sports year seems to have ended when the Lakers'
championship parade chugged to a halt. He and a guy at the office
had chatted about the Lakers every morning of the regular season
and playoffs, with ``Groundhog Day'' regularity, until 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do now?'' the guy said this week.
</P>
<P>
   What indeed? What's a sports fan to do around here all summer
before the Lakers begin their quest for a repeat?
</P>
<P>
   As you try to get on with life beyond the NBA Finals, it doesn't
help when you start to sink your teeth into Wimbledon, and you come
across this quote from Pete Sampras on the subject of playing
through a leg injury: ``I use Kobe Bryant in the NBA Finals as my
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help when you go to a Dodgers game for the first time
in nearly a month, on the Tuesday that Orel Hershiser is released,
and there's Kobe throwing out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help when Kobe throws as if he could start for
the Dodgers right now.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon, we must give in to Lakers withdrawal. What do we
do then? Here are a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ride your bicycle to San Diego as fast as you can. Next day,
ride your bicycle back from San Diego as fast as you can. Repeat
this, oh, 10 times. Then you'll know what the Tour de France
cyclists go through _ if they didn't have the Alps to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the Tour de France (on TV and on paper, not on a bike),
which turned into the world's greatest annual sports event as soon
as Americans became competitive. You want international flavor?
First-stage leader David Millar was born in Malta, lives in
Biarritz and considers Hong Kong home. But because he used to live
in Scotland, the Reuters news service dubbed him the ``Flying
Scot'' in a headline. Are we sure he didn't change planes in
Burbank once?
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to Dodger Stadium and cheer Kevin Brown ($15 million a
year) and Gary Sheffield ($10 million a year) for giving the
Dodgers their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to Edison Field, just so someday you can say you saw Darin
Erstad in that season when he couldn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tune out NBC during the Olympics to protest its decision to
cover the events on tape-delay. Otherwise, next time it'll be
worse: They'll show everything days or weeks later, and it'll be
like a car race on ESPN2, where you can't tell when it happened and
what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to a movie. Recommended: ``The Life and Times of Hank
Greenberg,'' about the Detroit Tigers Hall of Famer who was a hero
to Jews in the 1930s and '40s. A timely revelation, though off the
topic of the documentary, is that when the Tigers clinched the 1934
pennant, people in Detroit celebrated by turning over streetcars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Read a book. Recommended: Bruce Jenkins' ``A Good Man: The
Pete Newell Story,'' about the great college basketball coach,
worthy rival of John Wooden, and one-time Lakers general manager.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be a conscientious All-Star voter. Study before punching your
ballot. Don't just vote for the local favorites. Don't
automatically vote for the hot first-half hitters either. Think
about who you'd really want at the plate in a big game.
</P>
<P>
   See if we can move the Toronto Blue Jays' Carlos Delgado, the
American League's most productive hitter of the past season and a
half, up from sixth in the voting at first base.
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to Del Mar for a weekend of racing in one of the prettiest
settings in sports. Bring $500. Bet $10. You'll need the rest for
dinner and a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to the local tennis tournaments (men at UCLA in July,
women in Manhattan Beach in August). Ask other spectators why they
show up for these things in tennis outfits. Perhaps they anticipate
an announcement from the chair ``Miss Sanchez Vicario has withdrawn
due to injury. Would Mrs. Herman Cavandish be kind enough to
replace her in tonight's featured match?''
</P>
<P>
   -- Read an encyclopedia so you'll be prepared for Dennis
Miller's allusions on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to a minor-league game. Triple-A is the most entertaining
level, because you see familiar faces on the way down as well as
prospects on the way up. But the L.A. area's five Single-A teams
have attractive little ballparks where you might get as close to
the action as, well, Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Go to a Long Beach Summer League basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   -- Submit your application for the Clippers head-coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reserve your seats for the Lakers opener. &QL;

YANKS BEAT TAMPA BAY, 6-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Jorge Posada and Orlando Hernandez were
dressed in street clothes and waiting at the clubhouse door when
their teammates came through, in single file, after their emotional
victory Saturday. Roger Clemens saw Posada and playfully
shadowboxed, an allusion to the catcher's short but nasty brawl in
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to go, Duque,'' other Yankees shouted to Hernandez, who
threw five and two-thirds innings after not knowing if his elbow
trouble would prevent him from pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees want to build on this 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay.
Hernandez hopes to wake up Sunday and feel no pain in his elbow,
and come back and pitch well again in five days. Perhaps Tino
Martinez, who had a three-run double to finish off the Devil Rays,
will put together more runs batted in in the days to come. Maybe
the passion that Posada's fight generated will fuel a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are a team needing a spark and maybe this was it.
``We needed this,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager said, ``It was a lift for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner seethed over Friday's 6-4 loss to Tampa Bay
when he had lunch Saturday with Torre and General Manager Brian
Cashman. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, asked
questions, demanded answers and said afterward that he was
accepting the assurances of Torre and Cashman that the team was
good enough to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Translated: Those guys tell me we're good enough, and they had
better be right.
</P>
<P>
   They all agree that there is a need for pitching, the need for
Hernandez and Clemens to come back this weekend _ Clemens pitches
Sunday after coming off the disabled list _ and revitalize the
rotation that has been so inconsistent that it has placed a strain
on the bullpen. There were 13 instances in the Yankees' last 43
games that the starting pitcher did not finish the fifth inning.
Torre dug deep into his bullpen again Friday, and Saturday he held
back David Cone from his usual bullpen session, just in case
Hernandez's elbow trouble surfaced again.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque felt good warming up _ ``He felt strong,'' Posada said
_ and contentiousness yanked Hernandez back into the world of
pitching in the big leagues. After Tampa Bay's Russ Johnson stroked
a leadoff double in the third, Hernandez became annoyed when Randy
Winn called time out as Hernandez began to throw the ball.
Hernandez flipped the ball high into the air and shot a glance at
Winn, then fired a fastball inside, forcing him to jump out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys started yelling at him'' from the Tampa Bay
dugout, Posada said. Hernandez looked over his left shoulder at the
Devil Rays' dugout and continued to stare, until Posada ran out and
nudged Hernandez in the lower back with his glove, turning him away
from the bench jockeys and back to the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The at-bat developed into a war of wills. Hernandez looked in
for the sign, then stepped away from the rubber. Winn called time
out. Hernandez shook off four signs and then stepped off the mound.
El Duque was determined to control the pace of the at-bat,
responding to every move Winn made, like a debater wanting to get
in the last word. Winn tried to check his swing on a 2-1 pitch, but
Umpire C.B. Bucknor called a strike, then ejected the third-base
coach, Billy Hatcher, igniting a long argument. Winn's at-bat took
about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Winn was ready to hit, Hernandez shook off four signs
again, stepped away from the rubber, then threw a fastball and
prompted Winn to fly out to center field. In this way, Hernandez
and the Yankees gripped a 2-1 lead through six innings. Hernandez
(7-6) allowed one run on four hits over five and two-thirds
innings.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at second and third and one out in the Yankees
seventh, Tampa Bay Manager Larry Rothschild ordered an intentional
walk of Posada to get to Martinez, and the left-hander Mark Guthrie
moved ahead in the count, 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie spun a low breaking ball over the plate and Martinez
pulled a soft liner into the right-field corner. All three runners
scored, padding the Yankees' lead to 5-1. After reaching second on
his double, Martinez hustled to third when a throw got away, and
Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third-base coach, patted Martinez on
the helmet. It was the second time this season that Martinez had
three RBI in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith struck out to lead off the bottom of the
seventh, and when Posada stepped in front of home plate to whip the
ball to third, Smith pushed Posada discreetly with the barrel of
his bat. Posada turned and jabbed the ball into Smith's side, and
Smith and Posada immediately came together, wrestling each other to
the ground. Posada was quickly on his back, with Smith flailing
away with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   The benches cleared, and Posada and Smith were pulled apart.
Posada kept pushing his tongue into his cheek, as if to feel for a
cut. Both players were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to throw the ball to third, and he just
shoved me with his forearm,'' said Posada, who said he was not
hurt. ``I didn't like that. I guess he can't strike out. So I
pushed him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``I struck out and was walking away and I bumped
him. I don't know if he thought it was on purpose or whatever, and
he shoved me. Somebody pushes you _ are you just going to walk away
from it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with anybody. I'm a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both face the possibility of suspension from Major League
Baseball's primary enforcement official, Frank Robinson. ``I have a
great deal of respect for Frank Robinson,'' Torre said. ``I would
certainly like him to remember how many fights he was in and not be
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torre seemed happy, pleased with the game; it was a good day
all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, was scratched from
the starting lineup because of an ear infection. He might miss
Sunday's game as well.

US WOMEN TOP CANADA AGAIN 
 
ORRECTING DAY OF FINAL  
 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It doesn't matter where they play _ in Taipei,
in Port-au-Prince, in Sydney, in Winnipeg, in Worcester. When the
US women's soccer team meets Canada, it's a guaranteed KO.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again Saturday night in Muhammad Ali's hometown, as
the world champions got two first-half goals from Shannon MacMillan
and took out their northern neighbors, 4-1, at Papa John's Cardinal
Stadium for the 21st straight time.
</P>
<P>
   The victory earned the US a rematch in Monday night's Gold Cup
final in Foxborough with Brazil, which upset China, 3-2, in
overtime in Saturday's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans hadn't lost to Canada since 1986, back when their
makeshift national team played a year's worth of matches in three
July weeks. So they were hardly complaining when the toss of the
coin that decided their group allowed them to duck the Chinese
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians had been blown out twice by the US this spring,
losing, 4-0, in the US Cup and 9-1 in the Pacific Cup. ```We wanted
to prove that the 9-1 score wasn't indicative,'' said Canada keeper
Nicole Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody was disputing that the Americans were by far the
better side. ``We are not at that quality,'' conceded coach Even
Pellerud, who'd coached Norway to the 1995 world title and was
brought in this year to resuscitate the Canadian program after the
team failed to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The US wasted no time affirming the point, storming the Canadian
end from the opening whistle and getting three corner kicks in the
first three minutes. Then, a dozen minutes in, midfielder Nikki
Serlenga lofted a long crossfield ball for MacMillan, who dribbled
across the box and blasted a goal into the upper corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans nearly had another in the 25th minute, when Mia
Hamm dribbled through the Canadian defense and found Tiffeny
Milbrett open at the penalty spot. But keeper Karina LeBlanc (who
alternates with Wright) gathered in Milbrett's bid.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc did the same to Kristine Lilly in the 35th minute, after
Serlenga had launched another cruise missile to MacMillan, who
served Lilly for a point-blank shot straight on.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, though, MacMillan took no chances. Three minutes
later, with three red-shirted defenders around her, she cocked and
fired from 25 yards and caught LeBlanc flatfooted. Then Milbrett,
denied earlier, took a deft through ball from Julie Foudy, sprinted
into the area and fired a 12-yarder past LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
   So it was 3-0 at halftime, but US coach April Heinrichs wasn't
concerned about the score. What she'd wanted was for her side to
play with creative dominance, no matter who was in the lineup. No
issue there Saturday night. The only question was whether the
Americans, who hadn't allowed a goal in the tournament, would hang
up another clean sheet.
</P>
<P>
   That chance ended in the 58th minute, when defender Kate Sobrero
pushed Charmaine Hooper in the penalty area. Hooper, Canada's
all-time scorer, drilled her kick low and left past keeper Siri
Mullinix and the US scoreless skein was snapped at 486 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything else changed. The US got the goal back within
seven minutes as Foudy set up Hamm for a top-of-the-box boomer.
Then it was time for curtain calls, as Foudy came out for Lorrie
Fair and Hamm came out for Susan Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So the US and Brazil, who tied, 0-0, Tuesday at Foxboro Stadium
when keeper Andreia blocked Lilly's last-minute penalty kick, get a
chance to pick up where they left off. And this time, there'll be
no coin flip.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cidinha knocked in a penalty kick in the final minute
of the first overtime to push Brazil past the favored Chinese. The
Brazilians, who lost to China in the Olympic semifinals, had come
from behind to take the lead on Roseli's goal in the 60th minute.
And after the Chinese equalized on Qiu Haiyan's chip shot in the
75th, Brazil had a chance to win on Sissi's free kick in injury
time, which keeper Gao Hong stopped. ``We won the game on Brazilian
hustle,'' declared coach Jose Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, playing without star forward Sun Wen, had struggled
earlier in the tournament, beating Canada only 3-2 and needing two
goals in the final five minutes to put away Mexico, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They struck quickly though, as Shui Qingxia hooked in a free
kick from 20 yards in the 9th minute. But Brazil drew even two
minutes later when Katia da Silva, who scored six goals here
against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, headed in Cidinha's free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides squandered golden chances to take the lead. China's
Pu Wei, alone 10 yards from the goal, shot directly at Andreia in
the 22d minute. And in the 23d, Roseli hit the post on a breakaway
with keeper Gao Hong out.
</P>
<P>
   Roseli came storming back, though, to slam in a rebound after
Gao had blocked her breakaway. And she had another chance to win it
four minutes into overtime but Gao blocked her point-blank shot.
``Whoever has more luck wins the game,'' shrugged Chinese coach Ma
Yuanan.

&HT;    WHITE ABALONE ON BRINK OF EXTINCTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Removing unnecessary word in 16th paragraph) (With BC-ABALONE-RESCUE-LADN, both for use by NYTimes News Service
clients)

 &LR;
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ In its heyday, white abalone dotted the ocean
floor in the prime fishing grounds off the Ventura County coast and
numbered in the millions from Point Conception to Baja.
</P>
<P>
   The sea snail was common fare on California's menus, offered
deep fried or in sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than 2,540 remaining, white abalone is nearly
extinct. The public has until Wednesday to comment on a National
Marine Fisheries Service plan to list the mollusk as an endangered
species, the first time a marine invertebrate would receive the
classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is listed, it's sort of a milestone in our thinking
about the ocean,'' said Ian Taniguchi, a marine biologist with the
California Department of Fish and Game. ``For the longest time,
probably throughout recorded history, there has been a sort of
mentality that things that come from the ocean are infinite, are
non-exhaustible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception we could ever fish an invertebrate species to
extinction is sort of being realized now with the white abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The NMFS had already designated the white abalone as a candidate
for the endangered list in 1997. Last year, several environmental
groups - including the Channels Island Marine Resource Institute in
Port Hueneme - petitioned the agency to include it it under the
Endangered Species Act. And state Fish and Game currently is
working on listing the species under California's Endangered
Species Act, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups hope to bring more attention - and,
potentially, money for restoration and recovery - by classifying
the abalone as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties also would be greater for those who illegally harvest
the species, with violators facing a $100,000 fine and a year in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The white variety is among eight species of abalone that live
along the West Coast. It is the deepest dwelling, found on
low-relief rocks covered with algae at 80 to 200 feet, where the
water temperature is cooler.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, divers harvested thousands of pounds of the
melon-sized invertebrate - its shell lined with mother of pearl -
for the local and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always been a delicacy from Native Americans
onward,'' said Tom McCormick, director of the Channel Islands
Marine Resource Institute. ``They've always been perceived as
something exotic, very delicious and very California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1950s after the war, when scuba diving becoming
available and expanding to new areas, you would hear reports of
hundreds of thousand of abalone from dives,'' he said. ``There are
pictures showing mountains of abalone as tall as two-story
buildings at processing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people in the 1940s and 1950s, the $1.50 abalone sandwich
was very common. That memory is gone for younger people unless they
are out sport diving in Northern California to get the red
abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The white abalone, favored for its tender meat, commanded a
higher price at market, up to 20 percent more than the red abalone,
which was the main staple of the fishing industry, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1977, more than 95 percent of the commercial white
abalone harvest took place, with a peak catch of 144,000 pounds in
1972, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. A common
spot for catches was off the Ventura County coast - east of Santa
Cruz Island to Anacapa Island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years the white abalone population went from an
estimated high of 2.22 million to 4.24 million to 1,613 to 2,540 -
a 99 percent decline, the NMFS reported.
</P>
<P>
   That drop prompted state Fish and Game officials to close
fishing for white, pink and green abalone in 1996. A year later,
they imposed a moratorium on commercial and sport catches on all
abalone species found south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although harvesting was banned, the white abalone has not
rebounded, marine biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Overfishing has reduced the density of the population, making
reproduction practically nil for the slow-growing gastropods, which
have a life span of 30 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both male and female abalone are broadcast spawners, meaning
they release their eggs and sperm into the water to make contact by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be within a few yards of each other to have
successful fertilization,'' McCormick said. ``If they are spaced in
order of 1 to 1 miles apart, in most cases these animals won't
successfully reproduce because they are so far apart. So they will
die of old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Abalone move slowly on a single foot along the ocean bottom, and
adults have extremely limited movements. With its single, flattened
spiral shell, the species averages five to eight inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Research in the 1970s showed a potential of one white abalone
per square meter in its natural habitat - today it's maybe five
abalone per hectare or 10,000 square meters, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Locations such as San Clemente, Catalina Island and Anacapa
Island, where the greatest number of white abalone was removed in
the 1970s, were surveyed last fall with disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 157 in 10 days of looking,'' said Dan Richards, a
marine biologist at Channel Islands National Park. ``That is not
very good. Seventy hours of prime time searching over really good
habitat - and that was all we could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Although human consumption is largely to blame for the white
abalone's demise, some experts said a bacterial infection also
could have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Withering syndrome, which shrivels the abalone in its shell, has
decimated 99 percent of the black abalone, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   First detected in the late 1980s in Southern California waters,
the syndrome is moving north and has reached Point Conception, in
Santa Barbara County, he said. The syndrome, which affects the
abalone's digestive glands, also has been found in pink, red, green
and white abalone.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

   NEW YORK _ A tale of history tinged with mystery caught the
attention of the Orange County, N.Y., town of Southfields on
Saturday, as two amateur historians declared that in their midst
(sort of) lay the bones (maybe) of a heretofore unknown descendant
of Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The local paper, The Times Herald Record of Middletown,
announced on its front page on Saturday that the historians, Roger
A. King of Monroe and Robert Brennan of Pine Bush, might have found
the younger Jefferson's grave in an old Orange County cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The paper cited the possible discovery of two pieces of a
tombstone, one belonging to a man named Thomas Jefferson, who had
died in 1855, the other reading ``son of Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings'' _ the slave long believed to have borne children by him.
</P>
<P>
   King and Brennan called a news conference to repeat their
findings Saturday afternoon at the Red Apple Restaurant, on Route
17 in Southfields. Speaking to about 35 people, over the clatter of
cutlery and coffee cups, they described parts of their theory: that
Sally Hemings gave birth in 1809 to an eighth child, a son, with
Thomas Jefferson. And that the boy, Thomas Jr., was brought north
soon afterward to New York, out of slavery, by Elizabeth Monroe,
who later became the nation's fifth first lady and who was a friend
of Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth child of Jefferson and his slave mistress, and a New
Yorker, at that? Big news, if true: in the long-running debate over
whether Jefferson and Hemings had children together, and if so how
many, historians usually stop at seven. In 1998, an article in the
scientific journal Nature reported that DNA tests provided
compelling evidence that Jefferson fathered at least one of
Hemings' children.
</P>
<P>
   King and Brennan presented as evidence two sisters who claimed
to be descendants of the newly discovered Thomas Jefferson Jr., who
recalled how one of their uncles had researched the family tree _
then stopped, mysteriously. There were rumors in the family, the
women said, that he had discovered the connection between Jefferson
and his mistress, and the uncle did not want to know more.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a few dozen people, including a handful of reporters
and photographers, walked from the restaurant to the John Coffey
Jr. Cemetery, a small, lumpy knoll with stones in various stages of
disrepair. There, they saw the stone that read ``In memory of
Thomas Jefferson who died April 25, 1855 Ae 46 Yrs &AMP; 12 Ds.''
</P>
<P>
   But the piece of stone identifying him as a son of Jefferson and
Hemings was nowhere to be found. The same was true of King, who
was, it turned out, one of the few people around claiming to have
actually seen the second half of the gravestone. He had given
rubbings of the stone to Brennan, who has not seen the actual
stone, and Chris Sonne, the historian for the town of Tuxedo, who
had accompanied King to the graveyard Friday for a fruitless search
for the second piece of the stone.
</P>
<P>
   After King left the restaurant for parts unknown, Sonne said,
``I have every reason to believe it to exist, because you can't
fake an etching, but I am really somewhat mystified.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson scholars reached by telephone Saturday were not about
to jump on the next plane to Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the last person to say anything is impossible, but
it strikes me as very unlikely,'' said Annette Gordon-Reed, a
professor at New York Law School and author of ``Thomas Jefferson
and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University Press of
Virginia, 1997). The child, she said, would have had to have been
conceived a month and a half after Hemings gave birth to her son
Eston, and there was no later child listed in Jefferson's farm
book, which lists Hemings' other children.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Reed said the discovery of the tombstone raises the
unlikely possibility of there being three Jefferson sons named
Thomas: Thomas Eston, who went by his middle name; the Southfields
Thomas; and Thomas Woodson, some of whose descendants claim the
relation, though DNA testing has cast doubt on it.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of the memoirs of Madison Hemings,
whom Gordon-Reed considers one of the four known children of
Jefferson and Hemings (the others were Beverly, Harriet, and
Eston.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He lists his siblings, and Eston, he says, is the last one,''
said Gordon-Reed, who is now writing a biography of the Hemings
family. ``Why wouldn't he know this kid? He would have been
somebody he grew up with, just like his other siblings.''
</P>
<P>
   And family tradition does not count for much, she added. ``If
all the people who claim to be descendants of Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings really were,'' Gordon-Reed said, ``she would have had
hundreds of children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be possible, but there's nothing that indicates if it's
true,'' she said. ``Right now, there's nothing in the documentary
record that supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Ellis, a history professor at Mount Holyoke College
and author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1997) also said the new claims
appeared doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's listen to what the men have to say, but the historical
evidence we do have doesn't seem to take a shape that makes this
very likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been in any of the record _ either in the
written or oral traditions, on the white or black side of the
argument that has been going on in the longest running soap opera
in American history _ any previous claim that a child was born
after Eston.''

   &UR; BLIND EYE: The Terrifying Story of a Doctor Who Got Away With
Murder &LR;  By James B. Stewart. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14. A
journalist tells the story of a doctor suspected of killing at
least 35 hospital patients, and indicts the medical authorities who
failed to protect the public. Last year in The New York Times Book
Review, Lance Morrow called this a ``chillingly thorough and
superbly matter-of-fact ... reconstruction that has the fascination
of an acutely observed and troubling novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEMENTALS: Stories of Fire and Ice &LR;  By A.S. Byatt. Vintage
International, $12. A British writer whose work explores the
intersection of aesthetics and morality spins tales in which
stolid, blinkered Europeans from the North become either imprisoned
or re-energized by the earthier South and the warmer-blooded people
(mostly artists) who live there. In Byatt's eyes, it is an
unforgivable crime not to be curious about a world ``full of light
and life.'' ``Byatt's prose is capacious yet exquisite,'' Fernanda
Eberstadt wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999, and this
collection is infused with ``the throwaway gleams of a writer at
the height of her powers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DISTANCE TO THE MOON: A Road Trip Into the American Dream &LR; 
By James Morgan. Riverhead, $12.95. The author explores America's
obsessive love affair with cars and car culture as he drives from
Miami to Portland, Ore., in a shiny new Porsche. ``The human case
for the automobile has never been more persuasively presented,''
Bruce McCall wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF: Notes on Returning to America After
Twenty Years Away &LR; , by Bill Bryson (Broadway, $14), is a collection
of humorous dispatches written for a British newspaper about the
author's bumpy re-entry into his native culture with his English
wife and four children. ``The best columns are those in which the
author discards his hapless persona and allows his natural
impatience and intelligence out of their cages,'' Elizabeth Gleick
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT &LR;  By Ernest Hemingway. Edited by Patrick
Hemingway. Scribner, $13. This fictional chronicle of an African
safari, which was abandoned by Hemingway and edited by one of his
sons, is a pale imitation of the writer's best work, James Wood
wrote last year. Nonetheless, ``there is a kind of mottled glamour,
made up of bullying integrity and nonsense, of truth and falsity,
which always makes the least of Hemingway's books compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1185 PARK AVENUE: A Memoir &LR;  By Anne Roiphe. Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $13. Avoiding sentimentality and self-pity in favor of an
emotionally mature distance, the author tells of growing up Jewish
in the 1940s and '50s with everything she could want except her
parents' affection. ``Roiphe gives her memoir the dramatic
vividness of a novel,'' Karen Lehrman wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLES FROM THE DESERT: Selected Stories &LR;  By Savyon Liebrecht.
Feminist Press, $13.95. This collection of 12 stories originally
published in Israel focuses on the fault lines between secular and
Orthodox Jews, bereft parents and their torn children. ``At her
best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors
like Amos Oz,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOTHER OF PEARL &LR;  By Melinda Haynes. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $13.95. This first novel revolves around a large cast of
characters in sleepy Petal, Miss., in the 1950s, including Even
Grade, a black orphan named for a road, and Valuable Korner, a
fatherless white girl named after a real estate sign. Last year the
reviewer Roy Hoffman admired the book's ``profuse and vigorous''
language.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE III: A Personal History &LR;  By Christopher Hibbert. Basic
Books, $18. As portrayed here, George III (1738-1820) was a
churchgoing, monogamous, mostly competent ruler before going
famously mad. His oldest son, however, George IV (1762-1830), the
subject of  &UR; PRINCE OF PLEASURE: The Prince of Wales and the Making
of the Regency &LR; , by Saul David (Grove, $15), led the field in
scandalous behavior at a time when London was the world's capital
for debauchery. ```George III' and `Prince of Pleasure' make a
simply unputdownable theater of the personal and political
absurd,'' Valentine Cunningham wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUDINI GIRL &LR;  By Martyn Bedford. Vintage Crime, $13. After
his Irish girlfriend dies in a mysterious train accident, a British
magician discovers that she led a double life and sets out to
unravel her carefully hidden past. Last year the reviewer Carey
Harrison called this ``a masterfully choreographed'' erotic
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POACHERS: Stories &LR;  By Tom Franklin. HarperPerennial, $12. Set
in lower Alabama, these mordant tales feature sympathetic good old
boys stuck in bad situations, frayed marriages and dead-end jobs.
``With this satisfying collection'' Franklin ``establishes himself
as one of the region's more interesting emerging voices,'' Bruce
Barcott wrote last year.
