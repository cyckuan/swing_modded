Demonstrators protest against Indonesian president

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Several hundred students and
supporters of an opposition party staged a noisy rally against
Indonesia's president Wednesday as discontent grew over rising food
prices.
	   The protest, the latest in a series as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in three decades, was held in the second
largest city, Surabaya, during an official visit by President B.J.
Habibie.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police were deployed across the
city, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, after students
said they would stage a big march against Habibie.
	   Wednesday's protest was smaller than expected because of tight
security.
	   Witnesses said students from several universities, along with
supporters of prominent opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri,
gathered in the center of the city, about 100 meters (yards) from
the office of the governor of East Java.
	   There were no reports of arrest or injuries, although some
witnesses said members of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing
vehicles.
	   Habibie was scheduled to visit the governor's office after
making a speech at a sports stadium to mark Indonesia's national
sports day.
	   Wednesday's protest came a day after police and troops used
sticks, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of students from the
grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta.
	   Two students underwent surgery after they were allegedly stabbed
by bayonets.
	   Large numbers of security personnel remained stationed around
the Parliament building on Wednesday. But there was no sign of
trouble.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Floods have hit 15 Thai provinces
causing more than 100 million baht (dlrs 2.43 million) in damages
to roads, bridges and public buildings, The Nation newspaper
reported Wednesday.

Minister calls for death penalty as looting and unrest continue:

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As looting and protests continue in
Indonesia, a senior Cabinet minister has said those caught
disrupting vital food supplies should be executed.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Justice Minister
Muladi as saying a 39-year-old law to protect the distribution of
rice and other food should be invoked.
	   ``I think it is important for us to think about using it to
enforce the rule of law,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Prices of food, particularly for rice, have skyrocketed as
Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Food shortages have also been reported despite concerted efforts
by the government to import rice and sell it at subsidized prices.
	   The problem has been compounded by the effects of a crippling
drought last year. There also been claims that some people have
hoarded rice or have resold subsidized grain to neighboring
countries.
	   Until recently Indonesia prided itself on being self-sufficient
in the production of rice, the main staple food for its 202 million
people.
	   On Tuesday, the government said it would import 3.4 million tons
of rice in the fiscal year 1999-2000.
	   Police and troops continued to patrol the streets of the Central
Java town of Kemumen, about 350 kilometers (218 miles) southeast of
Jakarta, Wednesday after mobs looted and burned about 50 shops
owned by the ethnic Chinese minority on Monday and Tuesday.
	   In the third-largest city Medan on Sumatra island, mobs have
been stopping and pillaging trucks carrying foodstuffs from a
nearby port, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Police and troops used sticks, shields and tear gas to break up
a demonstration Tuesday at the Parliament in Jakarta by students
angered by rising food prices.
	   A heavy security presence remained in place at the legislature
on Wednesday, although there was no sign of trouble.
	   Also Wednesday, students in Surabaya, in the second largest city
on Java island, staged a noisy protest against visiting President
B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie made a speech at a ceremony marking National Sports day
in the city. Troops and police were on the streets.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Republika reported that a widow
committed suicide by setting herself and her house afire. She had
complained to neighbors that she could no longer afford to feed her
family.

Beijing executes six for armed robbery, murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Six people sentenced to death for armed robbery
and murder have been executed at the order of Beijing's High Court,
the official newspaper Beijing Morning Post reported Wednesday.
	   Five of those executed Tuesday were convicted of using guns and
other weapons to rob people in their homes, the report said. The
sixth was found guilty of murder, it said.
	   Executions in China are usually carried out with a gunshot to
the back of the head. Although the number of executions appears to
be declining, China still executes more people than any other
country.
	   According to Amnesty International, China sentenced at least
3,152 people to death and executed at least 1,876 last year, a
decline from an unusually high total of 4,367 executions in 1996.

 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A child's voice plaintively called out
``Mon-ee-ka'' in the match's waning moments, but it had little more
effect than any of Monica Seles' shots did against the chilling
precision of Martina Hingis.
	   The top-seeded Hingis made just 16 unforced errors in a 6-4, 6-4
win over No. 6 Seles on a cool Tuesday night at the U.S. Open to
reach her ninth straight Grand Slam semifinal.
	   Hingis closed out the match with her second ace, then jumped for
joy and pumped her right arm in the air. The match included several
long, fascinating rallies in which both players made acrobatic
saves.
	   Seles had defeated Hingis in their only two previous matches
this year, including the semifinals of the French Open. But Hingis
was nearly perfect Tuesday night, losing just seven points on her
serve in the first set.
	   ``I was a little worried going into the match because I wasn't
playing my best and I lost two times to Monica before this,''
Hingis said. ``I was playing well tonight, my serve was very good
and I didn't make any mistakes. I was on a good wave.''
	   The temperature was just 66 during the match, and a 21 mph (34
kph) wind that swirled around the Arthur Ashe Stadium court made it
feel like 55 Fahrenheit (13 Celsius).
	   Hingis will face No. 3 Jana Novotna in the semifinals. Novotna,
the Wimbledon champion, advanced earlier Tuesday with a 6-2, 6-3
win over Patty Schnyder, who ousted Steffi Graf on Sunday.
	   When it came down to pure tennis, and not the mind games of the
night before, Andre Agassi simply couldn't handle the speed or
power of an opponent who rallied from a big deficit in the final
set.
	   Karol Kucera slowly regained his confidence while winning five
straight games as he closed out a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-3
victory that took two days to complete because of rain.
	   The win sent No. 9 Kucera toward a quarterfinal match against
top-seeded Pete Sampras, while No. 8 Agassi failed to advance
beyond the fourth round in any Grand Slam tournament this year.
	   A day after the players glared and postured at each other across
the net, there was little emotion as an embattled Kucera saved two
break points that would have given Agassi a 3-0 lead in the final
set.
	   ``Last night it just got to the point where it was so
competitive we could have put on boxing gloves, thrown darts, we
could have done anything not to do with tennis,'' Agassi said.
``Today was all about tennis.''
	   Joining Sampras and Kucera in the quarterfinals was No. 3
Patrick Rafter, the defending champion, as well as Carlos Moya,
Mark Philippoussis and Swedes Jonas Bjorkman, Magnus Larsson and
Thomas Johansson.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old
home-run record, hitting his 62nd of the season Tuesday night in
the St. Louis Cardinals' 6-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs.
	   McGwire, playing in his 145th game of the season, connected in
the fourth inning off Steve Trachsel (14-8), setting off an
11-minute delay caused by the celebration. Maris hit No. 61 when he
set in the record in 1961.
	   Kent Mercker (10-11) allowed two runs and eight hits in six
innings, and Juan Acevedo got his seventh save. Chicago remained
tied with the New York Mets in the NL wild-card race.
 &UR; Phillies 16, Mets 4
	   In Philadelphia, Rico Brogna, Kevin Sefcik and Bobby Estalella
each homered twice.
	   Philadelphia's Marlon Anderson added a homer in his first major
league at-bat as the Phillies set a club record with seven home
runs off four pitchers. It was the most runs for Philadelphia since
1995 and the most home runs off the Mets since July 11, 1967, at
Chicago.
	   Paul Byrd (3-2) allowed three runs and nine hits in 5 2-3
innings against his former team. Hideo Nomo (6-12) was tagged for
seven runs and six hits in 2 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Astros 13, Reds 7
	   In Houston, Jeff Bagwell hit his first career grand slam and
tied a career high with six RBIs as Houston (92-53) tied Atlanta
for the NL's best record.
	   Sean Bergman (12-7) allowed four runs and eight hits in seven
innings. Jason Bere (1-1) was tagged for six runs and six hits in 1
1-3 innings.
 &UR; Expos 6, Braves 3
	   In Montreal, Greg Maddux (17-8) struggled for the sixth straight
start, allowing all six runs _ five earned _ and six hits in seven
innings. Maddux has given up 24 earned runs in his last six starts,
a span of 39 innings, and his ERA has climbed from 1.53 to 2.20.
	   Miguel Batista (3-5) allowed three runs _ two earned _ and four
hits in six innings. Ugueth Urbina got four outs for his 29th
save.
 &UR; Pirates 8, Brewers 7
	   In Pittsburgh, Jose Guillen blooped a two-run, two-out single
off Eric Plunk (0-2) into right field in the eighth inning as
Pittsburgh rallied from a 7-0 deficit.
	   Jeromy Burnitz and Marquis Grissom homered as the Brewers built
their lead. Mike Williams (4-2) pitched a scoreless eighth for the
victory and Rich Loiselle finished for his 18th save.

ASEAN transport ministers see Singapore's new traffic system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian transport ministers opened
their annual meeting Wednesday in Singapore, where they can view
the week-old Electronic Road Pricing system that controls downtown
traffic during peak hours by automatic deductions from cash cards
in each vehicle.
	   Singapore has been in the forefront of managing traffic and
discouraging road use, making it one of the least congested Asian
cities.
	   The city-state has been able to implement strong anti-car
measures such as high ownership prices and high user fees because
of ``the strong political will of our government and the
cooperation and support of our people,'' Communications Minister
Mah Bow Tan told fellow transport ministers in his opening address.
	   The nine ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations are meeting through Thursday with researchers, government
officials and transportation professionals to discuss ways of
managing traffic, curbing noise and pollution and easing
congestion.
	   As host, Singapore had a chance to show off the Electronic Road
Pricing system that went into effect in the downtown business
district and on major highways last week. It replaced a 23-year-old
system that involved posting guards in huts by the roadside to note
down the license plates of cars that did not have inner-city
permits.
	   The new system is handled electronically. Cameras over the
roadway take pictures of vehicles. Computers subtract charges for
the area, vehicle size and time of day and dispatch bills to those
who don't have the cash card devices installed.
	   Controlling traffic congestion is good for business,
Communications Minister Mah said. The Land Transport Authority has
determined that the potential annual cost of a 30-minute delay
every day by every motorist would be 420 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 240 million).
	   One negative effect for business travelers and tourists in
Singapore is that it has become even more difficult to get a taxi
in the Central Business District in the morning and evening. Taxi
drivers said last week they would not drive into the downtown area
unless they already had a customer who wanted to go there, because
the drivers do not want to pay the entry fee themselves.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ The New York Yankees clinched a tie for the AL
East title as David Cone became baseball's first 19-game winner,
outdueling Pedro Martinez for a 3-2 win Tuesday night over the
Boston Red Sox.
	   The matchup between Cy Young award contenders was all it was
expected to be.
	   Through seven innings, it was tied 1-1 as Cone (19-5) had
allowed just two hits and Martinez (18-5) only three. At that
point, Cone had 11 strikeouts and Martinez eight.
	   But Martinez' control deserted him in the eighth, when the
Yankees scored twice and went on to break a three-game losing
streak with their first win since getting their 100th last Friday
night.
	   Cone walked none, faced one batter over the minimum and allowed
just three balls out of the infield.
	   Mariano Rivera got the last five outs for his 34th save,
allowing a run in the ninth on Troy O'Leary's sacrifice fly. Rivera
struck out Darren Bragg with the bases loaded to end the game.
 &UR; Rangers 7, Royals 6 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Ivan Rodriguez's two-run single with one
out in the ninth inning lifted Texas to its 38th come-from-behind
victory.
	   Mark McLemore drew a leadoff walk from Jeff Montgomery (2-5).
Pinch-hitter Luis Alicea singled him to third before Rusty Greer
had an RBI double to make it 6-5. Juan Gonzalez was intentionally
walked to load the bases. After Will Clark struck out, Rodriguez
singled down the right-field line.
	   Danny Patterson (2-5) got three outs for the victory.
	   The Royals had 15 hits, including three from Jeremy Giambi, who
hit his first major league homer, but left seven men on base in the
first three innings.
 &UR; White Sox 12, Tigers 6 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Rookie Jeff Abbott hit two home runs, Robin Ventura
hit a two-run shot and Wil Cordero added a solo homer to lead
Chicago.
	   Abbott hit a solo homer leading off the sixth and a two-run shot
with two out in the seventh to raise his season total to 10. The
White Sox won for the seventh time in their last eight games.
	   John Snyder (6-2) posted his second consecutive win, giving up
five runs on six hits and two walks over 5 1-3 innings. He departed
after allowing solo home runs to Tony Clark and Luis Gonzalez in
the sixth to pull Detroit within 6-5.
	   Justin Thompson (10-14) lost his fifth straight start.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police using clubs, guns and
water cannon scattered rock-throwing demonstrators Wednesday who
defied strongman Hun Sen's attempt to crush intensifying demands
for his ouster by destroying a protest camp outside the National
Assembly.
	   A Buddhist monk was struck in the leg by a bullet as police
fired volleys of warning shots to scatter the protesters, mostly
motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped at intersections near the U.S.
Embassy and the residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Police formed skirmish lines in the narrow, pot-holed streets,
then charged the protesters and journalists, clubbing people
trapped against the walls. APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was smashed
in the head and rushed to a hospital.
	   Several other people were injured. One badly hurt person was
brought inside the embassy. Human-rights workers said at least six
people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   The motorcyclists, a core of support for Ranariddh and
opposition ally Sam Rainsy, had taunted the police to fight. Some
unloaded bags of rocks they had collected into piles for use as
ammunition.
	   Within an hour after the clashes erupted, police had sealed off
the area and dispersed the protesters. A group of 30 praying monks
were scattered with water cannon. Rocks and shell casings littered
the streets.
	   About 120 people had earlier sought protection under the walls
of the U.S. Embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out
Tuesday from their protest camp, which they had dubbed Democracy
Square. Police ended the 16-day round-the-clock vigil with clubs,
bamboo canes and rifle butts.
	   They said they could not return to their villages, since the Hun
Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   One, San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her,
said that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old
son for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy. I have no other place to
go.''
	   Sam Rainsy left the United Nations offices, where he had sought
refuge from Hun Sen's threats to arrest him, under the protection
of U.N. officials to meet Ranariddh.
	   Mu Sochua, a senior member of the prince's FUNCINPEC party, said
the ``party is still ready to carry on the struggle for democracy.
We must prevent it from dying, but it has received a big blow.''
	   Hun Sen ordered Sam Rainsy's arrest Monday after grenades were
thrown at his home, then rescinded the order Tuesday. Hun Sen has
denied staging the attack as a pretext to launch the crackdown. He
was not at home at the time, and no one was hurt.
	   ``Now maybe there is no leader,'' said Meg Viasnar, 22, a
student protester. ``Maybe now students and monks will lead the
movement. We don't want Hun Sen anymore. The situation in Cambodia
now is very dangerous.''
	   The violence in the capital is the worst since Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a bloody coup a year ago, but there has been only one
confirmed death.
	   Hun Sen sought to decisively stamp out mounting unrest over his
disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26 by destroying
the Democracy Square protest site, a focal point for the
opposition.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the waste that remained of the tent
city, and a tractor scooped up what they left behind and dumped it
into a truck. Police armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy allege Hun Sen rigged the election to
ensure his Cambodian People's Party won. It got a narrow majority
but fell short of the two-thirds needed to form a government.
	   The opposition is threatening to boycott the assembly, scheduled
to meet Sept. 24, and stop a government from being formed.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with McGwire getting ball, Hall of Fame taking it.

 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The talk flowed everywhere _ all day, all week.
Who'd catch it? Should they keep it? Would the IRS come calling?
And the most pressing: Give it back gratis or take Mark McGwire and
the Cardinals for as much cash and cool stuff as possible?
	   In the end, when No. 62 came Tuesday night, the whole affair
proved far easier than anybody thought.
	   Unlike so many of Mark McGwire's 1998 home runs, this one didn't
make it into the left-field stands. Instead, the line drive shot
over the left field fence, where Tim Forneris was waiting _ Tim
Forneris, Busch Stadium groundskeeper.
	   At a postgame ceremony, Forneris presented McGwire with the
ball.
	   ``Mr. McGwire, I think I have something that belongs to you,''
he said.
	   McGwire took the ball, looked at it and held it up triumphantly.
The Hall of Fame then took possession of the ball, as well as
McGwire's bat and uniform.
	   When the ball left McGwire's bat, Forneris and his brother,
Tino, were working behind the outfield fence under, appropriately
enough, a sign for ``Target'' department stores.
	   Both joined other members of the ground crew in a mad dash to
where they thought it would land, under a ``Konica Copiers and
Printers'' sign.
	   ``I figure, if it's not gone, it's going to hit the wall. If it
is gone, it's mine,'' Forneris said.
	   He beat them all.
	   ``He was always the better player,'' Tino Forneris said.
	   Forneris stuffed the ball into his shirt and ran onto the field
with dozens of other employees as McGwire rounded the bases. He
gave the prize to Cardinals equipment manager Buddy Bates. In a
moment, the jubilant McGwire had his piece of history back.
	   McGwire has said the ball belongs in Cooperstown _ at the
Baseball Hall of Fame, home of 5,000 other significant baseballs,
including one believed to have been used in 1839 by Abner
Doubleday, the man said to have invented baseball.
	   ``It's refreshing,'' said Don Marr, the hall's president,
carrying a case containing the bat Roger Maris used to hit No. 61.
``People short-change America. These baseball fans are showing
their true colors.''
	   The mass of cowhide-covered yarn and rubber that makes up a
Rawlings official National League baseball, which retails for dlrs
5, could have been worth more than dlrs 1 million to anyone who
caught it.
	   There was a brief flurry over the weekend when media reports
indicated whoever caught the ball might be taxed heavily even if
they gave it away. But the Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday
that wouldn't be the case.
	   McGwire, who earns dlrs 9.5 million a year, had implored whoever
retrieved the ball to return it.
	   ``I just totally disagree with all this money talk about a
ball,'' he said over the weekend. ``It is outrageous. Why would
somebody hold the ball hostage when really, basically, they had
nothing to do with it?''
	   The ``magical one,'' he says, ``belongs in Cooperstown.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Security guards dragged the wife of a veteran
political activist away from the entrance of a Beijing hotel
Wednesday to prevent her from meeting U.N. human rights chief Mary
Robinson.
	   In a separate incident, a dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province, Lin Xinshu, said he was taken to a local police station
for questioning Wednesday morning.
	   Chu Hailan, wife of political prisoner Liu Nianchun, was
standing quietly outside the front door of the Hilton Hotel in
Beijing Wednesday, waiting for Robinson to arrive, when security
officers pulled her inside. Chu yelled and struggled as they
dragged her through the Hilton's lobby.
	   Asked about the incident, Robinson, who arrived minutes later,
said, ``Obviously, I would be concerned about any issue such as
that, but I don't know anything about it.''
	   Chu has been seeking the release on medical grounds of her
husband, who has been detained for more than three years without
trial. According to Chu, Liu suffers from high blood pressure,
stomach problems and other ailments.
	   Chu is one of scores of dissidents who have sought to gain
Robinson's help during her 10-day visit to China, the first
official mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner for human
rights.
	   Lin Xinshu, the Fujian dissident, said police questioned him
about essays he had written and about the activities of other
dissidents who had sent letters to Robinson decrying China's human
rights situation.
	   Lin was allowed to return home after two and a half hours but
was told the police would return for more questions later in the
day.
	   ``They told me they weren't accusing me of breaking the law, but
they wanted to understand the situation,'' Lin said. ``I think it's
strange. Why are they bothering with me?''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia launched Commonwealth
Games cricket with a thoroughly professional performance to beat
Canada's amateurs in the first match Wednesday.
	   Australia's strong lineup dismissed the Canadians for 60 runs
with only one batsman, Nuneeb Diwan (14), making double figures.
Australia lost just one wicket in reply.
	   Paceman Damien Fleming claimed 4-21 from six overs in hot and
humid conditions on a true pitch while Michael Kasprowicz, Tom
Moody and Gavin Robertson took two each.
	   ``It was a good day for us,'' said Australian captain Steve
Waugh. ``We talked about being professional last night and we did
just that.''
	   Canadian captain Ingeton Liburd said his team of part-timers
were overawed by the Australians.
	   ``We were a little bit nervous, playing against the top team in
the world,'' Liburd said.
	   In the other Group B match, India made a strong start against
Antigua after the start was delayed almost two hours because of
overnight rain and the game was reduced to 41 overs per side.
	   The 16-team cricket competition started two days ahead of
Friday's opening ceremony.

McGwire always seemed destined for greatness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ He started with a home run in his very first
Little League at-bat. Years later, when he reached the majors, he
set a home run record for rookies.
	   He won a World Series title as one of the ``Bash Brothers'' and
has revitalized his sport, his bulging biceps headlining the news
each night during the summerlong pursuit of Roger Maris' record.
	   And now, with his 62nd homer Tuesday night, Mark McGwire stands
alone at the top of baseball.
	   Hard to believe he didn't think much of himself as a Little
Leaguer.
	   ``I started playing when I was 9,'' McGwire said. ``Was I any
good? I guess I was pretty good, but I don't think I was that
good.''
	   Nobody _ but nobody _ would believe that. The evidence of
greatness is all over Mark David McGwire's life, and his conquering
of Maris' home run record is just the culmination.
	   McGwire seemed linked with home runs from the start: He was born
Oct. 1, 1963 _ two years to the day after Maris hit No. 61. And
McGwire hit his 61st home run on the day his father, John McGwire,
turned 61.
	   At Southern California, McGwire set the Pacific-10 Conference
record for home runs in a season with 32. He was an important part
of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. And when he played his first full
season in the major leagues in 1987, he was already a finished
product.
	   Just ask Tony La Russa, who managed him for nine years in
Oakland and is in his second year of penciling him in third in the
batting order with the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   ``When he first started in Oakland, we had no one fundamentally
better than Mark McGwire,'' La Russa said.
	   McGwire set a rookie record with 49 home runs that year, a total
that took him nine seasons to top. He drove in 118 runs, a total he
didn't top until this season.
	   McGwire and Jose Canseco became known as the ``Bash Brothers''
for their home runs that led Oakland to American League pennants in
1988, 1989 and 1990, and a World Series victory over the crosstown
Giants in '89. Their trademark _ slamming their forearms together
after homers _ became a widely imitated gesture of triumph.
	   McGwire, who'll turn 35 in October, could reach 500 homers next
season and write his ticket to the Hall of Fame.
	   The only reason he has just 449 is a series of back and heel
problems that robbed him of most of the 1993 and '94 seasons and
cast doubt on his durability. This year, he has missed just three
games due to back spasms. His only other days off were to keep him
fresh.
	   The first baseman has produced several seasons' worth of
highlights, toppling milestones with almost every long ball:
	   _ He matched Willie Mays' 1971 record when he homered in each of
the first four games of the season.
	   _ In May, he surpassed Babe Ruth by reaching 400 homers in the
fewest at-bats.
	   _ It only took him until early June to set the Busch Stadium
season home run record with his 18th. On July 26, he smashed Johnny
Mize's team record of 43 homers.
	   There were also periods of frustration _ the times when he'd hit
out eight in batting practice but left the cage muttering and
wringing his hands around the handle of his bat.
	   Twice, McGwire endured 29 at-bat stretches between home runs.
For about a three-week period, pitchers wanted no part of him, and
his walk total began approaching a record.
	   After one particularly frustrating game, La Russa predicted that
if the trend continued, McGwire would break Ruth's 1923 record of
170 walks by Sept. 1.
	   But most of the time, fans didn't have to wait too long for
McGwire to go deep. When he tied Maris on Monday, his season pace
was one home run for every seven at-bats.
	   Also watching for many of the games this summer was his
10-year-old son, Matthew, the Cardinals' batboy at home games.
Matthew was just 1 when McGwire and his wife, Kathy, divorced.
	   All year, McGwire downplayed his chances of breaking baseball's
most cherished record _ until he got to home run No. 50.
	   When he got there ridiculously early, on Aug. 20, even McGwire
had trouble not getting giddy about the whole thing. As he rounded
the bases at Shea Stadium after connecting off the Mets' Willie
Blair, the only man to have three consecutive 50-home run seasons
pumped his fists and grinned.
	   Teammates along for the historic ride grinned, too. McGwire's
chase has reduced the Cardinals' sub-.500 season to a mere
footnote.
	   ``The guy is doing it all by himself,'' La Russa said. ``He's
got tremendous support, but he doesn't need it. He's a
self-contained phenomenon.''
	   Not even a healthy dose of controversy over his use of
androstenedione, a supplement that boosts testosterone levels for
brief periods, could make much of a dent in McGwire's mystique. As
La Russa, teammates and opponents came to his defense, noting that
he still had to make contact, McGwire stepped up his already
prodigious pace.
	   So where does all this wind up? Now that he has the record, does
he hold it? Does he break it again in 1999?
	   ``I think McGwire is going to chase it next year,'' Canseco
said. ``He is incredible. No one can even stand in his shoes _ not
Babe Ruth, not anyone.''

Parliament approves landmark bill to protect Sri Lankan Children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan parliament has
established a new agency charged with protecting children from sex
abuse.
	   The National Child Protection Authority, set up by a law adopted
unanimously Tuesday night, will have its own police and legal
officers and the power to investigate allegations of crimes ranging
from illegal adoption to trafficking in young prostitutes.
	   Authority staff can raid any place where they suspect a child is
being abused. Anyone trying to obstruct them can be subject to a
fine of 1,000 rupees (dlrs 15) and six months in jail.
	   This Indian Ocean island off the southern tip of India has
earned a reputation as a place where children are sexually
exploited. Last year, the government raised the prison term for
child sex offenders to up to 20 years.
	   One German and two Swiss citizens were sentenced last year to
two years in jail each for having sex with boys under 14. They were
the first foreigners to be punished in Sri Lanka.

Netanyahu cancels trip to Georgia at last minute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Wednesday cancelled a trip to the Georgian capital Tbilisi because
of influenza, his spokesman said.
	   Reporters were already on Netanyahu's plane at Ben-Gurion
airport when his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky came on board and told
them the trip was off.
	   ``A doctor who examined what his condition is this morning
determined that it would be better if the prime minister remained
at home for a day or two,'' Bushinsky said.
	   On Tuesday night Netanyahu cut short a marathon cabinet
discussion on next year's state budget, because he felt unwell.
	   Early Wednesday morning a leading cardiologist, Andre Keren, was
called to tthe prime minister's residence and found that he had
influenza.
	   ``The prime minister last night suffered from exhaustion. The
source of the exhaustion was not clear. ... Today it became clear
that he is suffering from influenza,'' Dr. Keren told Army radio.
	   Netanyahu was to have made a one-day visit to Tbilisi to take
part in celebrations marking the 2.600th anniversary of the Jewish
presence in Georgia.
	   Because of his illness he will be represented at the
celebrations by Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Katsav and Israel's two
chief rabbis, Bushinsky said.
	   In view of the doctor's statement it was not clear whether
Netanyahu would be able to meet the American peace envoy Dennis
Ross Thursday for talks on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
and the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.

President Kumaratunga says no to unconditional talks with Tamil
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ President Chandrika Kumaratunga has
rejected unconditional talks with Tamil Tiger separatists and
accused the main opposition party and the guerrillas of plotting to
overthrow her, a state-run newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The opposition United National Party suggested last week that
Kumaratunga hold talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
even while fighting continued in the 15-year-old ethnic conflict.
The Tamil Tigers said it was not averse to a political settlement
to its demand for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in
the north and east of the country.
	   ``Evidence has come to light that there was an understanding
between the LTTE and the UNP to work together with the aim of
toppling the Peoples' Alliance government,'' The Daily news quoted
her as saying in a Sinhala language speech Tuesday.
	   The newspaper report did not elaborate on what made the
president conclude that the opposition and the rebels were
conspiring against her.
	   She was also quoted as questioning whether the UNP's proposal
for unconditional talks wouldn't result in the ``division of the
country.''
	   She criticized the UNP for not extending crucial support to
amend the constitution to guarantee wide autonomy to the island
nation's eight provinces, including the one with a Tamil majority.
	   Kumaratunga hopes the proposal will win over the moderates among
the Tamils and eventually sideline the rebels.
	   There was no immediate comment by the UNP.
	   Several rounds of peace talks in the past have ended after the
rebels broke off negotiations and resumed attacks on the military.

Demonstrators protest president, fight with police

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with scuffles, other details thruout
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Scuffles broke out with security
forces Wednesday when about 1,500 students and opposition party
supporters staged protests against Indonesia's president over
skyrocketing food prices.
	   Students from several universities, along with supporters of
prominent opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, gathered near
the office of the governor of East Java, where President B.J.
Habibie was staying during a visit to Surabaya, Indonesia's second
largest city.
	   The protesters were spilt into two groups by hundreds of
security personnel in riot gear. Armored vehicles were also
stationed nearby.
	   The demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans and waved red
and white Indonesian flags.
	   ``We don't want Habibie. We want lower food prices,'' read one
banner.
	   Witnesses said several protesters were beaten by security
personnel and arrested. There was no immediate comment from police.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police were deployed across the
city, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, after students
said they would stage a big march against Habibie.
	   Despite the large security presence, the number of protesters
continued to grow through the morning.
	   There were no reports injuries, although some witnesses said
members of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing vehicles.
	   Habibie entered the governor's office after making a speech at a
sports stadium to mark Indonesia's national sports day.
	   Protests have been frequent in this Southeast Asian nation since
it fell into its worst economic crisis in three decades. Habibie
himself took power in May after riots and protests forced
authoritarian President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie, a long time friend of Suharto, maintains he has done
much to attack corruption and nepotism that plagued Indonesia's
ailing economy.
	   He has also thrown his full support behind a multi-billion
dollar economic rescue plan drafted by the International Monetary
Fund, which has demanded deep and painful reforms.
	   There has been growing discontent among many of Indonesia's 202
million people as prices for food and other essentials soar and
unemployment climbs.
	   Protests, looting and riots have hit several cities and towns in
recent weeks as criticism of Habibie's presidency mounts.
	   Wednesday's protest came a day after police and troops used
sticks, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of students from the
grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta.
	   Two students underwent surgery after they were allegedly stabbed
by bayonets.
	   Large numbers of security personnel remained stationed around
the Parliament building on Wednesday. But there was no sign of
trouble.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police using clubs, guns and
water cannon Wednesday scattered rock-throwing demonstrators
defying strongman Hun Sen's attempt to crush intensifying demands
for his ouster by destroying a protest camp outside the National
Assembly.
	   A Buddhist monk was struck in the leg by a bullet as police
fired volleys of warning shots to scatter the protesters, mostly
motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped near the U.S. Embassy and
residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Police formed skirmish lines in the narrow, pot-holed streets,
then charged the protesters and journalists, clubbing people
trapped against the walls.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy left the U.N. offices, where he has
sought refuge from Hun Sen's threats to arrest him, under the
protection of U.N. officials to meet his ally, Ranariddh.
	   They held talks behind closed doors at the prince's headquarters
at the foot of the city's only bridge over the Mekong river.
	   The motorcyclists, a core of opposition support, had taunted the
police to fight. Some unloaded bags of rocks they had collected
into piles for use as ammunition.
	   Within an hour, police had sealed off the area and dispersed the
protesters. A group of 30 praying monks were scattered by water
cannon. Rocks and shell casings littered the streets.
	   About 120 people earlier sought protection under the walls of
the U.S. Embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out
Tuesday from their protest camp, which they had dubbed Democracy
Square.
	   They said they could not return to their villages, since the Hun
Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   One, San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her,
said that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old
son for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy. I have no other place to
go.''
	   Hun Sen ordered Sam Rainsy's arrest Monday after grenades were
thrown at his home, then rescinded the order Tuesday. Hun Sen has
denied staging the attack as a pretext to launch the crackdown. He
was not at home at the time, and no one was hurt.
	   ``Now maybe there is no leader,'' said Meg Viasnar, 22, a
student protester. ``Maybe now students and monks will lead the
movement. We don't want Hun Sen anymore. The situation in Cambodia
now is very dangerous.''
	   The violence in the capital is the worst since Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a bloody coup a year ago, but there has been only one
confirmed death.
	   Hun Sen sought to decisively stamp out mounting unrest over his
disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26 by destroying
the Democracy Square protest site, a focal point for the
opposition.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the waste that remained of the tent
city, and a tractor scooped up what they left behind and dumped it
into a truck. Police armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy allege Hun Sen rigged the election to
ensure his Cambodian People's Party won. It got a narrow majority
but fell short of the two-thirds needed to form a government.
	   The opposition is threatening to boycott the assembly, scheduled
to meet Sept. 24, and stop a government from being formed.

British empire has faded, but Commonwealth Games bigger than ever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Britain's mighty, globe-spanning
empire is no more, but the sporting extravaganza that it spawned in
1930, the Commonwealth Games, has ballooned in size.
	   So many athletes are vying for medals this year that events had
to be started early _ on Wednesday, two days before the opening
ceremony, which will take place on the outskirts of the Malaysian
capital of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Competitors jousted with one another on cricket pitches,
badminton courts, hockey fields and shooting ranges while others
with some idle moments roamed the city's Chinatown, Little India
and a shopping mall at the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest
building in the world.
	   Still more athletes flew into the city's new airport, a sleek
and glittering showpiece that was finished quickly for the first
Commonwealth Games ever to be held in Asia. Others have been held
in Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.
	   Shaken by political and economic turbulence, Malaysia is banking
on the games to lend some zest to its image. The economy of the
Southeast Asian nation is in full-blown recession, and Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad last week fired Anwar Ibrahim, his
deputy.
	   Blissfully unaware of the country's woes, the games mascot _ an
orangutan named Wira _ grins from logos, posters and other
paraphernalia that decorate hotels and stadiums. Wira means
``warrior'' in Malaysian.
	   About 5,000 athletes are competing in the games, an event held
every four years that was inaugurated in Hamilton, Canada, 68 years
ago with the title of ``British Empire Games.''
	   The number of participants four years ago in Victoria, Canada,
was 3,200.
	   There are 16 sports in Malaysia, the largest Commonwealth event
so far.
	   From 2002, when the Commonwealth Games are scheduled to be held
in Manchester, there will be a limit of 14 sports, including a
maximum of four team events.
	   Questions linger about the relevance of the Commonwealth Games,
which are modeled on the Olympic Games, but enjoy only a fraction
of the prestige.
	   The event has drawn some top athletes, including Peter Nicol of
Scotland, the No. 1 squash player in the world. But many have
skipped it for engagements elsewhere that offer prize money.
	   ``It is a bit difficult to compete with some of the rewards that
are being offered,'' said Michael Fennel, chairman of the
Commonwealth Games Federation.
	   The games have weathered rougher challenges. In 1986, 32 nations
boycotted the event in Edinburgh, Scotland because of Britain's
refusal to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa.
	   For now, a more pressing worry for the athletes may be the
tropical climate in Malaysia, where temperatures often soar over 30
degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-morning.
	   Australian swimming stars Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe have been
ordered to rest during the opening ceremony Friday, a day before
they try to crack the world record in the 200-meter freestyle.
	   ``They're going to be standing out in the heat for a long, long
time and that's not conducive to good swimming the next day,'' said
Australian head coach Don Talbot.
	   In keeping with tradition, the British royal family will add
aristocratic glitter to the Commonwealth Games.
	   Queen Elizabeth II will preside over the closing ceremony on
Sept. 21, and Prince Edward, trailed by photographers, on Tuesday
visited the international media center in a hotel ringed by
highways.
	   As his guides explained the computer technology being used at
the games, the royal scion asked: ``Does it work?''

Ex-general questioned over Indonesian riots: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A son-in-law of former President
Suharto has denied rumors that he was behind riots that rocked
Indonesia in May, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper said a government-appointed fact-finding team
talked with former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto on Monday.
	   The rioting, which left 1,200 dead and hundreds of buildings
burned and ransacked, led to the downfall of Suharto, who had ruled
Indonesia for 32 years.
	   The Post quoted one investigator, Bambang Soeharto, as saying
the team questioned Prabowo for one hour at his Jakarta home on
Wednesday.
	   Bambang said Prabowo, who is married to one of Suharto's
daughters, was questioned because he had been the head of the
army's elite Strategic Reserves Command at the time of the rioting.
	   ``There are rumors that I was behind the riots ... that's not
true,'' Bambang quoted Prabowo as saying.
	   Bambang said Prabowo maintained that he deployed his troops in
accordance with orders but admitted that his men were outnumbered
by protesters.
	   Critics complain that the military was slow to stop the
violence, which lasted three days.
	   There have also been accusations that sections of the military
may have fomented some rioting.
	   After Suharto's resignation, Prabowo's once high-flying career
came to an abrupt end.
	   Last month he was dismissed from the military after an army
tribunal found evidence that his troops took part in the
disappearance of dozens of anti-government activists in the months
prior to Suharto's departure from office.

Arrest total in Myanmar rises to 303, opposition party says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ In its preemptive strike against the
opposition's attempt to convene parliament, Myanmar's military
government has now arrested a total of 303 people, the party of
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi said Wednesday.
	   Among those arrested were 129 members of parliament, said Tin
Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy.
	   Several Western governments, including the United States, and
international human rights groups have issued sharp condemnations
of the crackdown against the opposition. They have called on the
military to release prisoners and begin a dialogue with the NLD and
Myanmar's ethnic groups.
	   Tin Oo, a former defense minister, Buddhist monk and political
prisoner, said that not only NLD members had been arrested but also
members of political parties representing some ethnic groups, such
as the Shan and the Rakhines.
	   Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since the arrests began. She
is living under intense restrictions on her movements by the
military government.
	   Tin Oo said that she and the rest of the NLD's central executive
committee would meet at the party's Yangon headquarters Wednesday
to discuss the situation.
	   Dissatisfaction with the government is rising, particularly over
its mismanagement of the crumbling economy. Military bungling has
left resource-rich Myanmar one of the world's poorest nations.
	   Students in Yangon protested against military rule for the first
time in two years during the past two weeks.
	   Student exiles in Bangkok reported that 12 Buddhist monks have
been arrested in the northern city of Mandalay after an
anti-military demonstration involving more than 200 people.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. A government
spokesman has said only that opposition members have been
``invited'' for an exchange of views at government guest houses.
	   ``I do not think all NLD detainees are being kept at guest
houses,'' Tin Oo said. ``I'm very concerned about the quality of
the conditions they are being kept under.''
	   During previous mass arrests, the military made similar claims
about good treatment of opposition members, only to have those
arrested detail harsh treatment at the hands of the military after
their release.
	   The military frequently uses physical and psychological torture
against detainees, former prisoners and human rights groups have
said.
	   The current wave of arrests had been expected. The NLD had set
an Aug. 21 deadline for the military government to convene
parliament. When it passed unheeded, the party announced it would
call the assembly on its own.
	   The military responded by branding the NLD as traitors. It
warned any attempts to convene parliament would be illegal and
could result in the party being outlawed.
	   The NLD won 385 of the 492 parliamentary seats in the 1990
election. Despite promising to turn over power to the winners
before the polls were held, the military refused to honor the
result.
	   The military, which has held power in Myanmar, also known as
Burma, since 1962, held the elections to appease the international
community, which was outraged when soldiers gunned down more than
3,000 people during a nationwide pro-democracy protest in 1988.
	   Since the election, 183 NLD members of parliament have either
been imprisoned, driven into exile, stripped of the parliamentary
status by the military-controlled election commission or died.
	   The rest are living under constant persecution and harassment by
the authorities, the party has said.
	   In Bangkok, about 20 Myanmar exiles protested in front of the
Myanmar embassy for the release of political prisoners.
	   ``I'm confident change will come to my country in the next few
months,'' said one student who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``There is a lot of pressure building up on the military from
many directions, and Aung San Suu Kyi is becoming very active
now,'' he said.

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Scuffles broke out with security
forces Wednesday when about 4,000 students and opposition party
supporters staged protests against Indonesia's president over
skyrocketing food prices.
	   Students from several universities, along with supporters of
prominent opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, gathered near
the office of the governor of East Java where President B.J.
Habibie was staying during a visit to Indonesia's second largest
city, Surabaya.
	   The protesters were spilt into two groups by hundreds of
security personnel in riot gear. Armored vehicles were also
stationed nearby.
	   The demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans and waved red
and white Indonesian flags.
	   ``We don't want Habibie. We want lower food prices'' read one
banner.
	   ``Reject Habibie! Reject Habibie!'' the protesters shouted.
	   Habibie left the governor's office after several hours. His
heavily guarded motorcade went immediately to Surabaya airport,
where he boarded a jet to Jakarta.
	   After Habibie's departure, thousands of protesters pushed
through a line of troops and demonstrated in front of the
governor's office.
	   Earlier witnesses said several protesters were beaten and
arrested by security personnel. Police, however, reported no
arrests.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police were deployed across the
city, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, after students
said they would stage a big march against Habibie.
	   Despite the large security presence, the number of protesters
continued to grow through the morning.
	   There were no reports injuries, although some witnesses said
members of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing vehicles.
	   Habibie entered the governor's office after making a speech at a
sports stadium to mark Indonesia's national sports day.
	   Indonesia has been wracked by social unrest since it entered its
worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and protests forced
authoritarian President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie, a long time friend of Suharto, maintains he has done
much to attack corruption and nepotism that plagued Indonesia's
ailing economy.
	   He has also thrown his full support behind a multi-billion
dollar economic rescue plan drafted by the International Monetary
Fund, which has demanded deep and painful reforms.
	   There has been growing discontent among many of Indonesia's 202
million people as prices for basic food and other commodities soar
and unemployment climbs.
	   Protests, looting and riots have hit several cities and towns in
recent weeks as criticism of Habibie's presidency mounts.
	   Wednesday's protest came a day after police and troops used
sticks, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of students from the
grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta.
	   Two students underwent surgery after they were allegedly stabbed
by bayonets.
	   Large numbers of security personnel remained stationed around
the Parliament building on Wednesday. But there was no sign of
trouble.

Russia awaits signal from president to break political deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin still mulling decision, other
new information &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's political crisis whirled in a holding
pattern Wednesday as the country waited for word from President
Boris Yeltsin on whether he would agree to accept a compromise
candidate for prime minister.
	   Yeltsin had not made a decision on the prime minister's post and
was considering measures to stabilize the economic situation,
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters
Wednesday morning.
	   ``We are waiting for the decision of the president,'' he said,
refusing to speculate on possible candidates for the post.
	   The choice could resolve a deadlock between the president and
parliament that has paralyzed the political system even as the
country's economy descends deeper into crisis.
	   Ever since the lower chamber, the State Duma, resoundingly
rejected his unpopular choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
Yeltsin has been meeting with aides, but has said nothing publicly.
	   In previous situations, he has made a new nomination within
hours of a no vote, and the delay spurred speculation he was
considering a change of heart.
	   Yeltsin has one more chance to propose a candidate _ either
Chernomyrdin or someone else. If the Duma rejects the third choice,
Yeltsin is required to disband the chamber and call new elections.
	   Opposition and religious leaders warned Tuesday that unless a
solution is found quickly, the political standoff could spark civil
war.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, a presidential aspirant,
said Wednesday he was ready to take charge of the government,
adding that Yeltsin should resign. ``A paralysis of power is
obvious now,'' he said.
	   The nation's top clergyman, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II,
even prayed publicly before Russia's holiest icon, Our Lady of
Vladimir, seeking divine protection against ``misfortunes, sorrows
and internecine war.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said if Yeltsin
continues to insist on Chernomyrdin, the crisis will deepen.
	   ``A mistake for the president and his team can cost the
country's civic peace. This is a very high price,'' Zyuganov said
Tuesday. Disbanding the Duma, he added, could ``end in fighting
throughout Russia's expanses.''
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. Two names that have prompted the
greatest speculation among lawmakers are Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a statement circulated Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry,
Primakov said he would not agree to take the prime minister's post.
Luzhkov, too, coyly denied he'd been negotiating for the job.
	   Noting that he was already ``prime minister of the Moscow
government,'' Luzhkov asked ``Is that so little?,'' the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the economy continued its skid. The ruble, which
bought about 16 cents last month, is now worth around 5 cents.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
also began forming at gas stations.
	   Apparently seeking to slow the deterioration, Chernomyrdin moved
late Tuesday to put at least some of his economic program into
motion.
	   He instructed tax police to start raids Thursday on firms
suspected of gouging, ordered a swift cut in oil excise taxes, and
directed the Central Bank to require exporters to sell half their
hard currency proceeds for rubles. He also announced that customs
officers can now collect duties in foreign currencies, Interfax
said.
	   He named Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax
chief, to be Russia's chief envoy to the International Monetary
Fund, Interfax reported.
	   In another step to increase tax collections, the acting
government decided to transfer the tax accounts of the country's 50
biggest companies to the Central Bank, the Federal Treasury and two
large, state-owned banks _ Sberbank, the Savings Bank, and
Vneshtorgbank, the Bank for Foreign Trade.

Pakistan accuses players of fixing scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pakistan cricket officials called
Wednesday for life bans to be imposed on three star players
implicated in match-fixing scandals.
	   A preliminary report by the Pakistan Cricket Board into
match-fixing allegations, which have haunted the country's top
players for several years, recommended Wasim Akram, Salim Malik and
Ijaz Ahmed be banned pending further investigations.
	   The report follows years of accusations against Pakistani
players. In 1994 Australian players Mark Waugh, Tim May and Shane
Warne accused Malik of trying to bribe them. Malik was cleared by a
hearing in Pakistan.
	   On Wednesday Syed Naushad Ali, the manager of Pakistan's
Commonwealth Games team, said that if the new allegations were
correct the players had ``betrayed their nation.''
	   ``It is most unfortunate from a cricketing point of view and
from a national point of view,'' Ali told The Associated Press.
``The prestige of Pakistani players has plunged a lot after this
affair. A life ban would be the simplest punishment. Fixing a match
and losing it (on purpose) is betraying your nation and is a
crime.''
	   Former Pakistan opener Mohsin Khan, who is coaching the Games
team, said he was sorry to hear the report.
	   ``Actually I'm not surprised that such a thing was going on but
I am surprised at who was involved,'' Khan said. ``I am also sorry
that we will lose three world class cricketers. But if it is true I
would have no hestitation in banning them for life.''
	   Pakistan's Chef-de-Mission, Malik Nasir Khan, said Malik and
Ijaz were on their way to Canada to play in the annual Sahara Cup
competition against India.
	   Nasir Khan, a parliamentarian who is also on an 11-member
inquiry into Pakistani cricket, said Malik had been cleared
recently by the government.
	   Waugh was part of the Australian team which played in Kuala
Lumpur on Wednesday but team manager Steve Bernard said none of the
team would comment on the issue.
	   Reports said the Pakistan finding was based on interviews with
current and former players and spelled out the involvement of
players in betting and match fixing.
	   The report by the three-member committee Akram, Malik and Ijaz
should be kept away from other Pakistan players, ``to save
youngsters and new entrants in the game from being affected further
and spoiled by the soiling atmosphere.''
	   ``However, the final decision against them and all other
concerned may be deferred to the finalisation of inquiry and
findings.''

Philippine stocks plunge on currency control concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks dropped sharply
Wednesday because of concerns over poor regional economic prospects
and calls from local businessmen for currency controls, traders
said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 34.65 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,157.43, erasing its 2.8 percent gain over the
previous two days and setting a fresh six-year low.
	   The last time the index closed lower was on April 13, 1992, at
1,139.665.
	   Dealers said investors took the opportunity to cash in the gains
of the past two sessions. Most other Asian stock markets also
dropped in morning trading because of profit-taking.
	   Ricardo Lorayes, analyst for Unicapital Securities Inc., said
traders were ``unpleasantly surprised'' by the market's performance
since many expected a strong rally following the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's record 5 percent surge overnight.
	   ``What proved worrisome for foreign investors was the call for
currency controls. Look, other markets in the region also suffered
losses, but not as much as ours,'' said Noel Reyes, vice president
for research of Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Newspaper reports Wednesday said Federation of Philippine
Industries President Raul Concepcion backed the imposition of
partial currency controls to stabilize the exchange rate. He said
increases in interest rates are no longer effective in deflecting
speculative attacks on the peso.
	   While Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson reiterated Wednesday
that the government will not impose currency controls, foreign
investors were not completely assured and opted to punish local
stocks.
	   As regional economic prospects remain bleak, foreign fund
managers continue to be pessimistic toward Asia in general, said
Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional sales
at Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   He said Manila shares are likely to weaken further in coming
days.
	   Blue-chip stocks bore the brunt of the foreign investors' ire
over suggestions of currency controls. Overall, decliners trounced
gainers 66 to 25, while 36 issues were unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the peso was slightly lower against the
U.S. dollar in morning trading, despite relatively strong gains by
the Japanese yen, which underpinned most other regional currencies.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.467 pesos, up from 43.395 pesos
on Tuesday.
	   The central bank held its overnight borrowing and lending rates
at 16 percent and 18 percent respectively.

Most Asian markets drop on uncertainty in Japan, Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Banking problems in Japan, political
uncertainty in Malaysia and profit-taking in Hong Kong left most
Asian markets lower early Wednesday.
	   Shares in Japan and Hong Kong opened slightly higher on Wall
Street's 5-percent rally overnight, but the gains were short-lived,
and both markets were lower at midday.
	   Malaysian shares opened sharply higher on a technical rebound,
after Tuesday's 21-percent fall.
	   In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng Index was down 1.8 percent at
8,038.58 points at the midday close.
	   ``The market opened higher because of the Dow's performance. But
there is some profit-taking coming in as the index has gone up
three days in a row,'' said Sean Li of Amsteel Securities (Hong
Kong) Ltd.
	   The drop surprised many small retail investors, who thought
share prices would track the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
	   ``The Hong Kong market is like a gambling zone. The so-called
investors are just playing around with tricks,'' said Raymond
Leung, 39, a telecommunications executive.
	   ``The Dow Jones went up and everyone thought that Hong Kong
would go up, but it went down. Those who were holding stocks take
the chance for a profit,'' he said, while watching stock prices on
a computer screen facing a busy street.
	   The Hang Seng had gained 12 percent since last Friday, following
the announcements of a series of market control measures to
strengthen its currency link to the U.S. dollar and quash
speculative activities.
	   In Tokyo, gains by the Japanese yen and Wall Street failed to
boost the market, plagued by concerns over the health of Japan's
financial system.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues closed at midday at
14,831.82, down 0.5 percent.
	   The dollar was trading at 131.68 yen midday, down 0.24 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo. It fell as low as 130.45 yen Wednesday
morning.
	   Rumors that Fuji Bank Ltd. is facing huge derivatives losses
overseas triggered selling in the banking sector, traders said. The
bank later denied the rumors as ``totally groundless.''
	   ``With lack of positive news for banks lately, the rumors
dampened market sentiment,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at
Nikko Securities.
	   In Malaysia, the benchmark Composite Index surged 9.2 percent at
381.65 points in midmorning.
	   But analysts predicted little further upward movement in share
prices due to continuing political tension in the country and
government restrictions on investors in the stock market.
	   Share prices could only rise with foreign funds coming in, which
was unlikely due to government-imposed currency controls, analysts
said.
	   On Tuesday, Malaysian stocks plummeted as a regulatory reprieve
gave foreigners their first chance to sell shares since the
government imposed capital controls on Sept. 1.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index opened up 0.7 percent,
buoyed by Wall Street's gains and the comeback on the Kuala Lumpur
bourse.
	   Malaysian-over-the-counter shares were heading the top price
gainers' and most actively traded lists as the three-day trading
suspension was lifted Wednesday.
	   Investors snapped up the shares to take advantage of their steep
discount to their counterparts on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange,
dealers said.
	   The Malaysian shares will trade through Sept. 15, after which
trading in those shares on Singapore's over-the-counter market will
cease.

Progress reported in Air Canada talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Air Canada's pilots entered the seventh day of
their strike with their planes still on the runways although
negotiators were making some headway toward ending the impasse.
	   ``There is good progress being made on all kinds of issues,''
said Priscille Leblanc, an Air Canada spokeswoman. ``We're
optimistic that we're going to get a settlement.''
	   Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots
Association, was also optimistic as he emerged briefly from
marathon talks at a downtown hotel.
	   ``There are issues that have been resolved already,'' he said.
``Both parties are keen and eager to resolve this.''
	   The talks broke off for the night early Wednesday and were set
to begin again later in the day.
	   Belanger would not say what issues had been resolved, but
suggested they did not involve the contentious issue of money.
	   The strike, which began a week ago, has torpedoed the travel
plans of thousands of Canadians and sent travelers scrambling for
alternate transportation.
	   Air Canada usually carries 60,000 passengers daily and analysts
estimate the strike is costing the airline about dlrs 13 million
(dlrs U.S. 8.45 million) a day in earnings.
	   Belanger said once an agreement is reached it would take two
days to poll the 2,100-member pilots union on the tentative deal.
	   Air Canada has said that once union members ratify a deal,
domestic flights can resume in about 24 hours and international
flights shortly after that.
	   The pilots want a 12 percent raise over two years to their
current average salary of dlrs 100,000 (dlrs U.S. 65,000) a year,
and better working conditions. The company's latest offer was an
increase of 9 percent over two years.
	   Air Canada's main rival, Canadian Airlines, added almost 100
flights over the Labor Day holiday weekend to help carry the extra
load, mostly within Canada.
	   Air Canada has also chartered about 13 flights a day on domestic
and international routes.
	   The Montreal-based airline has laid off about 9,500 other
employees.

Second national election after war seems confusing to voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Ljutovic is female in 11th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Pouring over the 83
candidates, multiple parties and coalitions competing in Bosnia's
second national election since its war ended, Zehra Dizdarevic just
shook her head.
	   ``What in God's name is this?'' the 64-year-old pensioner
wondered aloud as she read a sample ballot distributed by
international election organizers ahead of this weekend's vote.
	   In a nation recovering from 3 1/2 years of war, the ballot
reflects the complex political system created in the tortuous
negotiations that halted Bosnia's fighting in 1995 and divided it
into two ethnic-based entities effectively run by the international
community.
	   On Saturday and Sunday, voters will choose a three-member
presidency _ one from each of the main ethnic groups of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims. They also will elect parliaments in each entity
_ the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation _ and a
national parliament with delegates from both sides. The Serb
republic also will choose its president.
	   International officials hope the election continues a trend
since the war ended, with nationalist parties and leaders who
plunged the former Yugoslav republic into warfare continuing to
lose support.
	   The Americans and Europeans have already sidelined hardline
nationalist leaders in the Serb republic. They have given millions
of dollars in aid to the moderate Serb republic government to help
pay salaries and pensions there to bolster the moderate cause.
	   ``Seize this opportunity by choosing responsible leaders who
will manage the country's affairs honestly and will pursue the
future you want for yourselves and your children,'' the European
Union said in an appeal to Bosnians issued Tuesday.
	   But many people trying to recover from a war that devastated the
economic and social fabric feel they are being asked to vote a
third time in three years _ one election was for local officials _
without really understanding where it all is heading.
	   ``I won't vote,'' spat Dizdarevic's husband Hasan, 67, after
reading the sample ballot through the pair of glasses he and his
wife share because they can't afford another.
	   Engineer Munevera Ljutovic believes the complicated ballot is
not the problem.
	   ``It's the country's set-up,'' she said. ``I didn't understand
from the very beginning how this (country) is composed and which
parliament is which.''

Japan Airlines to ban smoking on international flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In line with a worldwide trend toward non-smoking
flights, Japan Airlines Co. said Wednesday it will ban smoking on
all international flights starting April 1.
	   JAL, Japan's biggest airline, has decided on the ban following a
survey that showed a majority of passengers supported the measure,
the company said in a release.
	   On Sept. 1, JAL imposed the smoking ban on all domestic flights.
	   In response to growing complaints from passengers of smoking
aboard flights, All Nippon Airlines, the No. 2 airline, has said it
will eliminate smoking sections on domestic routes Oct. 1.
	   Japan Air System, the third-largest carrier, started a ban on
domestic routes on July 17.
	   Smoking is extremely prevalent in Japan, where more than 50
percent of adult men are smokers. But restrictions on smokers are
increasing, with many restaurants in Japan introducing non-smoking
sections in recent years.

Tokyo stocks end lower, dollar higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rumors that a major Japanese bank was in serious
financial trouble pushed Tokyo share prices lower Wednesday. The
U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 157.95 points, or 1.07
percent, to 14,755.54. On Tuesday, the average closed up 123.43
points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar was trading at 132.30 yen mid-afternoon, up 0.38 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo. It fell as low as 130.45 yen Wednesday
morning. The dollar bought 132.10 yen in late New York trading
overnight.
	   The Nikkei 225, which started out higher following overnight
gains in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, was later
dragged down by a fall in bank shares, traders said.
	   Speculation, later denied by the bank, that Fuji Bank Ltd. faces
huge losses overseas sparked a broad sell off of banking issues,
they said.
	   ``With lack of positive news for banks lately, the rumors hurt
market sentiment,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities Co.
	   Fuji Bank closed at 329 yen (dlrs 2.5), down 59 yen (45 cents)
from Tuesday's close.
	   Worries about Fuji Bank also helped the dollar recover earlier
losses. The dollar has been under selling pressure amid growing
speculation about a possible U.S. interest rate cut.
	   Speculation on a possible rate cut came after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicated Friday that the financial turmoil in Asia and
Russia may pose a greater threat than inflation.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,116.01. The
TOPIX closed down 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, on Tuesday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.010 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.020 percent,
driving its price up to 113.00 yen from 112.93 yen.

Floods rage through southern Mexico, 32 dead, dozens missing

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Six days of rain turned rivers
into angry torrents that tore across the southern Mexico state of
Chiapas, sweeping away houses, bridges and big trees. At least 25
people drowned and as many were reported missing and feared dead.
	   Another seven died in flash flooding in other southern Mexico
states after heavy rains pounded the region.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast Tuesday. He said at least 25,000 people in
more than 50 towns and villages were driven from their houses by
rampaging rivers and creeks.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo ordered 1,100 army troops and two 727
jets loaded with doctors, medical equipment and specialized
personnel to Chiapas.
	   However, bad weather made it impossible to get aid by airplane
to some isolated towns, where dozens of people were stranded on
rooftops and islands surrounded by raging currents, the Televisa
television network reported.
	   The mayor of one of the most affected areas _ the town of
Pijijiapan, Chiapas _ said rescuers had pulled 18 bodies from the
waters in his town alone.
	   ``The water is rising,'' the mayor, Gilberto de los Santos Cruz,
said in a telephone interview.
	   Albores Guillen said 25 people drowned in Chiapas state and at
least as many are listed as missing.
	   Television footage showed muddy torrents, some more than 100
yards (meters) wide, ripping concrete slabs from houses, pulling
and twisting railroad bridges and dragging huge trees downstream.
Waters reached the tops of windows on tin-roofed houses.
	   Barefoot people in rain slickers hauled away suitcases,
mattresses and even stoves as the rain pelted them. More than 10
inches (25 centimeters) of rain have fallen in coastal areas of
Chiapas over the last six days.
	   In Chiapas, authorities said more than more than a dozen bridges
were destroyed and that washed-out roads cut off 57 villages.
Electricity, water and sewage services also were cut to 20
villages.
	   Because of the downed bridges, mudslides and fallen trees, the
coastal highway to Guatemala was cut in four places, the Televisa
reported. Fifteen rivers on the coastal plain have overflowed their
banks.

Toxic fumes from a plastic factory put 23 in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Toxic fumes emitted from a plastic
factory in a Bangkok suburb sent 23 people to a local hospital,
four of whom are still in intensive care, hospital officials said
Wednesday.
	   The four in intensive care are women. They are suffering from
respiratory problems and are being closely monitored, said Dr.
Trairong Pattanapolakornsakul, director of the Phra Pradaeng
Hospital.
	   ``They all suffered the same symptoms when admitted to the
hospital, such as sudden chest pain, dizziness and difficulty
breathing,'' said the doctor, referring to all 23 victims.
	   Most of the patients are local residents of the suburb named
Samut Prakarn, which is home to several factories and industrial
parks.
	   Three of the victims are students. Hundreds of students were
sent home when the fumes wafted into two schools.
	   The doctor said the area has been hit frequently by toxic fumes
because many factories are located in the densely-populated
community. This incident was the worst in the past three years, he
said.
	   Government officials were investigating the cause of the fumes.
They have yet to release their findings.

 &UR; May feels vindicated after bribery charges proven &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian test player Tim May
said Wednesday he feels justified in standing firm on allegations
of bribery leveled at Salim Malik now that an inquiry found
match-fixing exists and the former Pakistani captain was involved.
	   A preliminary report by the Pakistan Cricket Board into
match-fixing allegations, which have haunted the country's top
players for several years, recommended Wasim Akram, Malik and Ijaz
Ahmed be banned pending further investigations.
	   The report follows years of accusations against Pakistani
players. In 1994 Australian players Mark Waugh, May and Shane Warne
accused Malik of trying to bribe them. Malik was cleared by a
hearing in Pakistan.
	   May and Warne alleged Malik offered them 250,000 U.S. dlrs in
bribes to bowl badly on the last day of the first test in Karachi,
where Pakistan's last pair snatched a miracle victory.
	   Later on the tour, Mark Waugh alleged Malik tried to bribe him
to bat poorly in a one-dayer. Waugh made a century but Pakistan
triumphed easily.
	   The allegations were rejected by an internal Pakistan inquiry in
1995.
	   May, now the president of the Australian Cricketers Association,
said it was a relief that after years of speculation it had finally
been confirmed that match-fixing did exist.
	   ``In my own personal way there's a genuine sense of relief that
perhaps people are becoming more aware of a problem,'' May said.
	   ``Before the finding there wasn't evidence to suggest it but now
it seems there is the evidence to take this thing further.''
	   May said he felt his scrape with bribery back in 1994 had been
forgotten but was glad the issue had not been let slip.
	   ``I'm not out there campaigning to bring these players to
justice,'' May said. ``Personally I think the issue of May, Warne
and Waugh in 1994 has been buried and this is a new inquiry.
	   ``But in a broad cricket sense it's bloody disappointing that
match-fixing may well be part of the game of cricket and you'd hope
that every stone would be turned to ensure it is removed from the
game.''
	   May called for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to
intervene and take over investigations, instead of leaving it to
the independent country boards.
	   ``I don't know what the constitution of the ICC is but
apparently they couldn't do anything about it (in 1994) because
they didn't have the jurisdiction,'' May said.
	   ``It's a matter that effects cricket globally and the ICC is the
global governing body . . . they should have the jurisdiction to
deal with accusations like these.'' (djp)

Opposition denounces police violence; protesters scattered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sam Rainsy denouncing violence, accusing
government of ``ridiculous'' pretext.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police using clubs, guns and
water cannon Wednesday scattered rock-throwing demonstrators
defying strongman Hun Sen's attempt to crush intensifying demands
for his ouster by destroying a protest camp outside the National
Assembly.
	   A Buddhist monk was struck in the leg by a bullet as police
fired volleys of warning shots to scatter the protesters, mostly
motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped near the U.S. Embassy and
residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Police formed skirmish lines in the narrow, pot-holed streets,
then charged the protesters and journalists, clubbing people
trapped against the walls.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
There were no confirmed deaths.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy briefly left the local U.N.
offices, where he has sought refuge from threats to arrest him,
under protection from U.N. officials to meet his ally, Ranariddh.
Details of the talks were not immediately disclosed.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters that Hun Sen was using a ``ridiculous
pretext'' to crackdown on the protesters by accusing Sam Rainsy of
being behind a grenade attack Monday against Hun Sen's house.
	   Hun Sen was not home at the time, and no one was hurt. The
Cambodian leader has denied staging the attack himself.
	   ``I condemn this violent crackdown on the peaceful democratic
movement,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``It is unacceptable. The government
in my view is using a ridiculous pretext. Only one hour after the
attack, they pointed the finger at me.''
	   Sam Rainsy appealed to supporters to focus on disputes related
to the July 26 parliamentary elections, which the opposition says
Hun Sen won by fraud.
	   The motorcyclists, a core of opposition support, had taunted the
police to fight. Some unloaded bags of rocks they had collected
into piles for use as ammunition.
	   Within an hour, police had sealed off the area and dispersed the
protesters. A group of 30 praying monks were scattered with water
cannon. Rocks and shell casings littered the streets.
	   About 120 people earlier sought protection under the walls of
the U.S. Embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out
Tuesday from their protest camp, which they had dubbed Democracy
Square.
	   They said they could not return to their villages, since the Hun
Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   One, San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her,
said that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old
son for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy. I have no other place to
go.''
	   It is unclear how long protests can continue without a leader of
Sam Rainsy's standing to direct them.
	   ``Maybe now students and monks will lead the movement,'' said
Meg Viasnar, 22, a student protester. ``We don't want Hun Sen
anymore. The situation in Cambodia now is very dangerous.''
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh in a
bloody coup a year ago, but there has been only one confirmed death
since the crackdown began Monday.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the waste that remained of Democracy
Square. A tractor scooped up what they left behind and dumped it
into a truck. Police armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy allege Hun Sen rigged the election to
ensure his Cambodian People's Party won. It got a narrow majority
but fell short of the two-thirds needed to form a government.
	   The opposition is threatening to boycott the assembly, scheduled
to meet Sept. 24, and stop a government from being formed.

Roger Maris' widow hospitalized again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Roger Maris' widow was hospitalized Tuesday
after developing an irregular heartbeat for the second time this
week, hours before Mark McGwire broke her husband's record of 61
home runs in a season.
	   Patricia Maris was brought to the emergency room before Tuesday
night's Chicago Cubs-St. Louis Cardinals game in which McGwire
smacked his 62nd homer.
	   She was listed in satisfactory condition at Barnes-Jewish
Hospital and was expected to be released Wednesday morning.
	   ``She's fine, medically,'' hospital spokesman Todd Cooper. ``But
it's a little crazy out there tonight and we felt she just needed a
nice quiet night.''
	   Mrs. Maris, 62, flew to St. Louis from Gainesville, Florida, on
Sunday with her four sons and two daughters to watch McGwire. She
was taken to the hospital before that game when she first developed
an irregular heartbeat.
	   ``I think it's just exhaustion,'' Randy Maris said after his
mother was hospitalized the first time. ``The last three or four
months, a lot has been going on with all this attention.''

Officers seize more than 50,000 pirated compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials have seized more than 50,000
pirated compact discs worth 900,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
116,000) after raiding several stores in a busy shopping mall, a
government statement said Wednesday.
	   Customs officials seized over 34,000 video compact discs, 12,800
music CDs and more than 3,000 CD-ROMs and television game
cartridges after a raid on Tuesday of 10 shops in a busy mall in
Hong Kong's Mongkok district, it said.
	   Eleven persons, aged between 16 and 47, were arrested but later
released on bail of up to 6,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 779),
the statement added.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list for
copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in busy shopping centers in the territory.
Copies of local or Hollywood movies are widely available for under
40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5), sometimes before they're
released in local cinemas.
	   In late August, customs officials seized 380,000 pirated compact
discs worth 7.6 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 974 million)
on a ship from nearby Macau. The biggest seizure of pirated discs
was in April, when officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency
seized 7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth
U.S. dlrs 83 million.

 &UR; May feels vindicated after bribery charges proven &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian test player Tim May
said Wednesday he feels justified in standing firm on allegations
of bribery leveled at Salim Malik now that an inquiry found
match-fixing exists and the former Pakistani captain was involved.
	   A preliminary report by the Pakistan Cricket Board into
match-fixing allegations, which have haunted the country's top
players for several years, recommended Wasim Akram, Malik and Ijaz
Ahmed be banned pending further investigations.
	   The report follows years of accusations against Pakistani
players. In 1994 Australian players Mark Waugh, May and Shane Warne
accused Malik of trying to bribe them. Malik was cleared by a
hearing in Pakistan.
	   May and Warne alleged Malik offered them 250,000 U.S. dlrs in
bribes to bowl badly on the last day of the first test in Karachi,
where Pakistan's last pair snatched a miracle victory.
	   Later on the tour, Mark Waugh alleged Malik tried to bribe him
to bat poorly in a one-dayer. Waugh made a century but Pakistan
triumphed easily.
	   The allegations were rejected by an internal Pakistan inquiry in
1995.
	   May, now the president of the Australian Cricketers Association,
said it was a relief that after years of speculation it had finally
been confirmed that match-fixing did exist.
	   ``In my own personal way there's a genuine sense of relief that
perhaps people are becoming more aware of a problem,'' May said.
	   ``Before the finding there wasn't evidence to suggest it but now
it seems there is the evidence to take this thing further.''
	   May said he felt his scrape with bribery back in 1994 had been
forgotten but was glad the issue had not been let slip.
	   ``I'm not out there campaigning to bring these players to
justice,'' May said. ``Personally I think the issue of May, Warne
and Waugh in 1994 has been buried and this is a new inquiry.
	   ``But in a broad cricket sense it's bloody disappointing that
match-fixing may well be part of the game of cricket and you'd hope
that every stone would be turned to ensure it is removed from the
game.''
	   May called for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to
intervene and take over investigations, instead of leaving it to
the independent country boards.
	   ``I don't know what the constitution of the ICC is but
apparently they couldn't do anything about it (in 1994) because
they didn't have the jurisdiction,'' May said.
	   ``It's a matter that effects cricket globally and the ICC is the
global governing body . . . they should have the jurisdiction to
deal with accusations like these.'' (djp)

Russian crisis shows new direction of Central Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ For nearly 50 years, Moscow ran the show
in eastern Europe, dictating economic policy to its satellites. Now
the little guys are showing the way.
	   As Russia reels from an economic crisis that threatens social
disorder, its communist-era allies such as Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic prepare to reap the benefits of their neighbor's
distress.
	   Economists praise the basics of their economies _ sufficient
reserves, manageable debt, strong trade _ as the three prepare to
join NATO next year and negotiate to become members of the European
Union.
	   Looking back at how the region responded to the collapse of the
Soviet empire reveals some answers to how the western-most states
can maintain stability amid the Russian crisis.
	   A major difference between Russia and its former satellites was
the speed of reforms and the commitment to embracing them.
	   Russia's reforms never took root as firmly across the vast
country, blocked or slowed by corruption and Communists and their
allies. Industrial production, which deteriorated badly at the end
of the Soviet era due to the fall of world oil prices, failed to
build up again during the 1990s. And the oil- and energy-dependent
economy again fell victim to a plunging oil market this year,
setting up this summer's crisis.
	   Elsewhere, things happened more quickly in much smaller
countries that were more open to change, due in part to being
neighbors to the West.
	   Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's first finance minister after the
fall of communist rule there in 1989, proceeded with ``shock
therapy'' measures that ended state subsidies and pricing, sold off
bloated, loss-making state enterprises, and opened markets to
imported competition.
	   He knew full well the result would be soaring inflation, a
weakened currency and higher unemployment. Those hardships helped
bring down the Solidarity-led government in 1993 elections.
	   But Balcerowicz came back last year after a Solidarity-led
coalition took power and again adhered to policies of fiscal
discipline aimed at holding down the debt burden.
	   ``The major problem underlying the Russian disturbance was in
the public finance. It was too large of a deficit for the Russian
economy to handle,'' he said recently. ``This is the lesson for
Poland, to limit the deficit as much as possible.''
	   In the former Czechoslovakia, now divided into the Czech
Republic and Slovakia, economic ``shock therapy'' freed prices and
privatized swiftly. But overspending and political uncertainty
linked to the 1993 split slowed down the pace in the Czech
Republic, leading to a currency crisis last year when the koruna
was devalued by 10 percent due to a large trade deficit and
inefficiency among Czech producers.
	   Still, 80 percent of Czech Republic industry now is held
privately. Slovakia, which retains some of the central control of
the old days, lags behind in growth and development compared to its
neighbors.
	   Hungary's reforms sold off most state-owned industry and shifted
production from 90 percent from the state sector to 70 percent from
the private sector. Products that used to get sold to Soviet bloc
countries now go to EU nations, underlining Hungary's independence
from Russia, said Finance Minister Zsigmond Jarai.
	   Like the Czech Republic, Hungary also faced a currency problem
in 1995 when it devalued the forint by 9 percent, blaming an
excessive budget deficit and debt burden.
	   Because their economies were so much smaller, the devaluations
were local problems instead of a Russian-sized debacle that cost
foreign investors billions of dollars and influenced world markets.
	   Reforms also brought an opening into Western markets, with
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary all sending more than 60
percent of their exports to EU countries. Less than 10 percent of
their exports go to Russia, which protects them now against the
Russian crisis.
	   As Piotr Dubno, an adviser to Balcerowicz in Poland, put it:
``It's not the same region anymore.''

ST. LOUIS: 18th save.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Rockies 11, Marlins 10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Denver, Vinny Castilla matched a career high with six RBIs,
including the game-winning two-run single in the ninth.
	   Chuck McElroy (5-3) won despite allowing the go-ahead run in the
ninth.
	   The lead changed three times in the final three innings before
Castilla delivered the winning hit with the bases loaded off Matt
Mantei (3-4), dealing the Marlins their 11th loss in 12 games.
 &UR; Giants 5, Padres 1
	   In San Diego, Marvin Benard hit a leadoff homer and went
4-for-4, and J.T. Snow drove in two runs as the Giants won for the
12th time in 17 games.
	   Kirk Rueter (15-9) and three relievers combined on a
four-hitter, retiring 19 in a row from the second to the eighth
innings.
	   The Padres' Andy Ashby (16-8) failed for the fifth time to win
his 17th game. He allowed five runs and eight hits in five innings,
a season-high five walks and two strikeouts.
 &UR; Dodgers 6, Diamondbacks 5, 11 innings
	   In Phoenix, Raul Mondesi tied it with a three-run home run in
the eighth inning and Eric Karros drove in the winning run with a
sacrifice fly in the 11th.
	   Bobby Chouinard relieved loser Alan Embree (4-2) with runners on
first and third and nobody out in the top of the 11th. Pinch-hitter
Tripp Cromer struck out before Karros hit a high fly to center to
bring home Luke.
	   Jeff Hubenka (1-0) got the victory. Jeff Shaw pitched a perfect
11th for his 41st save.

Ivanisevic's temper helps Rafter into Open quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defending U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter
considered the possibility that he might not have gotten to the
quarterfinals except for Goran Ivanisevic's temper.
	   In a match suspended by Monday night's storm and completed
Tuesday afternoon, Rafter won 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. It sounds
relatively routine, but it wasn't.
	   After losing the third set, Rafter was up 3-1 in the fourth when
Ivanisevic made a bid to turn the match his way. Instead, it turned
in a different direction.
	   Three times, Ivanisevic had break points against Rafter's rocket
serve. Three times, he failed to convert.
	   Frustrated with his failure, he flung his racket and nearly
nailed a ball boy. The price for his temporary tantrum was a point
penalty that moved Rafter from deuce to his advantage. He
converted, pushing the lead to 4-1, and Ivanisevic was done.
	   ``He got a bit unlucky where the racket went,'' Rafter said. ``I
was under pressure. It was a big relief to get that point penalty.
I think that was a pretty big break.
	   ``The racket could have gone anywhere. It could have just gone
straight back up into his hand, as well. But it landed funny,
nearly hit a ball boy. It was a big break.''
	   Later, Ivanisevic moaned about the failure.
	   ``He hit unbelievable returns,'' he said. ``Three break points
and he hits great volleys back. Three break points and three
terrible returns.
	   ``One mishit, I hit like a home run. One, I miss with the
forehand. And one because he hit very deep, 100 miles (160
kilometers), and he comes very quick to the net, stays very close,
(and it's) tough to pass him.''
	   He shook his head.
	   ``It was a chance for me to get back in the match,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``He started to get a little nervous, not making too many
first serves. I hit a couple of good returns and that was the
chance.
	   ``And then I come up with three bad returns, two mishits
completely, one backhand. Then it's tough. He's pumped. Then I got
the penalty point.''
	   So did his temper cost him the match? Ivanisevic didn't think
so.
	   ``I lose cool so many times,'' he said. ``But is not because of
that I lost the match. I hope I can just put some first serves in
and that was not the case. I couldn't put first serves in.''
	   Ivanisevic was at just 40 percent on first serves for the match,
compared to 75 percent for Rafter.
	   Then there was the matter of Rafter's ability to keep returning
Ivanisevic's shots. That was according to plan, good preparation
for his next match against doubles partner Jonas Bjorkman,
considered the best returner in the sport.
	   ``My main aim was not to really hurt him from the baseline, but
just to try to run a lot of balls down,'' Rafter said. ``It's the
only way to play him, for me anyway.
	   ``I have to play within myself. I'm not going to try to blast
him off the baseline. Try to just keep the ball coming back. When I
was on the defensive, just try to make him play a tough volley.''
	   And then just wait for Ivanisevic's frustration to build and the
racket to start flying.

Pakistan accuses players of fixing scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds comment from Tim May and Mohsin Khan; byline &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pakistan cricket officials called
Wednesday for life bans to be imposed on three star players
implicated in match-fixing scandals.
	   A preliminary report by the Pakistan Cricket Board into
match-fixing allegations, which have haunted the country's top
players for several years, recommended Wasim Akram, Salim Malik and
Ijaz Ahmed be banned pending further investigations.
	   The report follows years of accusations against Pakistani
players. In 1994 Australian players Mark Waugh, Tim May and Shane
Warne accused Malik of trying to bribe them. Malik was cleared by a
hearing in Pakistan.
	   May said Wednesday that the allegations had justified his stance
at the time.
	   On Wednesday Syed Naushad Ali, the manager of Pakistan's
Commonwealth Games team, said that if the new allegations were
correct the players had ``betrayed their nation.''
	   ``It is most unfortunate from a cricketing point of view and
from a national point of view,'' Ali told The Associated Press.
``The prestige of Pakistani players has plunged a lot after this
affair. A life ban would be the simplest punishment. Fixing a match
and losing it (on purpose) is betraying your nation and is a
crime.''
	   Former Pakistan opener Mohsin Khan, who is coaching the Games
team, said he was sorry to hear the report but had himself once
been approached to fix a match.
	   ``Actually I'm not surprised that such a thing was going on but
I am surprised at who was involved,'' Khan said. ``I am also sorry
that we will lose three world class cricketers. But if it is true I
would have no hesitation in banning them for life.''
	   Khan played with Malik during a career of 51 tests from 1978-87.
	   Asked if he was suspicious about Malik then, Khan said, ``the
suspicions were always there, there were always doubts.''
	   Khan said he had been the subject of one offer to throw a game.
``I told him get out. I never saw him again.''
	   Pakistan's Chef-de-Mission, Malik Nasir Khan, said Malik and
Ijaz were on their way to Canada to play in the annual Sahara Cup
competition against India.
	   Nasir Khan, a parliamentarian who is also on an 11-member
inquiry into Pakistani cricket, said Malik had been cleared
recently by the government.
	   Waugh was part of the Australian team which played in Kuala
Lumpur on Wednesday but team manager Steve Bernard said none of the
team would comment on the issue.
	   Reports said the Pakistan finding was based on interviews with
current and former players and spelled out the involvement of
players in betting and match fixing.
	   The report by the three-member committee Akram, Malik and Ijaz
should be kept away from other Pakistan players, ``to save
youngsters and new entrants in the game from being affected further
and spoiled by the soiling atmosphere.''
	   ``However, the final decision against them and all other
concerned may be deferred to the finalization of inquiry and
findings.''
	   May, who has retired from playing and now heads the Australian
Cricketers' Association, said there was a ``sense of relief'' that
there was more awareness of the match-fixing problem.
	   ``Before the finding there wasn't evidence to suggest it but now
it seems there is the evidence to take this thing further,'' May
said. ``I'm not out there campaigning to bring these players to
justice. Personally I think the issue of May, Warne and Waugh in
1994 has been buried and this is a new inquiry.
	   ``But in a broad cricket sense it's bloody disappointing that
match-fixing may well be part of the game of cricket and you'd hope
that every stone would be turned to ensure it is removed from the
game.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police using clubs, guns and
water cannon Wednesday scattered rock-throwing demonstrators
defying strongman Hun Sen's attempt the day before to crush
opponents by raiding a sprawling protest camp.
	   A Buddhist monk was struck in the leg by a bullet as police
fired volleys of warning shots to drive away the protesters, mostly
motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped near the U.S. Embassy and
residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The violence came a day after riot police armed with clubs,
bamboo canes and rifts drove about 1,000 protesters from a
makeshift camp in front of the National Assembly, ending a 16-day
round-the-clock demonstration denouncing alleged fraud in recent
elections and calling for Hun Sen's resignation.
	   On Wednesday, police formed skirmish lines in the narrow,
pot-holed streets, then charged the protesters and journalists,
clubbing people trapped against the walls to the ground.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
There were no confirmed deaths.
	   Clusters of protesters, many on motorcycles, regrouped later in
different parts of the city, including the Angkor-style
Independence Monument, and were scattered by police firing in the
air.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy briefly left the local U.N.
offices, where he has sought refuge from threats to arrest him,
under protection from U.N. officials to meet his ally, Ranariddh.
Details of the talks were not immediately disclosed.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters that Hun Sen was using a ``ridiculous
pretext'' to crackdown on the protesters by accusing Sam Rainsy of
being behind a grenade attack Monday against Hun Sen's house. Hun
Sen was not home and no one was hurt. The Cambodian leader has
denied staging the attack himself.
	   ``I condemn this violent crackdown on the peaceful democratic
movement,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``It is unacceptable.''
	   Sam Rainsy appealed to supporters to focus on disputes related
to the July 26 parliamentary elections, which the opposition says
Hun Sen won by fraud. They are threatening to deny him the
two-thirds majority support needed to form a new government.
	   FUNCINPEC issued a statement calling the violence against the
demonstators ``unthinkable and barbarous.''
	   The motorcyclists, a core of opposition support, had taunted the
police to fight. Some unloaded bags of rocks they had collected
into piles for use as ammunition.
	   Within an hour, police had sealed off the area and dispersed the
protesters. A group of 30 praying monks were sent packing with
water cannon. Rock and shell casings littered the streets.
	   About 120 people driven from the protest camp on Tuesday earlier
sought protection under the walls of the embassy. They said they
could not return to their villages, since the Hun Sen-allied
headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her, said
that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old son
for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy. I have no other place to
go.''
	   It is unclear how long protests can continue without a leader of
Sam Rainsy's standing to direct them.
	   ``Maybe now students and monks will lead the movement,'' said
Meg Viasnar, 22, a student protester. ``We don't want Hun Sen
anymore. The situation in Cambodia now is very dangerous.''
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh in a
bloody coup a year ago, but there has been only one confirmed death
since the crackdown began Monday.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the wasteland that remained of the
protest camp, dubbed Democracy Square. A tractor scooped up what
they left behind and dumped it into a truck. Police armed with
Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.

Dow Jones record doesn't enthrall Asia's markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with the Nikkei closing lower and Hang
Seng lower and the Straits Times Index higher at midday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Encouraged by Wall Street's surge, Asia's top three
stock markets opened higher Wednesday, but two of them soon headed
south as concerns about local issues took precedence.
	   In fact, as encouraging as the 5 percent Dow Jones climb was,
Asian bourses had already reacted earlier in the week to the cause:
speculation that America will soon lower interest rates to offset
the punishment of Asia's and Russia's economic turmoil.
	   The chit-chat about U.S. interest rates began Friday _ thanks to
a speech that day by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan _ and
Asia's markets responded with improvements Monday and Tuesday.
	   But Wall Street was closed for the Labor Day holiday Monday and
didn't have a chance to applaud Greenspan with its record 380-point
gain on the Dow Jones industrial average until Tuesday.
	   As word of New York's overnight rebound reached Asia on
Wednesday morning, people seemed happy but uncertain, given how
much turbulence has wracked the world's markets lately.
	   ``I hope it means something,'' said Ahmad Pauzi, watching the
local stocks on a monitor outside a bank in Singapore.
	   ``It will be interesting to see what happens today. If the local
index's rally continues, it's a sign that things aren't so bad. But
maybe it's a one-day thing,'' he said.
	   In Tokyo, Masahiko Shimizu, 31, an insurance salesman who had
just completed a stock transaction at Nomura Securities Co., said:
``The Dow surge won't have a direct effect on the Japanese economy.
It has its own problems, and they are mostly political.''
	   In fact, Shimizu said Japan's beleaguered stock market, which
began its slump in early 1990, might have a better chance of
advancing big time if the nation produced its own Mark McGwire
breaking a major record in baseball-obsessed Japan. ``We wish we
had such great news here,'' Shimizu said with a smile.
	   When trading began Wednesday, Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average reacted to Wall Street's exuberance by rising. But it
closed 157.95 points, or 1.07 percent, lower at 14,755.54, because
of new concerns about a major part of Asia's economic crisis _ the
weakness of Japanese banks ridden with bad loans.
	   As Japan's political parties continue to wrangle over a proposed
bailout for the banks, rumors surfaced on the market that Fuji Bank
Ltd. was facing huge derivatives losses overseas. That triggered
selling in the banking sector, traders said, even though the bank
later called the rumors ``totally groundless.''
	   In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, Wall Street initially lifted the
index Wednesday. But it fell 150.67 points, or 1.8 percent, to
8038.58 by the midday close. Traders blamed profit-taking.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index opened higher and by
midday had risen 14.72 points, or 1.6 percent, to 883.40. But the
turbulence and machinations in the markets of neighboring Malaysia
were generating as much interest as the Dow.
	   On Monday, the composite index in Malaysia rose 22 percent, and
on Tuesday it fell 21 percent, thanks to big rule changes imposed
by the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in an effort
to leave Malaysia's markets less vulnerable to speculators.
	   The government imposed sharp capital controls on Sept. 1, but on
Monday regulators said that investors and brokers could trade under
the previous rules until this Friday to get their accounts in
order. That triggered a big sell off and market tumble.
	   In Singapore, investors snapped up Malaysian over-the-counter
stocks to take advantage of their much lower local price, compared
to the Kuala Lumpur market.

Kosovo Albanians surrender arms while villages leveled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to ADD why villagers have weapons in graf 3, Serbs'
reasons for leveling villages, in 6th graf, many villages weren't
involved in fighting in 8th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZHUR, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With a ``please'' and a ``thank you,''
Serb police collected dozens of rifles, machine guns and hand
grenades from residents of this prosperous Kosovo Albanian village.
	   ``The police know now we have no guns,'' said Resat Gavazaj, a
53-year-old ethnic Albanian who helped organize the weekend weapons
collection. ``The fighting will never come here. We thank them
very, very much.''
	   Down the road, residents said the Serbs' ``polite'' requests for
their weapons, mostly bought for personal security, are backed by
implicit threats to bomb and burn farms and villages where the
inhabitants sympathize with armed resistance.
	   After driving the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from most
of its strongholds, Serb forces have launched a two-pronged
campaign in an effort to wipe out the ethnic Albanian struggle for
independence.
	   Police have been encouraging Albanians to give up their arms and
return to their homes, saying those who remain loyal to the
government have nothing to fear. Serbian state television has aired
scenes of Albanian civilians walking peacefully home past police,
who help unload food and supplies for the refugees.
	   For villages who do not cooperate, there's another message.
While police were collecting arms from Zhur last weekend, hundred
of troops were leveling four nearby villages, they accused of
harboring secessionist rebels and refusing to lay down arms.
	   Albanian sources said the attack killed at least 17 people,
injured others and left thousands without homes, clothing or food.
	   Many of the villages haven't been involved in fighting, but
rampant gun smuggling from Albania has left military weapons on
farms and in shops.
	   Serbian authorities say they have collected thousands of weapons
from ethnic Albanian villages throughout Kosovo in recent weeks.
But Albanians interviewed this week near Zhur said the Serb
campaign will only drive more Albanians into rebel ranks.
	   ``If I die with a gun in my hands, I die singing,'' said one
bleary-eyed man who witnessed the destruction of his sister's
village within kilometers (miles) of Kosovo's border with Albania.
``I don't want to fight. But who can just watch this killing of
their people.''
	   That spirit was echoed in the mountainside farming village of
Jeskovo, seven kilometers (four miles) from Zhur.
	   ``I just farm,'' said one man who returned Tuesday to salvage
silverware and other possessions from his burned-out home. ``They
took my television. They burned my home. They burned my tractor.
Maybe I resist. What else can I do?''

Brazil's old-fashioned soccer clubs to go modern _ and profitable?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By TANYA WEINBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Internazionale star Ronaldo was
returning to Italy, but his heart remained in Rio. His dream was to
play here for his first love, Flamengo.
	   But that won't happen any time soon, he said. Despite four World
Cup titles, Brazilian soccer is too big a mess.
	   ``I wouldn't return to Brazil now for any offer,'' said Ronaldo,
twice voted player of the year. ``It's a shame there's so much
disorganization, especially in Rio.''
	   The problem is the antiquated, amateurish management of
Brazilian clubs. Multi-million dollar enterprises, churning out
some of the world's best players, are run as adjuncts of
not-for-profit social clubs. Directors are die-hard fans, but not
always good businessmen.
	   The result for many of Brazil's 500-some clubs is slumping
attendance, bad contracts and growing debts.
	   While Spanish and Italian clubs play once a week to packed
stadiums and big TV audiences, top Brazilian teams suit up three
times a week or more just to pay the bills. The best players are
quickly snapped up by European and Asian clubs.
	   Ronaldo went that route in 1994, when PSV Eindhoven of the
Netherlands paid dlrs 6 million to acquire him from Cruzeiro. Three
years later, Inter of Milan had to shell out six times that much to
pry him away from Spain's Barcelona.
	   ``The foreign teams pay more, and in the end we can't keep them
here,'' said Alvaro Barcelos, who recently quit after a ruinous
stint as president of Rio's Fluminense.
	   But all that could be changing. A new law written by soccer
legend Pele, until recently Brazil's Minister of Sports, promises
to turn today's Mom-and-Pop outfits into efficient, modern
corporations.
	   Under the so-called Pele Law, soccer teams must become
companies, and private investors may hold majority control. By
2000, all teams must pay taxes and comply with financial disclosure
laws. Directors can be fired for incompetence and even prosecuted
for malfeasance.
	   For many investors, soccer suddenly looks like a good business
opportunity.
	   ``We already have market and product, quality and public,'' said
Marcos Rechtman, director of the investment bank Bozano, Simonsen,
which is discussing a partnership with Fluminense. ``All we need
now is good management.''
	   Argentina is reaching the same conclusion. Today, only two of 20
first-division teams are financially solid. Racing Club has a debt
of about dlrs 62 million, while popular River Plate owes dlrs 35
million.
	   Dismayed at rowdy fans and decaying, half-empty stadiums, the
government reportedly is pressuring soccer authorities to
professionalize team ownership and management.
	   But club directors are divided over the idea. Big, popular clubs
like Boca Juniors are in favor, mostly because they can muster the
corporate backing to thrive in the new climate. But smaller clubs
fear they won't survive.
	   Although a shakeout is likely, the potential still is enormous.
Brazil alone has 160 million people, and soccer is akin to a
religion _ the 13 largest clubs alone have an estimated 100 million
fans.
	   Yet in 1997, all Brazilian teams combined made just dlrs 100
million from TV contracts, barely more than the dlrs 90 million
earned by England's Manchester United alone.
	   The first step is to bring in top-flight, independent
management, says Elena Landau of fund manager Opportunity S.A.,
which is working on a deal with Flamengo.
	   Landau sees a potential goldmine in Flamengo, a club with 25
million fans and five national titles. But in the past five years,
Flamengo has been cited 372 times in lawsuits for late or
non-payment of taxes and salaries. Its debt is put at dlrs 60
million.
	   ``We want to go straight to the London market,'' said Landau,
who used to head the Brazilian government's privatization program.
Shares of English clubs already trade there, and she expects
investors in Flamengo stock to generate revenue to buy big-name
stars _ maybe even Ronaldo.
	   Opportunity broke ground when it paid dlrs 15 million for a 51
percent stake in Esporte Clube Bahia, S.A., a traditional club in
northeastern Brazil that had fallen on hard times.
	   The injection wiped out the club's dlrs 10 million debt, and
three months later Bahia was state champion. Now Opportunity is
renegotiating Bahia's contract with Korean automaker Hyundai,
asking for dlrs 13.5 million, up from dlrs 1.8 million last year.
	   ``The object of the professionalization of soccer management is
to have big companies use soccer to market their brands,'' says
Alceu Lisboa, an executive at Esporte Clube Bahia.
	   The biggest deal so far belongs to NationsBank Corp. of the
United States. The bank will invest dlrs 150 million in current
national champion Vasco da Gama of Rio to refurbish its stadium and
handle all marketing for the club for 10 years.
	   Across town, Fluminense hopes Bozano, Simonsen is the answer to
its problems. The century-old club of Rio's elite _ former FIFA
President Joao Havelange is a member _ is mired in the second
division, with salaries months behind and a debt of nearly dlrs 30
million.
	   But director Rechtman has certain conditions. The bank wants
Fluminense to be part of an independent league, beyond the politics
of the Rio Soccer Federation. And it wants to run soccer on a
strictly-business basis.
	   ``Mixing business with a national passion leads to
irrationality, which is everything the investor doesn't want,'' he
says.
	   Will that reduce Brazil's national passion to a cold bottom
line?
	   No, says Rio sociologist (and Flamengo fan) Ronaldo Helal.
``It's modernization that will save a tradition,'' he says.
``Anything that kills the passion is bad for business.''

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police scuffled with protesters
and fired warning shots Wednesday when about 4,000 demonstrators
staged one of the biggest protests so far against Indonesia's
president over skyrocketing food prices.
	   Students from several universities and supporters of prominent
opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri gathered near the office of
the governor of East Java where President B.J. Habibie was staying
during a visit to Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya.
	   The protesters were spilt into two groups by hundreds of
security personnel in riot gear. Armored vehicles were also
stationed nearby.
	   Witnesses said riot police fired two or three shots into the air
to disperse a protesting crowd in one city street. The
demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans and waved red and
white Indonesian flags.
	   ``We don't want Habibie. We want lower food prices'' read one
banner.
	   ``Reject Habibie! Reject Habibie!'' the protesters shouted.
	   The protest was one of the biggest so far against Habibie, who
came to power in May after riots and protests forced authoritarian
President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
	   The president on Wednesday left the governor's office after
several hours and boarded a plan to Jakarta.
	   He earlier canceled a planned visit to a new sports complex in a
neighboring town because of disturbances along a highway.
	   After Habibie's departure, thousands of protesters pushed
through a line of troops and demonstrated on the steps of the
white-pillared governor's office.
	   Earlier witnesses said several protesters were beaten and
arrested by security personnel. Police, however, reported no
arrests.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police were deployed across the
city, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, after students
said they would stage a big march against Habibie.
	   Despite the large security presence, the number of protesters
continued to grow through the morning. Some witnesses said members
of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing vehicles.
	   Habibie entered the governor's office and officiated at a
ceremony in a sports stadium to mark Indonesia's national sports
day.
	   He called on Indonesians to remain calm.
	   ``In dealing with these heavy challenges, I would like to call
on all people to remain patience and clear mind,'' he said.
	   Indonesia has been wracked by social unrest since it entered its
worst economic crisis in three decades. Habibie, a long time friend
of Suharto, maintains he has done much to attack corruption and
nepotism that plagued Indonesia's ailing economy.
	   There has been growing discontent among many of Indonesia's 202
million people as prices for basic food and other commodities soar
and unemployment climbs. Protests, looting and riots have hit
several cities and towns in recent weeks as criticism of Habibie's
presidency mounts.

Russia awaits signal from president to break political deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:UPDATES grafs 7-9 with Communists threatening impeachment,
EDITS to conform, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's political crisis whirled in a holding
pattern Wednesday as the country waited for word from President
Boris Yeltsin on whether he would agree to a compromise candidate
for prime minister.
	   Yeltsin had not made a decision on the prime minister's post and
was considering measures to stabilize the economic situation,
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters
Wednesday morning.
	   ``We are waiting for the decision of the president,'' he said,
refusing to speculate on possible candidates for the post.
	   A compromise candidate could resolve a deadlock between the
president and parliament that has paralyzed the political system
even as the country's economy descends deeper into crisis.
	   Ever since the lower chamber, the State Duma, resoundingly
rejected his unpopular choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
Yeltsin has been meeting with aides, but has said nothing publicly.
	   In previous situations, he has made a new nomination within
hours of a no vote, and the delay spurred speculation he was
considering a change of heart.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned Wednesday that the Duma
would begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. A vote to start impeachment
proceedings blocks Yeltsin from dissolving the Duma.
	   ``If Chernomyrdin is nominated again we will immediately launch
the impeachment motion,'' he told journalists.
	   But the Duma needs a two-thirds majority to begin impeachment,
and government supporters predicted it could not be passed.
	   Yeltsin has one more chance to propose a candidate _ either
Chernomyrdin or someone else. If the Duma rejects the third choice,
Yeltsin is required to disband the chamber and call new elections -
unless an impeachment motion is passed.
	   Opposition and religious leaders warned Tuesday that unless a
solution is found quickly, the political standoff could spark civil
war.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, a presidential aspirant,
said Wednesday he was ready to take charge of the government,
adding that Yeltsin should resign. ``A paralysis of power is
obvious now,'' he said.
	   The nation's top clergyman, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II,
even prayed publicly before Russia's holiest icon, Our Lady of
Vladimir, seeking divine protection against ``misfortunes, sorrows
and internecine war.''
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. Two names that have prompted the
greatest speculation among lawmakers are Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a statement circulated Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry,
Primakov said he would not agree to take the prime minister's post.
Luzhkov, too, coyly denied he'd been negotiating for the job.
	   Noting that he was already ``prime minister of the Moscow
government,'' Luzhkov asked ``Is that so little?,'' the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the economy continued its skid. The ruble, which
bought about 16 cents last month, is now worth around 5 cents.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
also began forming at gas stations.
	   Apparently seeking to slow the deterioration, Chernomyrdin moved
late Tuesday to put at least some of his economic program into
motion.
	   He instructed tax police to start raids Thursday on firms
suspected of gouging, ordered a swift cut in oil excise taxes, and
directed the Central Bank to require exporters to sell half their
hard currency proceeds for rubles. He also announced that customs
officers can now collect duties in foreign currencies, Interfax
said.
	   He named Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax
chief, to be Russia's chief envoy to the International Monetary
Fund, Interfax reported.
	   In another step to increase tax collections, the acting
government decided to transfer the tax accounts of the country's 50
biggest companies to the Central Bank, the Federal Treasury and two
large, state-owned banks _ Sberbank, the Savings Bank, and
Vneshtorgbank, the Bank for Foreign Trade.

Philippines to borrow dlrs 260 million from IMF precautionary fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank said
Wednesday it plans to borrow some dlrs 260 million from a dlrs 1.37
billion precautionary loan arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund by the end of this year.
	   The government decided to borrow the money because of renewed
uncertainties in world markets, Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said.
	   Singson also reiterated that the Philippines will not follow
Malaysia's lead in imposing capital controls as a means of easing
market pressures, although some leading Philippine businessmen have
recently called for a moderate form of currency controls.
	   The borrowing from the standby loan arrangement must still be
approved by the IMF's board in Washington, Singson said.
	   After over two weeks of talks, the government and the IMF have
finalized new economic and fiscal targets for 1998 and the coming
year. The targets are part of the conditions the IMF has set for
the Central Bank to tap the standby loan to boost its foreign
reserves.
	   In a joint statement, the IMF and Central Bank noted that the
Philippine government regards the loan merely as a precautionary
arrangement.
	   When the standby loan was granted in April, the central bank
said it would be used mainly as a war chest to repel ``extreme''
speculative attacks on the peso.
	   Recent months have seen sporadic bouts of volatility in the peso
triggered mainly by falls in the Japanese yen and fears of a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan.
	   The Central Bank has repeatedly said that adjustments in its
interest rates will remain its main defense to quell currency
volatility by regulating the amount of money available for
speculation.
	   The precautionary loan has less stringent conditions attached to
it than for full borrowing programs, such as the IMF's bailouts for
Indonesia and Thailand.
	   The Philippines was the IMF's first patient in Asia, but exited
earlier this year from over three decades of full borrowing
programs and close supervision.
	   At present, the government intends to access some dlrs 1 billion
in loans from various multilateral and bilateral sources this year
to fund numerous projects and reforms.

Amnesty accuses Israel, Palestinians of rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat spokesman not immediately available for
comment &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amnesty International has accused Israel and
the Palestinian Authority of extensive human rights violations in
the five years since the signing of the Oslo agreements with the
Palestinians, according to a report released Wednesday.
	   In a 40-page report, the London-based human rights group said
more than 10,000 Palestinians have been arrested by the Israeli
security forces and routinely subjected to torture under
interrogation.
	   Amnesty accused Israel's Supreme Court of legitimizing the use
of torture and detention without trial. The international human
rights group also criticized an Israeli commission's endorsement of
the right of Israeli security forces to kill suspected terrorists
anywhere in the world.
	   The Palestinian Authority has also committed rights violations,
Amnesty said. It said most of the 19 Palestinians who have died in
the custody of Palestinian security forces were accused of
``collaboration'' with Israel.
	   ``Those particularly liable to suffer torture ... are suspected
`collaborators' including those accused of selling land to Jews,''
the report says.
	   In the preamble to the report and the press release on it,
Amnesty said the Authority also had targeted Palestinians opposed
to the peace process, partially because of pressure from Israel and
the United States.
	   The report said Israel contributed to the suicide bombings
carried out by Palestinian Islamic militants in Israeli cities.
	   ``In a spiral of violence, killings of Palestinians by Israeli
security services or settlers have led to suicide bombings and the
deaths of Israeli civilians,'' the report said.
	   A senior Israeli official criticized the report.
	   David Bar-Illan, an advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
told The Associated Press the Palestinian Authority's worst human
rights violations were not against opponents of the peace process
but against those who favored cooperation with Israel.
	   ``They haven't killed a single Hamas terrorist,'' he said.
	   ``To blame the dictatorial, corrupt and arbitrary regime of the
Palestinian Authority, which has executed people without a trial
for selling land to Jews _ to blame this on Israeli and American
pressure is to insult history and plain common sense,'' he said.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, could not immediately be reached for comment.

Japan's Matsushita to shut down U.S.-based chipmaking operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's
largest consumer electronics manufacturer, said Wednesday it will
close down its computer chipmaking operations in the United States
by year's end.
	   The move will affect about 340 employees at Matsushita
Semiconductor Corp.'s factory in Puyallup, Washington, Matsushita
Electric said in a statement.
	   Matsushita Semiconductor is an affiliate of the larger,
Osaka-based Matsushita Electric Industrial. Matsushita markets
products under the Panasonic, Quasar, National and Technics brand
names.
	   The decision to shutter the American semiconductor factory
followed similar moves to withdraw from U.S.-based chip production
by rivals Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
	   All three Japanese electronics makers have been hit hard by a
global glut in computer memory chips which has pushed down prices
and eroded profits.
	   Matsushita Electric said in May that its group net profit fell
by a third during the course of the fiscal year ended in March,
largely as a result of lower product prices.
	   The Puyallup facility was set up in 1991 and had primarily
manufactured 4-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips,
Japan's Kyodo News reported.

Imprisoned Leeson back in prison after operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The former securities trader blamed for the
1995 collapse of Barings Bank has been transferred back to prison
after having a cancerous tumor removed from his colon last month, a
British diplomat said Wednesday.
	   Nick Leeson, 31, was diagnosed with cancer Aug. 5 after serving
more than 2 1/2 years of a 6 1/2 year prison sentence for fraud and
forgery that led to the failure of Britain's oldest merchant bank.
	   A week after the diagnosis he underwent surgery at New Changi
Hospital, not part of Changi Prison, where he has been serving his
sentence.
	   The British consular official would not say when Leeson had been
transferred back to Changi Prison, nor would he comment on the
status of Leeson's appeal to the Singapore government for early
release.
	   Doctors gave Leeson a 70 percent chance of living another five
years, and said there was a 30 percent chance his cancer could
recur within the next two years, his London lawyer, Stephen
Pollard, has said.
	   The cancer had not spread to his lymph nodes, so he was not
undergoing chemotherapy.
	   In Singapore, pleas for early release on compassionate grounds
pass through several levels of bureaucracy before the Cabinet makes
a recommendation to President Ong Teng Cheong. Ong himself is
suffering from a recurrence of lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic
system.

Opposition schedules new mass protest amid clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout and UPDATES with prince saying Hun Sen
triggering revolution, opposition seeking mass protest Sunday. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defiant opposition leaders vowed
Wednesday to intensify mass protests against strongman Hun Sen,
even as riot police used clubs, guns, cattle prods and water cannon
to scatter rock-throwing demonstrators demanding his ouster.
	   About 1,000 protesters were dispersed by police in clashes near
the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. Some regrouped later in smaller clusters around
the city until police would arrive to scatter them again.
	   Ranariddh told supporters of his FUNCINPEC party that Hun Sen
sparked a ``real revolution'' by sending police Tuesday with clubs,
bamboo canes and shock prods to destroy a protest camp at the
National Assembly, smashing a 16-day vigil against his rule.
	   An angry Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy applied for
legal permission to hold a peaceful mass rally Sunday.
	   ``It is in the interests of this government to authorize a
peaceful demonstration, rather than letting what is happening now
to continue,'' the prince said. ``It's now time for Mr. Hun Sen to
stop using violence.''
	   Such rallies have drawn as many as 20,000 people. One now, legal
or not, could provoke more violence as Hun Sen moves to reassert
the power he has held for 13 years.
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago, but there has been
only one confirmed death since the crackdown began.
	   Hun Sen drew a tougher line following a grenade attack Monday
against his home. He was not present at the time and has denied
opposition allegations that he staged the attack as a pretext.
	   Sam Rainsy sought refuge in the local U.N. offices at the luxury
Cambodiana hotel after Hun Sen ordered his arrest. The order has
been rescinded, but his supporters doubt Hun Sen's intentions.
	   Sam Rainsy emerged from the offices, with a U.N. escort, to meet
Ranariddh on Wednesday. He called the violence ``unacceptable'' and
the allegations he was behind the grenade attack ``ridiculous.''
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s representative, was traveling to the
northern city of Siem Reap to enlist the help of King Norodom
Sihanouk, the prince's father, to defuse the crisis.
	   The prince said the violence was deepening, not resolving, the
deadlock resulting from July 26 parliamentary elections that Hun
Sen's party won, but failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of massive electoral fraud and
has threatened to withhold support, raising the prospect Cambodia
could soon have no legal goverment.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a Buddhist monk was wounded in the leg when
police fired volleys of warning shots to scatter protesters, mostly
motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped near the U.S. Embassy and
Ranariddh's residence.
	   Police formed skirmish lines in the narrow, pot-holed streets,
then charged the protesters and journalists, clubbing people
trapped against the walls to the ground. A group of 30 praying
monks were sent packing with water cannon.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   About 120 people earlier sought protection under the walls of
the embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out Tuesday
from their protest camp, which they had dubbed Democracy Square.
	   They said they could not return to their villages, since the Hun
Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her, said
that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old son
for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy.''
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the wasteland that remained of
Democracy Square. A tractor cleared the rest as armed police stood
guard.

Netanyahu cancels trip to Georgia at last minute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu phoning Shevarnadze

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Wednesday cancelled a trip to the Georgian capital Tbilisi because
of influenza, his spokesman said.
	   Reporters were already on Netanyahu's plane at Ben-Gurion
airport when his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky came on board and told
them the trip was off.
	   ``A doctor who examined what his condition is this morning
determined that it would be better if the prime minister remained
at home for a day or two,'' Bushinsky said.
	   On Tuesday night Netanyahu cut short a marathon cabinet
discussion on next year's state budget, because he felt unwell.
	   Early Wednesday morning a leading cardiologist, Andre Keren, was
called to tthe prime minister's residence and found that he had
influenza.
	   ``The prime minister last night suffered from exhaustion. The
source of the exhaustion was not clear. ... Today it became clear
that he is suffering from influenza,'' Dr. Keren told Army radio.
	   Netanyahu was to have made a one-day visit to Tbilisi to take
part in celebrations marking the 2.600th anniversary of the Jewish
presence in Georgia.
	   Because of his illness he will be represented at the
celebrations by Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Katsav and Israel's two
chief rabbis, Bushinsky said.
	   Netanyahu phoned Georgian President Edouard Shevarnadze and
apologized for the cancellation, Bushinsky said.
	   In view of the doctor's statement it was not clear whether
Netanyahu would be able to meet the American peace envoy Dennis
Ross Thursday for talks on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
and the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.

Ousted Anwar steps up reform campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, under virtual house
arrest since he was sacked as deputy prime minister last week,
called on supporters Wednesday to help spread his political reform
campaign nationwide.
	   ``We must spread the news. No power on earth can break our
spirits. You have to work now. Now! Now! Now!'' Anwar told a small
group of cheering supporters in his living room.
	   Anwar, who was dumped last week from his posts of deputy prime
minister and finance minister, canceled a nationwide tour Tuesday
to launch his political reform campaign.
	   Anwar said the tour was canceled because supporters from around
the country were traveling to him, but he was also concerned for
his personal safety. Aside from a walk Friday to a nearby mosque,
Anwar has been holed up at home, greeting throngs of supporters in
his living room and backyard.
	   Rumors have been rampant of Anwar's imminent arrest. He is under
police investigation for allegations ranging from sexual misconduct
to treason. He has declared his innocence and pledged to tell his
side of the story, which has been blacked out by the
government-backed media.
	   ``I want them to understand my side of the story,'' Anwar said
Wednesday. ``I want them to understand the rationale for reform.''
	   Verbal attacks between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Mahathir
and Anwar intensified Tuesday when the prime minister called Anwar
immoral and accused him of courting arrest to become a political
martyr.
	   Mahathir, who called a special meeting Tuesday to explain
Anwar's sacking to 3,500 members of the ruling United Malays
National Organization, told reporters after that Anwar was sacked
from his government posts and the ruling United Malays National
Organization on moral grounds.
	   Anwar responded to Mahathir's comments indignantly Tuesday
night, drawing uproarious chants from the crowd for ``Reformasi!''
_ or reform _ the rallying cry for the Indonesian student movement.
	   ``It's the law of the jungle,'' Anwar bellowed through a
microphone to an audience of about 6,000. He noted there were no
formal charges against him but the ruling party had already
determined his guilt.
	   Anwar's speeches have been circulating around the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, on video and cassette recordings, on sale outside his home.
The tapes, originally recorded in Bahasa Malaysia, have been
translated to English.
	   He called on supporters to distribute the tapes around the
country and stick newly printed bumper stickers to their car
windows that say: ``Reformation! Justice!''
	   ``Do I hate Dr. Mahathir? No, I remember his good deeds. But you
must also respect and honor justice and that means fighting for
reformation,'' Anwar said, punching a fist to an open palm.
	   His home showed signs of being transformed into a full-fledged
political command post. Workers set up a platform in anticipation
of Wednesday night's speech.
	   Supporters vowed to stick by Anwar's side, despite Mahathir's
official denouncement.
	   ``I'm ready to go for broke,'' said Saifuddin Nasution,
secretary of the powerful UMNO youth wing, which has pledged
loyalty to Mahathir. ``I'll continue to support Anwar till the end
no matter what happens.''

Australian swimmers heavily favored; journalists bitter about beer
</HEADLINE>
prices &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's swimmers are expected
to rack up the medals at the Commonwealth Games.
	   The nation's 41-member swimming squad includes seven past and
present Olympic and world champions, and claimed 25 of 40 gold
medals at stake in the last games four years ago in Victoria,
Canada.
	   The team in Kuala Lumpur includes Kieren Perkins, world record
holder of the 400-meter, 800-meter and 1,500-meter freestyle
events. Another notable is Susie O'Neill, the world and Olympic
butterfly champion.
	   But Australian coach Don Talbot refused to predict Australia's
medal chances. ``Obviously we're going to win some,'' said Talbot.
``Even if I had a fgure in mind, I'm not going to tell you.''
	   Canada, which won seven gold medals in Victoria, along with
Britain and New Zealand have strong swimmers too.
 &UR; ___
	   Outraged over the price of beer, 10 journalists covering the
Commonwealth games on Wednesday briefly picketed the hotel housing
the media center.
	   Dubbing themselves the Press Institute for Non-Teetotallers, or
PINT, the demonstrators held pieces of paper with slogans
protesting beer charges at the Mint Hotel.
	   Managers countered the rally by offering free beer to the
disgruntled band, which included reporters from Australia and South
Africa, and said they would reduce the cost of food.
	   Beer prices range from 14 ringgit (dlrs 3.70) for a local can to
18 ringgit (dlrs 4.70) for an imported can. That's roughly double
the price elsewhere.
	   Hundreds of journalists from all over the world are in Kuala
Lumpur for the games, which officially open Friday and end Sept.
21. Five thousand athletes from 71 nations are participating.
 &UR; ___
	   Organizers at the Commonwealth Games have sold 407,000 tickets
for the two-week event for some 22 million ringgit (dlrs 5.8
million).
	   Hashim Mohd Ali, chairman of Malaysia's organizing committee,
said the figure is higher than the number of tickets sold at the
games four years ago in Victoria, Canada.
	   The committee hopes to sell another 100,000 tickets, down from
an original forecast of 800,000.
 &UR; ___
	   The Commonwealth Games are missing some some star athletes,
including sprinter Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Canada's
Donovan Bailey, the Olympic 100-meter champion and world
record-holder.
	   Fredericks pulled out after Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob
compared him unfavorably with another athlete.
	   But Michael Fennell, the head of the games federation, on
Wednesday ruled out offering prizemoney to attract more world-class
competitors.
	   ``Certainly I do not believe in it and I don't think this is a
consideration,'' Fennell said. ``In any event you always miss some
because of injury, some miss because of family reasons and some
miss because they've chosen to participate in other events.''
 &UR; ___
	   Running great Roger Bannister clocked a mile in 3:58.8 at the
1954 Commonwealth Games, but he had already broken the four-minute
mark in that year.
	   On May 6, he ran 3:59.4 in Britain in one of the most famous
achievements in sporting history. Later, at the games in Vancouver,
Canada, he beat the mark again, defeating Australian rival John
Landy.
	   The world record now belongs to Algerian Noureddine Morceli, who
ran a mile in 3:44.39.

Taiwan's pro-unification group to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China has invited the head of a
pro-unification Taiwanese group to visit Beijing amid growing
criticism that China is trying to sideline a semi-official
negotiating body seeking to improve ties.
	   Liang Su-jung, president of the Association for the Promotion of
Peaceful Unification, will head a delegation to Beijing on Saturday
to discuss trade promotion and the protection of Taiwanese' rights
on the mainland, the group said Wednesday.
	   It said the invitation was extended to Liang by China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, a
semi-official body set up to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of formal ties.
	   Taiwanese officials have criticized the ARATS for trying to
sideline its Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation, in
favor of a small number of Taiwanese groups more amenable to
China's positions.
	   Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Straits Exchange Foundation, has said
he would want to visit Beijing next month to help steer back on
tract the dialogue which was suspended three years ago.
	   But Beijing has snubbed Taiwanese calls for preliminary talks to
arrange an agenda for Koo's visit.
	   Beijing wants to push Taiwan straight into political talks, but
Taiwan wants to pick up where the dialogue left off by starting
with smaller, less-sensitive practical issues.
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949, but China still
claims Taiwan a renegade province to be reunified with force if
necessary.
	   Officials said Liang will also visit Shenyang and Changchun in
northeast China to distribute aid to victims of the recent floods
there.

Indonesian police to investigate promissory note case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police said Wednesday they
will investigate an alleged dlrs 3.5 billion illegal promissory
note scam involving a brother-in-law of former President Suharto.
	   National Police Chief Rusman Hadi confirmed that the attorney
general office has handed down the case to the police, adding that
Ibnu Hartomo, who is Suharto's brother-in-law, and Indonesia's
former Ambassador to Syria Chalid Mawardi would be questioned,
among others.
	   Their signatures appear on the notes.
	   ``Later this week, we will start interrogating those involved in
the issuance of the promissory notes,'' Rusman said.
	   Last month Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said the
promissory notes, with a face value of dlrs 3.5 billion, were
issued in 1985 when Ibnu was the deputy to the secretary general of
the Indonesian national defense and security council.
	   Yunus said the notes were illegal because in 1985 the only
government body that was allowed to issue commercial papers was the
Finance Ministry.
	   Ibnu is the brother of Suharto's late wife Siti Hartinah
Suharto. Newspaper reports said that Ibnu is now paralyzed and is
confined to his bed.

Dhaka dam likely to collapse

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Disaster officials on ``maximum
alert'' Wednesday prepared to evacuate some 600,000 people living
near a weakening dam that protects Bangladesh's capital from rising
floodwaters.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center predicted the
Dhaka-Narayanganj dam would collapse Wednesday. It noted breaches
at 36 points and rising river levels, putting further pressure on
the structure. Some people living near the dam, which holds back
the Sitalakhoia River, were already fleeing their homes.
	   Half the capital is already flooded with knee-deep water, and an
influx of evacuees seeking shelter in its schools and government
offices will only add to Dhaka's woes. Authorities had not yet
ordered an evacuation Wednesday morning, but the step seemed likely
despite the hundreds of thousands of government workers and
residents stacking sandbags atop the dam.
	   Flooding has killed more than 800 people throughout Bangladesh
and displaced or marooned 35 million others since monsoon rains
began July 10. Waterborne diseases continue to spread with
hospitals reporting 175,000 serious diarrhea cases. Diarrhea can
lead to fatal dehydration.
	   This impoverished nation of 120 million people at the foot of
the Himalayas is a basin for several major rivers and is regularly
flooded. This year's floods are the deadliest in a decade, and have
lasted nearly two months, much longer than usual.
	   Weather officials issued a maximum alert and the flood control
center said the situation in and around Dhaka, a city of 9 million,
was reaching ``a serious proportion.''
	   An official at the Water Development Board, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that all major
highways connecting the capital with rest of the country were at
least partially underwater.
	   The government Tuesday asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign
aid, up from the dlrs 879 million it had earlier requested. The
country needs dlrs 112 million immediately, the government said.
Bangladesh has so far received pledges totaling dlrs 104 million.
	   The U.N. World Food Program diverted a ship headed to Africa
with 15,000 tons of wheat to Bangladesh. The ship was expected to
reach Bangladesh next week, according to a government press release
Wednesday.

Report: Police step up security in violence-stricken enclave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Macau police has stepped up security in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau a day after bombings
wounded 14 journalists and five police officers, reports said
Wednesday.
	   Police also rounded up six men related to the bomb attacks early
Wednesday, but they declined to say whether any arrests had been
made, government-owned Radio Hong Kong said.
	   Early Tuesday, a home-made bomb planted in a motorcycle
exploded, injuring a group of journalists and policemen who were at
the scene to investigate an earlier, smaller blast on the same
street.
	   Police blamed triad gangs for the attack, calling it a
``two-pronged act of organized crime intimidation against police
and journalists,'' covering criminal activities in the enclave.
	   Seven journalists and five police officers remained hospitalized
in stable condition Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists
issued a letter to Macau's Portuguese governor, Vasco Rocha Vieira,
condemning the attack and urging police to investigate the
incident.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Officials from mainland China, which will reassume the enclave's
sovereignty in December 1999, had pledged support and urged Macau
to take tougher acts against crimes following Tuesday's blasts.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. It has a
population of about 450,000.

Terror suspect wanted for more than 20 years arrested in village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police entered a bar in a tiny Normandy
village and arrested a German believed to be a former accomplice of
``Carlos the Jackal'' and wanted for a bloody 1975 terror attack,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Hans Joachim Klein, 51, had been sought for more than 20 years.
He is believed to have taken part in a 1975 attack against OPEC oil
ministers in Vienna, where three people were killed.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Illich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is in a French jail
serving a life sentence for a triple murder.
	   Klein had been living under a false identity in
Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume, a village of about 300 people, for
five years. Townspeople called him Dick, and believed he was a
journalist.
	   At about 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, plainclothes police barged into
the only bar in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume and surprised Klein
drinking his nightly beer.
	   In Germany, the Federal Crime Office in Wiesbaden confirmed that
Klein had been arrested in France.
	   ``He was well integrated into the village,'' said the town's
mayor, Remy Clerembaux, in a telephone interview.
	   ``For everyone here he was Dick,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``He said he wrote articles and books, but it was clear
he was a bit marginal, because he always lived alone and never had
guests.''
	   In 1978, Klein gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine in
which he renounced terrorism.
	   Since 1975, he had been sighted in Algeria, Yemen and Libya, but
then intelligence services lost track of him.
	   Ramirez, one of the world's most-wanted terrorists during the
Cold War, was convicted last December of shooting two French police
investigators and a Lebanese man.

Head of Japan's nuclear program vows to regain people's trust
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's state-run nuclear power company has
reformed itself and will regain the public's trust following a
series of accidents and coverups at reactors, the company's new
president said Wednesday.
	   The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, or
Donen, launched a restructuring program last year and the new
company will open Oct. 1 as the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development
Institute.
	   ``Our major obligation is to regain the public trust as soon as
possible and the new organization will attach the top priority on
the guarantee of safety.'' Donen President Yasumasa Togo told
reporters.
	   Togo, who was named president of the company in July after a
career in academia, also promised greater transparency in the
company's operations.
	   ``We believe that openness in exchanging information is the very
basis of the survival of our organization,'' he said.
	   Togo said that the long restructuring process that began in
April of last year after a fire and explosion at a Donen nuclear
facility has resulted in a trimmer, more efficient and more
responsible company.
	   He also said that the new company will intensify research into
effective ways to dispose of nuclear waste, which has been a source
of deep controversy in Japan.
	   ``Disposal of high-level nuclear waste is the most important
challenge to the nuclear energy community,'' he said. ``The new
organization will function as the core of research and development
of these efforts.''
	   Japan's faith in nuclear power was shaken after plant officials
tried to cover up the extent of damage from a fire at Donen nuclear
reprocessing facility in March 1997 that exposed 37 workers to
low-level radiation.
	   The first major stain on the company's reputation came in 1995
when officials were forced to admit they concealed the severity of
a liquid sodium leak at the prototype Monju reactor in western
Japan.
	   Natural resources poor Japan now has 51 commercial nuclear power
plants, supplying about one-third of the nation's electricity,
according to government figures.

 &UR; Amnesty International: Israel, Palestinians violate human rights &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinian Authority have
consistently violated human rights in the name of security in the
five years since they signed their first peace agreement, the human
rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday.
	   During the five-year period, Israel has arrested more than 8,000
Palestinians and routinely subjected them to torture, the
London-based group said in a 40-page report.
	   Israel's Supreme Court has legitimized the use of torture and
detention without trial, the report said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has detained hundreds of suspected
Islamic militants and collaborators, and 19 people have died in
detention, most as a result of torture, the group said.
	   David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the detentions were a necessary tool to protect
Israel and save lives.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   However, Hanan Ashrawi, a human rights campaigner and until
recently a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said the deaths in
detention were ``a source of serious concern.''
	   Amnesty said both sides engaged in human rights violations in
the name of security, but the Palestinian population has become the
main victim of the violations.
	   It said some of the Palestinian Authority's violations were
carried out under pressure from the United States and Israel, which
have called for a crackdown on Islamic militants responsible for
more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   ``In a spiral of violence, killings of Palestinians by Israeli
security services or settlers have led to suicide bombings (by
Islamic militants) and the deaths of Israeli civilians,'' the
report said. ``These have led to waves of arbitrary arrests,
incommunicado detention, torture and unfair trials.''
	   Bar-Illan, the Netanyahu adviser, accused Amnesty of using ``an
obnoxious double standard.''
	   He said the report did not give sufficient weight to the Hamas
suicide bombings and bristled at the claim that Israel was
pressuring the Palestinian Authority to violate human rights.
	   Most of those targeted by the Palestinian Authority were people
suspected of cooperation with Israel, he said.
	   ``To blame the dictatorial, corrupt and arbitrary regime of the
Palestinian Authority ... on Israeli and American pressure is to
insult history and plain common sense,'' he said.
	   In its report, Amnesty also said that an Israeli commission of
inquiry has endorsed the principle of allowing Israeli security
forces to kill suspected terrorists anywhere in the world.
	   The commission had criticized the Israeli security services for
botching the assassination of Khalid Mashaal, an Islamic militant
leader in Jordan, last year, but it did not question the
government's decision to carry out such operations, the report
said.

China drags away dissident; Robinson says respect human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and UPDATES with comment from Robinson spokesman,
Chinese official &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Challenging China's policy that economic growth
comes before civil liberties, U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson said
Wednesday that development and respect for human rights go
together.
	   Moments before Robinson confronted China's priorities during a
speech in a luxurious Beijing hotel, plainclothes police and hotel
security dragged away the wife of a jailed, ailing dissident who
was seeking the U.N. high commissioner's help.
	   ``I want to see Miss Mary,'' Chu Hailan screamed as she was
pulled through the Hilton Hotel lobby and out a rear door. Her
whereabouts were not immediately known.
	   Arriving at the hotel minutes later, Robinson said she knew
nothing about the case but ``obviously, I would be concerned about
any issue such as that.'' Her spokesman Jose Diaz later said
Robinson planned to raise the incident with the Foreign Ministry.
	   The police action threatened to muddy the careful path both
Robinson and Chinese leaders hoped her visit would take. Hers is
the first ever official mission to China by a U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, and both sides want it to end the
confrontation between China and U.N. groups on human rights.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   ``China can be commended for efforts to eliminate poverty and to
meet the basic needs of all,'' Robinson said in her speech,
acknowledging the official Chinese line that development takes
precedence over political rights.
	   More pointedly, though, she described the ``right to
development'' as based on ``respect for all human rights _ whether
civil, cultural, economic, political or social _ together, as an
integrated whole _ and none of these can be fully realized without
democratic governance and the rule of law.''
	   Throughout the first four of her 10 days in China Robinson has
pressed Chinese officials on when they will meet a six-month-old
pledge to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a
key human rights treaty.
	   Robinson spent two hours with Minister of Justice Gao Changli on
Tuesday. Although details of her talks were not known, Chinese
academics complained to her Monday about excessive use of the death
penalty and police powers that allow for detention without trial,
said a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Robinson was due to leave Beijing on Wednesday afternoon. She
will spend two days in Tibet. There she plans to follow up on a
report that Tibetan prisoners were interrogated and beaten for
staging a pro-independence protest during a visit last year by a
U.N. team on arbitrary detention, the diplomatic source said.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials indicated
they did not want her to meet with government critics.
	   After Chu Hailan was prevented from meeting Robinson, Assistant
Foreign Minister Wang Guangya said the dissident had no permit to
stage a demonstration.
	   ``In order to maintain the security of the hotel and surrounding
areas, I think it is right for the public security departments to
take some measures,'' Wang told reporters.
	   A spokesman for Beijing police, who gave only his surname, Liu,
said he new nothing about Chu's detention and had no comment. Janet
Zhang, a spokeswoman for the Hilton in Beijing, also refused to
comment.
	   Chu Hailan sent a letter to Robinson on Sunday requesting a
meeting with Robinson to discuss the plight of her husband, labor
rights campaigner Liu Nianchun.
	   One of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, Liu has been in
detention for more than three years without trial. Chu has been
seeking a medical parole to treat high blood pressure, stomach
problems and other ailments.

India to buy 10 more Russian fighter jets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ India plans to buy 10 more Russian Sukhoi-30MKI
fighter jets in a contract worth about dlrs 350 million, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   The Soviet Union was India's chief arms supplier and Moscow
still supplies much of New Delhi's military equipment.
	   Under a current military agreement, the two countries are
developing anti-tactical ballistic missile systems as well as
upgrading MiG-21 fighters and T-72 tanks that India already
possesses.
	   The purchase of the Sukhoi-30MKI jets is part of an agreement
concluded in 1996 under which India agreed to purchase at least 40
Russian military jets before 2002, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The multi-purpose plane is produced in Siberia by the Irkutsk
Aircraft Production Association.
	   Russian military sales, which are usually made in dollars,
represent a valuable source of hard currency and jobs.
	   Russian officials hope that a licensing agreement with India
will lead to the production of at least 100 military aircraft for
India, the agency said.

Amusement-ride collapse in China kills one, injures eight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A chair-swing ride loaded with Chinese
children and adults collapsed, killing one person and injuring
eight in Shanghai, a city official said Wednesday.
	   Gruesome footage of the Aug. 30 accident at Zhabei Park in
Shanghai was broadcast nationwide Wednesday on state-run
television. It showed the top of the twirling umbrella-shaped ride
snapping off, throwing riders to the ground and landing on them.
	   Fifteen people were on the ride, the report said.
	   A woman in her 60s was killed, and children were among the
injured, according to an official of the Zhabei neighborhood
government who gave her name as Ms. Jiang.
	   China Central Television showed injured children, some crying in
pain, lying in hospital beds with casts on their arms or legs.
	   The neighborhood government and the Shanghai Labor Bureau are
investigating the accident, but a police spokesman who did not give
his name said no criminal charges would be filed. Telephone calls
to the Labor Bureau were not answered.
	   Shanghai city safety inspectors quoted by CCTV blamed the
accident on faulty welding. They said inspectors failed to detect
it because they had no way to look inside the large metal
structure.

PECC experts call for strong APEC statement on economic reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 100 economic experts from
Asia-Pacific nations said in a statement released Wednesday that
leaders need to make a strong commitment to liberalization and
reform at the APEC summit in Malaysia.
	   Finishing a three-day meeting in Taiwan, more than 120 business,
government and research experts from 23 countries called on leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group to make statements
in November that will restore investor confidence.
	   The experts, from the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
(PECC), World Bank and Asian Development Council, said there will
be no recovery in Asia until investor confidence is bolstered and
capital flows are restored.
	   They proposed that the APEC leaders issue a statement in
November ``reaffirming their commitment to market-driven economic
integration through free and open trade and investment in the
region.''
	   The suggestion is controversial because Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who will host the APEC meeting, has just imposed
stringent curbs on currency and stock trading.
	   The economic experts expressed support for fiscal stimuli,
including subsidies, to restore demand in the countries hit by
crisis.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which has organized bail-out
aid to help South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, frowns on
subsidies.
	   The PECC is an independent organization of high-level business,
research and government representatives from 23 Asia-Pacific
countries. Its aim is to foster economic development by providing a
forum for discussion. The experts met in Taipei to discuss
recommendations to APEC and called for a coordinated regional
response to the crisis.

Philippines to borrow dlrs 260 million from IMF standby fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with new details, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With risks of another shock to Asian
markets increasing, the Philippines said Wednesday it plans to
boost its foreign reserves by tapping part of an International
Monetary Fund standby loan granted several months ago.
	   Blaming ``uncertainties'' in world markets, Philippine Central
Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the country will draw some dlrs
260 million shortly from the dlrs 1.37 billion loan arranged with
the IMF in April.
	   Closing over two weeks of talks, the Philippines and the IMF
also finalized new economic targets for 1998 and 1999 that better
reflect the tough times ahead for the country.
	   The targets are part of the conditions the IMF set for the
Philippines to tap the standby credit.
	   All told, the country plans to borrow a further dlrs 1 billion
this year from multilateral and bilateral sources to fund various
government programs and reform plans.
	   When the standby IMF loan was granted, the Central Bank said the
funds would be used to boost its foreign reserves in the event of
an ``extreme'' attack on the peso.
	   The country's foreign currency reserves at last count totaled
dlrs 10.4 billion, well below the dlrs 12.8 billion shortly before
the regional currency crisis erupted in July 1997.
	   Recent months have seen sporadic volatility in the peso
triggered mainly by falls in the Japanese yen and fears of a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan.
	   After losing a costly battle to defend the peso following the
devaluation of the Thai baht, which sparked the regional currency
crisis, the central bank has been highly reluctant to intervene on
the spot market.
	   But recent foreign debt payments have further reduced its
foreign reserves to a level that does not provide the desired three
months' worth of import funding.
	   The standby loan has less stringent conditions attached to it
than those for full borrowing programs, such as the IMF's bailouts
for Indonesia and Thailand.
	   Singson did not elaborate on the renewed threats to the
Philippine economy at a joint news conference with the IMF's Manila
representative, Henri Lorie.
	   So far, Russia's economic crisis has had a relatively muted
impact on Asian markets, but Malaysia's imposition of strict
controls on capital movements, ongoing worries over the recession
in Japan and other regional concerns all threaten a second round of
currency contagion.

Murdoch buys Manchester United for record price
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with deal announced; reaction; background,

1000 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The board of Manchester United, among the world's
wealthiest soccer clubs, has accepted a record 623.4 million pound
(dlrs 1 billion) buyout offer from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite
television company, the stock exchange announced Wednesday.
	   Murdoch-owned newspapers said the deal, which critics charge
will give the Australian-born magnate a stranglehold on televising
Premier League soccer, was clinched Tuesday night.
	   The price is the most ever paid for a sports team and far
outstrips the dlrs 350 million that Fox Sports, a division of
Murdoch's News Corp., paid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in March.
That was a record price for a baseball team.
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at about 240 pence. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198 cents) plus 0.2537
BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share.
	   On Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester
United shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   Officials of the club and the TV station scheduled a news
conference later Wednesday, opening a campaign to woo public
opinion.
	   The takeover has to be approved by shareholders and the
government. Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government has
said it will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The issue is sensitive for Blair. The Murdoch-owned Sun,
Britain's biggest selling daily newspaper, switched support from
the Conservative Party to Labor at national elections last year and
his administration is vulnerable to charges of owing Murdoch a
favor.
	   The deal provoked a storm of protest.
	   ``Murdoch wants to sit on one side of the table offering a price
for televised games then move round and sit on the other side for
Manchester United, accepting or rejecting it,'' said Joe Ashton,
chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on soccer. ``That
can't be fair.
	   The Sun, under a front-page headline, ``It's A Deal,'' and the
other big British daily newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp.,
The Times of London, reported the takeover enthusiastically. Rivals
kept up criticism.
	   ``Sold To The Red Devil,'' announced The Mirror, alongside a
front-page picture of Murdoch with horns.
	   The Financial Times said that, after 36 hours of meetings,
Manchester United board's vote was unanimous.
	   Fans said they were considering demonstrations at Old Trafford,
the club's ground.
	   ``I doubt very much if he (Murdoch) even knows where Old
Trafford is,'' commented former Manchester United manager Tommy
Docherty.
	   David Mellor, a former sports minister, said he was concerned
``this proud club with all its traditions'' could become ``just a
pawn in a global media power-play by Rupert Murdoch.''

British empire has faded, but Commonwealth Games bigger than ever
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Britain's mighty, globe-spanning
empire is no more, but the sporting extravaganza that it spawned in
1930, the Commonwealth Games, has ballooned in size.
	   So many athletes are vying for medals this year that events
kicked off Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony on the
outskirts of the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Competitors jousted with one another on cricket pitches,
badminton courts, hockey fields and shooting ranges while others
with some idle moments roamed the city's Chinatown, Little India
and a shopping mall at the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest
building in the world.
	   Still more athletes flew into the city's new airport, a sleek
and glittering showpiece that was finished quickly for the first
Commonwealth Games ever to be held in Asia. Others have been held
in Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.
	   Shaken by political and economic turbulence, Malaysia is banking
on the games to lend some zest to its image. The economy of the
Southeast Asian nation is in full-blown recession and Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad last week fired Anwar Ibrahim, his
deputy.
	   Blissfully unaware of the country's woes, the games mascot _ an
orangutan named Wira _ grins and happily clutches sporting
instruments on logos, posters and other paraphernalia that
proliferate in hotels and stadiums. Wira means ``warrior'' in
Malaysian.
	   About 5,000 athletes from some 70 nations are competing in the
event, compared to 3,200 at the 1994 games in Victoria, Canada.
	   Held every four years, the competition was inaugurated in
Hamilton, Canada 68 years ago with the title of ``British Empire
Games.'' Then colonies under London's yoke, participants today are
independent nations.
	   There are 16 sports in Malaysia, the largest number at a
Commonwealth event so far.
	   From 2002, when the Commonwealth Games are scheduled to be held
in Manchester, there will be a limit of 14 sports, including a
maximum of four team events.
	   Questions linger about the relevance of the Commonwealth Games,
which are modeled on the Olympic Games, but enjoy only a fraction
of the prestige.
	   The event has drawn some top athletes, including Peter Nicol of
Scotland, the No. 1 squash player in the world. But many have
skipped it for engagements elsewhere that offer prize money.
	   ``It is a bit difficult to compete with some of the rewards that
are being offered,'' said Michael Fennell, chairman of the
Commonwealth Games Federation.
	   The games have weathered rougher challenges. In 1986, 32 nations
boycotted the event in Edinburgh, Scotland because of Britain's
refusal to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa.
	   For now, a more pressing worry for the athletes may be the
tropical climate in Malaysia, where temperatures often soar over 30
degrees Celsius by mid-morning.
	   Australian swimming stars Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe have been
ordered to rest during the opening ceremony Friday, a day before
they try to crack the world record in the 200-meter freestyle.
	   ``They're going to be standing out in the heat for a long, long
time and that's not conducive to good swimming the next day,'' said
Australian head coach Don Talbot.
	   In keeping with tradition, the British royal family will add
aristocratic glitter to the Commonwealth Games.
	   Queen Elizabeth II will preside over the closing ceremony on
Sept. 21 and Prince Edward, trailed by photographers, on Tuesday
visited the international media center in a hotel ringed by
highways.
	   As his guides explained the computer technology being used at
the games, the royal scion asked: ``Does it work?''

Australian growth will shrink to nothing by 2000, predicts
</HEADLINE>
economist &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's economy will suffer zero
growth and double digit unemployment by 2000 as the Asian economic
crisis and a global economic slowdown take effect, a leading
economist forecasted Wednesday.
	   Peter Brain, the executive director of Australia's National
Institute for Economic and Industry Research, said growth in most
of the world's economies would slow in the next two years.
	   ``Unfortunately as we see the events unfolding before our eyes,
the international environment is quite poor,'' Brain, one of few
analysts to see th4e Asian economic crisis coming, told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``This will mean the impact on us will be a grinding down of the
Australian growth rate to zero levels by about 2000,'' he said
adding that the number of jobless Australians will grow by at least
300,000.
	   In an article in this week's Bulletin magazine, Brain predicted
growth rates would continue to be negligible in Australia until at
least 2002 to keep the present account deficit at less than 7
percent of gross domestic product.
	   He said on radio he was 60 to 70 percent confident his
predictions would come to pass.
	   Brain said his predictions for Australia were based on
contractions in the economies of Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and
Malaysia of between five and 15 percent forecast for the next 12
months.
	   He predicted growth in Japan would contract by about 2 percent
and China by 2 percent to zero over the next two years.
	   The events in Russia over the last two weeks meant that
country's economy would contract between 10 percent and 15 percent
over the next 18 months and Britain was entering a period of very
low growth.
	   Growth in the United States in the past six years had been
driven by a tremendous build up in debt which had to come to an
end, he said.
	   Australian Finance Minister John Fahey dismissed the predictions
as doom and gloom which flew in the face of expert, optimistic
treasury analysis and indicators pointing to continuing economic
growth.

Experimental U.S. equipment to help Flight 111 search

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ American reinforcements are arriving
to help find the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111, including a U.S.
Navy salvage ship and a Navy scientific team equipped with an
experimental laser camera to cut through the undersea gloom.
	   The camera, set to arrive Wednesday along with a newly developed
and more powerful sonar, is expected to provide investigators with
images to map and locate objects as small as a seashell, said Gary
Kekelis, who heads the sensing technologies division at the Navy's
Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, Florida.
	   A Canadian navy spokesman, Lt. Commander Mike Considine, said
the help is welcome.
	   ``Let's face it, the U.S. Navy is probably the most capable in
the world,'' he said. ``We would like to think that if the tables
were reversed and there was something we could do to help them, we
would.''
	   The salvage ship, the USS Grapple, helped with the undersea
recovery of wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996. It
was arriving in Halifax Wednesday with 30 divers on board, as well
as equipment for lifting large wreckage from the seabed.
	   On Tuesday, investigators released a more complete version of
the last minutes of conversation between the Swissair pilots and an
air traffic control tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   New details in the transcript included sounds consistent with
the pilots donning oxygen masks. The pilots also tell the
controllers they would have to fly the plane manually instead of by
autopilot.
	   Most of the conversation, which was heavy in technical
terminolgy, involves directing the plane to an area over water
where it can dump fuel. At one point, one pilot asks another, in
German, if he has the emergency checklist for solving problems with
smoke in the air conditioning system.
	   Canadian divers are trying to retrieve the plane's cockpit-voice
recorder, which is still on the sea bottom. A signal from that
recorder has been detected, but bad weather Tuesday forced a
one-day halt in diving operations.
	   The plane's other ``black box'' _ the flight data recorder has
been recovered and sent to a laboratory in Ottawa for examination.
	   Canadian divers have also been trying to confirm if three large
pieces of wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections
of the plane's fuselage.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, expressed hopes of
gaining valuable data from the data recorder even though it stopped
working during the final six minutes before the plane crashed into
the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on
board.
	   The recorder, retrieved by divers 190 feet (57 meters)
underwater, might show how systems aboard the plane failed between
the pilots' initial distress call 16 minutes before the crash and
when the machine shut off, he said.
	   Gerden also said investigators have detected signs of heat
damage on fragments of the MD-11's cockpit, evidence that could
help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots before the
jetliner crashed.
	   Gerden said the signs of heat stress have been found so far only
on wreckage from the cockpit, not from the passenger cabin. He
refused to speculate on the extent of the damage or the exact cause
of it.
	   Flight 111 crashed more than an hour after taking off from New
York, bound for Geneva.
	   Kekelis said the Navy equipment brought from Florida is designed
for use in coastal waters where turbid seas and underwater noise
can complicate searches with conventional sonar and photography.
	   The images will be taken from a 25-foot (7.5-meter) unmanned
torpedo-shaped craft dragged deep below the surface by the Canadian
Coast Guard boat Hudson. Surrounded by computer monitors and in
small rooms aboard the boat, the Navy team will examine the data
and report what they find to the searchers.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defiant opposition leaders vowed
Wednesday to intensify mass protests against strongman Hun Sen,
even as riot police used clubs, guns, cattle prods and water cannon
to scatter rock-throwing demonstrators demanding his ouster.
	   About 1,000 protesters were dispersed by police in clashes near
the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. Some regrouped later in smaller clusters around
the city until police would arrive to scatter them again.
	   Human-rights workers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
reported a Buddhist monk was killed by gunfire. The death could not
be confirmed. At least one and possibly two more were wounded.
	   Ranariddh told supporters of his FUNCINPEC party that Hun Sen
sparked a ``real revolution'' by sending police Tuesday with clubs,
bamboo canes and shock prods to destroy a protest camp at the
National Assembly, smashing a 16-day vigil against his rule.
	   An angry Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy applied for
legal permission to hold a peaceful mass rally Sunday.
	   ``It is in the interests of this government to authorize a
peaceful demonstration, rather than letting what is happening now
to continue,'' the prince said. ``It's now time for Mr. Hun Sen to
stop using violence.''
	   Such rallies have drawn as many as 20,000 people. One now, legal
or not, could provoke more violence as Hun Sen moves to reassert
the power he has held for 13 years.
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago.
	   Hun Sen drew a tougher line following a grenade attack Monday
against his home. He was not present and no one was hurt. Hun Sen
has denied opposition allegations that he staged the attack as a
pretext.
	   Sam Rainsy sought refuge in the local U.N. offices at the
luxurious Cambodiana hotel after Hun Sen ordered his arrest. The
order has been rescinded, but his supporters doubt Hun Sen's
intentions.
	   Sam Rainsy emerged from the offices, with a U.N. escort, to meet
Ranariddh on Wednesday. He called the violence ``unacceptable'' and
the allegations he was behind the grenade attack ``ridiculous.''
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s representative, was traveling to the
northern city of Siem Reap to enlist the help of King Norodom
Sihanouk, the prince's father, to defuse the crisis.
	   The prince said the violence was deepening, not resolving, the
deadlock resulting from July 26 parliamentary elections that Hun
Sen's party won, but failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of massive electoral fraud and
has threatened to withhold support, raising the prospect Cambodia
could soon have no legal goverment.
	   Earlier Wednesday, police fired volleys of warning shots to
scatter protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped near
the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's residence.
	   Police formed skirmish lines in the narrow, pot-holed streets,
then charged the protesters and journalists, clubbing people
trapped against the walls to the ground. A group of 30 praying
monks were sent packing with water cannon.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   About 120 people were protection under the walls of the embassy.
They were among the 1,000 people driven out Tuesday from their
protest camp, which they had dubbed Democracy Square.
	   They said they could not return to their villages, since the Hun
Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to join the protest.
	   San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her, said
that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old son
for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy.''
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the wasteland that remained of
Democracy Square. A tractor cleared the rest as armed police stood
guard.

Murdoch buys Manchester United for record price
</HEADLINE>

news conference scheduled 1000 GMT

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The board of Manchester United, among the world's
wealthiest soccer teams, agreed Wednesday to sell the club to
Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting for a record 623.4
million pounds (dlrs 1 billion).
	   Manchester United officials announced the deal at the London
Stock Exchange.
	   The price is the most ever paid for a sports team and far
outstrips the dlrs 350 million that Fox Sports, a division of
Murdoch's News Corp., paid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in March.
That was a record price for a baseball team.
	   Murdoch-owned newspapers said the Manchester United deal, which
critics charge will give the Australian-born magnate a stranglehold
on televising Premier League soccer, was clinched Tuesday night.
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at about 240 pence. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198 cents) plus 0.2537
BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share.
	   On Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester
United shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   Officials of the club and the TV station scheduled a news
conference later Wednesday, opening a campaign to woo public
opinion.
	   The takeover has to be approved by shareholders and the
government. Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government has
said it will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The issue is sensitive for Blair. The Murdoch-owned Sun,
Britain's biggest selling daily newspaper, switched support from
the Conservative Party to Labor at national elections last year and
his administration is vulnerable to charges of owing Murdoch a
favor.
	   The deal provoked a storm of protest.
	   ``Murdoch wants to sit on one side of the table offering a price
for televised games then move round and sit on the other side for
Manchester United, accepting or rejecting it,'' said Joe Ashton,
chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on soccer. ``That
can't be fair.
	   The Sun, under a front-page headline, ``It's A Deal,'' and the
other big British daily newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp.,
The Times of London, reported the takeover enthusiastically. Rivals
kept up criticism.
	   ``Sold To The Red Devil,'' announced The Mirror, alongside a
front-page picture of Murdoch with horns.
	   The Financial Times said that, after 36 hours of meetings,
Manchester United board's vote was unanimous.
	   Fans said they were considering demonstrations at Old Trafford,
the club's ground, at Wednesday night's game against Charlton.
	   ``I doubt very much if he (Murdoch) even knows where Old
Trafford is,'' commented former Manchester United manager Tommy
Docherty.
	   David Mellor, a former sports minister, said he was concerned
``this proud club with all its traditions'' could become ``just a
pawn in a global media power-play by Rupert Murdoch.''

Russia to launch U.S. communication satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will launch a rocket to put 12 American
commercial communication satellites into orbit Thursday, officials
said.
	   The 453-kilogram (997-pound) Globalstar satellites, built by the
Space Systems Loral company, will be carried into space by a
Zenit-2 rocket, said Russian Space Agency spokesman Konstantin
Kreidenko.
	   The launch is scheduled for shortly after midnight Moscow time
(shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday GMT) from the Baikonur cosmodrome,
which Russia rents from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   The Ukrainian-made Zenit-2 has suffered seven failures since
1985, but Russian and Ukrainian space officials have ambitious
plans for the booster.
	   Russia plans five more launches by mid-1999 to put 36 more
Globalstar satellites into orbit. Two Zenit-2 rockets will carry 12
satellites each, and another 12 satellites will be put into orbit
by three of Russia's Soyuz rockets.

China drags away dissident; Robinson says respect human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Robinson saying she spoke with Chinese
official about case of detained wife of dissident, commenting on
visit. &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Challenging China's policy that economic growth
comes before civil liberties, U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson said
Wednesday that development and respect for human rights go
together.
	   Moments before Robinson spoke at a Beijing hotel, plainclothes
police and hotel security dragged away the wife of a jailed, ailing
dissident who was seeking the U.N. high commissioner's help.
	   ``I want to see Miss Mary,'' Chu Hailan screamed as she was
pulled through the Hilton Hotel lobby and out a rear door. Her
whereabouts were not immediately known.
	   Robinson later said she spoke on to Vice Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya about Chu and was assured she was released. ``I know her
concerns are very serious concerns,'' she said.
	   The police action threatened to muddy the careful path both
Robinson and Chinese leaders hoped her 10-day visit would take. It
is the first official mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, and both sides want it to end the confrontation
between China and U.N. groups on human rights.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   ``China can be commended for efforts to eliminate poverty and to
meet the basic needs of all,'' Robinson said in her speech,
acknowledging China's position that economic development takes
precedence over political rights.
	   But, she added, the ``right to development'' is based on
``respect for all human rights _ whether civil, cultural, economic,
political or social _ together, as an integrated whole _ and none
of these can be fully realized without democratic governance and
the rule of law.''
	   Robinson later told reporters she brought ``a number of
concerns'' raised by U.N. human rights teams that have visited
China to the attention of Chinese officials.
	   She did not elaborate. But a diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said U.N. groups on torture, arbitrary detention and
religion have recommended changes to Chinese officials.
	   ``The visit I think is going well. It's not an easy one, and I
hope there are not unreal expectations about what can be done on a
visit of this kind,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson has pressed Chinese officials on when they will meet a
six-month-old pledge to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, a key human rights treaty.
	   Robinson spent two hours with Minister of Justice Gao Changli on
Tuesday. She also met with Chinese academics who candidly discussed
the extensive use of the death penalty and police powers that allow
for detention without trial, said the diplomatic source.
	   Robinson left Beijing Wednesday afternoon to spend three days in
Tibet. There she plans to follow up on a report that Tibetan
prisoners were interrogated and beaten after a visit last year by a
U.N. team on arbitrary detention, the source said.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials indicated
they did not want her to meet with government critics.
	   After Chu Hailan was prevented from meeting Robinson, Wang, the
assistant foreign minister, said she had no permit to stage a
demonstration, as required by law.
	   ``In order to maintain the security of the hotel and surrounding
areas, I think it is right for the public security departments to
take some measures,'' Wang told reporters.
	   Police and hotel executives refused to comment.
	   Chu Hailan sent Robinson a letter Sunday requesting a meeting to
discuss the plight of her husband, labor rights campaigner Liu
Nianchun.
	   One of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, Liu has been in
detention for more than three years without trial. Chu has been
seeking a medical parole to treat high blood pressure, stomach
problems and other ailments.

India to pay heavily for ecological devastation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed for release at 1000 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India is paying an enormous ecological
and medical price for its march into the next century, the United
Nations Development Program said Wednesday.
	   In a report tracking human development, UNDP said that according
to conservative estimates, India spent dlrs 5.7 billion treating
health problems linked to dirty water and dlrs 1.3 billion on those
linked to urban air pollution. India loses up to 6.3 percent of its
total agricultural output every year because of land degradation
and deforestation costs another dlrs 214 million a year, the report
said.
	   India also is facing a major decline in fish catches, a major
source of livelihood for poor people. Fisheries are being damaged
by sewage.
	   High levels of arsenic, linked to heavy use of certain
fertilizers, have appeared in groundwater in six districts in West
Bengal state, killing some of those who drank the water.
	   The adult literacy rate also grew slowly in the nation of nearly
1 billion people. The percentage change between 1970-95 was 55
percent as against 380 percent in the Central African Republic.
	   But India witnessed a media explosion in the past 10 years. It
showed a spectacular advertising growth of more than 200 percent.
	   The number of cable television subscribers increased to 16
million in 1995 from 7 million two years earlier, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police entered a bar in a tiny Normandy
village and arrested a German believed to be a former accomplice of
``Carlos the Jackal'' and wanted for a bloody 1975 terror attack,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Hans-Joachim Klein, 50, had been sought for more than 20 years.
He is wanted for a 1975 attack against OPEC oil ministers in
Vienna, during which three people were killed and 70 taken hostage.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Illich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is in a French jail
serving a life sentence for a triple murder.
	   Klein had been living under a false identity in
Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume, a village of about 300 people, for
five years. Townspeople called him Dick, and believed he was a
journalist.
	   At about 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, plainclothes police barged into
the only bar in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume and surprised Klein
drinking his nightly beer.
	   Klein was unarmed and offered no resistance, police said.
	   ``He was well integrated into the village,'' said the town's
mayor, Remy Clerembaux, in a telephone interview.
	   ``For everyone here he was Dick,'' the mayor said. ``He said he
wrote articles and books, but it was clear he was a bit marginal,
because he always lived alone and never had guests.''
	   In Germany, the Federal Crime Office in Wiesbaden confirmed that
Klein had been arrested in France, and said Frankfurt prosecutors
plan to request his extradition.
	   During the 1975 attack, Klein was wounded by a gunshot to the
stomach, and was clearly identified at the time as a suspect,
German officials said.
	   The attackers managed to negotiate their escape with Austrian
authorities, flying to Algeria with 35 hostages. After the crisis
ended in Algeria, Klein disappeared.
	   Since then, he'd been sighted in Yemen and Libya as well as
Algeria, but then intelligence services lost track of him.
	   In 1978, Klein gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine in
which he renounced terrorism.
	   Frankfurt prosecutors received new information last year
indicating Klein spent at least some of his time in the Benelux
countries and France. German investigators and French police found
that he was posing as a German journalist.
	   Klein had no identity papers when arrested, but conceded his
identity during questioning.
	   Ramirez, one of the world's most-wanted terrorists during the
Cold War, was convicted last December of shooting two French police
investigators and a Lebanese man.

First case of anthrax registered in Ukraine this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A man was hospitalized with anthrax in
southern Ukraine and local authorities were taking urgent measures
to prevent an outbreak of the disease, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Mykola Nepomnyashchiy, 37, in the village of Maksymivka,
developed symptoms of the disease a few days after he helped a
neighbor kill a cow and process its meat, the daily Segodnya said.
	   The neighbor, whose name was not given, decided to kill the cow
for meat after it unexpectedly fell ill.
	   Nepomnyashchiy was in hospital in satisfactory condition and
several other people were hospitalized for prophylactic treatment,
the daily Fakty reported.
	   Regional officials are worried that new cases of anthrax may
soon be registered because the infected cow's beef was sold to a
meat trader, the daily Den said.
	   Epidemiologic stations in the region are urgently inspecting
local markets, looking for the infected meat, while domestic
animals in Nepomnyashchiy's village are being urgently vaccinated
against anthrax.
	   Anthrax is an infectious disease of animals that can spread to
humans through skin contact, ingestion and even inhaling
contaminated spores.
	   It is characterized by black pustules that appear on the
infected person's body, which are accompanied by very high
temperature, strong headache and nausea.
	   The latest case of anthrax _ the first registered in Ukraine so
far this year _ follows an outbreak of the disease in the former
Soviet republic in 1997.
	   Infectious diseases, such as cholera and anthrax, have become
more frequent in recent years in Ukraine amid a steep post-Soviet
decline in the quality of health care.

Man holding diary pages to turn them over if buyer not found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Anne Frank researcher holding
five newly discovered pages to her famed diary will turn them over
to Dutch scholars for free if he can't find a buyer in a year, a
friend said Wednesday.
	   Melissa Muller, author of a new biography of the young Jewish
diarist who hid with her family from the Nazis, told AT5 television
that Suijk is holding out for a dlrs 500,000 donation to the New
York-based Anne Frank Center USA, where he works as international
director.
	   Suijk startled scholars last month by demanding money in
exchange for the five handwritten pages he's secretly held since
1980, when he claims Anne's father gave them to him. Until he came
forward, researchers didn't even know the pages were missing from
the internationally best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   Muller, an Austrian writer who consulted with Suijk on her new
book, ``Anne Frank,'' told AT5 that Suijk will turn the pages over
to the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation. But, she
said, he wants a year to try and secure funding for the
cash-starved New York center.
	   The war documentation institute, which edits a scholarly edition
of Anne's diary, has a lawyer working to help it recover the pages.
In them, Anne describes her parents' loveless marriage and her
stormy relationship with her mother.
	   Calls to the center were not immediately returned Wednesday.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime Frank family confidante, has accused the
Swiss organization of hoarding millions of dollars in royalties
from diary sales in the bank. He says word of the stashed money has
begun to circulate among American donors and that gifts to the New
York center are drying up.
	   Among other things, the Anne Frank Center USA raises money that
is used to pay for an Anne Frank exhibit that tours schools and
community centers around the United States.
	   The Anne Frank Fund hotly denies Suijk's allegations that it has
been squirreling away vast sums of money, saying it gives millions
of dollars annually to U.S. Holocaust awareness efforts.
	   The Swiss-based fund has no connection to the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which runs a popular museum in the Amsterdam
canal house where the Franks hid for two years in a secret annex
behind a movable bookcase until they were betrayed and hauled off
to concentration camps.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945.

	   RAIPURA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Holding a bamboo stick to support his
stooping figure, Mohammad Kalam surveyed the vast sheet of flood
waters covering his farming village.
	   ``There will be no harvest this year. The killer waters have
washed out the paddy I had planted,'' Kalam said Tuesday, looking
older than his 55 years.
	   Unabated flood waters have submerged much of this delta nation,
which is the size of Greece. The deluge, billed as the worst this
century in Bangladesh, has claimed more than 800 lives and
displaced more than a quarter of the country's 124 million people.
	   The worst fear is now of an impending food shortage.
	   Like Kalam, tens of thousands of farmers have lost their
standing crops and the floods have lingered too long _ 60 days _ to
replant the farms.
	   ``We had hoped to start replanting the crops if the waters
receded by mid-September. With waters still rising that hope is
gone,'' said Kalam.
	   Last year Kalam harvested nearly a ton of rice from his small
piece of land, enough to leave a surplus to buy clothing and to
meet farming costs as well as feed his family of five.
	   For now, the family is living on handouts doled out by relief
workers. If that runs out, Kalam has enough of his own rice to last
three months. Then what?
	   ``I really, really don't know,'' murmured Kalam. He shivered
from rains that drenched him and a few hundred other villagers who
huddled on a dirt road running through Raipura, a village 30 miles
(48 kilometers) east of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.
	   Kalam and his neighbors have been living on this 20-mile
(32-kilometer) road since last month, when the country's
overflowing rivers began inundating village after village.
	   Agricultural economists have estimated the loss to rice harvest
at 2.3 million tons because of the floods.
	   ``This may force the government to import at least 4 million
tons of rice because it will have to build a dependable food
reserve to meet the emergency,'' said Hossain Zillur Rahman, an
economist at the semiofficial Bangladesh Institute of Development
Studies.
	   ``There will be no shortage of food,'' Finance Minister Shah
Mohammad Kibria told reporters Tuesday after another round of
meeting with foreign donors. ``The donors' response to our need is
satisfactory.''
	   The government Tuesday increased its request for foreign help to
dlrs 889 million from an earlier plea for dlrs 879 million,
including dlrs 112 million needed right away. It has so far
received flood aid pledges totaling dlrs 104 million.
	   Economists worry about the disaster's long-term impact on the
more than one-fourth of the population too poor to buy food even in
normal times.
	   ``In the long run the floods will make the already poor people
poorer,'' said Rahman.

Pakistani officials slam players accused of fixing matches

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Three Pakistani cricket stars
implicated in a match-fixing scandal should be banned for life if
proven guilty, Pakistani sports officials said Wednesday.
	   Wasim Akram, Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmed were named in a
preliminary report by the Pakistan Cricket Board after extensive
investigations into charges of match-fixing that have hounded the
country's top players for years.
	   ``It is most unfortunate from a cricketing point of view and
from a national point of view,'' said Syed Naushad Ali, the manager
of Pakistan's Commonwealth Games cricket team.
	   ``The prestige of Pakistani players has plunged a lot after this
affair. A life ban would be the simplest punishment. Fixing a match
and losing it (on purpose) is betraying your nation and is a
crime,'' Ali told The Associated Press.
	   Former Pakistan opener Mohsin Khan, who is coaching the Games
team, was equally harsh. ``I am also sorry that we will lose three
world class cricketers. But if it is true I would have no
hesitation in banning them for life,'' he said.
	   The cricket board's report lends credence to accusations in 1994
by Australian players Mark Waugh, Tim May and Shane Warne that
Malik tried to bribe them. Malik was cleared by a hearing in
Pakistan.
	   May said Wednesday he felt vindicated.
	   ``Before the finding there wasn't evidence to suggest it but now
it seems there is the evidence to take this thing further,'' said
May who now heads the Australian Cricketers' Association.
	   The report said Akram, Malik and Ijaz should be kept away to
prevent young players from being influenced by the ``soiling
atmosphere.''
	   However, it said a final decision on the three players ``may be
deferred'' until the inquiry is completed.
	   Still, Malik and Ijaz, top-order batsmen, were named to the
Pakistani team that plays against India for the Sahara Cup in
Canada this month. Akram, a former captain and pace bowler, is
playing county cricket in England.
	   But Malik Nasir Khan, Pakistan's chef-de-mission at the
Commonwealth Games, cautioned against moving against the players
before the full facts are out.
	   He said Malik insisted on his innocence when he was questioned
earlier this year by a 11-member Parliamentary
	   The fact that he is on the team to Canada ``proves that he was
not involved,'' said Khan, a lawmaker who sat on the inquiry panel.
He said Akram also is scheduled to appear before the panel.
	   The Australian team at the Commonwealth Games refused to comment
on the issue. Waugh, one of the accusers, is a member of the team
that beat Canada in a preliminary match Wednesday by 10 wickets.
	   Khan, the Pakistani coach, said he was ``not surprised that such
a thing was going on but I am surprised at who was involved.''
	   Khan played with Malik during a career of 51 tests from 1978-87.
	   Asked if he was suspicious about Malik and other team-mates at
the time, Khan said: ``the suspicions were always there, there were
always doubts.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's
largest consumer electronics manufacturer, said Wednesday it will
close down its computer chipmaking operations in the United States
by year's end.
	   The move will affect about 340 employees at Matsushita
Semiconductor Corp.'s factory in Puyallup, Washington, Matsushita
Electric said in a statement.
	   Matsushita Semiconductor is an affiliate of the larger,
Osaka-based Matsushita Electric Industrial. Matsushita markets
products under the Panasonic, Quasar, National and Technics brand
names.
	   The decision to shutter the American semiconductor factory
followed similar moves to withdraw from U.S.-based chip production
by rivals Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
	   All three Japanese electronics makers have been hit hard by a
global glut in computer memory chips which has pushed down prices
and eroded profits.
	   Matsushita Electric said in May that its group net profit fell
by a third during the course of the fiscal year ended in March,
largely as a result of lower product prices.
	   The Puyallup facility was set up in 1991 and had primarily
manufactured 4-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips,
Japan's Kyodo News reported.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank said
Wednesday it plans to borrow some dlrs 260 million from a dlrs 1.37
billion precautionary loan arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund by the end of this year.
	   The government decided to borrow the money because of renewed
uncertainties in world markets, Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said.
	   Singson also reiterated that the Philippines will not follow
Malaysia's lead in imposing capital controls as a means of easing
market pressures, although some leading Philippine businessmen have
recently called for a moderate form of currency controls.
	   The borrowing from the standby loan arrangement must still be
approved by the IMF's board in Washington, Singson said.
	   After over two weeks of talks, the government and the IMF have
finalized new economic and fiscal targets for 1998 and the coming
year. The targets are part of the conditions the IMF has set for
the Central Bank to tap the standby loan to boost its foreign
reserves.
	   In a joint statement, the IMF and Central Bank noted that the
Philippine government regards the loan merely as a precautionary
arrangement.
	   When the standby loan was granted in April, the central bank
said it would be used mainly as a war chest to repel ``extreme''
speculative attacks on the peso.
	   Recent months have seen sporadic bouts of volatility in the peso
triggered mainly by falls in the Japanese yen and fears of a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan.
	   The Central Bank has repeatedly said that adjustments in its
interest rates will remain its main defense to quell currency
volatility by regulating the amount of money available for
speculation.
	   The precautionary loan has less stringent conditions attached to
it than for full borrowing programs, such as the IMF's bailouts for
Indonesia and Thailand.
	   The Philippines was the IMF's first patient in Asia, but exited
earlier this year from over three decades of full borrowing
programs and close supervision.
	   At present, the government intends to access some dlrs 1 billion
in loans from various multilateral and bilateral sources this year
to fund numerous projects and reforms.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kawasaki Heavy Industries has reached an agreement
with Rolls-Royce PLC to jointly develop jet engines for commercial
airlines, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Under the agreement, expected to become formal by the end of
this year, the major Japanese heavy machinery maker will develop
and manufacture key components for the new engines _ Trent500 and
Trent8104 _ now being developed by Rolls-Royce, said Kawasaki
spokesman Hideki Motooka.
	   Several Kawasaki engineers will be sent to the Rolls-Royce plant
in Britain for the project, Motooka said.
	   The new engines will be used in early next-century in Airbus
Industrie and Boeing Co. aircraft, he said. The cost of the project
was not disclosed.
	   Kawasaki Heavy Industries has produced engines for Japanese
destroyers under an agreement with Rolls-Royce.
	   Kawasaki is among three Japanese companies that will begin to
develop a quiet, low-pollution supersonic jet engine next year with
Japanese government funding. The other two are Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co.

	   HANOI (AP) _ Vietnam is moving ahead with badly-need economic
reform, even though it's going at a relatively slow pace, Asian
Development Bank economists said Tuesday.
	   Speaking after a two-day mission to review ADB's aid package to
Vietnam, Rajat M. Nag, the bank's Vietnam program manager, told Dow
Jones Newswires his team will take back a ``positive assessment''
to the bank's Manila headquarters.
	   ``Vietnam has always delivered on reforms, albeit with a time
lag,'' Nag said.
	   The ADB, like other donors to Vietnam, wants to see Hanoi
restructure its debt-ridden financial sector and lower trade
barriers. Donors have also called for reform of state-owned
enterprises, but Nag said the ADB is more interested in seeing the
companies run efficiently than it is in pressuring the government
to privatize them.
	   Nag said that the passage of two banking laws last December and
the recent reduction of some tariffs show Vietnam is on the right
track.
	   ___
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ Chinese banks will extend special loans to
loss-making state-owned exporting companies ``with earning
potential'' to support China's export growth, the Shanghai
Securities News said Wednesday.
	   The loans will be offered independently of other loan
obligations the exporting companies hold, the paper said.
	   Special inspectors will be assigned to monitor how the loans are
used and to supervise repayments, the paper said, giving no date
when the first loans will be issued.
	   China's export growth has slipped in the wake of Asia's
financial crisis as regional demand for the country's goods
declines. The relatively expensive yuan has also reduced
competitiveness of some Chinese exports, economists say.
	   Export growth fell to 7.6 percent in the first half of this year
from 20.9 percent in the whole of 1997. In a move to reverse that
slowdown, Beijing earlier this year announced a series of export
rebate increases. Exporters pay a 17 percent tax on the goods they
sell, but can reclaim a percentage of that in the form of a rebate.

Yugosslav airlines halts flights to Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's national airlines on
Wednesday suspended service to Germany, responding to that
country's implementation of a flight ban agreed to by the European
Union.
	   Germany announced Tuesday it would enforce the ban on the JAT
company. Other countries have yet to do so, and Yugoslav airlines
planes flew to Austria and Greece Wednesday.
	   Britain on Tuesday announced that under a 1959 air services
agreement it is required to give 12 months' notice before canceling
flights.
	   There was no immediate reaction in Yugoslavia over the German
ban.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT, banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo against
Yugoslavia for its involvement in the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo. Independent
Belgrade media reported Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the new EU ban
against the Yugoslav national carrier but suggested no reciprocal
measures would be adopted against foreign carriers flying to
Belgrade.

Jackson withdraws from Commonwealth Games

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World 110-meter hurdles record
holder Colin Jackson has joined the list of big name stars who will
skip the Commonwealth Games track meet.
	   The Welshman said he was too tired to compete in Kuala Lumpur,
which comes at the finish of the European track season.
	   Jackson joins world triple jump record holder Jonathan Edwards,
world 100-meter record holder Donovan Bailey and Olympic silver
medalist Frankie Fredericks as top class athletes who have decided
not to compete in KL.
	   Welsh team press officer Malcolm Stanners confirmed Jackson's
withdrawal.
	   ``Colin felt he had had a very long season and, although not
injured, he does feel mentally and physically tired and in need of
a rest,'' said Stanners. ``For that reason he has decided not to
travel to the Commonwealth Games.''
	   Jackson has won the past two Commonwealth titles,

Sadness in Fargo as Maris' record broken
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB MOEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARGO, North Dakota (AP) _ Roger Maris, no longer the
single-season home-run king in major league baseball, will never be
forgotten in his home town.
	   ``Not around here, they won't,'' said Mike Engh, who played
American Legion ball with Maris in their youth.
	   Maris is buried here. His museum is here. Many older residents
who knew him from the days when he played in the local sandlot
didn't want to see his record of 61 homers that he hit in 1961
surpassed.
	   Most of Maris' longtime friends watched from the solitude of
their homes as Mark McGwire broke the long-standing record Tuesday
night. There were no planned gatherings or parties to watch the
game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs.
	   Orv Kelly, who knew Maris since high school in 1951 and drives a
Lincoln with the license plate ``61 in 61,'' watched the game from
his recliner in his bathrobe at home.
	   When McGwire hit No. 62, Kelly did not move, did not cheer, did
not clap. He knew it was coming, but it was still hard to swallow.
Maris is a ``Fargo boy,'' after all.
	   Kelly only leaned forward to get a better look at the television
across the neatly kept living room when McGwire moved into the
stands to hug Maris' five children.
	   ``There he goes over to the Marises,'' he said, folding the foot
rest into the chair and turning up the volume. ``Roger would have
been 64 the day after tomorrow, September 10th.''
	   Don Gooselaw, who had known Maris since the mid-1940s and was a
pall bearer at Maris' funeral, said he felt a sense of relief when
McGwire broke the record.
	   Gooselaw said his eyes welled up a little when McGwire hit the
homer, but his thoughts were of seeing that Maris is duly honored
at the Baseball Hall of Fame.
	   ``I think maybe now he'll get his due and get elected to the
Hall of Fame,'' he said.
	   Isabelle Weaver, who knows the Maris family well, was happy to
see McGwire go over and hug them.
	   ``Didn't he do that right?'' Weaver said. ``That's great.''

Political drama unprecedented in modern Malaysian history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The increasingly vitriolic grudge
match between Malaysia's prime minister and his outcast deputy has
led to a political drama that is unprecedented in modern Malaysian
history.
	   In the week since the sacking of Anwar Ibrahim on allegations of
sexual misconduct and leaking state secrets, this Southeast Asian
nation has been gripped by confusion and locked in debate over who
is telling the truth.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says Anwar was sacked as deputy
and finance minister and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization because his own investigation concluded that
he was immoral.
	   ``His character does not qualify him to be a leader.''
	   Anwar, 51, says the allegations against him were cooked up to
undermine his growing popularity and challenge to Mahathir's
17-year rule. The lurid allegations _ from sodomy to wig-wearing
trysts _ have made banner headlines in the government-backed
dailies by way of police affidavits.
	   Police have indicated Anwar faces imminent arrest.
	   Anwar has been under virtual house arrest for a week now, but it
hasn't stopped thousands of supporters from swarming outside his
house to listen to his nightly speeches proclaiming his innocence
and outlining his political reform campaign.
	   Not since its independence from Britain in 1957 have Malaysians
expressed such apprehension and excitement over political events.
	   ``This is our first time, our first experience with this,'' said
Iksander, a sociology student at the Anwar rally Tuesday. ``He
stands for justice and truth _ I think.''
	   A government worker brought her two children to observe what she
described as history.
	   ``Oh my God,'' she said, afraid to give her name. ``In my life
I've never heard anyone speaking like that against the government,
not in public.''
	   Political observers agree the events unfolding in the last week
are staggering in a country that prides itself on stability and
unwavering support of its leadership.
	   There have been sex scandals, big-name sackings and political
detainments _ Anwar was held for 22 months during his radical
student days in the 1970s _ but none has provoked such an
outpouring of passion from both sides.
	   ``We are facing a crisis of an extraordinary nature in this
country for the first time in our history,'' Chandra Muzaffar, a
political science professor at the University of Malaya, shouted to
those gathered at Anwar's house Tuesday.
	   ``Our nation's leader has set aside all judicial and democratic
principles for his own political importance,'' said Chandra,
normally cautious when commenting on the Malaysian government.
	   ``I have never seen anything like this in this country, people
talking about reformation, about nationalism,'' said a senior
writer from a local newspaper, listening to Anwar.
	   Of course, he only listened and did not report.
	   The dailies mostly carry Mahathir's version of events,
relegating the rally of some 6,000 people outside Anwar's house to
a few paragraphs buried inside.
	   Meanwhile, UMNO is grappling with the political fiasco.
	   Its powerful youth wing, which floated an anti-corruption
campaign with the approval of Anwar at its July convention, is
splintered over its support of the two warring leaders.
	   Many are painting parallels between the current political
upheaval and that of neighboring Indonesia, where President Suharto
fell after deadly riots in May. ``Reformasi!'' is shouted during
Anwar rallies, a term popularized by the Indonesian opposition
leader Amien Rais.
	   ``The fall of Suharto had to do with corruption,'' Anwar said.
``That's why the paranoia about the terms cronyism, nepotism and
corruption.''
	   Many are saddened by current events. Anwar was seen for years as
Mahathir's worthy successor. The elder statesman in 1982 wooed
Anwar away from his conservative Islamic party to UMNO and then
promoted him up the ranks to deputy in 1993.
	   None says he is more saddened than Mahathir.
	   ``I don't do this to someone who I literally brought up, my
friend,'' he said.
	   Mahathir said he had wanted to retire this year before the
country was hit by the economic and leadership crisis.
	   ``Now I have to stay to lend my experience to solve the
problems.''

Suspected Philippine Muslim bandits abduct Italian priest, 12

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim bandits
abducted an Italian priest and 12 Filipinos, including children, in
the southern Philippines, police said Wednesday.
	   Police said Fr. Luciano Venedettie and the other victims were
taken at gunpoint Tuesday night from a church and a nearby
church-run cooperative store and forced into several boats in the
remote coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   The Italian Embassy in Manila said provincial Governor Isagani
Amatong confirmed the kidnappings. Venedettie, 56, is from Treviso
City, Italy.
	   Regional police commander Dominador Domingo said more than 20
men armed with rifles and grenade launchers barged into the church
and store and took Venedettie and the others after ransacking the
store.
	   The abducted Filipinos included the store manager, his staff and
their children.
	   Domingo said two men approached a town resident and asked for
directions to the church. After finding it, the two men signaled
the armed men to enter.
	   Domingo said no one has yet claimed responsibility for the
abductions or demanded ransom. Police and military teams have been
ordered to search hinterland mountain areas and islands near
Sibuco, he said.
	   Venedettie belongs to a missionary group called the Pontifical
Institute for Foreign Missions and is one of about 70 Italian
priests assigned to the southern region of Mindanao.
	   Two Italian priests have died in past years in violence related
to a separatist rebellion being waged by Muslim rebel groups in the
region, a member of the institute said.
	   Priests from Belgium and Ireland were abducted late last year by
former Muslim rebels who wanted to pressure the government to
provide benefits promised under an amnesty program.
	   Muslim rebels and bandits abound in Sibuco, about 810 kilometers
(500 miles) south of Manila.

Report: Police step up security in violence-stricken enclave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS `has' to `have' in lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Macau police have stepped up security in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau a day after bombings
wounded 14 journalists and five police officers, reports said
Wednesday.
	   Police also rounded up six men related to the bomb attacks early
Wednesday, but they declined to say whether any arrests had been
made, government-owned Radio Hong Kong said.
	   Early Tuesday, a home-made bomb planted in a motorcycle
exploded, injuring a group of journalists and policemen who were at
the scene to investigate an earlier, smaller blast on the same
street.
	   Police blamed triad gangs for the attack, calling it a
``two-pronged act of organized crime intimidation against police
and journalists,'' covering criminal activities in the enclave.
	   Seven journalists and five police officers remained hospitalized
in stable condition Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists
issued a letter to Macau's Portuguese governor, Vasco Rocha Vieira,
condemning the attack and urging police to investigate the
incident.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Officials from mainland China, which will reassume the enclave's
sovereignty in December 1999, had pledged support and urged Macau
to take tougher acts against crimes following Tuesday's blasts.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. It has a
population of about 450,000.

Russian military to bake own bread to feed officer's families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's underfunded military will soon have to
start baking its own bread to feed soldiers and their families, a
news report said Wednesday.
	   Mobile bakeries were being warmed up in several military units
to provide bread to the families of officers, who are only now
receiving their wages for June, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing unidentified sources in the Defense Ministry.
	   The chronic underfunding of the Russian armed forces has
recently become so severe that many military units complain of food
shortages. The country's economic crisis has accentuated the
military's plight.
	   Russian media reported this summer that the military has been
feeding some soldiers with canned dog food instead of meat in order
to save costs.

Yugoslav airlines halts flights to Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's national airlines on
Wednesday suspended service to Germany, responding to that
country's implementation of a flight ban agreed to by the European
Union.
	   Germany announced Tuesday it would enforce the ban on the JAT
company. Other countries have yet to do so, and Yugoslav airlines
planes flew to Austria and Greece Wednesday.
	   Britain on Tuesday announced that under a 1959 air services
agreement it is required to give 12 months' notice before canceling
flights.
	   There was no immediate reaction in Yugoslavia over the German
ban.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT, banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo against
Yugoslavia for its involvement in the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the embargo. Independent Belgrade media
reported Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the EU ban but
suggested no reciprocal measures would be adopted against foreign
carriers flying to Belgrade.

Dow Jones record doesn't enthrall Asia's markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS grafs 12-13, ``In Hong...the Dow.'' to UPDATE with Hong
Kong market closing lower, Singapore's finishing higher. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Encouraged by Wall Street's surge, Asia's top three
stock markets opened higher Wednesday, but two of them soon headed
south as concerns about local issues took precedence.
	   In fact, as encouraging as the 5 percent Dow Jones climb was,
Asian bourses had already reacted earlier in the week to the cause:
speculation that America will soon lower interest rates to offset
the punishment of Asia's and Russia's economic turmoil.
	   The chit-chat about U.S. interest rates began Friday _ thanks to
a speech that day by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan _ and
Asia's markets responded with improvements Monday and Tuesday.
	   But Wall Street was closed for the Labor Day holiday Monday and
didn't have a chance to applaud Greenspan with its record 380-point
gain on the Dow Jones industrial average until Tuesday.
	   As word of New York's overnight rebound reached Asia on
Wednesday morning, people seemed happy but uncertain, given how
much turbulence has wracked the world's markets lately.
	   ``I hope it means something,'' said Ahmad Pauzi, watching the
local stocks on a monitor outside a bank in Singapore.
	   ``It will be interesting to see what happens today. If the local
index's rally continues, it's a sign that things aren't so bad. But
maybe it's a one-day thing,'' he said.
	   In Tokyo, Masahiko Shimizu, 31, an insurance salesman who had
just completed a stock transaction at Nomura Securities Co., said:
``The Dow surge won't have a direct effect on the Japanese economy.
It has its own problems, and they are mostly political.''
	   Shimizu said Japan's beleaguered stock market, which began its
slump in early 1990, might have a better chance of advancing big
time if the nation produced its own Mark McGwire breaking a major
record in baseball-obsessed Japan. ``We wish we had such great news
here,'' Shimizu said with a smile.
	   When trading began Wednesday, Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average reacted to Wall Street's exuberance by rising. But it
closed 157.95 points, or 1.07 percent, lower at 14,755.54, because
of new concerns about a major part of Asia's economic crisis _ the
weakness of Japanese banks ridden with bad loans.
	   As Japan's political parties continue to wrangle over a proposed
bailout for the banks, rumors surfaced on the market that Fuji Bank
Ltd. was facing huge derivatives losses overseas. That triggered
selling in the banking sector, traders said, even though the bank
later called the rumors ``totally groundless.''
	   In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, Wall Street initially lifted the
index Wednesday. But it fell 283.80 points, or 3.5 percent, to
7,905.45 by the end of the day. Traders blamed profit-taking.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index closed at
885.46, up 16.78 points, or 1.9 percent. But the turbulence and
machinations in the markets of neighboring Malaysia were generating
as much interest as the Dow.
	   On Monday, the composite index in Malaysia rose 22 percent, and
on Tuesday it fell 21 percent, thanks to big rule changes imposed
by the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in an effort
to leave Malaysia's markets less vulnerable to speculators.
	   The government imposed sharp capital controls on Sept. 1, but on
Monday regulators said that investors and brokers could trade under
the previous rules until this Friday to get their accounts in
order. That triggered a big sell off and market tumble.
	   In Singapore, investors snapped up Malaysian over-the-counter
stocks to take advantage of their much lower local price, compared
to the Kuala Lumpur market.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Even before his first swing in spring training,
the questions started.
	   Could the record be broken? Would he be the one to do it?
	   Mark McGwire, the man who seemed destined for home run history
from the day he was born, answered them all Tuesday night.
	   Homer No. 62 was a low liner to left field, far from the monster
moonshots he's hit all season. At 341 feet (104 meters), it was his
shortest homer of the year.
	   No matter. Because the moment the ball barely cleared the wall,
the St. Louis slugger had won the race to break the most
recognizable record in sports, a mark that Roger Maris held for 37
years.
	   ``I have been talking about this since January,'' he said. ``I
can honestly say I did it.''
	   Born two years to the day after Maris hit his 61st in 1961,
McGwire's solo home run in the fourth inning off Chicago Cubs
pitcher Steve Trachsel capped a chase that began with his grand
slam on opening day.
	   Though McGwire and the rest of the baseball world had been
expecting the record-breaker any day, it was still overwhelming.
	   McGwire was so excited that he skipped past first base as he
rounded the bag and had to return to touch it, urged back by coach
Dave McKay.
	   ``I sort of missed one big thing _ to touch first base,'' he
said. ``I hope I didn't act foolish, but this is history.''
	   Every Cubs infielder shook McGwire's hand on his trip home.
McGwire pointed at the Chicago dugout in tribute and saluted the
fans.
	   McGwire was mobbed by his teammates at home as Cardinals
relievers ran in from the bullpen. He lifted his 10-year-old batboy
son Matt high into the air. McGwire then ran into the seats to hug
the family of Maris.
	   ``I couldn't be happier for him,'' Roger Maris Jr. said.
	   Before the game, McGwire clutched the bat that Maris used to hit
his 61st and rubbed it against his chest and said: ``Roger, I hope
you're with me tonight.''
	   Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa, who has 58 home runs and also
held Maris' bat, ran in after the home run to hug McGwire as the
sellout crowd of 43,688 roared.
	   None of the fans, however, wound up with the lucky ball. The
souvenir, which had attracted offers of dlrs 1 million, went over
the fence but short of the stands and was retrieved by grounds crew
worker Tim Forneris.
	   Forneris, 22, picked it up and later gave it to McGwire in a
postgame party on the field. McGwire also got a '62 red Corvette
from the Cardinals in the postgame ceremony, and he and his son
took a slow victory drive around the field. Plus, there was a call
from President Bill Clinton.
	   ``Right when it hit off the bat, I knew it was going out and it
went right over the sign,'' Forneris said. ``There was a bunch of
ground-crew guys on the wall. But I was right on the edge and I
said, `That ball is mine.'''
	   Starting Wednesday, the historic ball will be on display at the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, along with McGwire's bat and
jersey.
	   The homer set off an 11-minute delay, baseball's biggest midgame
celebration since Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games
record in 1995.
	   Trachsel watched most of the celebration with umpires near him,
and resumed pitching after a few warmups.
	   ``I was hoping it wasn't going to be me,'' Trachsel said.
	   McGwire appeared anxious in grounding out on a 3-0 pitch in the
first inning, especially considering he hasn't homered on a 3-0
pitch all year. His homer came in his second at-bat on the first
pitch, an 88 mph (142 kph) fastball at 8:18 p.m. (0118 GMT). He
walked in his final two plate appearances in the Cardinals' 6-3
victory.
	   Big Mac, the only player ever to hit at least 50 homers in three
straight years, started this season by connecting in his first four
games. He set the record in the Cardinals' 145th game, while Maris'
Yankees played 163 in 1961.
	   Before Maris set his record, commissioner Ford Frick declared
any record would carry a ``distinctive mark'' if it did not beat
Babe Ruth's mark of 60 in 154 games.
	   That decision was reversed seven years ago, but it came seven
years after Maris died in 1985. Maris played his final game on this
same Busch field for the Cardinals in the 1968 World Series.
	   Unlike Maris, McGwire didn't lose his hair in pursuing the
record, though the pressure began building even before the
Cardinals' first workout.
	   At one point in June, McGwire complained that he felt like a
``caged animal'' because of he attention. Later, he was stung by an
Associated Press report that he used androstenedione, an
over-the-counter muscle booster that is legal in major league
baseball, but banned by collegiate sports officials, the National
Football League and the International Olympic Committee.
	   On this special night, all of that seemed to be in the past.
	   ``The whole country has been involved in this since the All-Star
break,'' McGwire said. ``People have been saying it is bringing the
country together. So be it.''

Credit Suisse net profit rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Credit Suisse Group said Wednesday
its net profit rose 36 percent to 2.4 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.7 billion) during the first half of this year.
	   The increase was markedly higher than analysts' forecasts of an
increase of around 27 percent. The group said it was due to higher
commission and service fees, trading and interest incomes. The
bank's net profit during the first half of 1997 was 1.77 billion
francs (dlrs 1.27 billion).
	   Credit Suisse said global financial market turmoil, most notably
in Russia, will affect the group's operating results in the second
half. But Lukas Muehlemann, the group's chief executive officer,
said Wednesday it didn't have any plans to withdraw from Russia and
other countries experiencing economic problems.
	   ``Russia and other emerging markets do have long-term potential
and we do not want to pull out completely from these markets,'' he
said.
	   The banking group anticipates satisfactory results for the year
unless unexpected developments occur, Credit Suisse said in a press
release.
	   In August, Credit Suisse said the Russian exposure of its
investment banking unit, Credit Suisse First Boston, amounted to
some 1.7 billion francs (dlrs 1.2 billion). It totaled dlrs 2.16
billion at the end of Sept. 4, Credit Suisse said.
	   CSFB won't change its strategy but will lower its emerging
market exposure and has already begun to do so in recent months,
Muehlemann said.
	   He said the crises in global emerging markets are affecting only
CSFB within the group.
	   Given continued political instability in portions of the world,
Credit Suisse said it is too early to predict when and at what
level worldwide securities prices will stabilize.
	   ``Given Credit Suisse Group's leadership position in the asset
gathering and financial intermediation businesses, second-half
operating results of Credit Suisse Group are bound to be impacted
by these worldwide revaluations,'' the bank said.
	   In the first half of 1998, the group's operating income rose 22
percent to 12.51 billion francs (dlrs 8.87 billion), but total
operating expenses rose 23 percent to 8.17 billion francs (dlrs 5.8
billion), of which 6.03 billion francs (dlrs 4.3 billion) were
personnel expenses, up from 4.84 billion francs (dlrs 3.43 billion)
in the first half of 1997.

Eighteen Thai military officers linked to international drug ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the worst scandal to hit the Thai
military in years, 18 officers have been named as suspected members
of an international heroin trafficking syndicate, the country's top
drug fighting agency said Wednesday.
	   ``They are middle ranking officers, from colonels down to
lieutenants,'' said Sorasit Sangprasert, deputy secretary general
of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board.
	   The officers are suspected of being part of an international
drug smuggling and organized crime syndicate, he said. Thailand is
a major transit point for heroin smuggled out of neighboring
Myanmar, also known as Burma, the second largest producer of the
drug in the world.
	   The names of the 18 have been forwarded to the Office of the
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces for further investigation, he
said.
	   The ONCB probe was launched after Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
was angered over a scandal involving a military officer.
	   Earlier this month, a captain attached to the Supreme Command
was arrested for allegedly murdering an academic. The ONCB revealed
after his arrest that Capt. Patchara Phrompao had been convicted of
smuggling 3.5 kilograms (7.7 pounds) of heroin into Australia and
spent four years in jail there from 1993-97.
	   It is believed the 18 suspects had worked with Patchara as a
team of couriers trafficking heroin to foreign countries, Sorasit
said.
	   After he was released, he changed his name and was reinstated
into the army, reportedly with the help of powerful connections.
	   The Supreme Command has called his reinstatement a mistake.
	   But his easy reinstatement, his posting to the Supreme Command,
and the naming of colonels in the drug ring have raised questions
about whether Thailand's generals are also involved.
	   In May 1997, a former general attached to the Supreme Command,
Thanad Paktipatt, was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a court in
Oregon for smuggling 48.5 kilograms (107 pounds) of heroin to the
United States.
	   Earlier this year, a Thai officer submitted a letter to Chuan
charging that Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro was
profiting from the drug trade.
	   The officer was arrested by the military. He later retracted his
charges and apologized to Gen. Chetta in exchange for lenient
treatment.
	   When asked if Thailand's top brass are under suspicion, Sorasit
said, ``It's too early in the game. At the moment we don't have
enough evidence to take legal action.''
	   He said the military has their own code of justice and the probe
will be carried out accordingly, while the civilian authorities
will do the same. Sorasit said the suspects would face a criminal
court once enough evidence have been obtained.

Officials switch policy, allow working elephants to have babies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Love is in the air for more than two dozen
elephants who carry tourists and help rangers patrol northern
India's nature reserves.
	   They are being allowed to mate.
	   ``It appeared to be a case of gross injustice to me that while
regular government employees were entitled to such benefits, the
same were being denied to the elephants,'' Uttar Pradesh state
forest minister Raghuvir Singh told The Associated Press on
Wednesday. ``It is their natural right.''
	   The change was decided Tuesday, he said.
	   All 25 of the elephants working in Uttar Pradesh forests are
female because they respond to commands better than males.
	   Trainers had feared that if they mated the working female
elephants with untamed males, the females would be tempted to stray
into the wild.
	   Now the tame females and wild males will be allowed to mate
under supervision, then they will be separated and the female will
be moved to another reserve.
	   The working elephants get an extra job benefit _ a year's
maternity leave.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stone-throwing mobs attacked two local
government buildings Wednesday and dozens of vehicles were damaged,
a news report and police said.
	   Police said hundreds of villagers gathered at a government
office in Bekasi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Jakarta,
angered by the recent election of a local official.
	   The newspaper Harian Terbit said dozens of police and security
officers armed with sticks broke up the crowd.
	   Protests have become common in many parts of Indonesia in recent
months.
	   The country of 202 million people is facing its worst economic
crisis in decades as inflation and unemployment soar following a
dramatic dive in the value of the currency, the rupiah.
	   Civil unrest is widespread as the government of new President
B.J. Habibie attempts to reform the corruption-ridden political
system following the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto
in May.
	   Despite his reform efforts, Habibie was the center of a big
demonstration against his presidency in Surabaya, Indonesia's
second largest city, on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ For nearly 50 years, Moscow ran the show
in eastern Europe, dictating economic policy to its satellites. Now
the little guys are showing the way.
	   As Russia reels from an economic crisis that threatens social
disorder, its communist-era allies such as Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic prepare to reap the benefits of their neighbor's
distress.
	   Economists praise the basics of their economies _ sufficient
reserves, manageable debt, strong trade _ as the three prepare to
join NATO next year and negotiate to become members of the European
Union.
	   Looking back at how the region responded to the collapse of the
Soviet empire reveals some answers to how the western-most states
can maintain stability amid the Russian crisis.
	   A major difference between Russia and its former satellites was
the speed of reforms and the commitment to embracing them.
	   Russia's reforms never took root as firmly across the vast
country, blocked or slowed by corruption and Communists and their
allies. Industrial production, which deteriorated badly at the end
of the Soviet era due to the fall of world oil prices, failed to
build up again during the 1990s. And the oil- and energy-dependent
economy again fell victim to a plunging oil market this year,
setting up this summer's crisis.
	   Elsewhere, things happened more quickly in much smaller
countries that were more open to change, due in part to being
neighbors to the West.
	   Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's first finance minister after the
fall of communist rule there in 1989, proceeded with ``shock
therapy'' measures that ended state subsidies and pricing, sold off
bloated, loss-making state enterprises, and opened markets to
imported competition.
	   He knew full well the result would be weakened currency, higher
unemployment and economic recession. Those hardships helped bring
down the Solidarity-led government in 1993 elections.

Dutch consumer group's sales plunge in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Anglo-Dutch consumer products
group Unilever said Wednesday that Russia's economic crisis has
sent its sales there plunging ``dozens of percentage points'' in
the past month.
	   ``Sales have certainly gone down in light of the financial
troubles in Russia. It's gone down dozens of percentage points, but
we don't know the exact number yet, as it's been only a month or
so,'' said Unilever spokesman Tom Gordijn.
	   Gordijn said the full impact of the financial crisis in Russia
is still difficult to gauge due to the uncertainty of the
situation.
	   But he added that as Unilever's annual sales in Russia are
around 500 million guilders (dlrs 256.4 million), or around 0.5
percent of total group sales, ``the impact on our overall results
will be limited.''
	   Gordijn said Unilever will continue its operations in Russia
while ``monitoring the situation there very closely.'' He declined
to specify what steps the company would take should the situation
in Russia deteriorate further.
	   Unilever owns a toiletry factory in St. Petersburg, and is in
the process of refurbishing a margarine factory in Moscow, which it
purchased a few months ago, with an investment of around 42 million
guilders (dlrs 21.5 million).

Japanese prime minister sends congratulatory message to McGwire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan sent a
congratulatory telegram Wednesday to St. Louis Cardinals slugger
Mark McGwire for setting a record with his historic 62nd home run
of the season.
	   ``Having been a baseball player in my youth, your performance
excites me and I wholeheartedly applaud your success,'' Obuchi said
in his message in English. ``You have brightened up the world which
needed good news. Let me wish you continued success in your play.''
	   Obuchi later told a news conference, ``It's a great achievement.
As prime minister of the country with many baseball players and
baseball fans, I congratulate him from the bottom of my heart.''
	   McGwire's feat was top news in Japan and the story was on the
front pages of major newspapers. ``McGwire's No. 62: Major League
record broken for the first time in 37 years,'' announced the
country's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri, showing a photo of the
slugger rounding the bases.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The trial of Aleksandras Lileikis,
charged with genocide for allegedly turning over Lithuanian Jews to
a Nazi execution squad, was postponed Wednesday after Lileikis
failed to show up for the opening day.
	   Lileikis, 91, is seriously ill and has been in a hospital since
last week, his defense team told the court. Judge Viktoras Kazhys
postponed the trial by one day to allow the defense time to present
proof of Lileikis' hospitalization.
	   Although Lithuanian law allows the prosecution of war crimes
suspects in absential, prosecution lawyers agreed that the trial
should not continue without Lileikis present.
	   Lithuania has been widely criticized by Jewish groups for the
frequent delays in bringing Lileikis to trial.
	   Although he returned to Lithuania from the United States in
1995, as the United States was beginning moves to revoke his
citizenship, he was not charged until this year.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in the Lithuanian
capital during the Nazi occupation of 1941-44. The charges allege
that he ordered scores of Jews arrested and handed over to a Nazi
squad that executed an estimated 70,000 people.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.

Share prices fall as investors cash in profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices fell sharply Wednesday as
investors cashed in on the market's rally earlier this week.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 283.80 points, or 3.5
percent, to close at 7,905.45. It had risen 1.8 percent Tuesday.
	   Volume was 4.71 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 603 million),
down from Tuesday's 8.43 billion Hong kong dollars (dlrs 1.08
million).
	   The index had surged 12 percent from Friday to Tuesday as
investors rushed to buy back borrowed shares, following recent
government steps to tighten rules on short-selling.
	   After most short positions were covered, the market started
correcting and investors were cashing in, said Antony Mak, sales
director at Vickers Ballas Holdings Ltd.
	   ``There was a scramble to cover short positions built up in the
past two weeks'' before the new regulations were introduced, Mak
said. ``Now all that's come to an end.''
	   The government has introduced measures aimed at strengthening
Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar and stabilizing the
volatile stock market by boosting liquidity in the banking sector
and stamping out illegal short selling activities.
	   Short selling is the selling of borrowed shares in the hope that
the price will fall before the shares need to be returned on a
promised date and a profit can be made on the difference.
	   Investors who sell short in both the stock and currency markets
in attempts to drive up interest rates and depress stock prices at
the same time have been blamed for creating chaos in the financial
system.
	   The index failed to get a boost from Wall Street, despite the
Dow Jones Industrial Average's biggest one day gain in history of
380.53 points, or 5 percent, on Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong is now more focused on concerns about Japan and
depressed emerging markets in Asia and Russia, said Jason Tang, a
trader at South China Brokerage.
	   Among the heaviest hit stocks were in property and banking.
Property conglomerate Cheung Kong Holdings fell 1.70 Hong Kong
dollars to 34.60, and its affiliate Cheung Kong Infrastructure shed
1.35 to 14.75.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings closed down 4.00 to 158.00, and
Bank of East Asia closed at 10.20, down 1.20.
	   Hongkong Electric, one of the few shares to buck the downward
trend, closed at 25.50, up 0.50.

Japan's central bank decides to lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's policy-making board Wednesday
decided by majority vote to take an easier monetary stance, guiding
overnight call money rates to around 0.25 percent on average, down
from around 0.5 percent.
	   The Bank of Japan said the easing is aimed at preventing Japan's
economy from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   This marks the first change in monetary policy since September
1995, when the bank cut the official discount rate to a record low
0.5 percent and led overnight call money rates slightly below that
level.

Report: air cargo problems encountered early, but ignored
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials detected _ but ignored _ problems at
the air cargo terminal hours before the first flight landed at Hong
Kong's troubled new airport, a senior official told independent
investigators Wednesday.
	   Yeung Kwok-keung, deputy managing director of Hong Kong Air
Cargo Terminals Ltd., said officials were already aware of the
problems in the new cargo terminal shortly after midnight on July
6, when the final flights departed from old Kai Tak airport,
government-run radio reported.
	   The problems worsened quickly, but company officials had to
ignore them because flights already were arriving at the new
airport, which opened the next morning, Radio Hong Kong said.
	   He said the company's priority at that time was to keep the
cargo handling operation running, not to identify those problems,
the report said.
	   After a complete systems break down, the company slapped a
partial ban on air cargo transport, and later shifted some
operations back to the Kai Tak cargo terminal.
	   Cargo services resumed last month, but the lengthly cargo ban
was estimated to have cost Hong Kong 0.35 percent of this year's
gross domestic product.
	   Yeung added the company recorded over 900 technical problems in
the terminal, far more than expected, and the computer system also
recorded more 8,000 erroneous inputs, the radio reported.
	   Under extreme pressure, officials erased some cargo inventory
data, which led to a complete breakdown of the operations, the
radio reported.
	   The probe to find out what went wrong and who's responsible for
the debacle started Monday and will last for about 12 weeks.
	   Meanwhile, a separate legislative probe team will summon top
civil servant, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, in a seven-day hearing
beginning Sept. 21, the South China Morning Post reported
Wednesday.
	   Chan also chairs the airport development steering committee,
which plays a key role in the planning of the airport.
	   Lawmaker Selina Chow, who heads the investigative team, said it
would try to find out which party decided on the opening date, the
Post reported.
	   Critics suspect government officials may have pressured the
airport authority for an early July opening to coincide with a
visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated the airport.
	   The U.S. dlr 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport was built on
reclaimed land off a remote outlying island, replacing the
73-year-old Kai Tak.

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ European planemaker Airbus Industrie
said Wednesday it sold jets priced at dlrs 1.5 billion to a big
U.S. leasing company that took options on another dlrs 500 million
worth of airplanes.
	   General Electric Capital Aviation Services, a subsidiary of GE
Capital, placed firm orders for 30 models from the Airbus A320
series at the Farnborough International 98 air show, the industry's
top event of the year.
	   GE Capital's president, Denis J. Nayden, said his company was
taking options on another 10 Airbus jets as part of its goal of
``maintaining a state of the art fleet,'' for its carrier clients
who lease their airplanes rather than buy them.
	   The firm orders brought Airbus sales by the third day of
Farnborough to dlrs 4.2 billion _ with customers' options on more
jets reaching into many hundreds of millions more.
	   A day earlier, archrival the Boeing Co. had announced a big sale
to Brazilian carrier Varig that brought Boeing's total firm orders
at Farnborough to around dlrs 3 billion, list price.
	   The actual price negotiated by airlines is lower, but neither
the carriers nor the manufacturers will disclose the real figures,
which they regard as sensitive competive information.
	   Boeing signed some dlrs 1.8 billion in firm orders for 24 jets
for Varig, with options on 15 more. The deal involves several types
of Boeing jets, including its first-ever sales of the twin-engine
777s in Latin America.
	   Airbus seemed to have an early advantage at the show, which
always turns into an intense point-scoring rivalry between the
world's top two airplane manufacturers.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard had been boasting about a
big increase in market share and talked of boosting profits. Boeing
president Harry Stonecipher seemed stuck at first explaining
efforts to recover from a series of costly production-line snags
and the recent firing of the head of its commercial airplane group.
	   But both companies soon soared ahead with a slew of big deals,
despite the concerns of analysts who say the industry is about to
peak out and enter a downturn in 2000.
	   Many of their airline customers acknowledge lean times are
coming, but they believe the industry will boom again early in the
next decade after the Asian financial crisis has time to run its
course.

Man holding diary pages to turn them over if buyer not found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Anne Frank researcher holding
five newly discovered pages of her famed diary will turn them over
to Dutch scholars for free if he can't find a buyer in a year, a
friend said Wednesday.
	   Melissa Muller, author of a new biography of the young Jewish
diarist who hid with her family from the Nazis, told AT5 television
that Cor Suijk is holding out for a dlrs 500,000 donation to the
New York-based Anne Frank Center USA, where he works as
international director.
	   Among other things, the Anne Frank Center USA raises money to
pay for an Anne Frank exhibit that tours schools and community
centers around the United States.
	   Suijk startled scholars last month by demanding money in
exchange for the five handwritten pages he's secretly held since
1980, when, he claims, Anne's father gave them to him. Until he
came forward, researchers didn't even know the pages were missing
from the internationally best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   Muller, an Austrian writer who consulted with Suijk on her new
book, ``Anne Frank,'' told AT5 that Suijk will turn the pages over
to the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation. But, she
said, he wants a year to try to secure funding for the cash-starved
New York center.
	   The war documentation institute, which edits a scholarly edition
of Anne's diary, has a lawyer working to help it recover the pages.
In them, Anne describes her parents' loveless marriage and her
stormy relationship with her mother.
	   Calls to the center were not immediately returned Wednesday.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime Frank family confidante, has accused the
Swiss organization of hoarding millions of dollars in royalties
from diary sales. He says word of the stashed money has begun to
circulate among American donors and that gifts to the New York
center are drying up.
	   The Anne Frank Fund hotly denies Suijk's allegations, saying it
gives millions of dollars annually to U.S. Holocaust awareness
efforts.
	   The Swiss-based fund has no connection to the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which runs a popular museum in the Amsterdam
canal house where the Franks hid for two years until they were
betrayed and hauled off to concentration camps.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945.

President Kim promises to rewrite South Korea's anti-espionage law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung said Wednesday
his government will revise South Korea's anti-espionage law, often
used by past authoritarian regimes to suppress political dissent.
	   Amending the National Security Law was a campaign pledge of Kim,
a longtime opposition leader who once was sentenced to death under
the Draconian law.
	   On Wednesday, Pierre Sane, secretary general of the London-based
human rights group Amnesty International, reminded Kim of that
unfulfilled promise.
	   Kim said he will keep his campaign pledge to revise the law but
did not say exactly when.
	   ``The day will come when the government will push for a
revision, and it will happen before long,'' Kim's spokesman, Park
Jie-won, quoted the president as telling Sane.
	   Kim said increasing military threats from North Korea have
intensified anti-communist sentiment in South Korea, making it
politically risky for his government to try to revise the law.
	   The National Security Law makes it illegal to ``praise or
encourage'' communist North Korea. Human rights groups say that
provision has been widely used to repress political opponents.
	   The law is so broadly interpreted that even the possession of
Marxist literature is a crime.
	   Kim took office in February, becoming South Korea's first
opposition leader to take power.
	   In 1980, he was sentenced to death by then military ruler Chun
Doo-hwan on what most believed were false charges that he
masterminded a bloody popular uprising that resulted in more than
200 people dead.
	   After Washington and international human rights groups
intervened, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment
and then to 20 years. He was released two years later for medical
treatment in the United States.
	   Sane arrived in Seoul on Wednesday on a four-day visit aimed at
promoting human rights in South Korea.
	   Human rights groups estimate that about 400 people, mostly
students, remain in prison in South Korea for violating the
National Security Law. They included 17 North Korean spies who have
served 30 years or more, often in solitary confinement.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 100 economic experts from
Asia-Pacific nations said in a statement released Wednesday that
leaders need to make a strong commitment to liberalization and
reform at the APEC summit in Malaysia.
	   Finishing a three-day meeting in Taiwan, more than 120 business,
government and research experts from 23 countries called on leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group to make statements
in November that will restore investor confidence.
	   The experts, from the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
(PECC), World Bank and Asian Development Council, said there will
be no recovery in Asia until investor confidence is bolstered and
capital flows are restored.
	   They proposed that the APEC leaders issue a statement during
their summit in November ``reaffirming their commitment to
market-driven economic integration through free and open trade and
investment in the region.''
	   The suggestion is controversial because Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who will host the APEC meeting, has just imposed
stringent curbs on currency and stock trading.
	   In a related development, John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador for
APEC, told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that Mahathir's action
is an ``unfortunate reversal'' of the free-market policies that the
international organization promotes.
	   ``The history of capital controls in most countries that have
tried them hasn't been a happy one,'' Wolf said during the news
conference held to discuss the forthcoming summit.
	   But Wolf expressed no regret that the APEC summit will be held
in Malaysia or worries that Mahathir might set back the discussions
the leaders have about ways of promoting free trade.
	   The economic experts who met in Taiwan expressed support for
fiscal stimuli, including subsidies, to restore demand in the
countries hit by crisis.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which has organized bail-out
aid to help South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, frowns on
subsidies.
	   The PECC is an independent organization of high-level business,
research and government representatives from 23 Asia-Pacific
countries. Its aim is to foster economic development by providing a
forum for discussion. The experts met in Taipei to discuss
recommendations to APEC and called for a coordinated regional
response to the crisis.

Second national election after war seems confusing to voters

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Zehra Dizdarevic just shakes
her head while she pores over a sample ballot with 83 candidates,
multiple parties and coalitions competing in Bosnia's second
national election since its war ended.
	   ``What in God's name is this?'' the 64-year-old pensioner
wondered aloud as she read a sample ballot distributed by
international election organizers ahead of this weekend's vote.
	   In a nation recovering from 3 1-2 years of war, the ballot
reflects the complex political system created in the tortuous
negotiations that halted Bosnia's fighting in 1995 and divided it
into two ethnic-based entities effectively run by the international
community.
	   On Saturday and Sunday, voters will choose a three-member
presidency _ one from each of the main ethnic groups of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims. They also will elect parliaments in each entity
_ the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation _ and a
national parliament with delegates from both sides. The Serb
republic also will choose its president.
	   International officials hope the election continues a trend
since the war ended, with nationalist parties and leaders who
plunged the former Yugoslav republic into warfare continuing to
lose support.
	   The Americans and Europeans have already sidelined hardline
nationalist leaders in the Serb republic. They have given millions
of dollars in aid to the moderate Serb republic government to help
pay salaries and pensions there to bolster the moderate cause.
	   ``Seize this opportunity by choosing responsible leaders who
will manage the country's affairs honestly and will pursue the
future you want for yourselves and your children,'' the European
Union said in an appeal to Bosnians issued Tuesday.
	   But many people trying to recover from a war that devastated the
economic and social fabric feel they are being asked to vote a
third time in three years _ one election was for local officials _
without really understanding where it all is heading.
	   ``I won't vote,'' spat Dizdarevic's husband Hasan, 67, after
reading the sample ballot through the pair of glasses he and his
wife share because they can't afford another.
	   Engineer Munevera Ljutovic believes the complicated ballot is
not the problem.
	   ``It's the country's set-up,'' she said. ``I didn't understand
from the very beginning how this (country) is composed and which
parliament is which.''
	   Neither Dizdarevic nor Ljutovic believe the elections will bring
substantial change, though the international organizers call the
vote a crucial step in continuing to implement the 1995 Dayton
peace plan.
	   ``They (Bosnians) were told voting was the key to total
happiness, and it turned out voting was not the key of total
happiness,'' said Christopher Bennett, head of the Bosnian branch
of the International Crisis Group, an independent group monitoring
the peace process.
	   He noted that progress toward implementing the Dayton peace plan
has come through the absolute power wielded by the Americans and
Europeans and 35,000 NATO-led troops, rather than through
elections.
	   ``Everything achieved so far in this country was achieved by
cheating on democracy ... by undemocratic means,'' Bennett said.
``Elections are needed only to ratify the new reality.''
	   Other problems also hinder the election process. Tens of
thousands of the 2.75 million registered voters were displaced by
the war, often forced from their homes in attempts to drive off
rival ethnic groups.
	   Many registered to vote where they used to live, even though
they haven't returned to their homes due to intimidation by ethnic
rivals.
	   Bosnia's lack of a democratic tradition was evident in the
election campaign.
	   The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which is running the vote, has banned 15 Bosnian Croat candidates
and two Bosnian Serbs for various violations of election rules.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said the lack of an election law
in post-war Bosnia required the international overseers to ensure a
free and fair vote.
	   An OSCE attempt to hold televised debates between the
presidential candidates of each ethnic group has faltered badly.
The Muslim debate was called off when likely winner, Alija
Izetbegovic, didn't show up. The probable Croat winner _ Ante
Jelavic _ also failed to appear at the Croat debate.
	   The non-appearances showed the leaders' ``incredible arrogance
and non-respect of the voting body,'' journalist Kristijan Ivelic
said during a discussion program after the Croat debate.
	   ``Imagine if Clinton would simply not come to a TV debate with
his opponents a week before the elections,'' Ivelic said. ``That
would be a scandal. Here it is not.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Consumption of goods and services
has skyrocketed globally, but lurking beneath the affluence is a
widening gap between the world's rich and poor, a U.N. report
warned Wednesday.
	   Highlighting ``gross inequalities,'' the Human Development
Report detailed the plight of the more than 1 billion people it
said suffer ``human deprivation and stunted lives marked by
illiteracy, inadequate income and exclusion from the social
mainstream.''
	   ``Abundance of consumption is no crime,'' said United Nations
Development Program administrator James Gustave Speth. ``But it is
scandalous that the poor are unable to consume enough to meet even
their most basic needs.''
	   Runaway growth in consumption, which topped dlrs 24 trillion
globally this year, is also wreaking havoc on the environment and
the poor are bearing the brunt of environmental damage, the agency
warned.
	   ``All over the world, poor people generally live nearest to
dirty factories, busy roads and waste dumps,'' it said.
	   The report did not condemn affluence, but it called for ``more
sustainable'' patterns of consumption to spread the wealth and put
the brakes on environmental damage.
	   ``Though the rich create most of the damage, the poorest in the
world suffer most of the consequences,'' Richard Jolly of Britain,
the report's chief author, told reporters Wednesday.
	   He stressed ``the need for consumption to be better shared and
not denied, to be strengthening and not disabling, to be socially
integrating and not divisive, to be sustainable and not destroying
or degrading the environment.''

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The trial of Aleksandras Lileikis,
charged with genocide for allegedly turning over Lithuanian Jews to
a Nazi execution squad, was postponed Wednesday after Lileikis
failed to show up for the opening day.
	   Lileikis, 91, is seriously ill and has been in a hospital since
last week, his defense team told the court. Judge Viktoras Kazhys
postponed the trial by one day to allow the defense time to present
proof of Lileikis' hospitalization.
	   Although Lithuanian law allows war-crimes suspects to be
indicted in absentia, prosecutors said the trial likely would have
to be cancelled if Lileikis cannot speak in his own defense.
	   ``The court's hands are tied,'' prosecutor Jonas Martinaitis
said after the court adjourned.
	   Lithuania has been widely criticized by Jewish groups for the
frequent delays in bringing Lileikis to trial.
	   Although he returned to Lithuania from the United States in
1995, as the United States was beginning moves to revoke his
citizenship, he was not charged until this year.
	   ``All this shows the reluctance in Lithuania to prosecute Nazi
collaborators,'' said Efraim Zuboff of the Nazi-hunting Simon
Wiesenthal Center, who was among the spectators in the tense
courtroom. ``They could have tried him much earlier when he was a
healthier man.''
	   But many Lithuanians oppose prosecuting Lileikis.
	   ``Are they still trying to try this poor old man,'' said Jurgis
Nainys, a 23-year-old student outside the courthouse. ``If I had my
way, I would let him die in peace.''
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in the Lithuanian
capital during the Nazi occupation of 1941-44. The charges allege
that he ordered scores of Jews arrested and handed over to a Nazi
squad that executed an estimated 70,000 people.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955. He lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, and worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police scuffled with protesters
and fired warning shots Wednesday when about 4,000 students staged
one of the biggest protests so far against Indonesia's president
over skyrocketing food prices.
	   Students from several universities and supporters of prominent
opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri gathered near the office of
the governor of East Java where President B.J. Habibie was staying
during a visit to Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya.
	   The protesters were split into two groups by hundreds of
security personnel in riot gear. Armored vehicles were also
stationed nearby.
	   Witnesses said riot police fired two or three shots into the air
to disperse a protesting crowd in one city street. The
demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans and waved red and
white Indonesian flags.
	   ``We don't want Habibie. We want lower food prices'' read one
banner.
	   ``Reject Habibie! Reject Habibie!'' the protesters shouted.
	   The protest was one of the biggest so far against Habibie, who
came to power in May after riots and protests forced authoritarian
President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
	   The president on Wednesday left the governor's office after
several hours and boarded a jet to Jakarta. He earlier canceled a
planned visit to a new sports complex in a neighboring town because
of disturbances along a highway.
	   After Habibie's departure, thousands of protesters pushed
through a line of troops and demonstrated on the steps of the
white-pillared governor's office.
	   Earlier witnesses said several protesters were beaten and
arrested by security personnel. Police, however, reported no
arrests.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police were deployed across the
city, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, after students
said they would stage a big march against Habibie.
	   Despite the large security presence, the number of protesters
continued to grow through the morning. Some witnesses said members
of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing vehicles.
	   Habibie entered the governor's office and officiated at a
ceremony in a sports stadium to mark Indonesia's national sports
day.
	   He called on Indonesians to remain calm and to support the
government in its bid to fix massive economic problems.
	   ``If the crisis is not overcome it can threaten the people's
unity which has been built upon hardship,'' he said. ``In dealing
with these heavy challenges, I would like to call on all people to
remain patient and to keep a clear mind.''
	   Indonesia has been wracked by social unrest since it entered its
worst economic crisis in three decades. Habibie, a long time friend
of Suharto, maintains he has done much to attack corruption and
nepotism that plagued Indonesia's ailing economy.
	   He has also thrown his full support behind a multi-billion
dollar economic rescue plan drafted by the International Monetary
Fund, which has demanded deep and painful reforms.
	   There has been growing discontent among many of Indonesia's 202
million people as prices for basic food and other commodities soar
and unemployment climbs.
	   Protests, looting and riots have hit several cities and towns in
recent weeks as criticism of Habibie's presidency mounts.
	   Wednesday's protest came a day after police and troops used
sticks, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of students from the
grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta. Two students
underwent surgery after they were allegedly stabbed by bayonets.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Pakistani match-fixing scandal
and heavy downpours cast a shadow over cricket's entry into the
Commonwealth Games Wednesday, while the tournament was virtually
snubbed by locals.
	   Pakistan officials released a report linking three of their
country's stars _ Wasim Akram, Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmed _ to a
bribery scandal which has haunted the sport for several years.
	   While none of the players were in Kuala Lumpur, Pakistani team
officials reacted by saying they should be banned for life if the
allegations are proven.
	   The news dominated a historic day for the sport where
highly-paid internationals turned out just for the honor of
representing their countries. And the public reaction befitted
lowly amateur sport _ at most of the venues, event volunteers and
reporters easily outnumbered paying spectators.
	   Australia, which has sent a near full strength team to the
Games, scored an elementary nine-wicket victory over Canada in
Group B with such ease that captain Steve Waugh admitted he felt
sorry for the losers.
	   Indian star Sachin Tendulkar tangled with Antiguan great Curtly
Ambrose in front of less than 100 fans, including Malaysian King
Tuanku Ja'afar, but the game was abandoned at an interesting stage.
	   Rain also ended Pakistan's match against a feisty Scottish team
with both teams getting a point each.
	   Zimbabwe managed a six-wicket win over Jamaica. The Africans
bowled their opponents out for 142 in 38.2 overs and reached the
target from 37.4 overs.
	   Sri Lanka, favored to meet Australia in the final, had no
trouble in beating Malaysia. The host nation survived 47.4 overs to
reach 109 but Sri Lanka passed it in 19.4 overs with three wickets
down.
	   Australia had vowed to treat Wednesday's match professionally
and it was a ruthless performance.
	   ``You have got to feel a bit sorry for them,'' said Waugh. ``The
wicket was helpful for bowlers, we have some good bowlers and
(Canada) are amateur players.''
	   Damien Fleming bowled the first delivery in Commonwealth Games
cricket and almost had a wicket. His appeal for lbw was turned down
but he finished with 4-21 off six overs as Canada was all out for
60 in 20 overs.
	   Only one batsman reached double figures while extras was the
highest score with 20.
	   ``It was pretty tough and we expected that playing against the
number one team in the world,'' said Canadian captain Ingleton
Liburd. ``But we were hoping to do a lot better than 60 runs.''
	   India's clash with Antigua, playing here as one of three nations
which contribute players to the West Indies test team, produced a
match-up between the world's best batsman Tendulkar and brilliant
paceman Ambrose.
	   Strangely Tendulkar won the battle with the ball and Ambrose
with the bat. Tendulkar made just 15 before falling as India made
30-2 in reply to Antigua's 164 before the match was abandoned.
	   Ambrose struck a speedy 23 in Antigua's innings but his knock
was ended when Tendulkar clean bowled him.
	   Pakistan, under stress with the bribery revelations, were
rattled by Scotland's amateur lineup. Pakistan was in trouble at 95
for five but thrashed 89 off the last 10 overs.
	   Akhtar Sarfraz hit three sixes in an unbeaten 66 from 61 balls
and shared an unbeaten 106 for the sixth wicket.
	   The top team from the four pools of four sides will advance to
the semifinals.

Report: Agents arrange executed prisoners transplants in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese patients can make arrangements
to receive kidneys transplanted from executed criminals in China
through an agent in southern Taiwan, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Agents in the city of Kaohsiung make all necessary arrangements
for patients, from initial health exams through operations and
follow up care at a hospital in the Chinese city of Fuzhou, the
United Daily News reported.
	   Taiwanese patients, with their hard currency, receive priority
for transplants, followed by Chinese and other foreigners, the
report said.
	   Human rights groups have reported organs being removed from
executed criminals by doctors operating on the back of a truck at
the execution ground.
	   China's Justice Ministry denies it supports trafficking in
organs from executed prisons.
	   According the Wednesday's report, the service isn't cheap,
though. Patients must first pay about U.S. dlrs 1,220 as a down
payment and to cover the cost of an initial health examination.
Once approved, total cost for a transplant including transportation
costs and hospital stay can total over U.S. dlrs 25,000, part of
which is a fee for the agent, the paper said.
	   The report quoted the manager of the agency, identified only by
his surname, Lu, saying that Fuzhou General Hospital in coastal
Fujian province had a contract with the local court to harvest
kidneys from executed criminals.
	   The organs can be delivered within 12 hours, and with 13
execution grounds in the vicinity, there was no problem with
supply, it quoted the manager saying.
	   The hospital also has an option to order kidneys from a hospital
in another Fujian city, Xiamen, it quoted him saying.
	   The report did not say how Lu's agency finds customers, but
previous reports have said Taiwanese doctors sometimes provide
referrals for patients needing transplants. It said the agency has
been operating on behalf of the Fuzhou hospital since May, but did
not say how many patients it has served.
	   Demand for Chinese transplants is driven by waits of up to 10
years for kidneys in Taiwan due to a highly limited supply.
	   China executes more criminals than any country in the world, and
criminals' rights to their body parts are routinely forfeited.
	   Taiwanese patients arranging for transplants to China say they
have been notified that their operations will be held when a
patient of matching blood type is executed.

Asset auction plan sends Thai stock market up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Government plans to hold an auction in
December of 460 billion baht (dlrs 11.2 billion) of assets of
insolvent finance companies gave a small boost to the sluggish Thai
stock market Wednesday.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed at 213.98 points
compared with Tuesday's close of 212.85 on investors' expectations
that the auction would bring large inflows of money into the
country.
	   The Financial Sector Restructuring Authority _ FRA _ a
government body set up last December to auction assets of 56
insolvent finance companies, on Tuesday announced a sale of
business loans worth 460 billion baht (dlrs 11.2 billion) in book
value.
	   The auction, which will take place December 2, is open to local
and foreign investors.
	   FRA president Amaret Sila-On said the December 2 auction will be
``the world's single biggest auction deal.''
	   Since local investors don't have much buying capacity and the
assets are likely to be sold at attractively big discounts, dealers
said investors expect to see substantial foreign funds flowing into
the liquidity-starved Thai economy.
	   Dealers said they don't expect the market index to rise much
because it won't be until December that investors see the real
impact of the auction.
	   The 56 insolvent finance companies have a combined book value of
880 billion baht (dlrs 21.5 billion). So far, the agency has sold
40 percent of those assets or 352 billion baht (dlrs 8.6 billion)
at book value.
	   Under Thailand's agreement with the International Monetary Fund,
which supervises a dlrs 17.2-billion bailout fund for the country's
beleaguered economy, the FRA has to complete auctions of all assets
of the 56 insolvent companies by December.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Consumption of goods and services
has skyrocketed globally, but lurking beneath the affluence is a
widening gap between the world's rich and poor, a U.N. report
warned Wednesday.
	   Highlighting ``gross inequalities,'' the Human Development
Report detailed the plight of the more than 1 billion people it
said suffer ``human deprivation and stunted lives marked by
illiteracy, inadequate income and exclusion from the social
mainstream.''
	   ``Abundance of consumption is no crime,'' said United Nations
Development Program administrator James Gustave Speth. ``But it is
scandalous that the poor are unable to consume enough to meet even
their most basic needs.''
	   Runaway growth in consumption, which topped dlrs 24 trillion
globally this year, is also wreaking havoc on the environment, and
the poor are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage, the
agency warned.
	   ``All over the world, poor people generally live nearest to
dirty factories, busy roads and waste dumps,'' it said.
	   The report did not condemn affluence, but it called for ``more
sustainable'' patterns of consumption to spread the wealth and put
the brakes on environmental damage.
	   ``Though the rich create most of the damage, the poorest in the
world suffer most of the consequences,'' Richard Jolly of Britain,
the report's chief author, told reporters Wednesday.
	   He stressed ``the need for consumption to be better shared and
not denied, to be strengthening and not disabling, to be socially
integrating and not divisive, to be sustainable and not destroying
or degrading the environment.''

Beckenbauer rules himself out, suggests Cruyff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer once again ruled
himself out for the job of Germany's soccer coach Wednesday and
suggested Johan Cruyff would be the ideal man for the post.
	   Beckenbauer, a former star player who guided Germany to its
third and last World Cup title in 1990, still exerts great
influence in German soccer.
	   Already in a slump after the its ouster in the quarterfinals of
the World Cup this summer, Germany's soccer was thrown into further
turmoil when Berti Vogts resigned as the national team coach
Monday.
	   German soccer federation (DFB) officials have been unable to
find a successor, with several candidates turning down the job.
	   ``It remains so that I am definitely not available,''
Beckenbauer wrote Wednesday in his column in the mass-circulation
newspaper Bild.
	   ``The coaching job was a part of my life that has been closed
for good,'' Beckenbauer said.
	   ``Perhaps the soccer federation should consider breaking with
all tradition and try to find a foreign coach,'' Beckenbauer wrote.
	   ``Positive influences from abroad would certainly not damage our
soccer. In that case, for me, there could be only one man and no
one other: Johan Cruyff. He would then be the bets man,''
Beckenbauer said.
	   Beckenbauer and Cruyff go back a long time _ they played against
each other in the 1974 World Cup final when Germany edged the
Netherlands 2-1.
	   Cruyff, the most venerated Dutch soccer star, has already
coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant Barcelona. These days, he
works as a television soccer commentator.
	   Last month, Cruyff turned down an offer to become coach of the
Dutch national team.
	   Cruyff was not the only foreign coach being mentioned. Bild said
Aime Jacquet, who stepped down after leading France to the World
Cup title this summer, was also being considered.
	   Although several other commentators also have been suggesting a
foreign coach, Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, vice president of the
soccer federation, said such a solution was unlikely.
	   But the DFB was quickly running out of candidates.
	   Jupp Heynckes said Tuesday he had turned down the job. Heynckes,
who was sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite leading the
Spanish club to the Champions Cup title, said he was too worried
about his wife's health to take on a new responsibility.
	   Three other Bundesliga coaches have said they want to stay with
their clubs _ Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich, Christoph Daum of
Bayer Leverkusen and Otto Rehhagel of champion Kaiserslautern.
	   Mayer-Vorfelder said the DFB could turn to its own coaching
staff for a candidate.
	   Among them are Uli Stielike, a former international who has
coached the Swiss national team and now works with Germany's
juniors, and Rainer Bonhof, Vogts' longtime assistant.

McGwire's home run heard round the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAVI NESSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Though few Americans would believe it, baseball,
a game whose season culminates in a ``World Series,'' gets
somewhere between little and no attention in many parts of the
world.
	   But when Mark McGwire broke one of the most storied records in
professional baseball Tuesday night by hitting his 62nd home run of
the season, even bastions of baseball apathy found the feat
difficult to ignore.
	   Italians, who normally care little about baseball, were greeted
with a full-page spread on McGwire in the country's major sports
daily, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   In Thailand, the vast majority of people have never heard of
McGwire or legendary Yankee slugger Babe Ruth. And the World Series
does not even rate a passing mention on television newscasts.
	   But at least one television station made room in its midday
newscast to broadcast McGwire's home run to a population that was
likely as confused as it was excited.
	   The Japanese, who adore baseball, greeted McGwire's home run
with front-page newspaper stories and a congratulatory telegram
from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, an avid baseball fan who called
McGwire a ``superman.''
	   ``You have brightened up the world, which needed good news. Let
me wish you continued success in your play,'' read the telegram
from Obuchi, a baseball player in his youth.
	   Outside of Canada, Latin America and some Asian countries, where
fans worship ``America's national pasttime'' as rabidly as
Americans do, baseball holds little allure around the world, where
soccer is king.
	   Many American fans themselves were disillusioned with the sport
after a 1994-95 players' strike. But the excitement of watching
McGwire's assault on the record has put some magic back in the game
for them and brought the sport to the attention of others.
	   ``He's made a fan of the world,'' Houston Astros player Craig
Biggio said.
	   In the United States, McGwire's homer was huge news.
	   At the U.S. Open, the large scoreboards atop Arthur Ashe Stadium
flashed word of the home run to the crowd there for the night
tennis matches.
	   In Seal Beach, California, hundreds of fans packed into The
Abbey, the small restaurant put on the map when McGwire made a
``The Abbey Seal Beach'' cap his lucky hat.
	   ``I gave up on baseball a few years back when the strike was
on,'' said prodigal fan Barney Caton. ``McGwire brought it back.
He's made the game fun again.''

Thief takes mobile rocket-launcher on garden-wrecking spree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A man stole a rocket-launching vehicle from
a military repair shop in northern Norway and careened through
hedges and flowerbeds in a residential neighborhood early Wednesday
before being arrested.
	   The 25-foot-long (8-meter-long) armored vehicle, called a
Multiple Launch Rocket System, is capable of firing a dozen
rockets, but was not armed when it was stolen, the news agency NTB
reported.
	   The man swiped the vehicle from the repair shop at the Setermoen
base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the Arctic Circle,
and took it on a joyride for several hours. Police scrambled to try
to find vehicles to use in a roadblock, fearing that the heavy
vehicle could crush an ordinary police cruiser.
	   The man eventually abandoned the rocket-launcher and was
surrounded by police. He was not identified, but police said he was
not a member of the armed forces.

Dutch consumer group's sales plunge in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Anglo-Dutch consumer products
group Unilever said Wednesday that Russia's economic crisis has
sent its sales there plunging ``dozens of percentage points'' in
the past month.
	   ``Sales have certainly gone down in light of the financial
troubles in Russia. It's gone down dozens of percentage points, but
we don't know the exact number yet, as it's been only a month or
so,'' said Unilever spokesman Tom Gordijn.
	   Gordijn said the full impact of the financial crisis in Russia
is still difficult to gauge due to the uncertainty of the
situation.
	   But he added that as Unilever's annual sales in Russia are
around 500 million guilders (dlrs 256 million), or around 0.5
percent of total group sales, ``the impact on our overall results
will be limited.''
	   Gordijn said Unilever will continue its operations in Russia
while ``monitoring the situation there very closely.'' He declined
to specify what steps the company would take should the situation
in Russia deteriorate further.
	   Unilever owns a toiletry factory in St. Petersburg, and is in
the process of refurbishing a margarine factory in Moscow, which it
purchased a few months ago, with an investment of around 42 million
guilders (dlrs 21.5 million).

Arrest total in Myanmar rises to 303, opposition party says

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ In a strike against the opposition's plan
to convene parliament, Myanmar's military government has arrested
303 people in its latest crackdown, the top pro-democracy party
said Wednesday.
	   Among those arrested in the crackdown that began Sunday were 129
members of parliament, said Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National
League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The NLD leadership asked for a meeting with generals from the
ruling military council to take place at 1:00 p.m. Wednesday to
discuss the arrests, the party said in a statement, but there was
no response.
	   Since May, 187 elected members of parliament plus 334 other NLD
members have been imprisoned by the military, the party said.
	   Several Western governments, including the United States, and
international human rights groups have issued sharp condemnations
of the crackdown against the opposition.
	   Tin Oo said that not only NLD members had been arrested but also
members of political parties representing some ethnic groups, such
as the Chins, the Mon and the Rakhines.
	   Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since the arrests began. She
is living under intense restrictions on her movements by the
military government.
	   Tin Oo said that she and the rest of the NLD's central executive
committee would meet at the party's Yangon headquarters Wednesday
to discuss the situation.
	   Dissatisfaction with the government is rising, particularly over
its mismanagement of the crumbling economy. Military bungling has
left resource-rich Myanmar one of the world's poorest nations.
	   Students in Yangon protested against military rule for the first
time in two years during the past two weeks.
	   Student exiles in Bangkok reported that 12 Buddhist monks have
been arrested in the northern city of Mandalay after an
anti-military demonstration involving more than 200 people.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. A government
spokesman has said only that opposition members have been
``invited'' for an exchange of views at government guest houses.
	   ``I do not think all NLD detainees are being kept at guest
houses,'' Tin Oo said. ``I'm very concerned about the quality of
the conditions they are being kept under.''
	   During previous mass arrests, the military made similar claims
about good treatment of opposition members, only to have those
arrested detail harsh treatment at the hands of the military after
their release.
	   The current wave of arrests had been expected. The NLD had set
an Aug. 21 deadline for the military government to convene
parliament. When it passed unheeded, the party announced it would
call the assembly on its own.
	   The military responded by branding the NLD as traitors and
warned it could result in the party being outlawed.
	   The NLD won 385 of the 492 parliamentary seats in the 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the result.

Opposition schedules new mass protest amid clashes

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defiant opposition leaders vowed
Wednesday to intensify mass protests against strongman Hun Sen,
even as riot police used clubs, guns, cattle prods and water cannon
to scatter rock-throwing demonstrators demanding his ouster.
	   About 1,000 protesters were dispersed in morning clashes near
the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. Some regrouped later in smaller clusters around
the city until police would arrive to scatter them again.
	   Thousands more returned in late afternoon to the same
neighborhood, a new focal point of unrest against Hun Sen following
the destruction of a protest camp Tuesday outside the National
Assembly. Only a few police were present.
	   Human-rights workers reported a Buddhist monk was killed by
gunfire in the morning clash. One and possibly two were wounded.
The death could not be confirmed despite an exhaustive search of
morgues and hospitals.
	   However, on the streets, people believed several monks had been
killed, stoking their anger at Hun Sen. They erected small shrines
where the monks were shot, burning incense and piling up the monks'
broken parasols.
	   ``People are sorrowful and angry,'' said Lem Tong, 34, a
businessman. ``Monks are holy people. Hun Sen will keep killing
people if he can. We want to overthrow this dicatator.''
	   Earlier, Ranariddh told supporters of his FUNCINPEC party that
Hun Sen sparked a ``real revolution'' by sending police Tuesday to
destroy the protest camp known as Democracy Square where an
unprecedented 16-day vigil had been mounted against his rule.
	   An angry Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy applied for
legal permission to hold a peaceful mass rally Sunday.
	   ``It is in the interests of this government to authorize a
peaceful demonstration, rather than letting what is happening now
to continue,'' the prince said. ``It's now time for Mr. Hun Sen to
stop using violence.''
	   Such rallies have drawn as many as 20,000 people. One now, legal
or not, could provoke more violence as Hun Sen moves to reassert
the power he has held for 13 years.
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago.
	   Hun Sen drew a tougher line following a grenade attack Monday
against his home. He was not present and no one was hurt. Hun Sen
has denied opposition allegations that he staged the attack as a
pretext.
	   Sam Rainsy sought refuge in the local U.N. offices after Hun Sen
ordered his arrest. The order has been rescinded, but his
supporters doubt Hun Sen's intentions.
	   Sam Rainsy emerged from the offices, with a U.N. escort, to meet
Ranariddh on Wednesday. He called the violence ``unacceptable'' and
the allegations he was behind the grenade attack ``ridiculous.''
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s representative, was traveling to the
northern city of Siem Reap to enlist the help of King Norodom
Sihanouk, the prince's father, to defuse the crisis.
	   The prince said the violence was deepening, not resolving,
deadlock resulting from July 26 parliamentary elections that Hun
Sen's party won, but failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of massive electoral fraud and
has threatened to withhold support, raising the prospect Cambodia
could soon have no legal goverment.
	   In the morning protest, police fired volleys of warning shots to
scatter protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, and charged.
They clubbed people trapped against the walls to the ground. A
group of 30 praying monks were dispersed with water cannon.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and rushed to a hospital. He received 10 stitches and was released.
Several other people were injured. One was brought inside the
embassy.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   About 120 people received protection under the walls of the
embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out from Democracy
Square. They said they could not return to their villages, since
the Hun Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to protest.

Credit Suisse net profit rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Credit Suisse Group said Wednesday
its net profit rose 36 percent to 2.4 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.7 billion) during the first half of this year.
	   The increase was markedly higher than analysts' forecasts of an
increase of around 27 percent. The group said it was due to higher
commission and service fees, trading and interest incomes. The
bank's net profit during the first half of 1997 was 1.77 billion
francs (dlrs 1.27 billion).
	   Credit Suisse said global financial market turmoil, most notably
in Russia, will affect the group's operating results in the second
half. But Lukas Muehlemann, the group's chief executive officer,
said Wednesday it didn't have any plans to withdraw from Russia and
other countries experiencing economic problems.
	   ``Russia and other emerging markets do have long-term potential,
and we do not want to pull out completely from these markets,'' he
said.
	   The banking group anticipates satisfactory results for the year
unless unexpected developments occur, Credit Suisse said in a press
release.
	   In August, Credit Suisse said the Russian exposure of its
investment banking unit, Credit Suisse First Boston, amounted to
some 1.7 billion francs (dlrs 1.2 billion). It totaled dlrs 2.16
billion at the end of Sept. 4, Credit Suisse said.
	   CSFB won't change its strategy but will lower its emerging
market exposure and has already begun to do so in recent months,
Muehlemann said.
	   He said the crises in global emerging markets are affecting only
CSFB within the group.
	   Given continued political instability in portions of the world,
Credit Suisse said it is too early to predict when and at what
level worldwide securities prices will stabilize.
	   ``Given Credit Suisse Group's leadership position in the asset
gathering and financial intermediation businesses, second-half
operating results of Credit Suisse Group are bound to be impacted
by these worldwide revaluations,'' the bank said.
	   In the first half of 1998, the group's operating income rose 22
percent to 12.51 billion francs (dlrs 8.87 billion), but total
operating expenses rose 23 percent to 8.17 billion francs (dlrs 5.8
billion), of which 6.03 billion francs (dlrs 4.3 billion) were
personnel expenses, up from 4.84 billion francs (dlrs 3.43 billion)
in the first half of 1997.

Benedetti, ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels
abducted an Italian priest and briefly held 12 Filipinos, including
children, in the southern Philippines, police said Wednesday.
	   Police said Fr. Luciano Benedetti and the other victims were
taken at gunpoint Tuesday night from a church and a nearby
church-run cooperative store and forced into several boats in the
remote coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   The Filipinos were later abandoned unharmed in a mountainous
area and rescued by police special forces, regional police
commander Dominador Domingo said.
	   The Italian Embassy in Manila said provincial Governor Isagani
Amatong confirmed the kidnappings. Benedetti, 56, is from Treviso
City, Italy.
	   Domingo said more than 20 men armed with rifles and grenade
launchers barged into the church and store and took Benedetti and
the others after ransacking the store.
	   The abducted Filipinos included the store manager, his staff and
their children.
	   Domingo said two men approached a town resident and asked for
directions to the church. After finding it, the two men signaled
the armed men to enter.
	   Domingo said no one has yet claimed responsibility for the
abductions or demanded ransom. Police and military teams have been
ordered to search hinterland mountain areas and islands near
Sibuco, he said.
	   Police officials said the released Filipinos told them the
abductors apparently were Muslim guerrillas belonging to the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front. Some wore jackets with the MILF insignia,
the officials said.
	   Benedetti belongs to a missionary group called the Pontifical
Institute for Fo
	   ``It is part of their mission to be in this zone. They're aware
of the danger and we couldn't force them to evacuate,'' Ferarese
said.
	   The abduction was carried out despite a high-profile campaign by
President Joseph Estrada to eradicate crimes such as kidnappings,
which frequently target wealthy traders and have led to a
significant flight of capital from the Philippines in recent years.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the government to establish an independent Islamic state in the
southern Philippines.
	   It is engaged in on-and-off peace talks with Philippine
officials and has signed a region-wide cease-fire with the Manila
government but continues sporadic attacks on government and
civilian targets.
	   Sibuco, about 810 kilometers (500 miles) south of Manila, is one
of several areas controlled by the MILF.

Amid safety concerns, Russia to pay nuclear workers' back wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government plans to allocate 317 million
rubles before the end of the month to pay back wages to nuclear
industry workers, who have warned that the lack of funding
threatens nuclear safety.
	   Acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and the vice chairman
of the Atomic Energy Workers' union, Vladimir Kashkin, signed an
agreement Wednesday for transferring the funds to the Atomic Energy
Ministry, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But the money, worth about dlrs 16 million at the current
exchange rate, is only about half of the federal government's wage
debt to nuclear industry workers. The document signed by Zadornov
and Kashkin estimates the total wage debt at 580 million rubles,
Interfax reported.
	   Nuclear workers from across the country began a three-day
protest in Moscow on Tuesday, demanding that the government pay its
bills for back wages and old orders. Trade union leaders said that
the failure to pay threatens the safety of Russia's huge network of
nuclear centers.

China drags away dissident; Robinson says respect human rights
</HEADLINE>

police, other comments; ADDS detail about scene before Chu
detained; CORRECTS that Robinson to spend two days in Tibet sted

 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Challenging China's policy that economic growth
comes before civil liberties, U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson said
Wednesday that development and respect for human rights go
together.
	   Moments before Robinson spoke at a Beijing hotel, plainclothes
police and hotel security dragged away an imprisoned dissident's
wife who had been standing quietly outside the hotel entrance
waiting to seek the U.N. high commissioner's help.
	   ``I want to see Miss Mary,'' Chu Hailan screamed as she was
pulled through the Hilton Hotel lobby.
	   Chu later said plainclothes police beat her severely on the head
and in the stomach while in the hotel. She was then taken to a
local police station. She was released late Wednesday afternoon,
eight hours after being hauled away.
	   Asked about the incident, Robinson said she spoke to Vice
Foreign Minister Wang Guangya and was assured she was released. ``I
know her concerns are very serious concerns,'' she said.
	   The police action threatened to muddy the careful path both
Robinson and Chinese leaders hoped her 10-day visit would take. It
is the first official mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, and both sides want it to end the confrontation
between China and U.N. groups on human rights.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   ``China can be commended for efforts to eliminate poverty and to
meet the basic needs of all,'' Robinson said in her speech,
acknowledging China's position that economic development takes
precedence over political rights.
	   But, she added, the ``right to development'' is based on
``respect for all human rights _ whether civil, cultural, economic,
political or social _ together, as an integrated whole _ and none
of these can be fully realized without democratic governance and
the rule of law.''
	   Robinson later told reporters she brought ``a number of
concerns'' raised by U.N. human rights teams that have visited
China to the attention of Chinese officials.
	   She did not elaborate. But a diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said U.N. groups on torture, arbitrary detention and
religion have recommended changes to Chinese officials.
	   ``The visit I think is going well. It's not an easy one, and I
hope there are not unreal expectations about what can be done on a
visit of this kind,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson has pressed Chinese officials on when they will meet a
six-month-old pledge to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, a key human rights treaty.
	   Robinson spent two hours with Minister of Justice Gao Changli on
Tuesday. She also met with Chinese academics who candidly discussed
the extensive use of the death penalty and police powers that allow
for detention without trial, said the diplomatic source.
	   Robinson left Beijing Wednesday afternoon to spend two days in
Tibet. There she plans to follow up on a report that Tibetan
prisoners were interrogated and beaten after a visit last year by a
U.N. team on arbitrary detention, the source said.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials indicated
they did not want her to meet with government critics.
	   After Chu Hailan was prevented from meeting Robinson, Wang, the
assistant foreign minister, said Chu had no permit to stage a
demonstration, and police acted properly in removing her.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao claimed Chu had been
blocking the entrance to the hotel and disturbing order.
	   Police and hotel executives refused to comment.
	   Chu had been waiting for Robinson along with foreign reporters.
She said she wanted to ask for a meeting about her husband, labor
rights campaigner Liu Nianchun.
	   ``If she had said `no' I would have just gone home,'' she said.
	   One of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, Liu has been in
detention for more than three years without trial. Chu has been
seeking a medical parole to treat high blood pressure, stomach
problems and other ailments.

Report: Warring Afghan groups to hold talks in Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The main combatants in Afghanistan's civil war
plan to hold direct talks soon in the Central Asian nation of
Kyrgyzstan, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement and the opposition groups
based in the north of the country plan to conduct rare face-to-face
discussions in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan's Deputy
Foreign Minister Alibek Dzhenkshenkulov told Russia's ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The report did not say when the talks were planned or what their
aim would be.
	   In Afghanistan, the warring factions have not announced any
recent plans to hold peace talks and fighting has continued in
recent days outside the capital, Kabul.
	   The Taliban control most of Afghanistan, except for a small
swath of territory in the northeast of the country. The Central
Asian nation has been at war for the past 20 years.

Indonesia announces new plan to tackle private debt problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government Wednesday
outlined a four-point plan to help the crippled private sector
overcome massive debt problems.
	   It said it wanted to play ``a crucial role'' in speeding
corporate debtor negotiations with their creditors.
	   At a news conference, senior economics minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Indonesia's huge domestic corporate debt load was
``hampering the recovery,'' of the crisis-ridden economy.
	   Under an IMF economic rescue program, the government agreed to
accelerate private debt restructuring by through legal, regulatory
and administrative reforms.
	   Three months ago international banks reached a sweeping
agreement with Indonesian companies to roll over debt payments and
to set up the Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency to facilitate
the process.
	   The agency opened its doors Aug. 3, but since then no Indonesian
debtor has used it.
	   Ginandjar said the Jakarta Initiative should serve as a
precursor to Indra, giving companies a plan by which to restructure
debt before joining the debt agency.
	   Indra offers a voluntary program to debt-laden companies under
which their obligations will be extended by eight years and under
which they will receive access to dollars at a locked-in exchange
rate.
	   In return, they must resume making loan payments, which almost
all Indonesian companies have ceased doing.
	   The implementation of a new bankruptcy law last month has also
given a new incentive to companies to start talking to their banks,
or risk ending up in bankruptcy court.
	   The government said the Jakarta Initiative ``will complement the
newly amended bankruptcy law and facilitate the bank restructuring
process and the use of Indra.''

Germany sending two aid flights to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany is sending two military cargo
planes and 50 soldiers to Sudan on Thursday to join a U.N. mission
to distribute food to people threatened by famine.
	   The flights to Sudan, originally scheduled for Aug. 21, were
delayed due to safety concerns following the U.S. attack that week
on a suspected terrorist target in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.
	   Once in Sudan, the two Transall planes are to make four flights
a day delivering food to affected regions in Sudan starting Sunday,
the Defense Ministry said Wednesday. They will join about 30 other
planes in the U.N. humanitarian mission.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A poor family, hoping for a few coins,
tries to sell what little they have left: chipped cups and saucers,
an ornate vase and broken kitchen appliances little better than the
row of derelict refrigerators others have dumped nearby.
	   No one gives their meager wares a second glance. Everyone is
selling something in Afghanistan's battered capital. But no one is
buying.
	   Outside a carpet shop _ really an old railroad freight car _
bearded men sit sipping sweet green tea and puffing lazily on their
cigarettes. They seem to be there out of habit, rather than in any
real hope of a customer turning up.
	   Since 1996, Kabul has been in the hands of the Taliban religious
army, which controls roughly 90 percent of the country. The
militia, known for its strict form of Islam, is battling a
coalition of northern-based armies, mostly small parties
representing ethnic groups.
	   The only shoppers on Kabul's dust-clogged streets are women,
dressed in the all-enveloping burqas, who sail past the ramshackle
shops. Occasionally, the women pause for a heartbeat or two, and
only then to buy food.
	   Cars are scarce. Most people ride bicycles.
	   ``It just keeps going from bad to worse,'' complains Ismatullah,
a young man with a wispy black beard and starched blue shalwar
kameez, the loose pants and dress-length shirt favored in the
region.
	   People seem confused that their old friend, the United States,
which aided Afghan rebels who ousted a Soviet-backed government,
would fire missiles at their country. They seem unaware that the
Aug. 20 strike was actually aimed at suspected terrorist training
camps, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southeast of Kabul, funded
by Saudi millionaire dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   ``We need help and instead the Americans fire missiles at us,''
said Ismatullah.
	   The stench from an open sewer wafts inside the decrepit
drugstore where Ismatullah is passing time with his friend, Saeed
Zabiullah. Zabiullah hasn't gotten around to cleaning up after the
opposition force's last rocket strike, which smashed his counter
and sprayed bits of glass over the few medicines on display.
	   Business is bad, says Zabiullah. But he refuses to blame the
hard-line Taliban, and he says both good and bad have come of the
Taliban's rule of Kabul.
	   The Taliban's strict religious rule has been relatively
peaceful, putting an end to four years of rocket attacks by rival
Islamic groups that left the city in ruins and killed 50,000
people.
	   Corruption and crime, once widespread, have all but disappeared
because of the Taliban's severe Islamic punishments. Theft, for
example, is punished by chopping off a culprit's limb.
	   ``That was good,'' said Zabiullah, bearded and his head covered
as the Taliban demand.
	   The bad has been the Taliban's seemingly endless Islamic edicts,
such as a ban on women working and the closure of all girls'
schools, he said.
	   And he misses foreigners. Under the Taliban's heavy-handed rule,
virtually all foreigners have fled the city, except for a few
employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Ahmed Jan, an old man seeking buyers for his rapidly rotting
watermelons, said the U.S. missile strike did not scare him.
	   ``We have had thousands of rockets land on our heads,'' said the
survivor of a four-year civil war that left much of his hometown in
ruins.
	   He doesn't know bin Laden, blamed by the United States for
financing attacks on American embassys in eastern Africa that
killed 258 people. Nor does he understand why the United States
would attack Afghanistan in a failed bid to kill bin Laden.
	   He said his own country's opposing sides fire rockets at each
other because ``they are ignorant and want only power.''
	   ``But America is an educated country with smart people and
computers. Are they crazy?'' he says. ``Why do they do this? We
have nothing.''
	   The Taliban's protocol officer, Abdul Sattar Paktis, said the
international community has never given the country's religious
rulers a chance.
	   ``No one gives us credit for the good that we have done. We only
get criticism,'' Paktis said. ``After 20 years of war we have to be
strict in our rules and our punishments to bring order.''

Israel says it's trying for peace, Egypt is skeptical
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli official said Wednesday that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing his best to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, but Egyptian officials were
skeptical any progress has been achieved.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh spoke after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled peace process, saying Israel
wants to restart full negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Naveh read a statement saying Netanyahu was ``doing his best to
reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.''
	   ``We have a desire, from our side, to return to negotiations
with the Palestinians until we reach an agreement,'' Naveh said.
	   He refused to answer reporters' questions about the status of
negotiations, but said Netanyahu had sent him to Egypt to inform
Mubarak of the latest developments between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Naveh's visit came hours before U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to
arrive in the region for talks with Arafat and Netanyahu about a
reported American plan to restart talks by having Israeli troops to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which calls for them to
step up efforts to curb attacks on Israel, but Netanyahu's
government has so far refused to go along with the plan.
	   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, who attended
Wednesday's meeting along with Israel's ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel, told reporters that ``the situation, until now, does not
show that tangible progress has been made.''
	   He added that Mubarak believes failure to reach an agreement
will lead to tension and instability in the region ``and this is
not in the interest of any side, including Egypt.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed skepticism
about any progress Tuesday, describing the Middle East peace
process as frozen.
	   ``According to what we are hearing and reading, there is little
hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa told
reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen after
Ross arrives.''
	   The U.S. plan for a withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
territory is based on the idea that Palestinians would step up
efforts to fight Islamic militants.
	   Israel has said the pullback would compromise its security, but
it has suggested an alternative, withdrawing from 10 percent and
turning an additional 3 percent into ``nature reserves'' where
Palestinians would not have the right to build.
	   The Palestinians have been reluctant to accept the alternative
and are hoping Washington will pressure Israel to go along with the
original U.S. idea.
	   In Israel, news reports said Netanyahu sent Naveh to talk to
Mubarak because he suspects that Arafat was prodded by the Egyptian
leader to withdraw concessions he had already made to Israel.
	   But el-Baz said before Wednesday's meeting that ``it is not in
Egypt's interest to pressure Palestinians to accept or reject any
proposal they get during negotiations.''
	   Naveh headed back to Israel after the meeting. Netanyahu's
political adviser Uzi Arad, who was expected to join Naveh on this
trip to Egypt, instead went to New York for a meeting with Israel's
UN ambassador Dori Gold.
	   Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool since their 1979 peace
treaty, have worsened since the election of the hard-line Netanyahu
in 1996. Egypt has joined other Arab countries in blaming Netanyahu
for the stalemate in Arab-Israeli negotiations.

Italian premier says expected 1998 growth falls short
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi on Wednesday conceded that
Italy's 1998 growth rate would fall short of the government's
target but said there was no threat of a recession.
	   Prodi told a state radio talk show he expected the country's
1998 gross domestic product to grow at a rate of 2 percent,
compared to the government's objective of 2.5 percent.
	   He blamed the shortfall on the Asian and Russian crises, which
have damaged economies worldwide. But even before stock markets
plunged, some economists had predicted Italy would not meet its
objectives.
	   Prodi, however, stressed that U.S. and European economies were
strong and that ``there will be no recession and no new 1929,''
referring to the starting year of the U.S. Depression.
	   Since taking office, Prodi has aggressively pursued strict
economic policies to meet European Monetary Union requirements. By
slashing spending, increasing taxes and fighting tax evasion, Italy
largely met the criteria and joined European Monetary Union when it
was formally launched in May.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco was trying to
reassure angry Italians that their next income tax bill would be
lower despite a new tax increase. Last week the government told
Italians they would receive partial reimbursement of the so-called
Euro tax, but a few days later reneged on a promise not to raise
other taxes.
	   Visco pledged that income tax would be lower as the government
keeps up its battle against widespread tax invasion.

EU Commission says Malpensa share-out plan illegal, offers week
</HEADLINE>
reprieve &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
Italy's plan to expand Milan's Malpensa airport was illegal but
gave the government a week's reprieve to set fair conditions for
all European Union airlines.
	   The 20-member EU executive demanded Italy change current plans
that force foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan to move to
Malpensa airport, which opens as the city's second airport and
Italy's second national hub on Oct. 25.
	   If the Italian government fails to act before Sep. 16. the
Commission will officially rule the system discriminatory, said EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   Nine European airlines have complained about the plan to move
them to Malpensa, claiming poor road and rail links from Malpensa
to downtown Milan 53 kilometers (33 miles) away means they'll lose
passengers to Italy's national carrier Alitalia.
	   Under the Italian government's plans, flights to Milan will be
switched to the new terminal from the current Linate airport which
is just 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city center.
	   An exception will be made for Alitalia's shuttle flights between
Rome and Milan which will be allowed to stay at Linate. Competitors
fear that long-haul passengers will prefer flying with the Italian
carrier from Linate to Rome and on to their final destination,
rather than trekking out to Malpensa.
	   Kinnock said he will make sure the conditions for all airlines
from the 15-nation EU would have to be equal. ``Operating
conditions and access to air markets must be equitable,'' he said.

Beckenbauer rules himself out, suggests Cruyff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vogts interview, fixes typos &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer once again ruled
himself out for the job of Germany's soccer coach Wednesday and
suggested Holland's Johan Cruyff would be the ideal man for the
post.
	   Beckenbauer, a former star player who guided Germany to its
third and last World Cup title in 1990, still exerts great
influence in German soccer.
	   Already in a slump after its ouster in the quarterfinals of the
World Cup this summer, German soccer was thrown into further
turmoil when Berti Vogts resigned as the national team coach
Monday.
	   German soccer federation (DFB) officials have been unable to
find a successor, with several candidates turning down the job.
	   ``It remains so that I am definitely not available,''
Beckenbauer wrote Wednesday in his column in the mass-circulation
newspaper Bild.
	   ``The coaching job was a part of my life that has been closed
for good,'' Beckenbauer said.
	   ``Perhaps the soccer federation should consider breaking with
all tradition and try to find a foreign coach.
	   ``Positive influences from abroad would certainly not damage our
soccer. In that case, for me, there could be only one man and no
other: Johan Cruyff. He would then be the best man.''
	   Beckenbauer and Cruyff go back a long way _ they played against
each other in the 1974 World Cup final when Germany edged the
Netherlands 2-1.
	   Cruyff, the most venerated Dutch soccer star, has already
coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant Barcelona. These days, he
works as a television soccer commentator.
	   Last month, Cruyff turned down an offer to become coach of the
Dutch national team.
	   Cruyff was not the only foreign coach being mentioned. Bild said
Aime Jacquet, who stepped down after leading France to the World
Cup title this summer, was also being considered.
	   Although several other commentators also have been suggesting a
foreign coach, Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, vice president of the
soccer federation, said such a solution was unlikely.
	   But the DFB was quickly running out of candidates.
	   Jupp Heynckes said Tuesday he had turned down the job. Heynckes,
who was sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite leading the
Spanish club to the Champions Cup title, said he was too worried
about his wife's health to take on a new responsibility.
	   Three other Bundesliga coaches have said they want to stay with
their clubs _ Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich, Christoph Daum of
Bayer Leverkusen and Otto Rehhagel of champion Kaiserslautern.
	   Mayer-Vorfelder said the DFB could turn to its own coaching
staff for a candidate.
	   Among them are Uli Stielike, a former international who has
coached the Swiss national team and now works with Germany's
juniors, and Rainer Bonhof, Vogts' longtime assistant.
	   In his first interview since stepping down, Vogts was quoted
Wednesday as saying he hoped Germany would qualify for the 2000
European Championship now that he had left the team.
	   Germany, the reigning European champion, travels to Turkey for
its first qualifying match Oct. 10.
	   In an interview with the Sport-Bild weekly, Vogts blasted
Germany's media and said he had been chased out of the job by their
criticism.
	   ``My entire work was never respected,'' he said. ``Now I am
finding my dignity again.''

Lawyer of human rights victims welcomes Marcos offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The American lawyer for victims of
human rights abuses under late dictator Ferdinand Marcos said
Wednesday their case has been speeded up by the willingness of
Marcos' widow to pay dlrs 150 million.
	   Imelda Marcos repeated Tuesday that she is willing to give the
money ``out of compassion, not guilt'' to 9,539 Filipinos who won a
class action suit against the Marcos estate for torture, summary
executions and disappearances during her husband's rule.
	   The Hawaii court which tried the case awarded about dlrs 2
billion in damages to the plaintiffs.
	   Robert Swift, the victims' American lawyer, said he welcomes
Mrs. Marcos' consent and will now seek a meeting with her lawyers.
	   Swift said the amount is close to the 30 percent being sought of
the dlrs 540 million from Marcos' Swiss bank accounts that has been
transferred into an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can
only be released to the Philippine government if it obtains a
conviction of Mrs. Marcos in a case connected to the deposits and
if the victims of human rights abuses are compensated.
	   Swift spoke with reporters after meeting presidential Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora to explore a ``fast-track solution'' to
compensating the Marcos victims.
	   He said any compensation would have to be coursed through the
Hawaii court ``to assure integrity, credibility and transparency.''
	   Zamora also met last week with Filipino human rights lawyer
Romeo Capulong and leaders of Selda, a group of former political
detainees under Marcos.
	   The group submitted a proposal for compensation that sought
payment of at least 30 percent from the Marcos Swiss accounts
before the government and Mrs. Marcos negotiate a division of the
remaining 70 percent.
	   No agreement has been reached on this proposal, which was made
as part of the implementation of a human rights accord between the
government and Communist rebels.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and fled
to Hawaii where he died three years later.
	   He denied any wrongdoing during his administration, including
charges that the Swiss bank accounts were part of what the
government says is billions of dollars of ill-gotten wealth.

Tiger cub raised by a stray dog in a Ukrainian zoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Rejected by its natural parents, a newly
born tiger in a Ukrainian zoo is being raised by a stray dog that
treats the cub as a puppy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The search for a new mother to feed the cub began after its
parents rejected it soon after birth, the daily Dyen wrote. The
tiger was born in a zoo in the city of Mykolaiv.
	   The first offer _ a Caucasian sheep-dog from a local police
station _ was turned down because zoo officials feared the dog was
too fierce and might harm the cub.
	   Finally, zoo workers found a stray female dog at a nearby
construction site, where it had settled among piles of bricks and
unfinished buildings after giving birth to puppies.
	   The dog, called Lada by zoo workers, was taken to the zoo with
one of its puppies and put into a separate cage in the section for
foxes and wolves.
	   At first, Lada was wary of the cub, so zoo workers rolled the
tiger in a puppy's urine to change its smell. The trick was a
success: Lada immediately began to treat the young tiger as if it
were its own.
	   Lada attentively tends to the tiger these days, leaving its
darkened cage only once a day for a walk, Dyen said.
	   The cub, meanwhile, spends all its time in the cage since it
takes weeks before newly born tigers become strong enough to crawl
out of their dens into the light.

McGwire's home run heard round the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with home run too late for most European newspapers &QL; 
 &UR; By RAVI NESSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Though few Americans would believe it, baseball,
a game whose season culminates in a ``World Series,'' gets
somewhere between little and no attention in many parts of the
world.
	   But when Mark McGwire broke one of the most storied records in
professional baseball Tuesday night by hitting his 62nd home run of
the season, even bastions of baseball apathy found the feat
difficult to ignore.
	   Italians, who normally care little about baseball, were greeted
with a full-page spread on McGwire in the country's major sports
daily, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   In Thailand, the vast majority of people have never heard of
McGwire or legendary Yankee slugger Babe Ruth. And the World Series
does not even rate a passing mention on television newscasts.
	   But at least one television station made room in its midday
newscast to broadcast McGwire's home run to a population that was
likely as confused as it was excited.
	   In most European countries, where the home run chase has
received only minor attention, McGwire's record came too late in
the night to make it into most Wednesday newspapers.
	   But many papers did run stories on his 61st homer, including a
front-page report in Tuesday's editions of the Daily Telegraph, a
British newspaper.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's political crisis whirled in a holding
pattern Wednesday as the country waited for word from President
Boris Yeltsin whether he would agree to a compromise candidate for
prime minister. Government officials, who refused to be named,
indicated a decision was expected Wednesday. A compromise candidate
could resolve a deadlock between the president and parliament that
has paralyzed the political system even as the country's economy
descends deeper into crisis. Ever since the lower chamber, the
State Duma, resoundingly rejected his unpopular choice of Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Monday, Yeltsin has been meeting with aides.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned Wednesday that the Duma
would begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. Opposition and religious
leaders warned Tuesday that unless a solution is found quickly, the
political standoff could spark civil war. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ While official Washington waits nervously for
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's impeachment report, President Bill
Clinton is attempting some bridge-building with restive Democrats
in the House of Representatives. To that end, Clinton invited
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and other House Democrats to the
White House on Wednesday as members of Clinton's party continued to
blister him with criticism for his extramarital affair with a
former intern half his age. Starr's report, expected to focus on
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power, should land in
Congress ``this week or next,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said Tuesday. The specter of a report that could gravely affect the
Clinton presidency and hurt Democrats in the fall elections hovered
like a dark cloud over the House's return Wednesday from a summer
recess. (US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Disaster officials on ``maximum
alert'' Wednesday prepared to evacuate some 600,000 people living
near a weakening dam that protects Bangladesh's capital from rising
floodwaters. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center predicted the
Dhaka-Narayanganj dam would collapse Wednesday. Some people living
near the dam, which holds back the Sitalakhoia River, already fled.
Half the capital is already flooded with knee-deep water, and an
influx of evacuees seeking shelter in its schools and government
offices will only add to Dhaka's woes. Flooding has killed more
than 800 people throughout Bangladesh and displaced or marooned 35
million others since monsoon rains began July 10. Waterborne
diseases continue to spread with hospitals reporting 175,000
serious cases of diarrhea, which can lead to fatal dehydration.
This year's floods are the deadliest in a decade in this
impoverished nation of 120 million people at the foot of the
Himalayas. (BANGLADESH-FLOOD)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's defiant opposition
leaders vowed Wednesday to intensify mass protests against
strongman Hun Sen, even as riot police used clubs, guns, cattle
prods and water cannon to scatter rock-throwing demonstrators
demanding his ouster. About 1,000 protesters were dispersed in
morning clashes near the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of
opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Thousands more returned
in late afternoon to the same neighborhood, a new focal point of
unrest against Hun Sen following the destruction of a protest camp
Tuesday outside the National Assembly. Only a few police were
present. Human-rights workers reported a Buddhist monk was killed
by gunfire in the morning clash and at least one was wounded. The
death could not be confirmed despite an exhaustive search of
morgues and hospitals. (CAMBODIA)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ In ire preemptive strike against the
opposition's plan to convene parliament, Myanmar's military
government has arrested 303 people in its latest crackdown, the top
pro-democracy party said Wednesday. Among those arrested in the
crackdown that began Sunday were 129 members of parliament, said
Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy, headed
by Aung San Suu Kyi. The NLD leadership asked for a meeting with
generals from the ruling military council to take place Wednesday
afternoon, but there was no response, the party said. Since May,
187 elected members of parliament plus 334 other NLD members have
been imprisoned by the military, the party said. Several Western
governments, including the United States, and international human
rights groups have issued sharp condemnations of the crackdown.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Encouraged by Wall Street's surge, Asia's top three
stock markets opened higher Wednesday, but two of them soon headed
south as concerns about local issues took precedence. In fact, as
encouraging as the 5 percent Dow Jones climb was, Asian bourses had
already reacted earlier in the week to the cause: speculation that
America will soon lower interest rates to offset Asia's and
Russia's economic turmoil. When trading began Wednesday, Japan's
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose on Wall Street's exuberanceat
first, but closed 157.95 points, or 1.07 percent, lower at
14,755.54, because of new concerns about the weakness of Japanese
banks ridden with bad loans. In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang
Seng Index had jumped 12 percent in the last three days, the index
closed down 283.80 points, or 3.5 percent, to 7,905.45. Traders
blamed profit-taking. In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times
Index closed at 885.46, up 16.78 points, or 1.9 percent. (WORLD

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police scuffled with protesters
and fired warning shots Wednesday when about 4,000 students staged
one of the biggest protests so far against Indonesia's president
over skyrocketing food prices. The protest in Indonesia's second
largest city, Subraya, was one of the biggest so far against
President B.J. Habibie, who came to power in May after
authoritarian President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
Habibie called on Indonesians to remain calm and to support the
government in its bid to fix massive economic problems. Habibie, a
long time friend of Suharto, maintains he has done much to attack
corruption and nepotism that plagued Indonesia's ailing economy.

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ European planemaker Airbus Industrie
said Wednesday it sold jets priced at dlrs 1.5 billion to a big
U.S. leasing company that took options on another dlrs 500 million
worth of airplanes. General Electric Capital Aviation Services, a
subsidiary of GE Capital, placed firm orders for 30 models from the
Airbus A320 series at the Farnborough International 98 air show.
The show always turns into an intense point-scoring rivalry between
the world's top two airplane manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing Co.
The firm orders brought Airbus sales by the third day of
Farnborough to dlrs 4.2 billion _ with customers' options on more
jets reaching into many hundreds of millions more. A day earlier,
Boeing announced a big sale to Brazilian carrier Varig that brought
Boeing's total firm orders at Farnborough to around dlrs 3 billion,
list price. (BRITAIN-AIR SHOW)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Consumption of goods and services
has skyrocketed globally, but lurking beneath the affluence is a
widening gap between the world's rich and poor, a U.N. report
warned Wednesday. Highlighting ``gross inequalities,'' the Human
Development Report detailed the plight of the more than 1 billion
people it said suffer ``human deprivation and stunted lives marked
by illiteracy, inadequate income and exclusion from the social
mainstream.'' ``Abundance of consumption is no crime,'' said U.N.
Development Program administrator James Gustave Speth. ``But it is
scandalous that the poor are unable to consume enough to meet even
their most basic needs.'' Runaway growth in consumption, which
topped dlrs 24 trillion globally this year, is also wreaking havoc
on the environment, and the poor are bearing the brunt of the
environmental damage, the agency warned. ``All over the world, poor
people generally live nearest to dirty factories, busy roads and
waste dumps,'' it said. The report urged ``more sustainable''
patterns of consumption to spread the wealth and put the brakes on
environmental damage. (RICH AND POOR)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 100 economic experts from
Asia-Pacific nations said in a statement released Wednesday that
leaders need to make a strong commitment to economic liberalization
at the APEC summit in Malaysia. Finishing a three-day meeting in
Taiwan, more than 120 business, government and research experts
from 23 countries called on leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group to make statements in November that will restore
investor confidence. The experts said there will be no recovery in
Asia until investor confidence is bolstered and capital flows are
restored. They proposed that the APEC leaders issue a statement
during their November summit ``reaffirming their commitment to
market-driven economic integration through free and open trade and
investment in the region.'' The suggestion is controversial because
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who will host the
meeting, has just imposed stringent curbs on currency and stock
trading. (SINGAPORE-APEC-ECONOMIES)

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ India's Jaspal Rana tuned up for
the Commonwealth Games individual men's center fire pistol event
Wednesday by beating his own Games record.
	   Rana's score of 584 points came in practice so could not replace
his record 581 score from Victoria, Canada.
	   ``I shoot to improve my target and not to think of medals,''
Rana said.
	   Bruce Quick of Australia shot 578 points for the second place
followed by John Rochon of Canada with 575 points.
	   Scotland's sole shooting gold medalist in Victoria, Shirley
MacIntosh, ranked first for the individual women's sport rifle
three-position event by hitting 567 points.
	   M. Wickramasinghe of Sri Lanka and Canadian Christina Ashcroft
both scored 566 but the former was placed second on a countback.
	   In the individual women's air pistol event, Jocelyn Lees of New
Zealand fired 379 points, two better than the Games record, for
first place.
	   Michael Thompson shot 71 birds, four short of a perfect game, in
the individual men's skeet to earn the top ranking followed by
Nigel Kelly of Isle of Man with 70 birds.
	   Guernsey's Andre Carre also had 70 birds but missed the second
seeding after a countback.

Report: Hong Kong airport problems encountered early, but ignored
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES 5th-6th grafs with more details from Yeung.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hours before the first flight landed at Hong
Kong's troubled new airport officials had detected _ but then
ignored _ problems at the airport's cargo terminal, a senior
official told independent investigators Wednesday.
	   Yeung Kwok-keung, deputy managing director of Hong Kong Air
Cargo Terminals Ltd., said airport officials were already aware of
the problems in the new cargo terminal shortly after midnight on
July 6, when the final flights departed from the old Kai Tak
airport, government-run radio reported.
	   The problems worsened quickly, but company officials were forced
to ignore them because flights already had begun arriving at the
new airport, which officially opened the next morning, the Radio
Hong Kong broadcast said.
	   Yeung said his company's priority at that time was to keep the
cargo handling operation running, not to identify problems as they
crept up, the report said.
	   He told a two-man committee appointed by Hong Kong's leader,
Tung Chee-hwa, that equipment broke down more than 930 times on
opening day, while computer controls in the cargo terminal
registered more than 8,000 faulty messages.
	   But Yeung denied that problems were caused by simple computer
glitches, saying they were due to a complete mechanical and
electrical break down. And the deletion of cargo records after they
were registered manually was due to human error, he reportedly
said.
	   Under extreme pressure, officials erased some cargo inventory
data, which led to a complete breakdown of the operations.
	   After the systems broke down, the company slapped a partial ban
on air cargo transport and later shifted some operations back to
the Kai Tak cargo terminal.
	   Cargo services resumed last month, but the lengthy cargo ban was
estimated to have cost Hong Kong 0.35 percent of this year's total
gross domestic product.
	   The probe to find out what went wrong and who has responsibility
for the debacle started Monday and will last for about 12 weeks.
	   Meanwhile, a separate legislative team will summon top civil
servant Chief Secretary Anson Chan in a seven-day hearing beginning
Sept. 21, the South China Morning Post reported Wednesday.
	   Chan also chairs the airport development steering committee,
which played a key role in the planning of the airport.
	   Lawmaker Selina Chow, head of the investigative team, said it
would try to find out which party decided on the opening date, the
Post reported.
	   Critics suspect government officials may have pressured the
airport authority for an early July opening to coincide with a
visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated the airport.
	   The U.S. dlr 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport was built on
reclaimed land off a remote outlying island, replacing the
73-year-old Kai Tak airport.

China's Communist Party expels bribe-taking provincial leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior local government official in China whose
fondness for bribes earned him the nickname ``Millionaire Xu'' has
been expelled from the ruling Communist Party, state media reported
Wednesday.
	   China's highest party and government corruption watchdog
agencies also recommended that the official, Xu Bingsong, be
stripped of his job as vice chairman of southern Guangxi region,
the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Xu was arrested in May for taking bribes of cash and gifts worth
680,000 yuan (dlrs 82,000) by demanding kickbacks for government
contracts and permits, and Xinhua said prosecutors were pursuing
the investigation.
	   Xu is one of a string of high-level politicians caught in a
corruption crackdown Chinese leaders hope will alleviate public
anger over rampant official graft. In contrast to Xu's high-living,
Guangxi contains some of China's poorest areas.
	   In a directive to officials, the party's Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection and the top government prosecutor's office
urged that Xu's case be taken as an example.
	   Xu ``could not withstand the test of power nor the temptation of
money. He coveted goods and pleasure,'' Xinhua cited the directive
as saying.

Dutch brewer's first-half net profit unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch beer brewer Koninklijke
Grolsch NV said Wednesday that net profit in the first half of 1998
was unchanged at 17.8 million guilders (dlrs 9.1 million).
	   Net profit from operating activities over the whole of 1998 is
expected to come in at 50 million guilders (dlrs 25.6 million),
which, excluding an extraordinary gain of 3 million guilders (dlrs
1.54 million) in 1997, is the same level as last year.
	   Grolsch, which generates about 65 percent of total sales in the
Netherlands, said it expects home market sales to be lower in the
second half of the year from a year ago because of the bad weather.
	   In the first six months, domestic sales were at the same level
as in the first half of 1997. Sales outside the Netherlands rose
compared with the like period, with increases in the United States
and the United Kingdom but a decrease in Russia.
	   Foreign sales in the second half are likely to be lower from the
same period in 1997 due to the economic turmoil in Russia, Grolsch
said.

Yugoslav president cancels meeting with Belgian foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Flight ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
canceled a meeting with the Belgian foreign minister at the last
moment Wednesday, one day after European Union nations agreed to
ban flights of Yugoslavia's airlines.
	   ``The EU decision irritates the Yugoslav authorities,'' said
Hubert Cooreman, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Erik Derycke.
	   Derycke, who is on a visit to Yugoslavia and Macedonia, was
supposed to meet Milosevic in Belgrade Wednesday morning. ``It was
canceled this morning. We think the flight ban decision is behind
this decision.''
	   Instead Derycke met a vice-president in the Yugoslav government,
Nikola Sainovic.
	   Sainovic's office said the vice-president ``stressed the need
that European Union took a more constructive and much more balanced
stand toward the problem in Kosovo.''
	   ``One-sided pressure, threats and measures, such as the
completely baseless ban on JAT flights, have only counter-effect,''
Sainovic said in a statement.

Suspected Philippine Muslim rebels abduct Italian priest, 12
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped words in 9th graf and 11th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels
abducted an Italian priest and briefly held 12 Filipinos, including
children, in the southern Philippines, police said Wednesday.
	   Police said Fr. Luciano Benedetti and the other victims were
taken at gunpoint Tuesday night from a church and a nearby
church-run cooperative store and forced into several boats in the
remote coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   The Filipinos were later abandoned unharmed in a mountainous
area and rescued by police special forces, regional police
commander Dominador Domingo said.
	   The Italian Embassy in Manila said provincial Governor Isagani
Amatong confirmed the kidnappings. Benedetti, 56, is from Treviso
City, Italy.
	   Domingo said more than 20 men armed with rifles and grenade
launchers barged into the church and store and took Benedetti and
the others after ransacking the store.
	   The abducted Filipinos included the store manager, his staff and
their children.
	   Domingo said two men approached a town resident and asked for
directions to the church. After finding it, the two men signaled
the armed men to enter.
	   Domingo said no one has yet claimed responsibility for the
abductions or demanded ransom. Police and military teams have been
ordered to search hinterland mountain areas and islands near
Sibuco, he said.
	   Police officials said the released Filipinos told them the
abductors apparently were Muslim guerrillas belonging to the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front. Some wore jackets with the MILF insignia,
the officials said.
	   Benedetti belongs to a missionary group called the Pontifical
Institute for Foreign Missions and is one of about 70 Italian
priests assigned to the southern region of Mindanao.
	   Italian Embassy spokesman Andreas Ferarese said the other
Italian priests in Mindanao would not be recalled despite the
abduction.
	   ``It is part of their mission to be in this zone. They're aware
of the danger and we couldn't force them to evacuate,'' Ferarese
said.
	   The abduction was carried out despite a high-profile campaign by
President Joseph Estrada to eradicate crimes such as kidnappings,
which frequently target wealthy traders and have led to a
significant flight of capital from the Philippines in recent years.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the government to establish an independent Islamic state in the
southern Philippines.
	   It is engaged in on-and-off peace talks with Philippine
officials and has signed a region-wide cease-fire with the Manila
government but continues sporadic attacks on government and
civilian targets.
	   Sibuco, about 810 kilometers (500 miles) south of Manila, is one
of several areas controlled by the MILF.

Serbian police, KLA guerrillas clash in northwest Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police battled independence-minded
Albanian militants at a gold and zinc mine on Wednesday, in a rare
instance of fighting in the Serbian province's northwest.
	   The Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia _
said fighting began after members of the Kosovo Liberation Army
attacked police and guards at the Stari Trg mine, about 30
kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has been to the southwest
of Pristina, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up
to push KLA fighters out of their strongholds there. With the area
around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was possible that a
similar government offensive had been ordered in that region.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, said strong detonations could be heard
in Kosovska Mitrovica town, and at Podujevo, further east.
	   Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanians, most of them
supportive of the KLA's armed struggle for independence after
decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most of them ethnic Albanian _ have been
killed in the 6-month-old crackdown on the guerrillas and more than
265,000 others have been forced to flee their shelled and
burned-out villages.
	   The Serbs, for their part, have accused the militants of
massacring Serb civilians in at least two cases.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegations, police on Tuesday
showed reporters and international observers bodies of some alleged
victims near the rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where they claimed
some 40 Serb civilians were executed. They said they knew of more
similar execution sites in the area.
	   Reporters saw seven decomposed bodies, one beheaded and another
missing limbs, lying on the ground under a heavy rain. Police said
the bodies were those of Serb civilians. No more bodies could be
immediately seen _ despite police claims there were others _ and no
details on the victims were available.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo since
fighting started in early March. They claim the rebels kidnapped
them. Earlier this month, police showed charred remains of what
they said were burned bodies of Serb civilians in another former
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold.
	   On Wednesday, the government-run Politika daily in Belgrade said
preliminary investigations of those alleged killings, in Klecka
village, showed 10 people were burned there, including two
children, aged 8 and 12. It cited Aleksandar Dobricanin, a Serb
doctor heading the investigations, as saying some of the bones will
be sent to Moscow and London for detailed analysis and
identification.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to order a
stop to the offensive against Kosovo villages. Authorities say they
have no intention of ending the fight against the province's
``terrorists.''
	   After meeting Milosevic on the weekend, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, said that Milosevic
was responsible for the the rebellion in Kosovo and that war or
peace in the province depended on him alone.
	   On Tuesday, the reliable Belgrade newspaper Glas Javnosti said
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans for Kosovo, an apparent sign that the Yugoslav
president was seeking a compromise. With Albanians dominating the
province, any election could legally empower ethnic Albanian
leaders now leading the independence struggle and allow them to
re-establish some of Kosovo's autonomy that Milosevic rescinded in
1989.
	   Elections on all levels in Yugoslavia are being demanded by
anti-Milosevic politicians. On Tuesday, the Alliance for Change
opposition coalition warned that ``Yugoslavia is falling apart,''
and said new leadership was needed to democratize the country.

U.S. envoy may prolong stay in Middle East if deal close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ross-Arafat meeting tentatively set to start at 1800 gmt &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' new Mideast peace
mission is open-ended and may be extended if progress is being made
toward a deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that an accord was not yet
within reach since Israel and the Palestinians still differ on key
issues, such as the scope of withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Ross was to arrive later Wednesday and hold talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the evening. On Thursday, Ross
was to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Ross will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement is close, said
a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The envoy could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to
work out in a possible summit in New York later this month when the
two leaders, as well as U.S. President Bill Clinton, attend the
U.N. General Assembly, Israeli newspapers said.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross would focus on the biggest stumbling
block _ negotiating a new agreement on security issues which Israel
has made a precondition for a troop withdrawal.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   In a meeting Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Palestinian security officials
told CIA representatives they were not willing to renegotiate the
whole agreement, but would consider suggested changes.
	   Both sides have in principle agreed to an Israeli pullback from
13 percent, but the Palestinians have rejected an Israeli
stipulation that 3 percent of the area be turned into a nature
reserve with building restrictions for the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians originally accepted the
nature reserve idea but then backed down, reportedly due to
pressure from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   The U.S. peace initiative, initially presented in January, calls
for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent and a series of
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal, but Israeli initially rejected a 13 percent pullback.
	   The Palestinians have expressed concern that the United States
would agree to Israeli demands for changes in the U.S. plan.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said the ball was
in Israel's court. ``I hope that Mr. Ross will choose the shortest
way to have Mr. Netanyahu say yes to the American initiative,'' he
said.

A tiny Caribbean nation dreams of medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A tiny banana-growing Caribbean
nation has only one proper playing field which is used for soccer,
cricket and athletics.
	   But that has not deterred St. Vincent and The Grenadines from
sending a team to the 16th Commonwealth Games. It even dreams of
winning a medal.
	   The nation, a cluster of islands with 107,000 inhabitants, has
sent eight sportsmen to compete in track and field and boxing
events.
	   It hopes that marathon runner Benedict Ballantyne will win a
medal, said team Chef-de-Mission Claire Thomas. Ballantyne is the
Caribbean marathon champion.
	   ``He is our medal hope,'' Thomas said.
	   The islands could have dreamed of another medal if their 400m
runner, Esworth Coombs, had not pulled out because a hamstring
injury.
	   ``Coombs was a semi-finalist in Atlanta with a time of 45.29
seconds and his absence is sorely felt,'' Coach Godfrey Harry said.
Olympics were held in Atlanta in 1996.

Pakistan may defer external debt repayments, loan restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan, shaken by international
sanctions and scant foreign exchange reserves, may have to stall
foreign debt payments and seek loan restructuring from Western
countries, a government official warned Wednesday.
	   A joint International Monetary Fund and World Bank team is due
Friday in Islamabad for crucial talks on bailing out the country's
economy, which sank to new lows due to international sanctions.
Hostile neighbors Pakistan and India were hit with economic
sanctions after conducting nuclear tests in May.
	   The six-member team and Pakistani experts hope to put together a
crisis program within two weeks for October approval by the IMF's
board at its Washington meeting. The Pakistani government has
openly raised the idea of deferring debt payments, and blamed the
crisis on international sanctions. Those included a stop on crucial
IMF loans.
	   ``This will be a unique default, if happens at all, for it would
not be for homegrown reasons, but would be imposed from outside,''
Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar told the National Assembly on Tuesday.
	   A senior government official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, on Wednesday said Pakistan lacks the currency reserves
needed to met this month's foreign debt obligations and has to seek
loan restructuring.
	   Pakistan, burdened by a dlrs 32 billion external debt, is
supposed to repay about dlrs 750 million a month in foreign debt,
yet in early September had total foreign reserve of just dlrs 700
million.
	   Hafeez Pasha, financial adviser to prime minister, was seeking
emergency funding from the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi Arabi.
	   The senior government official said no formal request for
restructuring up to half Pakistan's bilateral loans was expected
until after meetings with the IMF and World Bank. He said Pakistan
expects the two global lenders to offer a dlrs 2.5 billion loan and
credit package.
	   Mushtaq Khan, chief analyst of ABN AMRO Bank in Islamabad, said,
``Lenders will not be screaming `default,' because the IMF is in
negotiations with the country. A delay on loan payments is usual
until actual restructuring is done.''
	   Nadeem Naqvi, chief analyst of International Asset Management
Co., said loan restructuring would have a severe, short-term impact
on Pakistan's economy, because lenders would demand painful
austerity measures.
	   Those could include broader and higher taxes, government
spending cuts and reforms in state-run institutions.

Japan not ruling out possible second North Korean missile test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has no hard evidence that North Korea plans
to test fire a second missile, but believes such a launch might be
carried out despite protests from Tokyo, a government spokesman
said Wednesday.
	   One week after North Korea fired what is believed to have been a
ballistic missile over Japan, Russia'a ITAR-Tass news agency on
Monday cited an unidentified diplomatic source as saying North
Korea would conduct another test on Wednesday.
	   But there was no indication a second firing had taken place as
of late Wednesday in Tokyo, the Japanese spokesman said.
	   ``We are not ruling out the possibility'' of a second launch at
some point, said Akitaka Saiki, deputy press secretary to the
Japanese prime minister. ``But we do not have any concrete
information.''
	   North Korea's Aug. 31 test of what U.S. and Japanese defense
officials described as a newly developed, two-stage ballistic
missile caused an outcry in Tokyo. Japan immediately halted
economic aid to its impoverished communist neighbor.
	   North Korea, however, contends the launch simply sent a
scientific satellite into orbit and accused Japan of overreacting.
	   The U.S. State Department said Tuesday it has not been able to
observe any orbiting object which correlates with data provided by
North Koreans in public statements.
	   Also Tuesday, Japan informally expressed its concerns about the
apparent missile firing to the U.N. Security Council in the hopes
of calling a formal meeting to condemn North Korea's action, Saiki
said.
	   Japan has begun considering launching a ``multiple purpose
reconnaissance satellite'' of its own so that it can monitor any
future missile launches by North Korea independent of the United
States.
	   The launch shocked many Japanese, but a Foreign Ministry
official said Wednesday that Japan had received information
beforehand that such a test might occur and had warned Pyongyang
not to carry out a missile firing.

traders said.

trading, was down 82.02 points, or 1.6 percent, at 5013.20 points.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was considering compromise
candidates for prime minister Wednesday, including an ex-Soviet
official, as political leaders called for swift action to pull
Russia out of an economic nosedive.
	   Government officials gave conflicting signals on how soon
Yeltsin would announce a decision, with some saying he would act
Wednesday. Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he did
not know if a decision had been made.
	   ``We are waiting for the decision of the president,'' he said,
refusing to speculate on possible candidates for the post.
	   Yeltsin was closeted at his country home outside Moscow, meeting
with top aides and deciding if he would agree to a compromise
candidate for prime minister.
	   There was speculation Wednesday in the Duma, the lower chamber
of parliament, that Yeltsin may be considering Yuri Maslyukov, a
Soviet-era economic official and a member of the Communist Party.
Maslyukov has worked with Yeltsin before, resigning last week as
trade and industry minister.
	   Communist and centrist leaders both praised Maslyukov, saying
they would back him for prime minister. The Kremlin denied reports
by lawmakers that Yeltsin met Wedneday with Maslyukov.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended lower Wednesday, as
banking problems in Japan and profit-taking in Hong Kong pulled
down markets despite Wall Street's 5 percent rally overnight.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues closed at 14,755.54,
down 157.95 points, or 1.1 percent, on concerns over the health of
Japan's financial system.
	   The dollar was trading at 133.15 late Wednesday, up 0.95 yen
from late Tuesday in New York. It fell as low as 130.45 yen
Wednesday morning.
	   Rumors that Fuji Bank Ltd. is facing huge derivatives losses
overseas triggered selling in the banking sector, traders said. The
bank later denied the rumors as ``totally groundless.''
	   ``With lack of positive news for banks lately, the rumors
dampened market sentiment,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at
Nikko Securities.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator
of blue chips _ fell 283.80 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at
7,905.45.
	   The drop surprised many small retail investors, who thought
share prices would track the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
	   ``The Hong Kong market is like a gambling zone. The so-called
investors are just playing around with tricks,'' said Raymond
Leung, 39, a telecommunications executive.
	   The Hang Seng had gained 12 percent since last Friday, following
the announcements of a series of market control measures to
strengthen its currency link to the U.S. dollar and quash
speculative activities.
	   Malaysian shares closed sharply higher on a technical rebound,
after Tuesday's 21-percent fall. The benchmark Composite Index
rallied 40.09 points, or 12 percent, to 389.65, compared with
349.56 points Tuesday.
	   Some traders said persistent rumors that government-linked funds
and even central bank buying into the market were spurring more
investment.
	   On Tuesday, Malaysian stocks plummeted as a regulatory reprieve
gave foreigners their first chance to sell shares since the
government imposed capital controls on Sept. 1.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index was up 16.78 points, or
1.9 percent, to close at 885.46.
	   Malaysian-over-the-counter shares, which resumed after a
three-day suspension, were heading the top price gainers' and most
actively traded lists as the three-day trading suspension was
lifted Wednesday. Trading of those shares will cease permanently in
one week.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Stock prices ended higher as Wall Street's gains
sparked massive buying in energy stocks, despite lingering concerns
over Thailand's financial system. The SET index gained 1.13 points,
or 0.5 percent, to end at 213.98.
	   JAKARTA: Escalating fears over domestic political stability
coupled with bearish trend in some regional major markets drove the
shares prices down. The JSX Composite Index was down 4.651 points,
or 1.4 percent, to close at 325.762.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed lower on profit-taking in financial
shares, prompted by worries over the fundamentals of Taiwan's
economy. The Weighted Price Index was down 47.69 points, or 0.6
percent, to close at 6,894.57.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower, hobbled by poor regional
economic prospects and the growing clamor from local businessmen
for currency controls. The PSE Index was down 34.65 points, or 2.9
percent, to close at 1,157.43.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares finished lower as market pessimism carried
over from gloomy government economic forecasts outweighed a
positive lead from Wall Street overnight. The benchmark NZSE-40
index was down 16.52 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 1,793.15.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on a stable yen and hopes that
the U.S. may lower interest rates. The benchmark KOSPI index was up
2.87 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 329.22.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower as slides in Hong Kong
and Japan markets prompted selling in resource and mining stocks.
The All Ordinaries index was down 12.7 points, or 0.4 percent, to
close at 2,542.5.

Airbus, Boeing lock horns in fresh jet-selling duel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with new Airbus deal, Boeing announcements, EDITING

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The intense air show rivalry between
Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Co. tilted toward the Europeans
early Wednesday, as Airbus announced dlrs 4 billion in new jet
orders and dlrs 3 billion more in options.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard was all smiles as he
unveiled big deals with United Parcel Service _ an important new
customer _ and a large U.S. leasing company, General Electric
Capital Aviation Services, a subsidiary of GE Capital.
	   The big U.S. purchasers are becoming increasingly aware that it
doesn't matter where their airplanes are made, Forgeard told
reporters in a thinly concealed swipe at his competitor, the Boeing
Co. of Seattle.
	   Boeing, meanwhile, did not get off to nearly such a good start
on the third day of the Farnborough International 98 air show, the
biggest event of the year in the global aerospace industry.
	   Boeing said late Wednesday morning it had sold five new 737s to
Scandinavian Airlines System and one to a small Greek carrier.
Boeing also announced a sketchier arrangement to sell one big
747-400 to a startup Sri Lankan carrier called PeaceAir that plans,
among other things, to fly religious pilgrims to holy sites.
	   ``Peace begins with a smile,'' said PeaceAir's chairman, Gamini
Wethasinghe, his voice choking with emotion as he described plans
to give 80 percent of profits to charity. ``When PeaceAir starts,
we hope to bring peace and joy.''
	   A Boeing regional vice president, Tom Basacchi, said that the
737 orders from SAS ``reaffirms that we have the right product for
the European market.''
	   Airbus struck a massive deal with United Parcel Service _ which
ordered 30 A300FR-600R cargo jets and took options on 30 more in a
package priced at around dlrs 5 billion if UPS takes all of the
airplane. It was the first time Airbus had sold planes to UPS, the
huge delivery company based in Louisville, Kentucky.
	   Earlier, Airbus said GE Capital had placed firm orders for 30
models from the Airbus A320 series _ with options for 10 more in a
deal worth up to dlrs 2 billion. GE Capital leases out its jets to
airlines that don't buy their own fleets.
	   The firm orders brought Airbus sales by the third day of
Farnborough to dlrs 6.7 billion _ with billions more in options.
	   A day earlier, archrival the Boeing Co. had announced a big sale
to Brazilian carrier Varig that brought Boeing's total firm orders
at Farnborough to around dlrs 3 billion, list price.
	   Its smaller deals announced Wednesday pushed the total asking
price to around dlrs 3.2 billion _ although Boeing, too, racked up
many more hundreds of millions in option agreements.
	   The actual price negotiated by airlines is lower, but neither
the carriers nor the manufacturers will disclose the real figures,
which they regard as sensitive competive information.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defiant opposition leaders vowed
Wednesday to intensify mass protests against strongman Hun Sen,
even as riot police shot Buddhist monks and used clubs, guns and
water cannon to scatter rock-throwing demonstrators demanding his
ouster.
	   About 1,000 protesters were dispersed in morning clashes near
the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. Some regrouped later in smaller clusters around
the city until police would arrive to scatter them again.
	   Thousands returned in late afternoon to the embassy
neighborhood, a new focal point of unrest following Tuesday's
destruction of a protest camp outside the National Assembly. Only a
few police were present.
	   Human-rights workers reported a Buddhist monk was killed by
gunfire in the morning clash. One and possibly two were wounded.
The death could not be confirmed despite a complete search of
morgues and hospitals.
	   On the streets people believed several monks had been killed,
stoking anger against Hun Sen. They erected shrines where the monks
were shot, burning incense and piling up the monks' broken
parasols.
	   Leaflets circulated in the name of a monks' organization urging
people to rise up and overthrow Hun Sen. Many people expressed hope
the United States would help drive him from power.
	   ``People are sorrowful and angry,'' said Lem Tong, 34, a
businessman. ``Monks are holy people. Hun Sen will keep killing
people if he can. We want to overthrow this dicatator.''
	   Earlier, Ranariddh told supporters of his FUNCINPEC party that
Hun Sen sparked a ``real revolution'' by sending police Tuesday to
destroy the protest camp known as Democracy Square, where an
unprecedented 16-day vigil had been mounted against his rule.
	   An angry Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy applied for
permission to hold a peaceful mass rally Sunday.
	   ``It is in the interests of this government to authorize a
peaceful demonstration, rather than letting what is happening now
to continue,'' the prince said. ``It's now time for Mr. Hun Sen to
stop using violence.''
	   Such rallies have drawn as many as 20,000 people. One now could
provoke more violence as Hun Sen moves to reassert the power he has
held for 13 years.
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago.
	   Hun Sen drew a tougher line following a grenade attack Monday
against his home. He was not present and no one was hurt. Hun Sen
has denied opposition allegations that he staged the attack as a
pretext.
	   Sam Rainsy sought refuge in the local U.N. offices after Hun Sen
ordered his arrest. The order has been rescinded, but his
supporters doubt Hun Sen's intentions.
	   Sam Rainsy emerged from the offices, with a U.N. escort, to meet
Ranariddh on Wednesday. He called the violence ``unacceptable'' and
the allegations he was behind the grenade attack ``ridiculous.''
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s representative, was traveling to the
northern city of Siem Reap to enlist the help of King Norodom
Sihanouk, the prince's father, to defuse the crisis.
	   The prince said the violence was deepening, not resolving,
deadlock resulting from July 26 parliamentary elections that Hun
Sen's party won, but failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of massive electoral fraud and
has threatened to withhold support, raising the prospect Cambodia
could soon have no legal goverment.
	   In the morning protest, police fired warning shots to scatter
protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, and charged. They
clubbed people trapped against the walls and turned water cannon on
a group of 30 praying monks.
	   APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the the head by a rock
and required 10 stitches. Several other people were injured.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The clean-up is going to continue,'' government spokesman
Khieu Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry
on the demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the
law.''
	   About 120 people received protection under the walls of the
embassy. They were among the 1,000 people driven out from Democracy
Square. They said they could not return to their villages, since
the Hun Sen-allied headmen had warned them not to protest.

Kenya bans six Islamic aid agencies after U.S. Embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya banned six aid agencies linked to
Islamic organizations, including at least one raided in connection
with terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The groups were banned because they ``had been found to be
working against the interests of Kenyans in terms of security,''
John Etemesi, chairman of the Nongovernmental Coordinating Board,
which registers aid agencies in Kenya, said Tuesday, according to
the Daily Nation newspaper.
	   ``Our investigations reveal that the operations of these
organizations are inconsistent with the reasons for which they were
registered,'' Etemesi said without elaborating.
	   Etemesi out of his office Wednesday. His assistant, who declined
to be named, confirmed the ban but declined to elaborate.
	   FBI agents and Kenyan detectives raided the offices of one of
the banned organizations, Mercy Relief International, in Nairobi
following the Aug. 7 terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The blasts killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured more than 5,500 people.
	   The government also banned Help Africa People, Al Haramain
Foundation, and the Ibrahim bin Abdul Aziz al Ibrahim Foundation,
all three of which are based in Nairobi, plus the International
Islamic Relief Organization, which is based in the Indian Ocean
port of Mombasa.
	   A sixth banned agency, Rabitat Islam Ali Slam of Nairobi, was
not registered, but illegally engaged in relief work, Etemesi said.
	   All six of the agencies serve Kenya's Muslim community.
	   Telephone calls to the agencies went unanswered Wednesday.
	   Two suspects in the Nairobi bombing _ Mohamed Rashed Daoud
Al-'Owhali and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh _ were flown from Kenya to New
York last month to face charges.
	   Authorities in the United States have linked the pair to Islamic
militant Osama bin Laden.
	   The International Islamic Relief Organization has its main
office in a Mombasa neighborhood where Odeh formerly lived. His
Kenyan wife and son are now staying in a relative's home nearby.
	   The International Islamic Relief Organization had earlier lost
its exemption from paying customs duties after the Finance Ministry
complained the agency was selling its duty-free food to merchants.
	   The organization's operations were concentrated along the Indian
Ocean coast and in eastern and northeastern regions where most of
Kenya's Muslim community lives.

Murdoch buys Manchester United for record price

	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United, among the world's wealthiest
soccer clubs, announced Wednesday its board has accepted a record
623.4 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) buyout offer from Rupert
Murdoch's BSkyB satellite television company.
	   The deal, the highest price ever paid for a sports team, evoked
a storm of protest from fans and some lawmakers, and many charged
it would give the Australian-born media magnate a stranglehold on
televising Premier League soccer.
	   A supporters' club vowed to fight the deal, which needs the
approval of shareholders and the government, and protests were
urged at Wednesday night's match against Charlton Athletic.
	   ``We've certainly not betrayed our supporters,'' Manchester
United chief executive Martin Edwards said, facing a string of
largely hostile questions at a joint news conference. ``We've
secured a safe future for them.''
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at about 240 pence (396 cents) each. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198
cents) plus 0.2537 BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share.
On Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester United
shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   The price far outstripped the dlrs 350 million that Fox Sports,
a division of Murdoch's News Corp., paid for the Los Angeles
Dodgers in March _ a record price for a baseball team.
	   BSkyB chief executive Martin Booth tried to allay fans' fears.
	   ``Our interests are 100 percent aligned with the Manchester
United fans,'' Booth said. ``They want to win the league, so do we.
They want to win the (Football Association) cup, so do we. They
want to have the best players and best manager, so do we.''
	   But Andy Walsh, chairman of the newly formed Independent
Manchester United Supporters Association, said his group would
fight the deal ``at all costs.''
	   ``If not, we will not be Manchester United any longer, we will
just be part of his organization,'' he said of Murdoch.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government reiterated
that the takeover would be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The issue is sensitive for Blair. The Murdoch-owned Sun,
Britain's biggest-selling daily newspaper, switched support from
the Conservative Party to Labor at national elections last year and
Blair is vulnerable to charges of owing Murdoch a favor.
	   As well as concerns about a major broadcaster now owning a major
soccer club, the criticisms reflected strong emotional attachments
to Manchester United.
	   Asked how many times Murdoch has visited Old Trafford, the
club's grounds, Booth replied, ``It is not relevant whether Mr.
Murdoch goes to the game or not.''
	   He also denied BSkyB had struck the deal because its current
sole right to broadcast Premier League matches runs out in 2001.
	   ``Murdoch wants to sit on one side of the table offering a price
for televised games, then move round and sit on the other side for
Manchester United, accepting or rejecting it,'' said Joe Ashton, a
Labor lawmaker who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group
on soccer. ``That can't be fair.''
	   The Sun, under a front-page headline ``It's A Deal,'' and the
other big British daily newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp.,
The Times of London, reported the takeover enthusiastically.
	   But rivals stoked the criticism.
	   ``Sold To The Red Devil,'' announced The Mirror, alongside a
front-page picture of Murdoch with horns.

Austrian students said to be too fat, often emotionally disturbed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian high school students are too
fat, too often emotionally disturbed, and the government needs to
provide better health care for them, a group of doctors said
Wednesday.
	   Dr. Kurt Widhalm told reporters that Austrian 16-year-olds today
weigh on average two kilos (4.4 pounds) more than the same age
group 10 years ago.
	   Dr. Gerhard Weintoegl, head of the commission in charge of
school health programs, said educators should strengthen health and
fitness education in the classroom and increase the number of
doctors available to students during the school day.
	   A prominent Viennese child psychiatrist, Dr. Max Friedrich, also
told reporters he is noticing an increase in the number of Austrian
children and teens with psychological and emotional problems.
	   Friedrich pointed to an increase in unsafe practices such as
sprinting back and forth across highways in front of on-coming
traffic and running across subway tracks for sport.
	   No reasons were given for the problems.
	   Weintoegl complained that most academic studies on child
psychology and behavior patterns available to Austrian educators
were woefully outdated and need to be revised to develop programs
to care for problems of childhood and adolescence.

More ethnic Chinese in Indonesia staying in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to ``an'' from ``a'' in lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An increasing number of ethnic Chinese
Indonesians with Hong Kong residency stayed in the territory from
May to July, apparently to escape recent anti-Chinese violence in
Indonesia, government statistics released Wednesday showed.
	   About 10,900 Indonesians who also have Kong residency privileges
visited the Chinese territory from May to July, a 25 percent
increase from the same period a year ago, according to data
released by the Hong Kong Security Bureau.
	   Some 3,425 Indonesians with Hong Kong residency showed up the
territory in May, when widespread riots resulted in the toppling of
former Indonesian leader Suharto _ 38 percent more than the
previous year.
	   In July, amid fears that more riots would break out around the
August National Day, the number surged 26.1 percent. In June, when
order was temporarily restored in Indonesia, the increase was just
5.9 percent.
	   Outrage over the anti-Chinese attacks has galvanized ethnic
Chinese worldwide, sparking protests outside several Indonesian
diplomatic posts, including in Hong Kong, and calls for action by
Beijing.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May's violence and hundreds of
homes and buildings, mainly Chinese-owned, were looted, damaged and
burned.
	   Women's rights groups estimate at least 168 women and girls,
most from the ethnic Chinese minority, were raped during the riots
that helped drive Suharto from power.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
but control an estimated 70 percent of the country's wealth. As
such, they have been made into scapegoats for the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Hong Kong's Security Bureau said it doesn't keep track of the
race of visitors, only their nationality, and therefore unsure
whether more ethnic Chinese Indonesians who are not Hong Kong
residents had fled to the territory.
	   Indonesian nationals can stay in Hong Kong visa free for 14
days. There's been no reports of a surge in the number of
Indonesians overstaying their visas.

Report: Israel and Turkey to hold joint air exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new sign of increasing military
cooperation, Israel and Turkey are to hold their first joint air
exercise this month, a British journal said Wednesday.
	   Several Arab countries in the region, especially Syria, have
expressed concern about the Israeli-Turkish military alliance.
	   Israel and Turkey say their cooperation is not directed against
other countries and is aimed at promoting stability in the region.
	   The air exercise will take place in Israel between Sept. 13-16,
Jane's Defence Weekly reported. Turkish F-16 jet fighters from
Diyarbakir air base will take part, the journal said.
	   Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu would not
confirm or deny the report, but said confirmed that the Israeli and
Turkish air forces have already trained in each other's air space.
	   ``Each side carries out maneuvers according to its needs, taking
advantage of the air space of the other country,'' he said.
	   A squadron of Turkish F-16s was in Israel in June to train on
testing grounds run by the Israel Air Force and the Rafael arms
development authority, the Jerusalem Post newspaper said Wednesday.
	   At the range in southern Israel, pilots train to evade
surface-to-air missiles - possibly similar to the Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles Greek Cypriots plan to deploy in November to
balance Turkish air superiority over the island, the paper said.
	   The Israel army spokesman's office denied Turkish media reports
that Turkish pilots had trained in Israel to evade the S-300.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who visited Israel this
week, confirmed that the Israeli and Turkish navies will conduct a
joint search and rescue naval exercise in November, their second
this year.

Report: Taiwan's intelligence chief visits Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's intelligence chief has gone to
Moscow on a secret visit to discuss cooperation on intelligence
gathering and crime control, a Taiwanese TV network reported
Wednesday.
	   In a report from Moscow, the Taiwan Television network said Wang
Kuang-yu, head of the Bureau of Investigation, arrived in Moscow on
Tuesday to learn intelligence gathering from the KGB, Russia's spy
agency.
	   The network quoted members of Taiwan's unofficial mission in
Moscow as saying Wang was in Moscow on a business trip, without
elaborating. Taiwanese government officials were not immediately
available for comment.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government which fled the
communist takeover of the Chinese mainland in 1949.
	   For decades, the Nationalists considered the Soviet Union a
hostile nation and blamed their defeat in the Chinese civil war on
Soviet aid to the Chinese communists.
	   But trade and other unofficial ties were established in the late
1980s, when Taiwan relaxed its anti-communist policies. Trade
between Taiwan and Russia totaled more than U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion
in 1997.
	   Wednesday's report was the first time any spying cooperation was
reported between the former foes.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was considering compromise
candidates for prime minister Wednesday, including an ex-Soviet
official, as political leaders called for swift action to pull
Russia out of an economic nosedive.
	   Government officials gave conflicting signals on how soon
Yeltsin would announce a decision, with some saying he would act
Wednesday. Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he did
not know if a decision had been made.
	   ``We are waiting for the decision of the president,'' he said,
refusing to speculate on possible candidates for the post.
	   Yeltsin was closeted at his country home outside Moscow, meeting
with top aides and deciding if he would agree to a compromise
candidate for prime minister.
	   There was speculation Wednesday in the Duma, the lower chamber
of parliament, that Yeltsin may be considering Yuri Maslyukov, a
Soviet-era economic official and a member of the Communist Party.
Maslyukov has worked with Yeltsin before, resigning last week as
trade and industry minister.
	   Communist and centrist leaders praised Maslyukov, saying they
would back him for prime minister. Maslyukov met Wednesday with
Yeltsin's chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, but there were no
details on what they discussed, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Israel says it's trying for peace, Egypt is skeptical
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli official said Wednesday that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing his best to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, but Egyptian officials were
skeptical any progress has been achieved.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh spoke after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled peace process, saying Israel
wants to restart full negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Naveh read a statement saying Netanyahu was ``doing his best to
reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.''
	   ``We have a desire, from our side, to return to negotiations
with the Palestinians until we reach an agreement,'' Naveh said.
	   He refused to answer reporters' questions about the status of
negotiations, but said Netanyahu had sent him to Egypt to inform
Mubarak of the latest developments between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Naveh's visit came hours before U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to
arrive for talks with Arafat and Netanyahu about a reported
American plan to restart talks by having Israeli troops to withdraw
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which calls for
increased efforts to curb attacks on Israel by Islamic militants,
but Netanyahu's government has so far refused to go along with the
plan.
	   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, who attended
Wednesday's meeting along with Israel's ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel, told reporters that ``the situation, until now, does not
show that tangible progress has been made.''
	   He added that Mubarak believes failure to reach an agreement
will lead to tension and instability in the region ``and this is
not in the interest of any side, including Egypt.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed skepticism
about any progress Tuesday, describing the Middle East peace
process as frozen.
	   ``According to what we are hearing and reading, there is little
hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa told
reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen after
Ross arrives.''
	   Israel has said the pullback would compromise its security, but
it has suggested an alternative, withdrawing from 10 percent and
turning an additional 3 percent into ``nature reserves'' where
Palestinians would not have the right to build.
	   The Palestinians have been reluctant to accept the alternative
and are hoping Washington will pressure Israel to go along with the
original U.S. idea.
	   Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool since their 1979 peace
treaty, have worsened since the election of the hard-line Netanyahu
in 1996. Egypt has joined other Arab countries in blaming Netanyahu
for the stalemate in Arab-Israeli negotiations.

Germany wins back looted painting in British court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spelling of Wtewael is correct in graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Germany won a High Court battle Wednesday to
recover a 16th-century Dutch painting looted from a German art
gallery in the final days of World War II.
	   Judge Sir Alan Moses ruled that the work by Joachim Wtewael,
which a Panamanian corporation was trying to sell through Sotheby's
auction house, must be returned to the Federal Republic of Germany.
	   ``The Holy Family with Saints John and Elizabeth and Angels''
was stolen from a gallery in the eastern province of Thuringia
during the Red Army's advances through Germany in 1945.
	   After a tangled post-war history, it was bought in 1989 by
Cobert Finance SA, which tried to sell it through Sotheby's in
1992. It was withdrawn from sale when doubts about its provenance
were raised in the news media.
	   The judge ruled Wednesday that Cobert ``did deliberately conceal
facts'' in the ownership dispute with the city of Gotha, together
with Germany.
	   One of the crucial issues in the case was a German legal time
limit.
	   Cobert said Germany had lost all rights of ownership because its
claim was made after the legal limit of 30 years from the date the
painting was taken from the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Ducal Foundation for
Art and Science.
	   ``The judge has said that, under English law, anyone who has
concealed facts which would help an owner cannot rely on the
limitation period,'' Michael Carl, attorney for the German
authorities, said after the ruling.
	   During the hearing, Alexander Layton, a lawyer for the German
authorities, told the judge the decision would be closely watched
by the London auction houses at the center of the international art
trade.
	   ``There are many thousands of works of art known to exist before
this century's wars, which remain hidden, and it is thought that
the outcome of this case may have a significant bearing on the
extent to which those who now have those lost works of art will
sell them for their own profit, without fear of claims by their
rightful owners,'' Layton said.
	   It was not immediately known if there would be an appeal against
the ruling.

China drags away dissident; Robinson says respect human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and CORRECTS title in 5th graf previous `Asked
about ... ' to Assistant, sted Vice foreign minister. &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Moments after police dragged away a dissident
waiting to meet her, U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson told
China Wednesday that respect for rights and economic growth go hand
in hand.
	   Plainclothes police and hotel security grabbed Chu Hailan as she
stood quietly outside the entrance to a swanky Beijing hotel
waiting to ask Robinson's help in seeking freedom for her jailed,
ailing dissident husband.
	   ``I want to see Miss Mary,'' Chu Hailan screamed as she was
pulled through the Hilton Hotel lobby.
	   Chu later said plainclothes police beat her on the head and in
the stomach while in the hotel. She was then taken to a local
police station and released late Wednesday afternoon, eight hours
after being hauled away.
	   Robinson had yet to arrive at the hotel when police detained
Chu. When asked about it later, Robinson said she brought it up
with Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Guangya. ``I know her concerns
are very serious concerns,'' Robinson said.
	   The police action threatened to muddy the careful path both
Robinson and Chinese leaders hoped her 10-day visit would take. It
is the first official mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, and both sides want it to end the confrontation
between China and U.N. groups on human rights.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   ``China can be commended for efforts to eliminate poverty and to
meet the basic needs of all,'' Robinson said in her speech,
acknowledging China's position that economic development takes
precedence over political rights.
	   But, she added, the ``right to development'' is based on
``respect for all human rights _ whether civil, cultural, economic,
political or social _ together, as an integrated whole _ and none
of these can be fully realized without democratic governance and
the rule of law.''
	   Robinson later told reporters she brought ``a number of
concerns'' raised by U.N. human rights teams that have visited
China to the attention of Chinese officials.
	   She did not elaborate. But a diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said U.N. groups on torture, arbitrary detention and
religion have recommended changes to Chinese officials.
	   ``The visit I think is going well. It's not an easy one, and I
hope there are not unreal expectations about what can be done on a
visit of this kind,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson has pressed Chinese officials on when they will meet a
six-month-old pledge to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, a key human rights treaty.
	   Robinson spent two hours with Minister of Justice Gao Changli on
Tuesday. She also met with Chinese academics who candidly discussed
the extensive use of the death penalty and police powers that allow
for detention without trial, said the diplomatic source.
	   Robinson left Beijing on Wednesday afternoon to spend two days
in Tibet. There she plans to follow up on a report that Tibetan
prisoners were interrogated and beaten after a visit last year by a
U.N. team on arbitrary detention, the source said.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials indicated
they did not want her to meet with government critics.
	   After Chu Hailan was prevented from meeting Robinson, Wang, the
assistant foreign minister, said Chu had no permit to stage a
demonstration, and police acted properly in removing her.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao claimed Chu had been
blocking the entrance to the hotel and disturbing order.
	   Police and hotel executives refused to comment.
	   Chu had been waiting for Robinson along with foreign reporters.
She said she wanted to ask for a meeting about her husband, labor
rights campaigner Liu Nianchun.
	   ``If she had said `no' I would have just gone home,'' she said.
	   One of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, Liu has been in
detention for more than three years without trial. Chu has been
seeking a medical parole to treat high blood pressure, stomach
problems and other ailments.

Signs growing of Kosovo refugee stream to Germany, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hundred of refugees, many apparently from Kosovo,
are camped near the Czech border waiting for a shot at slipping
undetected into Germany border patrol officials said Wednesday.
	   Fighting in the southern Serbian province has forced more than
200,000 people from their homes this summer, and Germany is afraid
many of them will head north to join family or friends.
	   German officials are already seeking to deport some 140,000
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo here illegally.
	   But those deportations were effectively halted by the European
Union's flight ban on the Yugoslav airline, which Germany began
enforcing Tuesday. Germany is bound by treaty with Belgrade to use
the Yugoslav airline, JAT, for such repatriations.
	   Steffen Claussner of the German border patrol office in Pirna,
said there were signs that a growing number of people from Kosovo
were headed toward Germany by land.
	   ``We know from our Czech colleagues that the relevant pensions
and hotels (in border towns) are completely full,'' he told the
Saechsische Zeitung. All were seeking to get to Germany, often with
the help of smugglers, he added.
	   Germany has spent more than any other European land _ some 20
billion marks (dlrs 11.2 billion) _ since 1991 caring for 450,000
war refugees, mostly from Bosnia.

Polish and Dutch 17th century coins found in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Workers in northeast Romania have dug
up almost 2,000 Polish and Dutch coins dating from the 17th
century, an official said Wednesday.
	   The find is ``an extraordinary discovery'' said curator Nicoleta
Arnautu of the Vasile Parvan museum. She said no value could be
established until the coins are cleaned.
	   The museum is in Barlad, some 250 kilometers (156 miles)
northeast of Bucharest. Workers digging a sewage ditch there last
week unearthed two ceramic pots containing the coins, of silver and
copper alloy.
	   Barlad was a stopping point for West European merchants en route
to the Ottoman Empire and Russia between the 15th and 18th
centuries.

One of Italy's most popular singer-songwriters dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Lucio Battisti, whose romantic and often sad
songs of the late 1960s and 1970s made him a kind of musical poet
of his times, died Wednesday in a Milan hospital after a long
illness. He was 55.
	   He and his family jealously guarded his privacy, and the
communique by the hospital, San Paolo, announcing his death, did
not cite the cause.
	   For countless Italians from their 20s to their 50s, the songs
that he wrote, played on his guitar and sang were intertwined with
their dreams.
	   But starting in the 1980s, when his hits became fewer, Battisti
virtually dropped out of sight, refusing to give interviews and
turning down public appearances.
	   ``A little piece of me died,'' said Roberto Maroni, a former
interior minister from the Northern League party and a musician
himself.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni sent a telegram to the widow,
Grazia Letizia Veronesi, saying ``For many Italians, Battisti's
songs were part of their lifetime.''
	   Many of Battisti's songs, like the hit ``Emozioni'' (Emotions),
were melancholy or sad and often spoke of betrayal in love. His
biggest successes came through his collaboration with lyricist
Mogol, but starting in the 1980s Battisti changed songwriter, the
lyrics were judged less accessible and the big sales slowed down.
	   But his old songs, like ``Pensieri e Parole,'' (Thoughts and
Words) and ``Fiori rosa, fiori di pesco'' (Rose petals, peach
blossoms), and his fast-stepping ``Acqua Azzura, Acqua Chiara''
(Blue Water, Clear Water), continued to sell well and were heavily
played on radio, and royalties brought him an estimated 1 billion
lire (dlrs 600,000) a year, according to Italian news reports.
	   After the news of his death, one radio station began to play his
songs non-stop, and fans gathered outside the hospital.
	   Battisti was credited with weaving into his songs elements of
rock and black music and introducing more marked rhythms into
Italian song composition, which had heavily depended on lyrics to
sell.
	   In his heyday, Battisti appeared at Italy's annual song festival
in San Remo.
	   Some of his compositions became hits for other top Italian
singers, such as ``Il Paradiso'' (The Paradise), song by Patty
Pravo. He was also a hit when singing with Mina, another star.
	   In keeping with Battisti's wish for privacy, the family
requested that only immediate family members be allowed into the
hospital room where the wake was held. Other survivors include a
son, Luca, a student who lives in England, a sister, Albarita, and
his father, Alfiero.
	   The funeral was also expected to be private.

	   MAKHACHKALA, Dagestan (AP) _ Heavily-armed police on Wednesday
intercepted a car and seized opposition leader Magomed Khachilayev,
who was wanted for storming a government building this spring.
	   A stun device, which produces a loud blast but causes little
damage, was detonated on a road in central Makhachkala, forcing
Khachilayev's car to stop.
	   Police with automatic rifles then seized Khachilayev, said
officers who took part in the operation. Khachilayev's brother,
Nadirshakh, was also in the car but managed to escape, police said.
	   Both Nadirshakh Khachilayev _ a member of the Russian parliament
and head of Russia's Muslim Union _ and Magomed Khachilayev, who
heads a group representing an ethnic minority in Dagestan, the
Laks, are accused of organizing an attack on a government building
in Makhachkala, capital of the Dagestan region last May.
	   Supporters of the Khachilayev brothers then held several
policemen and government officials hostage. They left peacefully
after receiving promises of a shakeup in the local government.

Ousted Malaysian steps up reform campaign

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy premier
lashed out at police Wednesday, saying his family and many
associates had been harassed by authorities since his firing last
week.
	   ``All my family friends and colleagues live in fear. They have
been threatened by the police,'' Anwar Ibrahim told reporters at
his home in a Kuala Lumpur suburb, where he has been holed up for a
week, fearing arrest.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar last week from his
posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister. Anwar is under
police investigation for allegations ranging from sexual misconduct
to treason.
	   Anwar said police pulled his private secretary from his car
Tuesday night for questioning and he had not been seen since.
	   Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Dermawan has also not been seen
since his arrest Sunday, Anwar said. Sukma is named as one of
Anwar's sex partners in a book that is at the heart of the
investigation against the ousted minister.
	   Police were not immediately available for comment.
	   ``This is not the Malaysia that I know,'' Anwar said angrily
Wednesday, directing his words at the police. ``This is not a
police state. You'll have to respect the laws of the country.''
	   Under virtual house arrest since last week, Anwar called on
supporters earlier Wednesday to help spread his reform message
nationwide.
	   ``We must spread the news. No power on earth can break our
spirits. You have to work now. Now! Now! Now!'' Anwar told a small
group of cheering supporters in his living room.
	   Anwar canceled a nationwide tour Tuesday saying that supporters
from around the country were traveling to him, but he was also
concerned for his personal safety.
	   Verbal attacks between Mahathir and Anwar intensified Tuesday
when the prime minister called Anwar immoral and accused him of
courting arrest to become a political martyr.
	   Anwar responded to Mahathir's comments indignantly Tuesday
night, drawing uproarious chants from the crowd for ``Reformasi!''
_ or reform _ the rallying cry for the Indonesian student movement.
	   ``It's the law of the jungle,'' Anwar bellowed through a
microphone to an audience of about 6,000. He noted there were no
formal charges against him but the ruling party had already
determined his guilt.
	   Anwar's speeches have been circulating around the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, on video and cassette recordings, on sale outside his home.
	   He called on supporters to distribute the tapes around the
country and stick newly printed bumper stickers to their car
windows that say: ``Reformation! Justice!''
	   ``Do I hate Dr. Mahathir? No, I remember his good deeds. But you
must also respect and honor justice and that means fighting for
reformation,'' Anwar said, punching a fist to an open palm.

Israel says it's trying for peace, Egypt is skeptical
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 12-13 with Mubarak meeting Lebanese, Italian
officials. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli official said Wednesday that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing his best to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, but Egyptian officials were
skeptical any progress has been achieved.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh spoke after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled peace process, saying Israel
wants to restart full negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Naveh read a statement saying Netanyahu was ``doing his best to
reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.''
	   ``We have a desire, from our side, to return to negotiations
with the Palestinians until we reach an agreement,'' Naveh said.
	   He refused to answer reporters' questions about the status of
negotiations, but said Netanyahu had sent him to Egypt to inform
Mubarak of the latest developments between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Naveh's visit came hours before U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to
arrive in the region for talks with Arafat and Netanyahu about a
reported American plan to restart talks by having Israeli troops to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which calls for them to
step up efforts to curb attacks on Israel, but Netanyahu's
government has so far refused to go along with the plan.
	   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, who attended
Wednesday's meeting along with Israel's ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel, told reporters that ``the situation, until now, does not
show that tangible progress has been made.''
	   He added that Mubarak believes failure to reach an agreement
will lead to tension and instability in the region ``and this is
not in the interest of any side, including Egypt.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed skepticism
about any progress Tuesday, describing the Middle East peace
process as frozen.
	   ``According to what we are hearing and reading, there is little
hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa told
reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen after
Ross arrives.''
	   Later in the day, Mubarak held talks with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
	   The talks with Dini concentrated on the Middle East peace
process as well as security in the Mediterranean, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported. No details were made public on Mubarak's
meeting with Hariri.

British runner set to break world long distance record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ British runner Robert Garside said
Wednesday he expects to break the world long distance record early
Thursday on a lonely track in the Western Australian outback.
	   Garside, who said he was jailed for 30 days in China, robbed in
Pakistan, nearly bitten by deadly snakes in Namibia and shot at in
Cape Town, South Africa during his run, is likely to reach the
milestone with a mouthful of dust and flies.
	   ``The flies are buzzing around me as it is,'' he said by mobile
phone about 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside Norseman, in the
state's southeast, as he paused on his long journey east across
Australia.
	   ``I don't fancy swallowing any of them, but I'm expecting plenty
of them.''
	   By Wednesday night, Garside was scheduled to have covered 17,811
kilometers (11,132 miles), needing to run only another 3.5
kilometers (2.1 miles) on Thursday to break the world distance
record of 17,814.4 (11,134 miles) held by American Sarah
Lovington-Fulcher.
	   Garside said he started his quest at London's Piccadilly Circus
on Dec. 7, 1996.
	   He said he plans to run across North and South America to
fulfill his dream of becoming the first person to run around the
world.
	   That could take another two years, Garside said.
	   ``I'm not mad, I don't like the word mad,'' said the
31-year-old. ``I think I'm eccentric. I like to run and I like
travel.''
	   Garside is trying to raise awareness of Greenpeace and
environmental issues through his efforts.

Perkins healthy, continues looking ahead

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Triple world record holder Kieren
Perkins is out to collect some memories to go with his huge
selection of gold medals. And maybe a few more medals as well.
	   Perkins, feeling fit again after a sickness scare, will line up
in the unusual position of underdog in the men's 1500-meter swim at
the Commonwealth Games.
	   He has claimed the past two Olympic gold medals and in the 1994
Commonwealth Games set the 1500-meter record which still stands. He
set the 800-meter record in the same race and added the 400-meter
record at the Rome world championships immediately following the
Victoria Games.
	   Perkins, 25, is now under assault, particularly from fellow
Australian Grant Hackett, the teenaged winner of the world titles
in January when Perkins failed to make the team.
	   Perkins' ultimate goal is to win three-straight Olympic golds in
the 1500-meters when the Olympics come to him in Australia in 2000.
The Commonwealth Games are a stage for him, but one he looked in
danger of missing when he caught the flu just before the team
departed for camp in Singapore.
	   ``Health-wise I'm fine and everything's going well,'' Perkins
said Wednesday. ``I'm improving every time I get in the water.''
	   Perkins was at his peak four years ago. His 1996 Olympic victory
was achieved after he sneaked into the final in lane eight and
looked a beaten man. He celebrated his victory by taking five
months of, a sabbatical which he is still feeling the effects of in
training.
	   He has been well below his best since Atlanta, while others have
surged.
	   ``It has been a very interesting transition for me,'' said
Perkins. ``I felt going into this meet it would be test for me to
see where I am in my career and how I feel about the whole
situation.
	   ``Because of the young kids coming through in my own team, let
alone the rest of the world I have a lot stronger competition than
I have had in the past.''
	   That, he says, is an enjoyable challenge.
	   ``I'm at the point now where I'm enjoying it, I've got a goal,
which is to pick up a third goal in the 1500 meters in 2000,''
Perkins said. ``Above and beyond that I just want to enjoy
myself.''
	   Perkins knows he is two years from the end, and after years of
total focus he has started to stick his head up out of the water to
look around.
	   ``Now that I'm getting to the end of my career I would like to
come away with more than just gold medals,'' he said.
	   For now he is happy not to be the race favorite. He won't put up
with that in 2000.
	   ``When I go to bed at night I know I'm the best and I will win
in the end,'' Perkins said. ``I've been doing it for a long time. I
know what's required and I know where I am and that experience
gives me an advantage over the younger guys I'm racing.''

Customs officials had orders to clamp down during Tour de France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Customs officials were under orders to clamp down
on the transportation of banned drugs during the Tour de France, a
French newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``Customs officials didn't come across Festina by chance,''
Jean-Paul Escande, co-president of the French government's new
anti-doping working group, was quoted as telling France-Soir.
	   ``In combination with capable ministers and various departments,
customs received very precise instructions to act.''
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the famous race after it
admitted using the banned doping substance EPO.
	   Six other teams, including the Dutch team TVM, also investigated
by authorities, withdrew during the race to protest police actions.
	   The controversy began when customs officials found more than 400
doping products in a Festina team car at the France-Belgium border.
	   Health Minister Bernard Kouchner and Sports Minister
Marie-George Buffet announced the anti-doping group Tuesday in the
aftermath of the scandal-plagued Tour.
	   Escande, who headed the French government's drive against doping
from 1990-1996, told France Soir that drugs are used in other
sports, including soccer, France's No. 1 sport.
	   It is ``unjust'' that cycling has become a scapegoat, he said.
``Festina is paying for everyone.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United, among the world's wealthiest
soccer clubs, announced Wednesday its board has accepted a record
623.4 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) buyout offer from Rupert
Murdoch's BSkyB satellite television company.
	   The deal, the highest price ever paid for a sports team, evoked
a storm of protest from fans and some lawmakers, and many charged
it would give the Australian-born media magnate a stranglehold on
televising Premier League soccer.
	   A supporters' club vowed to fight the deal, which needs the
approval of shareholders and the government, and protests were
urged at Wednesday night's match against Charlton Athletic.
	   ``We've certainly not betrayed our supporters,'' Manchester
United chief executive Martin Edwards said, facing a string of
largely hostile questions at a joint news conference. ``We've
secured a safe future for them.''
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at 240 pence (396 cents) each. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198 cents)
plus 0.2537 BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share. On
Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester United
shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   The price far outstripped the dlrs 350 million that Fox Sports,
a division of Murdoch's News Corp., paid for the Los Angeles
Dodgers in March _ a record price for a baseball team.
	   BSkyB chief executive Martin Booth tried to allay fans' fears.
	   ``Our interests are 100 percent aligned with the Manchester
United fans,'' Booth said. ``They want to win the league, so do we.
They want to win the (Football Association) cup, so do we. They
want to have the best players and best manager, so do we.''
	   In a statement posted on the electronic announcement system of
the London Stock Exchange, BSkyB said it recognized the club was
``not just another business, it is part of the cultural fabric of
Manchester and the nation.''

Ralf Schumacher quits Jordan

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ German driver Ralf Schumacher is
free to quit Jordan and negotiate with another Formula One team to
compete in the 1999 season, a Jordan Grand Prix statement said
Wednesday.
	   In a deal brokered through Formula One boss Bernie Eccelstone,
Jordan agreed to reverse its stand and let Schumacher, younger
brother of former world champion Michael Schumacher, negotiate with
another team.
	   The 23-year-old driver had issued a writ against Eddie Jordan's
team when it tried to prevent him negotiating a four-year deal with
rival Williams.
	   Jordan released a statement on Sept. 1 saying it would defend
Schumacher's writ.
	   However, the brief statement released by Jordan on Wednesday
said a settlement had been agreed and the terms would be kept
confidential.
	   A team spokeswoman later said neither Eddie Jordan, nor any
member of the Jordan team, would have any further comment regarding
Schumacher.
	   A spokesperson for Williams was unavailable.

United Nations wants Hong Kong to write off debt for refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A senior United Nations official said Wednesday
he hopes Hong Kong will write off massive debts incurred for the
care of thousands of Vietnamese refugees.
	   Jean-Noel Wetterwald, the outgoing head of the Hong Kong office
of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, told government radio the
agency is facing a serious funding shortfall because of the
region's financial crisis.
	   ``The fact is we had problems receiving donations before and we
have even more problems to receive donations now because of the
financial crisis hitting the developed countries and because of the
shortfall affecting the UNHCR,'' Wetterwald said.
	   He said the agency is unlikely to be able to repay more than the
20 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlr 2.6 million) already paid,
and hopes the government would write off its claim of 1.16 billion
Hong Kong dollars, the report said.
	   ``It's an unfortunate problem, but we don't consider it as a
debt. I think if we try to argue to qualify it as a debt we are
getting nowhere,'' Wetterwald said.
	   Since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South in
1975, ending the Vietnam war, nearly 223,000 Vietnamese have passed
through Hong Kong, most of them arriving penniless by boat.
	   The government has deported nearly 13,000 refugees under the
government's forced repatriation policy introduced in 1991.
	   The government in January abolished its 23-year old policy of
offering temporary asylum to the Vietnamese, and shut down the last
government-run camp for them in May.
	   The territory still harbors about 2,500 Vietnamese
asylum-seekers. More than 1,100 of them have been granted refugee
status and are awaiting resettlement. The rest are in jail and will
be deported.

	   ORANIENBERG, Germany (AP) _ Hollywood movie director Steven
Spielberg toured a former Nazi concentration camp Tuesday, one day
before he is to receive a German medal for his filmmaking about the
Holocaust.
	   Spielberg, director of the 1993 Academy Award-winning
``Schindler's List,'' said it was his first visit to a
concentration camp in Germany.
	   ``I am very moved to see so many young Germans here,'' Spielberg
said after touring the former barracks and museum at the
Sachsenhausen camp in Oranienburg, about 10 kilometers (six miles)
from Berlin.
	   During the war, the Nazis detained 204,000 mostly Jewish
prisoners in Sachsenhausen. About 120,000 inmates died of
mistreatment and starvation, and many others were deported to the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
	   Spielberg, wearing a gray suit and a blue yarmulke, signed the
camp's visitors book and made brief comments. On Thursday, he is to
receive a ribboned medal _ the Commander's Cross of the Order of
Merit _ at a dinner given by German President Roman Herzog.
	   The medal honors Spielberg's Shoah Visual History Foundation, an
archive of filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors, as well as
``Schindler's List,'' the story of how a non-Jewish industrialist
saved the lives of thousands of Jews.
	   By late last month, Spielberg's four-year archive project had
nearly reached its goal of 50,000 interviews. When completed it
will be made available to schools, libraries and other users around
the world.

	   ROME (AP) _ Get ready for The Ronnie and Robby Show.
	   Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio, the prodigy and the veteran, are
teaming up at Internazionale of Milan, which aims to parlay their
considerable talents into its first Serie A title in a decade. The
strikers _ who totaled 46 goals last season, when Baggio was with
Bologna _ are both capable of carrying a team.
	   So are several others on Inter Milan's roster.
	   It all adds up to a tough, if enviable, task for Luigi Simoni
heading into the 1998-99 season, which starts this weekend. The
coach has at his disposal the most diverse, talent-laden and
expensive roster in Italy. But he has to dole out minutes in a
manner that keeps everyone happy, while finding the right
combinations.
	   If he can do the trick, Inter should dethrone Juventus of Turin,
which has taken back-to-back crowns and three of the last four, and
hold off Lazio of Rome and AC Parma.
	   Juventus has been plagued by distractions that could haunt it
throughout the season. Three separate investigations into doping in
Serie A have focused largely on Juventus, with the Turin prosecutor
seizing the team's medical records.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi, likely in his last year, has a strong core
of players who will stay near the top of the standings and also
make a bid for a fourth straight Champions Cup final.
	   French midfielders Zinedine Zidane _ the two-goal hero of the
World Cup final _ and Didier Deschamps make Juve's engine run. If
they suffer a post-World Cup letdown, a common phenomenon, the team
could be in trouble. Another key factor will be if Alessandro Del
Piero rebounds from his rough summer. He and Filippo Inzaghi
combined for 39 goals last season.
	   Lazio went on the summer's biggest spending spree.
	   The Roman club rehauled a roster that was good enough to win
last season's Italian Cup, reach the UEFA Cup final _ where it lost
to Inter _ and challenge for the league title until a late fade
dropped it to a misleading seventh place in the 18-team standings.
	   Owner Sergio Cragnotti brought aboard hardened veterans
(Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic and Portugal's Fernando
Couto), flashy youngsters (striker Dejan Stankovic, another
Yugoslav, and Spanish playmaker Ivan De la Pena) and World Cup
stars (Chile's Marcelo Salas and Italy's Christian Vieri).
	   Cragnotti says the Salas-Vieri tandem is the best in Europe.
Inter owner Massimo Moratti would beg to differ.
	   His Ro-Ro pairing, Ronaldo and Baggio, are equally comfortable
putting the ball in the net or setting up teammates, and the links
between the two extend beyond a penchant for the spectacular.
	   They have just one league title between them (Baggio's with
Juventus in 1995), and both had unfortunate roles in their
countries' World Cup title game losses, Ronaldo this year and
Baggio in 1994. Ronaldo, 22, must come back from his disappointing
France '98.
	   When Ronaldo or Baggio (who's prone to injury) need a rest or a
boost, Simoni can look to Ivan Zamorano for added scoring punch, or
play Baggio, 31, alongside France's Youri Djorkaeff. Inter also
added two of the brightest young Italian striker prospects: Nicola
Ventola, 20, and Andrea Pirlo, 18.
	   The talent pool is just as deep at midfield and defense, where
Nigerian Taribo West _ after whom Simoni named his pet dog _ is an
intimidating, if erratic, presence. But while the midfield, with
Argentina's Diego Simeone as the catalyst, appears set, the defense
doesn't.
	   ``In the middle, things are going well,'' Simoni said, ``but in
attack and on defense we need to close the loop.''
	   Parma, which hired ex-Fiorentina coach Alberto Malesani, made
perhaps the most prudent acquisitions, adding Lazio's Diego Fuser,
Sampdoria midfielders Juan Veron and Alain Boghossian and AS Roma
striker Abel Balbo. It also has a top defense, with World Cup star
Lilian Thuram, Fabio Cannavaro, plus baby-faced 'keeper Luigi
Buffon.
	   Other teams that could have an impact in the higher reaches of
the standings, but are a piece or more short of truly contending
for the title are Roma, Fiorentina and AC Milan.
	   Of them, only Roma has the same coach as last season _ Zdenek
Zeman, who sparked the doping investigations with remarks in
interviews _ and it made the fewest changes in personnel.
	   After four titles in five years earlier in the decade, Milan has
been mediocre the last two seasons and its rebuilding effort could
be called Udinese West.
	   Coach Alberto Zaccheroni traveled across the map from small-time
Udine to financial capital Milan and brought German striker Oliver
Bierhoff (league-leading 27 goals) and Danish midfielder Thomas
Helveg with him.
	   The season surprise could well be promoted Salernitana, while
Vicenza _ which nearly knocked eventual titlist Chelsea out of the
Cup Winners Cup last season _ should take the biggest step
backward, possibly sliding all the way to relegation.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Triple world record holder Kieren
Perkins is out to collect some memories to go with his huge
selection of gold medals. And maybe a few more medals as well.
	   Perkins, feeling fit again after a sickness scare, will line up
in the unusual position of underdog in the men's 1500-meter swim at
the Commonwealth Games.
	   He has claimed the past two Olympic gold medals and in the 1994
Commonwealth Games set the 1500-meter record which still stands. He
set the 800-meter record in the same race and added the 400-meter
record at the Rome world championships immediately following the
Victoria Games.
	   Perkins, 25, is now under assault, particularly from fellow
Australian Grant Hackett, the teenaged winner of the world titles
in January when Perkins failed to make the team.
	   Perkins' ultimate goal is to win three-straight Olympic golds in
the 1500-meters when the Olympics come to him in Australia in 2000.
The Commonwealth Games are a stage for him, but one he looked in
danger of missing when he caught the flu just before the team
departed for camp in Singapore.
	   ``Health-wise I'm fine and everything's going well,'' Perkins
said Wednesday. ``I'm improving every time I get in the water.''
	   Perkins was at his peak four years ago. His 1996 Olympic victory
was achieved after he sneaked into the final in lane eight and
looked a beaten man. He celebrated his victory by taking five
months of, a sabbatical which he is still feeling the effects of in
training.
	   He has been well below his best since Atlanta, while others have
surged.
	   ``It has been a very interesting transition for me,'' said
Perkins. ``I felt going into this meet it would be test for me to
see where I am in my career and how I feel about the whole
situation.
	   ``Because of the young kids coming through in my own team, let
alone the rest of the world I have a lot stronger competition than
I have had in the past.''
	   That, he says, is an enjoyable challenge.
	   ``I'm at the point now where I'm enjoying it, I've got a goal,
which is to pick up a third goal in the 1500 meters in 2000,''
Perkins said. ``Above and beyond that I just want to enjoy
myself.''
	   Perkins knows he is two years from the end, and after years of
total focus he has started to stick his head up out of the water to
look around.
	   ``Now that I'm getting to the end of my career I would like to
come away with more than just gold medals,'' he said.
	   For now he is happy not to be the race favorite. He won't put up
with that in 2000.
	   ``When I go to bed at night I know I'm the best and I will win
in the end,'' Perkins said. ``I've been doing it for a long time. I
know what's required and I know where I am and that experience
gives me an advantage over the younger guys I'm racing.''

Belgium lifting food into Kinshasa; says humanitarian tragedy near
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium is ready to start lifting food
into the Congolese capital Kinshasa to boost dwindling stocks and
stave off a humanitarian crisis, the government said Wednesday.
	   Belgium has sent a C-130 military transport plane to Pointe
Noire in neighboring Republic of Congo, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) from Kinshasa, and the plane is ready to start transporting
700 tons of food to the capital.
	   Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said food supplies were
increasingly hard to come by in Kinshasa, raising the threat of a
humanitarian crisis in the capital of 3.8 million people.
	   ``Sometimes I have the impression we are the only one's
realizing this,'' Derycke told Knack magazine Wednesday.
	   Belgium sent a small shipment from Brazzaville, the Republic of
Congo's capital, across the Congo river into Kinshasa two days ago
for distribution by non-governmental organizations.
	   Congo is in the midst of a civil war, making it difficult for
supplies to arrive in the capital.
	   The United Nations world food program is willing to let Belgium
transport its 700 tons of stocks from Pointe Noire, but so far,
shipments have been held up by practical and diplomatic
difficulties.
	   ``We are looking for practical solutions,'' said Derycke's
spokesman Hubert Cooreman, listing problems ranging from landing
rights to distribution facilities in Kinshasa.

Dow Jones record doesn't enthrall Asia's markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Encouraged by Wall Street's surge, Asia's top three
stock markets opened higher Wednesday, but two of them soon headed
south as concerns about local issues took precedence.
	   In fact, as encouraging as the 5 percent Dow Jones climb was,
Asian bourses had already reacted earlier in the week to the cause:
speculation that America will soon lower interest rates to offset
the punishment of Asia's and Russia's economic turmoil.
	   The chit-chat about U.S. interest rates began Friday _ thanks to
a speech that day by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan _ and
Asia's markets responded with improvements Monday and Tuesday.
	   But Wall Street was closed for the Labor Day holiday Monday and
didn't have a chance to applaud Greenspan with its record 380-point
gain on the Dow Jones industrial average until Tuesday.
	   As word of New York's overnight rebound reached Asia on
Wednesday morning, people seemed happy but uncertain, given how
much turbulence has wracked the world's markets lately.
	   ``I hope it means something,'' said Ahmad Pauzi, watching the
local stocks on a monitor outside a bank in Singapore.
	   ``It will be interesting to see what happens today. If the local
index's rally continues, it's a sign that things aren't so bad. But
maybe it's a one-day thing,'' he said.
	   In Tokyo, Masahiko Shimizu, 31, an insurance salesman who had
just completed a stock transaction at Nomura Securities Co., said:
``The Dow surge won't have a direct effect on the Japanese economy.
It has its own problems, and they are mostly political.''
	   Shimizu said Japan's beleaguered stock market, which began its
slump in early 1990, might have a better chance of advancing big
time if the nation produced its own Mark McGwire breaking a major
record in baseball-obsessed Japan. ``We wish we had such great news
here,'' Shimizu said with a smile.
	   When trading began Wednesday, Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average reacted to Wall Street's exuberance by rising. But it
closed 157.95 points, or 1.07 percent, lower at 14,755.54, because
of new concerns about a major part of Asia's economic crisis _ the
weakness of Japanese banks ridden with bad loans.
	   As Japan's political parties continue to wrangle over a proposed
bailout for the banks, rumors surfaced on the market that Fuji Bank
Ltd. was facing huge derivatives losses overseas. That triggered
selling in the banking sector, traders said, even though the bank
later called the rumors ``totally groundless.''
	   In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, Wall Street initially lifted the
index Wednesday. But it fell 283.80 points, or 3.5 percent, to
7,905.45 by the end of the day. Traders blamed profit-taking.
	   The sag in markets continued in Europe, with share prices on the
London Stock Exchange lower at midday Wednesday. At noon, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 24.6 points
at 5,319.6.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index closed at
885.46, up 16.78 points, or 1.9 percent. But the turbulence and
machinations in the markets of neighboring Malaysia were generating
as much interest as the Dow.
	   On Monday, the composite index in Malaysia rose 22 percent, and
on Tuesday it fell 21 percent, thanks to big rule changes imposed
by the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in an effort
to leave Malaysia's markets less vulnerable to speculators.
	   The government imposed sharp capital controls on Sept. 1, but on
Monday regulators said that investors and brokers could trade under
the previous rules until this Friday to get their accounts in
order. That triggered a big sell off and market tumble.
	   In Singapore, investors snapped up Malaysian over-the-counter
stocks to take advantage of their much lower local price, compared
to the Kuala Lumpur market.

Court upsets hunters, government, by suspending hunting season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's hunters and its Agriculture
Ministry Wednesday said they were furious with the country's
highest administrative court for suspending the hunting season.
	   The Council of State late Tuesday ruled in favor of an objection
by two environmental organizations and suspended the hunting season
until Dec. 9.
	   By order of Agriculture Minister Stefanos Tzoumakas, the hunting
season began on Aug. 20 and was to end on Feb. 28. There are about
250,000 registered hunters in Greece. Bird hunting here is also
popular with Italians.
	   Tzoumakas said he would issue a new decree Thursday to get
around the court decision and re-start the hunting season.
	   His office said Tzoumaks would take the court decision into
account, but justified his action by saying that people have the
right to hunt.
	   In their petition, the environmental groups claimed the hunting
season was ``premature and unnecessarily extended,'' and coincided
with the reproductive and migratory patterns of birds.

Airbus, Boeing lock horns in fresh jet-selling duel

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The intense air show rivalry between
Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Co. tilted toward the Europeans
early Wednesday, as Airbus announced dlrs 4 billion in new jet
orders and dlrs 3 billion more in options.
	   Boeing bounced back with a slew of orders for airplanes that
list at about dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard was all smiles as he
unveiled big deals with United Parcel Service _ an important new
customer _ and a large U.S. leasing company, General Electric
Capital Aviation Services, a subsidiary of GE Capital.
	   The big U.S. purchasers are becoming increasingly aware that it
doesn't matter where their airplanes are made, Forgeard told
reporters in a thinly concealed swipe at his competitor,
Seattle-based Boeing.
	   Boeing, meanwhile, did not get off to nearly such a good start
on the third day of the Farnborough International 98 air show, the
biggest event of the year in the global aerospace industry.
	   One of Boeing's more colorful deals was a memorandum of
understanding _ not a firm order _ to sell one big 747-400 to a
startup Sri Lankan carrier called PeaceAir that plans, among other
things, to fly religious pilgrims to holy sites.
	   ``Peace begins with a smile,'' said PeaceAir's chairman, Gamini
Wethasinghe, his voice choking with emotion as he described plans
to give 80 percent of profits to charity. ``When PeaceAir starts,
we hope to bring peace and joy.''
	   Boeing soon rolled out dlrs 1.67 billion in jet orders to GE
Capital _ which is taking 12 of Boeing's longhaul 767 models.
Boeing also said it sold five 737-800s in a deal listed at about
dlrs 250 million to the San Francisco aircraft leasing company GATX
Capital Corp.
	   Boeing said earlier it had sold five new 737s to Scandinavian
Airlines System and one to a small Greek carrier, Cronus Airlines,
which took an option on another 737 as well.
	   A Boeing regional vice president, Tom Basacchi, tried to show
Boeing was doing well off its home turf, saying the 737 orders from
SAS ``reaffirms that we have the right product for the European
market.''
	   But the biggest deal of the day _ and thus far of the whole
Farnborough show _ was the Airbus sale to UPS, the Atlanta-based
delivery company that made its first purchase from the European
planemaking consortium from France, Germany, Britain and Spain.
	   UPS ordered 30 A300FR-600R cargo jets and took options on 30
more in a package priced at around dlrs 5 billion if it takes all
of the airplanes.
	   Earlier, Airbus said GE Capital had placed firm orders for 30
models from the Airbus A320 series _ with options for 10 more in a
deal worth up to dlrs 2 billion. GE Capital and its competitors
lease out jets to airlines that don't buy their own fleets.
	   The firm orders brought Airbus sales by the third day of
Farnborough to dlrs 6.7 billion _ with billions more in options.
	   Boeing's firm orders announced here puts its new business at
around dlrs 4.8 billion _ with many more deals for airplanes that
could be sold on option.
	   The actual price negotiated by airlines is lower, but neither
the carriers nor the manufacturers will disclose the real figures,
which they regard as sensitive competitive information.

One miner dead, two injured in subway construction cave-in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ One miner was killed and two injured by a
sand slide as they were strengthening walls of a new section of
Warsaw's subway, still under construction.
	   The first fatal accident in more than 14 years of the subway's
construction occurred Tuesday night as the three were positioning a
wooden plank shortly before the end of their shift, said Adam
Sapijaszko, deputy director of the project.
	   Experienced miners from the southwestern copper giant KGHM
Polska Miedz S.A. are working on extending the tunnel of the
one-line metro.
	   The sudden cave-in of sand gave the miners no time to escape,
Sapijaszko said. He said such slides are frequent as the tunnels
mostly are dug in sand.
	   A special mining commission was immediately appointed to
investigate the accident.
	   The Warsaw subway opened in April 1995. It now has 12 stations
along the 13-kilometer (eight mile) stretch between the southern
housing district of Ursynow and the city center, but work continues
on extending the line to northern parts of the capital.

North Korea marks anniversary with military parade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea marked the 50th
anniversary of its founding Wednesday with leader Kim Jong Il
viewing a massive military parade in the capital, the official news
media reported.
	   Columns of Korean People's Army units and military academy
cadets goose-stepped before Kim, ``vowing to become rifles and
grenades to defend Great Leader Comrade Kim Jong Il,'' the official
Pyongyang Radio said.
	   The dispatch, monitored by Seoul's Naewoe Press, did not report
the number of soldiers who took part in the parade. No
sophisticated weapons were displayed.
	   Kim, 56, is ruling North Korea as chairman of its National
Defense Commission, which is in charge of the 1.1 million-strong
military, the world's fifth largest and backbone of the
belligerent, Marxist country.
	   North Korean television footage, carried by South Korean TV
stations later Wednesday, showed Kim standing solemnly on the
platform and clapping as the crowd burst with a frenzy of cheers.
Kim did not speak.
	   Pyongyang's main plaza, named after Kim's late father, longtime
President Kim Il Sung, was filled with red flags and slogans and
placards vowing loyalty to the junior Kim and celebrating what the
North called the launch of its first satellite.
	   North Korea says it launched the satellite Aug. 31. But U.S. and
Japanese defense officials believed the launch was the test-firing
of a ballistic missile that sailed over northern Japan and crashed
into the Pacific Ocean.
	   Whether a missile or satellite, analysts said, it showed a
worrisome increase in North Korea's missile capability.
	   The launch was ``a powerful demonstration of the iron will of
the party, the people and armed forces to build the People's
Republic of Korea into a strong and great country,'' Gen. Kim Yong
Chun, chief of the military's general staff, was quoted as saying
in a speech before the parade.
	   On Saturday, North Korea's parliament amended its constitution
to make the National Defense Commission chairman _ a post held by
the junior Kim since 1993 _ its highest state post.
	   The previous top post, state president, was abolished.
	   That completed a long process to enthrone the junior Kim as a
full-fledged leader of North Korea. It was the communist world's
first hereditary transfer of power.

Serbian police, KLA guerrillas clash in northwest Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police battled independence-minded
Albanian militants Wednesday at a gold and zinc mine in Kosovo, in
a rare instance of fighting in the Serbian province's northwest.
	   The Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said fighting began after
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army attacked police and guards at
the Stari Trg mine, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   Aid workers have warned of an increasing humanitarian disaster
in Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia, one of the two republics
that make up Yugoslavia. Hundreds of people _ most of them ethnic
Albanian _ have been killed in the 6-month crackdown on the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army and more than 265,000 others have
been forced to flee their shelled and burned-out villages.
	   The Serbs, for their part, have accused the militants of
massacring Serb civilians in at least two cases.
	   Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanians, most of them
supportive of the KLA's armed struggle for independence after
decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has been to the southwest
of Pristina, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up
to push KLA fighters out of their strongholds there. With the area
around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was possible that a
similar government offensive had been ordered in that region.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, said strong detonations could be heard
in Kosovska Mitrovica town, and at Podujevo, further east.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegations, police on Tuesday
showed reporters and international observers bodies of some alleged
victims near the rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where they claimed
some 40 Serb civilians were executed. They said they knew of more
similar execution sites in the area, about 40 miles (60 kilometers)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw seven decomposed bodies, one beheaded and another
missing limbs, lying on the ground under a heavy rain. Police said
the bodies were those of Serb civilians. No more bodies could be
immediately seen _ despite police claims there were others _ and no
details on the victims were available.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo since
fighting started in early March. They claim the rebels kidnapped
them. Earlier this month, police showed charred remains of what
they said were burned bodies of Serb civilians in another former
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold.
	   On Wednesday, the government-run Politika daily in Belgrade said
preliminary investigations of those alleged killings, in Klecka
village, showed 10 people were burned there, including two
children, aged 8 and 12. It cited Aleksandar Dobricanin, a Serb
doctor heading the investigations, as saying some of the bones will
be sent to Moscow and London for detailed analysis and
identification.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the
offensive against Kosovo villages. Authorities say they have no
intention of ending the fight against the province's
``terrorists.''
	   John Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human
rights, said after a weekend meeting that Milosevic was responsible
for the rebellion in Kosovo and that war or peace in the province
depended on him alone.
	   On Tuesday, the respected Belgrade newspaper Glas Javnosti said
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans for Kosovo, an apparent sign that the Yugoslav
president was seeking a compromise. Any election in the majority
ethnic Albanian province could empower the leaders of the
independence struggle and let them restore some of Kosovo's
autonomy that Milosevic rescinded in 1989.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Wednesday canceled a trip to the Georgian capital Tbilisi because
of influenza, his spokesman said.
	   Reporters were already on Netanyahu's plane at Ben-Gurion
airport when his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky came on board and told
them the trip was off.
	   ``A doctor who examined what his condition is this morning
determined that it would be better if the prime minister remained
at home for a day or two,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Netanyahu, who will be 50 next month, cut short a marathon
cabinet discussion on next year's state budget Tuesday night,
because he felt unwell.
	   He was examined Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning by a
leading cardiologist, Andre Keren, who found that he had influenza,
with a fever and muscular pains.
	   ``The prime minister last night suffered from exhaustion. The
source of the exhaustion was not clear. ... Today it became clear
that he is suffering from influenza,'' Dr. Keren told Army radio.
	   Netanyahu was to have made a one-day visit to Tbilisi to take
part in celebrations marking the 2.600th anniversary of the Jewish
presence in Georgia.
	   Because of his illness he will be represented at the
celebrations by Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Katsav and Israel's two
chief rabbis, Bushinsky said. ` Netanyahu phoned Georgian President
Eduard Shevarnadze and apologized for the cancellation, Bushinsky
said.
	   In view of the doctor's statement it was not clear whether
Netanyahu would be able to meet the American peace envoy Dennis
Ross Thursday for talks on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
and the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Three people were killed and 10 were
injured Wednesday in two consecutive traffic accidents, after a
truck plowed through passengers leaving a bus involved in an
earlier fatal crash, police said.
	   Pandelis Karagonis, 33, died when the car he was driving crashed
almost head-on with a bus carrying 45 excursioners on a national
road about 120 kilometers (74.5 miles) south of the northern port
city of Salonica.
	   The collision also jammed the bus doors, forcing the passengers
to leave from the driver's door.
	   An oncoming truck plowed through a group of passengers who had
just left the bus, killing two and injuring nine, one of them
seriously.
	   Police arrested the truck driver, who was also injured.
	   The injured were being treated in a hospital in the central city
of Larissa.

Luxembourg, Bulgaria call for European strategy on Russia's crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The prime ministers of Bulgaria and
Luxembourg called Wednesday for a joint European strategy aimed at
blunting the impact of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   ``The European Union countries and the candidates to join it
must work out a joint strategy towards the crisis in Russia,''
Premier Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg said after talks with
Ivan Kostov, his Bulgarian counterpart.
	   Juncker wouldn't elaborate as to what such a strategy could
include.
	   Kostov said Russia's crisis could have an adverse effect on
Bulgaria's trade and payment balance and on foreign investment. He
urged ``EU protection'' for prospective members from central and
eastern Europe ``as a sign that those countries are different, that
they are not like Russia ... a response that would soothe foreign
investors.''
	   Kostov asked Juncker to help hurry up a dlrs 250 million loan
already pledged to Bulgaria by the European Union for market
reforms supervised by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kostov said Bulgaria needed EU money to regularly pay its dlrs 9
billion foreign debt without risking financial stability.

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinian Authority have
consistently violated human rights in the name of security in the
five years since they signed their first peace agreement, the human
rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday.
	   During the five-year period, Israel has arrested more than 8,000
Palestinians and routinely subjected them to torture, the
London-based group said in a 40-page report.
	   Israel's Supreme Court has legitimized the use of torture and
detention without trial, the report said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has detained hundreds of suspected
Islamic militants and collaborators, and 19 people have died in
detention, most as a result of torture, the group said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Israel did not
allow blanket torture, but that in certain circumstances
interrogators were permitted to use physical force if they believed
this could stop a terror attack.

giving cause of death; NOTE single names Mogol and Mina cq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Lucio Battisti, whose romantic and often sad
songs of the late 1960s and 1970s made him a kind of musical poet
of his times, died Wednesday in a Milan hospital after a long
illness. He was 55.
	   He and his family jealously guarded his privacy, and the
communique by the hospital, San Paolo, announcing his death, did
not cite the cause. But RAI state TV reported that he had liver
cancer.
	   For countless Italians from their 20s to their 50s, the songs
that he wrote, played on his guitar and sang were intertwined with
their dreams.
	   But starting in the 1980s, when his hits became fewer, Battisti
virtually dropped out of sight, refusing to give interviews and
turning down public appearances.
	   ``A little piece of me died,'' said Roberto Maroni, a former
interior minister from the Northern League party and a musician
himself.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni sent a telegram to the widow,
Grazia Letizia Veronesi, saying ``For many Italians, Battisti's
songs were part of their lifetime.''
	   Many of Battisti's songs, like the hit ``Emozioni'' (Emotions),
were melancholy or sad and often spoke of betrayal in love. His
biggest successes came through his collaboration with lyricist
Mogol, but starting in the 1980s Battisti changed songwriter, the
lyrics were judged less accessible and the big sales slowed down.
	   But his old songs, like ``Pensieri e Parole,'' (T than an estimated 1
billion lire (dlrs 600,000) a year, according to Italian news
reports.
	   After the news of his death, one radio station began to play his
songs non-stop, and fans gathered outside the hospital. It was the
day's top story on state and private TV networks.
	   Battisti was credited with weaving into his songs more marked
rhythms into Italian song composition, which had heavily depended
on lyrics to sell.
	   In his heyday, Battisti appeared at Italy's annual song festival
in San Remo.
	   Some of his compositions became hits for other top Italian
singers, such as ``Il Paradiso'' (The Paradise), song by Patty
Pravo. He was also a hit when singing with Mina, another star who
later shied away from the limelight.
	   Although both Battisti and Mogol claimed during their work was
apolitical during the highly-charged political climate of the
1970s, both the left and the right tried to claim that the
successful duo was on their side.
	   At one point, Battisti was photographed with his arm
outstretched, and Italy's neo-fascists were quick to claim that he
was giving the Fascist salute. But, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported, Battisti was only guiding the orchestra through one of
hits, ``Ed io penso a te'' (And I think of you).
	   In keeping with Battisti's wish for privacy, the family
requested that only immediate family members be allowed into the
hospital room where the wake was held. Other survivors include a
son, Luca, a student who lives in England, a sister, Albarita, and
his father, Alfiero.
	   The funeral was also expected to be private.

Swedes plan to send bill for hooligan damage to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Swedish soccer association wants to
send the bill to Britain for damage inflicted on a Stockholm
stadium after the weekend's Sweden-England match, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The 3,500 British fans who attended the game, which Sweden won
2-1, were kept in one section of the stadium and police forced them
to stay there while others left at the end of the game. The
strategy was meant to minimize conflict.
	   But while the stadium was emptying, hooligans in the England
section kicked out windows that surround the top tier of the
Rasunda stadium and through objects out of them, including a
hot-dog stand and carbon-dioxide cylinders.
	   The damage and clean-up costs amount to an estimated 200,000
kronor (dlrs 25,000) and the soccer association, Svenska
Fotbollforbundet, wants compensation.
	   ``We will send a letter to the English soccer association and
launch a discussion of who it is that will pay for the damages,''
soccer association Goeran Havik was quoted as telling the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter.
	   The English fans bought their tickets through the English soccer
association FA, a method aimed at identifying known hooligans. The
Swedish association thinks FA should bear economic responsibility
if that method is unsuccessful in reducing hooliganism, the
newspaper said.

Chubais: Russia had to lie about its economic situation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government had no other choice but to lie
to the IMF and other financial institutions about the country's
economic situation while negotiating billions of dollars in a
recent bailout package, a former top official says.
	   While Russia could have devalued the ruble and defaulted on its
government bonds in May, that would have brought negative
psychological consequences and an ``extremely negative reaction in
the world,'' said Anatoly Chubais, who led Moscow's negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Instead, Russia appealed for international assistance to help it
battle the looming crisis.
	   The IMF approved a dlrs 22.5 billion rescue package for Russia
in July to overcome sharp losses on its financial markets and
stabilize the ruble. But that failed to stop a sharp economic
crisis that hit Russia in mid-August.
	   ``We showed that the government was fighting to the end, that it
made all the possible and impossible efforts in order not to fail
the expectations of our partners inside and outside the country,''
Chubais said in an interview published Tuesday in the daily
Kommersant.
	   In reply to a question, Chubais said the government had been
right not to tell the truth to international financial
institutions.
	   ``We made financial and economic decisions, we stated there
would be no radical steps, thus calming the markets down,'' he
added. ``The authorities have no right to say they're not certain
they would be able to overcome a difficult financial situation ...
In such situations, they are obliged to do it.''
	   But Chubais, dismissed in August as deputy prime minister in the
former Russian government, argued that the tactics actually won
understanding from international creditors.
	   ``Now, the international financial institutions _ in spite of
everything we've done to them, namely deceiving them out of dlrs 20
billion _ understand that we no longer had a different choice,''
said Chubais.
	   ``We showed the world that we were fighting to the end. The IMF
supported us precisely because we did everything to save the
country's face,'' he said.
	   Chubais has been widely respected in the West and hated in
Russia as an architect of the country's economic privatization
program. Despite being dismissed from the Cabinet, he has preserved
his job as head of Russia's giant Unified Energy Systems electric
utility.

Pakistan beats Kenya 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Penalty specialist Imran Yousuf
scored four goals Wednesday to lead Pakistan to a 5-4 victory over
minnow Kenya in a Commonwealth Games field hockey preliminary
match.
	   Kenya had a chance to level the match in the final minute but
failed to convert a peanlty corner.
	   Yousuf was in supreme form, converting three penalty strokes and
one penalty corner as Pakistan beat back an impressive challenge
from the Kenyans.
	   Pakistan, a four-time world champion, led 5-2 but had to
withstand a fierce comeback.
	   Kenya's tough-tackling defense kept out the favorites until the
19th minute before Yousuf opened the count on a penalty stroke from
a foul on a Pakistani forward by Kenyan goalkeeper Jotham Omany.
	   Kenya's Raymond Ondong then scored the first of his two penalty
corner goals to equalize in the 26th minute. Yousuf converted a
second penalty stroke to make it 2-1 in the 31st minute after
center forward Khalid Mohammed was brought down by the Kenyan
goalkeeper.
	   Pakistan scored its lone field goal six minutes into the second
half as right winger Atif Bashir's defense-splitting pass enabled
Mohammed to shoot home.
	   Kenya pulled one goal back as the Pakistan defense fell for the
second time to Ondong's rasping penalty corner shot in the 41st.
Yousuf returned to goalscoring action in the 42nd minute as his
scoop went into the roof of the cage and two minutes later he
converted another penalty stroke to give Pakistan a 5-2 lead.
	   Far from being overawed, Kenya fought back Nicholas Induli
scored on a rebound from a goal post in the 52nd minute. Four
minutes from the end Joel Senge reduced the deficit to 5-4 with a
set piece penalty corner conversion.
	   Kenya put everything into its attack for the equalizer against a
jittery Pakistan defense.

Police detain 76 would-be refugees on Turkish-Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Police detained 76 would-be immigrants,
mostly Iraqi nationals, as they attempted to cross the border into
Greece, the Anatolia news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The 70 Iraqis and six Iranians were rounded up in four villages
along the Meric River, which marks the border between Turkey and
Greece. The river is known as Evros in Greek.
	   The report did not say when the detentions took place and
authorities refused to comment.
	   Seventy-two immigrants were detained in the same region Tuesday.
	   Turkey is a world crossroads for immigrants trying to make their
way to more prosperous countries in Western Europe. The Meric River
alone sees thousands of attempted illegal border crossings each
year.

U.S. envoy may prolong stay in Middle East if deal close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ross-Arafat scheduled to start at 1800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; With Egypt-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' new Mideast peace
mission is open-ended and may be extended if progress is being made
toward a deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that an accord was not yet
within reach since Israel and the Palestinians still differ on key
issues, such as the scope of withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Ross was to arrive later Wednesday and hold talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the evening. On Thursday, Ross
was to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Ross will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement is close, said
a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The envoy could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to
work out in a possible summit in New York later this month when the
two leaders, as well as U.S. President Bill Clinton, attend the
U.N. General Assembly, Israeli newspapers said.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross would focus on the biggest stumbling
block _ negotiating a new agreement on security issues which Israel
has made a precondition for a troop withdrawal.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   In a meeting Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Palestinian security officials
told CIA representatives they were not willing to renegotiate the
whole agreement, but would consider suggested changes.
	   Both sides have in principle agreed to an Israeli pullback from
13 percent, but the Palestinians have rejected an Israeli
stipulation that 3 percent of the area be turned into a nature
reserve with building restrictions for the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians originally accepted the
nature reserve idea but then backed down, reportedly due to
pressure from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   The U.S. peace initiative, initially presented in January, calls
for Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent and a series of Palestinian
security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the proposal, but
Israeli initially rejected a 13 percent pullback.
	   The Palestinians have expressed concern that the United States
would agree to Israeli demands for changes in the U.S. plan.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said the ball was
in Israel's court. ``I hope that Mr. Ross will choose the shortest
way to have Mr. Netanyahu say yes to the American initiative,'' he
said.

 &UR; Israel says it's trying for peace, Egypt is skeptical. PICKUP 12th

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli official said Wednesday that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing his best to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, but Egyptian officials were
skeptical any progress has been achieved.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh spoke after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled peace process, saying Israel
wants to restart full negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Naveh read a statement saying Netanyahu was ``doing his best to
reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.''
	   ``We have a desire, from our side, to return to negotiations
with the Palestinians until we reach an agreement,'' Naveh said.
	   He refused to answer reporters' questions about the status of
negotiations, but said Netanyahu had sent him to Egypt to inform
Mubarak of the latest developments between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Naveh's visit came hours before U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to
arrive for talks with Arafat and Netanyahu about a reported
American plan to restart talks by having Israeli troops to withdraw
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which calls for
increased efforts to curb attacks on Israel by Islamic militants,
but Netanyahu's government has so far refused to go along with the
plan.
	   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, who attended
Wednesday's meeting along with Israel's ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel, told reporters that ``the situation, until now, does not
show that tangible progress has been made.''
	   He added that Mubarak believes failure to reach an agreement
will lead to tension and instability in the region ``and this is
not in the interest of any side, including Egypt.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed skepticism
about any progress Tuesday, describing the Middle East peace
process as frozen.
	   ``According to what we are hearing and reading, there is little
hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa told
reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen after
Ross arrives.''
	   Later in the day, Mubarak held talks with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
	   The talks with Dini concentrated on the Middle East peace
process as well as security in the Mediterranean, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported. No details were made public on Mubarak's
meeting with Hariri.

Microsoft boss sees lawsuit resolved within six months

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said
Wednesday he believed the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit
against his company would be resolved within six months.
	   ``I think the legal issues will be behind us six months from
now,'' Gates said during a visit to the Lisbon world's fair.
	   The U.S. Justice Department and 20 states are suing Microsoft
for alleged anticompetitive practices by the software giant towards
its rivals in the high-tech industry. The case is due to begin in
the U.S. later this month.
	   ``Our competitors are using (the lawsuit) to say really bad
things about us,'' Gates said in reply to a question, after
speaking to an invited audience on the future links between
business and information technology.
	   ``Let the lawyers worry about (the lawsuit) and the rest of us
concentrate on making great products,'' he said.
	   Tight security kept journalists at bay while Gates visited the
Microsoft pavilions at the fair, known as Expo 98, and handed out
prizes to representatives of European schools as part of the
Microsoft Road Ahead 98 competition.
	   The billionaire Microsoft boss, in the Portuguese capital for a
two-day stay, opened an exhibition on Leonardo da Vinci which
features the five-century-old Codex Leicester on Tuesday.
	   Gates, often listed as the world's wealthiest man, paid dlrs
30.8 million for da Vinci's Codex _ 18 double pages of scientific
writings and drawings _ at auction four years ago.

Police arrest suspected Basque separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAU, France (AP) _ Police on Wednesday arrested nearly a dozen
prominent figures tied to the underground separatist group that has
claimed responsiblity in recent terrorist bombings in the French
Basque country, officials said.
	   Gendarmes from this southwestern French city also conducted
house searches in the town of Saint-Palais, about 60 kilometers (34
miles) east of Bayonne.
	   Police said a cache of weapons was discovered. No further
details were immediately available.
	   The early-morning sweep of well-known figures connected to the
Basque separatist organization Iparretarrak was carried out as
police stepped up their investigation into the bombings in recent
months that ripped through the picturesque Basque country in
France's southwest corner.
	   Among those arrested was Jean-Pierre Sainte-Marie, a Basque
militant who spent several years in jail for belonging to
Iparretarrak.

More than 4,000 minks freed from fur farm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Thousands of minks caused havoc on
roads in southern Finland Wednesday after they were released from a
fur farm in the early hours of the morning, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police believe
that animal rights activists were behind the action.
	   ``Many of the freed minks were run over by cars or killed each
other because they are predatory animals even though they have
lived in captivity,'' said Police Chief Inspector Rune Swahn.
	   ``Many will also disturb the wildlife in the forests and many
won't survive because they are used to being fed,'' Swahn said.
	   No other damage was reported at the farm in Kirkkonummi, 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Helsinki.
	   Officials feared similar attacks in the near future.
	   ``Fur farmers have had several letters recently in which (animal
rights) activists have warned that they will disrupt fur farming,''
said Kai Lindh from the Finnish Fur Breeders Association.
	   Some 2,000 people live off fur farming in Finland which is the
world's largest producer of fox furs. This season, it sold 2.5
million fox pelts and 4 million mink furs.

Khatami says U.S. not interested in a stable Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States does not want stability
and security in the Gulf and its forces in the region are a source
of anxiety, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday.
	   ``Without a doubt, the sooner the U.S. stops its interference,
the sooner will we have peace,'' Khatami said after holding talks
with the visiting Armenian and Greek foreign ministers.
	   In remarks broadcast on Iranian radio, Khatami said Iran was
surprised that ``the Americans expressed concern over our troops'
movements in our eastern borders. Without a doubt, we are more
worried about the security of the region than the Americans are.''
	   Last week, Iran conducted large military exercises on its border
with Afghanistan. Tehran has accused Afghanistan's Taliban militia
of holding 70 Iranians, including 11 diplomats and a journalist.
	   ``We will in no way tolerate any insecurity on our borders and
we cannot be indifferent about the lives of our fellow citizens,
especially our diplomats who have been taken hostage,'' he said.
	   The diplomats and the journalist for the state-run Islamic
Republic News Agency went missing after the Taliban captured the
city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month.
	   The Taliban, which accused the Iranians of aiding opposition
forces, denies any knowledge of the diplomats. Last Thursday, it
freed five other Iranian prisoners in a goodwill gesture.
	   Over the past few days, Iran has warned the Taliban that it
would take ``necessary measures'' to win the others' release.
	   U.S. intelligence has suggested that Iran was poised for an
incursion into Afghanistan.
	   ``To defend the security of the borders and the lives of our
citizens is our natural, legitimate, international right and we
uphold that right as we see fit,'' he said.
	   He said the United States was concerned about Iran's military
exercises yet ``allowed itself to launch missiles on other
countries and kill innocent people,'' a reference to the U.S.
strike against suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan
on Aug. 20.
	   Meanwhile, Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani
met Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Rabbani, who is Iran's key ally in Afghanistan and is still
referred to and treated as president in Iran, was ousted from Kabul
by the Taliban in 1996.

EU gives Italy week to rethink Malpensa Airport traffic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BRU1-101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission gave Italy a
week Wednesday to craft a new airlines distribution plan for
Milan's soon-to-open Malpensa Airport saying current plans unfairly
favor Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
	   If Italy misses the deadline, the European Commission will
reject its plans to allocate foreign carriers to Malpensa, 53
kilometers (33 miles) out of Milan and suffering from poor road and
rail links to the city due to construction delays.
	   Citing such inadequate access, nine European carriers have
complained about being moved to Malpensa from Linate Airport, 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Milan while Alitalia may stay there.
	   They fear passengers will inevitably opt for Alitalia's
hassle-free connection from Linate to its hub airport at Rome.
	   Other carriers say they cannot feed passengers from Malpensa,
which is due to open Oct. 25, to their hubs due to the poor
connection with Milan.
	   On Wednesday, the EU executive Commission unanimously agreed to
draw a line in the sand, telling Italy to rethink its Malpensa
plans. If it ignores the EU, Italy opens itself up to legal action
from Alitalia competitors and the European Commission.
	   Under EU law, EU governments can distribute air traffic as they
wish across several airports but ``without discrimination on
grounds of nationality or identity of the air carrier,'' said EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   ``It is my duty to uphold European law and, in this case, to
protect the competitive interests of European air carriers and
their passengers,'' he told a news conference.
	   In the afternoon he met with Italian officials, signaling a
desire by Rome to settle the dispute amicably. Kinnock said he will
make sure conditions for all EU airlines to be the same at
Malpensa.
	   The heart of the problem lies with the criteria Italy used to
leave Alitalia at Linate. It said all routes with more than 2
million passengers a year will stay at Linate ``and all other
flights will operate out of Malpensa,'' Kinnock said.
	   He said the practical effect of that was that ``only flights
from Rome may operate from Linate'' and that means Alitalia.
	   The nine airlines that complained to the European Commission
about this back in February are: British Airways, Iberia, TAP,
Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic Airways, SAS and Austrian
airlines.
	   KLM, the Dutch carrier which is an Alitalia code-sharing
partner, did not join the chorus of protesters.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The president of OPEC said
Wednesday that Gulf countries can't act as ``swing producers'' for
the oil market and that non-OPEC countries must contribute to
production cuts to bolster prices.
	   Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, who also serves as oil minister of
the United Arab Emirates, said in an interview with Dow Jones
Newswires that ``it's not fair'' to expect the Gulf states to bear
a disproportionate share of cutbacks.
	   ``The others have to bear their responsibilities,'' he said.
``If they want to defend the price of oil, they have to be
practical. The problem with prices is you either have a higher
price or a higher quantity of oil (on the market). You can't have
both.''
	   Al-Nasseri also said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would consider further production cuts at its November
meeting if prices don't firm.
	   OPEC's basket of seven crude oils was priced at dlrs 12.48 a
barrel Monday, considerably below the cartel's target of dlrs 18 a
barrel.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Islamic Development Bank has offered
to lend Lebanon up to dlrs 3 million to finance small and medium
industrial projects, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   ``We are ready to finance the purchase of industrial machinery,
raw materials as well as financing trade and export transactions
worth between dlrs 50,000 and up to dlrs 3 million,'' said Daoud
Suleiman al-Bourshid, head of an IDB delegation visiting Beirut.
	   He spoke to reporters after meeting with Jacques Sarraf,
chairman of the Lebanese Industrialists' Association, An-Nahar and
other newspapers reported.
	   The Saudi-based IDB previously loaned Lebanon dlrs 18 million to
build a new campus for the state-run Lebanese University.
	   The Lebanese government has launched a multibillion-dollar
program to rebuild the infrastructure damaged during the 1975-90
civil war.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ In a bid to revitalize the economy, Kuwait has
decided to give visas on arrival to businessmen with residency
permits in other Gulf states, Al-Watan daily reported Wednesday.
	   Foreign businessmen _ as well as their Kuwaiti partners _
complain of long delays in getting visas for this oil-rich country,
which has been hit hard by low world oil prices.
	   The newspaper quoted Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Rujaib, the assistant
undersecretary of the Interior Ministry, as saying 30-day visas
also will be given to businessmen's families. The businessmen must
have residency permits valid for at least one year, he said.
	   The new procedure will begin Oct. 1, al-Rujaib said.
	   He noted that some nationalities will be excluded, but did not
say which ones. They are believed to include Iraqis and citizens of
Arab countries that did not support Kuwait in the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis, which was triggered by Iraq's invasion.

As Moscow surrenders power, Russian regions take charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In one Russian region, the local government has
created a barter bank, where people can swap timber or cardboard
for food. In another, local officials have begun manufacturing
macaroni to stave off people's hunger.
	   With no government in place in Moscow, power in Russia is
quickly devolving to the country's regions, where governors are
adopting widely divergent policies to deal with the worst economic
crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Where it will all lead, nobody knows. But more than one observer
has warned that Russia could be heading down a road toward
division, separatism and collapse.
	   Igor Farkhutdinov, the governor of Sakhalin island in Russia's
Far East, noted Wednesday that his counterpart in the Kaliningrad
region, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) to the west, had
suspended payments to the federal budget.
	   That act, Farkhutdinov, was ``the beginning of Russia's
dissolution.''
	   That will probably prove to be an overstatement. But other
political observers say what is happening across Russia, as
regional governments are forced to deal with the crisis by
themselves, has solidified a trend: Power in Russia, once strongly
anchored in Moscow, is beginning to spread across the country.
	   Some think the devolution of power could be a positive trend,
leading to a confederation of semi-autonomous regions that could
shape polices more finely tailored to their needs.
	   At this point, ``It's not dissolution,'' said Sergei Markov, an
independent political analyst in Moscow. ``But on the other hand,
if the crisis continues, if there's no government for one year,
there would be the dissolution of the country.''
	   For now, Markov thinks the makeshift policies being formed at
the regional level will mostly cause headaches in the Kremlin when
a new government sets out to enforce a new national economic
policy.
	   In many cases, the policies being introduced in regions
contradict the spirit of market-oriented economic reforms that
President Boris Yeltsin has haltingly sought to impose on a
national level.
	   Many regions have introduced price controls of various sorts.
Others have imposed limits on the bulk buying to discourage
hoarding.
	   In the city of Tambov, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
southeast of Moscow, local authorities limited bread sales
Wednesday to five loaves per customer, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   They also said they would try to limit traders from hauling
``socially important goods,'' such as bread, sugar, salt and meat,
out of the region.
	   In Arkhangelsk, about 960 kilometers (600 miles) north of
Moscow, the regional government has resumed operations at a closed
fish processing plant and begun producing macaroni, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The regional authorities also slashed prices of potatoes and
cooking oil. They noted that most residents had exhausted their
savings and could not afford to hoard food.
	   In the Saratov region, authorities opened several fall harvest
fairs so that residents could buy food directly from growers,
eliminating costs added by retailers. In the Novgorod region, known
for its progressive economic policies, officials established a
commodity bank, which will give out food in exchange for various
non-edible products, such as timber, fertilizer and cardboard.
	   In the vast Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, newly elected Gov.
Alexander Lebed imposed prices controls. Lebed, who is considered a
likely presidential candidate, said he felt he had no choice.
	   ``The emergency situation forces me to take emergency
measures,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I am determined to stave off
starvation in the region. I believe that businessmen ... should
understand me. They should understand that I am acting in their
interests, in order to prevent a situation in which huge crowds of
hungry and angry people take to the streets and smash everything.''

Minister questions economics of hosting Euro soccer championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A government minister on Wednesday
questioned the economics of Hungary's bid to jointly host the
European Soccer Championships in five years.
	   The state news agency MTI cited Economics Minister Attila Chikan
as urging further Cabinet discussions about co-hosting the 2004
championships with neighboring Austria.
	   The state would have to subsidise the event with between 15-20
billion forints (dlrs 70-85 million), he was cited as saying.
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a devoted soccer fan. His first
foreign visit after his May election was to Paris, where he watched
the final of the World Championships as President Jacques Chirac's
guest.
	   Other bidders for the championships are Spain, Portugal, and
Switzerland.
	   UEFA is expected to decide in July 1999.

Signs growing of Kosovo refugee stream to Germany, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees, many apparently from Kosovo,
are waiting near the Czech border for a shot at slipping undetected
into Germany, border patrol officials said Wednesday.
	   Fighting in the southern Serbian province has forced more than
200,000 people from their homes this summer, and Germany is afraid
many of them will head north to join family or friends.
	   German officials are already seeking to deport some 140,000
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo who are here illegally.
	   But those deportations were effectively halted by the European
Union's flight ban on the Yugoslav airline, which Germany began
enforcing Tuesday. Germany is bound by treaty with Belgrade to use
the Yugoslav airline, JAT, for such repatriations.
	   Steffen Claussner, of the German border patrol office in Pirna,
said there were signs that a growing number of people from Kosovo
were headed toward Germany by land.
	   ``We know from our Czech colleagues that the relevant pensions
and hotels (in border towns) are completely full,'' he told the
Saechsische Zeitung. All were waiting to ``make the jump to
Germany,'' often with the help of smugglers, he added.
	   Germany has spent more than any other European land _ some 20
billion marks (dlrs 11.2 billion) _ since 1991 caring for 450,000
war refugees, mostly from Bosnia.

 &UR; British runner set to break world long distance record

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ British runner Robert Garside said
Wednesday he expects to break the world long distance record early
Thursday on a lonely track in the Western Australian outback.
	   Garside, who said he was jailed for 30 days in China, robbed in
Pakistan, nearly bitten by deadly snakes in Namibia and shot at in
Cape Town, South Africa during his run, is likely to reach the
milestone with a mouthful of dust and flies.
	   ``The flies are buzzing around me as it is,'' he said by mobile
phone about 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside Norseman, in the
state's southeast, as he paused on his long journey east across
Australia.
	   ``I don't fancy swallowing any of them, but I'm expecting plenty
of them.''
	   By Wednesday night, Garside was scheduled to have covered 17,811
kilometers (11,132 miles), needing to run only another 3.5
kilometers (2.1 miles) on Thursday to break the world distance
record of 17,814.4 (11,134 miles) held by American Sarah
Lovington-Fulcher.
	   Garside said he started his quest at London's Piccadilly Circus
on Dec. 7, 1996.
	   He said he plans to run across North and South America to
fulfill his dream of becoming the first person to run around the
world.
	   That could take another two years, Garside said.
	   ``I'm not mad, I don't like the word mad,'' said the
31-year-old. ``I think I'm eccentric. I like to run and I like
travel.''
	   Garside is trying to raise awareness of Greenpeace and
environmental issues through his efforts.

Westwood and Clarke showdown looms for No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Darren Clarke missed his third
chance to unseat Lee Westwood at the top of European tour money
list but edged closer with his third-place finish at the European
Masters at Crans-Sur-Sierre, Switzerland.
	   A showdown looms at the British Masters, starting Thursday at
the Forest of Arden course, near Coventry, England, as Clarke
challenges Westwood again.
	   This time, only 5,498 pounds (dlrs 9,017) separates Westwood,
currently No. 1 on the European tour money list with 603,345 pounds
(dlrs 989,486), from Northern Ireland's Clarke, current No. 2 with
597,847 pounds (dlrs 980,469).
	   European Masters champion Sven Struver, who won in a play-off
with Patrik Sjoland, jumped into the top 15 on the tour with his
133,330 (dlrs 218,661) prize money, moving into the No. 12 spot
with 259,013 (dlrs 424,781).
	   Sjoland took second place at the Swiss tournament, claiming
88,880 pounds (dlrs 145,763) to jump into No. 4 spot with a total
of 442,187 (dlrs 725,187).
	   Westwood and Colin Montgomerie, a five-time European No. 1,
finished in a tie for 12th at the European Masters, earning enough
to retain their respective No. 1 and No. 3 positions on the table.
	   Montgomerie, an early leader on the tour this year, missed two
cuts at two previous tournaments and has only increased his total
marginally to 455,017 pounds (dlrs 726,228) in the last month.
	   Sjoland's rise up the leaderboard means Denmark's Thomas Bjorn
was relegated one spot to No. 5, with 413,624 pounds (dlrs
678,343), and South Africa's Ernie Els dropped one place to No. 6
with 386,759 (dlrs 635,832).

EU gives Italy week to rethink Malpensa Airport traffic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to restore writethru slug &QL; 
 &UR; With BRU1-101

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission gave Italy one
week Wednesday to craft a new airlines distribution plan for
Milan's soon-to-open Malpensa Airport saying current plans unfairly
favor Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
	   If Italy misses the deadline, the European Commission will
reject its plans to allocate foreign carriers to Malpensa, 53
kilometers (33 miles) out of Milan and suffering from poor road and
rail links to the city due to construction delays.
	   Citing such inadequate access, nine European carriers have
complained about being moved to Malpensa from Linate Airport, 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Milan while Alitalia may stay there.
	   They fear passengers will inevitably opt for Alitalia's
hassle-free connection from Linate to its hub airport at Rome.
	   Other carriers say they cannot feed passengers from Malpensa,
which is due to open Oct. 25, to their hubs due to the poor
connection with Milan.
	   On Wednesday, the EU executive Commission unanimously agreed to
draw a line in the sand, telling Italy to rethink its Malpensa
plans. If it ignores the EU, Italy opens itself up to legal action
from Alitalia competitors and the European Commission.
	   Under EU law, EU governments can distribute air traffic as they
wish across several airports but ``without discrimination on
grounds of nationality or identity of the air carrier,'' said EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   ``It is my duty to uphold European law and, in this case, to
protect the competitive interests of European air carriers and
their passengers,'' he told a news conference.
	   In the afternoon he met with Italian officials, signaling a
desire by Rome to settle the dispute amicably. Kinnock said he will
make sure conditions for all EU airlines to be the same at
Malpensa.
	   The heart of the problem lies with the criteria Italy used to
leave Alitalia at Linate. It said all routes with more than 2
million passengers a year will stay at Linate ``and all other
flights will operate out of Malpensa,'' Kinnock said.
	   He said the practical effect of that was that ``only flights
from Rome may operate from Linate'' and that means Alitalia.
	   The nine airlines that complained to the European Commission
about this back in February are: British Airways, Iberia, TAP,
Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic Airways, SAS and Austrian
airlines.
	   KLM, the Dutch carrier which is an Alitalia code-sharing
partner, did not join the chorus of protesters.

Amsterdam Stock Exchange drops amid jittery markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Shares on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange dropped Wednesday as traders reacted to a market made
jittery by the financial crises in Russia and Asia.
	   At midday, the 27-share AEX index was at 1084.42 points, down
11.26 points, or 1 percent. Traders blamed the downturn in part on
low expectations from Wall Street and on news that Swiss banking
giant Credit Suisse is suffering from exposure to Russia and other
emerging markets.
	   Financial stocks were the main losers, with leading Dutch bank
ABN Amro down 2.8 percent and ING bank falling by 4.2 percent.

Japan's central bank eases monetary policy

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's central bank eased its monetary policy on
Wednesday, aiming to boost the flow of funds to capital-starved
Japanese companies and stop the economy from falling into a
deflationary spiral.
	   The Bank of Japan lowered the target for the overnight call
money rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending
without collateral _ to around 0.25 percent from around 0.5
percent.
	   The move essentially makes it cheaper for banks to obtain funds
and could reduce corporate borrowing costs.
	   The target is the lowest in Japan ever, though in the
fluctuations of actual trading the rate has gone lower than that.
The bank does not set the rate, but only sets a target.
	   The decision _ the first easing of policy since 1995 _ does not
affect the official discount rate, which is at a record low of 0.5
percent. The discount rate is the central bank's charge on loans to
banks.
	   The measure comes as Japan is battling its worst recession since
World War II. Consumption is stagnant and officials fear a
destructive deflationary spiral unless the economy is somehow
jump-started.
	   ``The biggest goal for the easing is to provide even more funds
to the markets and help reduce pressures on corporate fund
raising,'' said Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami.
	   Hayami said he believes that if banks have ample funds, the
so-called ``credit crunch'' _ or tightened lending by financial
institutions _ will disappear as another positive effect of the new
policy.
	   The easing is expected to at least temporarily reduce pressure
on the rickety banking sector and avert system-wide instability.
	   But in the absence of more aggressive fiscal policy and deep
structural reform of the banking system and the economy, it's
unlikely to pull Japan out of its recession, critics said.
	   ``The move underscores a lack of any real policy initiatives
from the fiscal side,'' Cameron Umetsu, senior strategist in charge
of money and foreign exchange at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo, told
Dow Jones Newswires.
	   ``It's an act of desperation ... BOJ easing without structural
reform will have very little effect,'' he said. ``Japan again
resorted to traditional measures when progress on key restructuring
was needed.''
	   While the cut in overnight call rates will help banks' funding,
it won't immediately provide any boost to the economy, said Susumu
Kato, senior economist at Barclays Capital Japan.
	   ``It's not something that will directly affect the economy,'' he
told Dow Jones.

Metal detectors at Jewish, Muslim holy sites turned off on Sabbath
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Police have been turning off metal detectors
near the Western Wall plaza on the Jewish Sabbath despite warnings
that the area could be targeted by ultranationalist Jews, police
confirmed Wednesday.
	   The Maariv daily said a man from the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat
Gan recently was able to approach the wall, Judaism's holiest site,
with a 9mm pistol tucked under his shirt.
	   The metal detectors were turned off between sundown Friday and
sundown Saturday at the request of ultra-Orthodox Jews, the
newspaper said, but did not elaborate.
	   Observant Jews are barred from working on the Sabbath, and that
would include setting off an electrical device.
	   Several walk-through metal detectors are set up at the entrance
to the Western Wall plaza, which is adjacent to the Al Aqsa Mosque
compound, Islam's third holiest shrine.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that for the
past year, police have turned off the walk-through detectors on the
Sabbath and have used handheld devices, which are not as effective.
	   ``But we are doing our best to check some suspicious people who
are coming to the Western Wall,'' Ben-Ruby said.
	   It was not immediately clear why use of handheld detectors was
acceptable on the Sabbath.
	   The area of the Western Wall and the Al Aqsa Mosque compound is
the most sensitive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	   According to recent newspaper reports, Israeli security
officials have warned of plots by ultranationalist Jews to attack
Muslim worshipers in the compound in hopes of disrupting the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

Earthquake shakes southern Italy, killing at least one person
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An earthquake shook the mountain towns of southern
Italy on Wednesday, killing at least one person, who was hit by
falling rocks.
	   Panicked residents fled into the streets in towns close to the
quake's epicenter. It was based between the communities of
Castelluccio Inferiore and Laino Borgo, where the regions of
Calabria and Basilicata meet, about 350 kilometers (210 miles)
southeast of Rome.
	   The victim was hit by rocks near where he had parked his car.
Authorities said there was some damage to buildings, mainly older
ones.
	   The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.5 according to the
National Institute of Geophysics.
	   A year ago, a series of earthquakes struck the central region of
Umbria, killing 10 people and damaging century-old churches and
artwork, including the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Fans gasped and camera bulbs
flashed Wednesday as paragliders spiraled into the National
Stadium, focal point of the Commonwealth Games.
	   It was only a rehearsal ahead of the opening ceremony on Friday,
but thousands of Malaysians, many of them children, filed for free
into the red, blue and yellow arena seats. The stadium was built
especially for the Commonwealth Games.
	   Sixteen members of the Malaysian military jumped out of a
helicopter and drifted aloft with paragliders, or wide rectangular
parachutes. They dipped over the lip of the open-air stadium and
landed on its floor to the cheers of the crowd.
	   Britain's Prince Edward will be on hand for the opening ceremony
of the games, which also features musical performances and a parade
of the athletes with their national flags.
	   Some 70 nations are taking part in the games, which end Sept.
21.
	   ___
	   Australia's swimmers are expected to rack up the medals at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   The nation's 41-member swimming squad includes seven past and
present Olympic and world champions, and claimed 25 of 40 gold
medals at stake in the last games four years ago in Victoria,
Canada.
	   The team in Kuala Lumpur includes Kieren Perkins, world record
holder of the 400-meter, 800-meter and 1,500-meter freestyle
events. Another notable is Susie O'Neill, the world and Olympic
butterfly champion.
	   But Australian coach Don Talbot refused to predict Australia's
medal chances. ``Obviously we're going to win some,'' said Talbot.
``Even if I had a fgure in mind, I'm not going to tell you.''
	   Canada, which won seven gold medals in Victoria, along with
Britain and New Zealand have strong swimmers too.
 &UR; ___
	   Outraged over the price of beer, 10 journalists covering the
Commonwealth games on Wednesday briefly picketed the hotel housing
the media center.
	   Dubbing themselves the Press Institute for Non-Teetotallers, or
PINT, the demonstrators held pieces of paper with slogans
protesting beer charges at the Mint Hotel.
	   Managers countered the rally by offering free beer to the
disgruntled band, which included reporters from Australia and South
Africa, and said they would reduce the cost of food.
	   Beer prices range from 14 ringgit (dlrs 3.70) for a local can to
18 ringgit (dlrs 4.70) for an imported can. That's roughly double
the price elsewhere.
	   Hundreds of journalists from all over the world are in Kuala
Lumpur for the games. Five thousand athletes are participating.
 &UR; ___
	   Organizers at the Commonwealth Games have sold 407,000 tickets
for the two-week event for some 22 million ringgit (dlrs 5.8
million).
	   Hashim Mohd Ali, chairman of Malaysia's organizing committee,
said the figure is higher than the number of tickets sold at the
games four years ago in Victoria, Canada.
	   The committee hopes to sell another 100,000 tickets, down from
an original forecast of 800,000.
 &UR; ___
	   The Commonwealth Games are missing some some star athletes,
including sprinter Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Canada's
Donovan Bailey, the Olympic 100-meter champion and world
record-holder.
	   Fredericks pulled out after Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob
compared him unfavorably with another athlete.
	   But Michael Fennell, the head of the games federation, on
Wednesday ruled out offering prizemoney to attract more world-class
competitors.
	   ``Certainly I do not believe in it and I don't think this is a
consideration,'' Fennell said. ``In any event you always miss some
because of injury, some miss because of family reasons and some
miss because they've chosen to participate in other events.''
 &UR; ___
	   Running great Roger Bannister clocked a mile in 3:58.8 at the
1954 Commonwealth Games, but he had already broken the four-minute
mark in that year.
	   On May 6, he ran 3:59.4 in Britain in one of the most famous
achievements in sporting history. Later, at the games in Vancouver,
Canada, he beat the mark again, defeating Australian rival John
Landy.
	   The world record now belongs to Algerian Noureddine Morceli, who
ran a mile in 3:44.39.

Marion Jones leads premier World Cup field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY CHENAULT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Marion Jones says sometimes
winning is too easy.
	   Take this year. After going undefeated in the women's 100-meter
and 200-meter sprints and long jump, the 22-year-old American track
and field star often struggles to find motivation.
	   ``I've had to find new ways to make sure I stay stimulated,''
Jones said. ``It kind of gets difficult sometimes going out to the
track and knowing that if I run a sub-10.90 (in the 100), 95
percent of the time I'm going to win the race.''
	   Sometimes trash-talking by rivals fires her up. Sometimes
inspiration comes from negative news reports. But at the World Cup
starting Friday, Jones has natural motivation _ her first chance to
compete at high altitude, a boost to athletes who rely on explosive
speed.
	   ``I'm hoping for very fast results,'' she said.
	   So are World Cup promoters and the rest of the premier field
that has won 16 Olympic gold medals and 34 World Championship
titles. They will compete at Johannesburg Stadium, which has a
reputation as a fast track at 1,650 meters (5,000 feet) above sea
level.
	   Athletes representing the United States, Africa, Europe, the
Americas, Oceania, Asia, and two European national squads will vie
for team honors in the three-day event. Britain and Germany compete
in the men's field, while Germany and Russia round out the women's
competition.
	   The World Cup offers dlrs 3.5 million in individual prize money,
with dlrs 100,000 for a world record.
	   The U.S. men's and women's teams pose the biggest threats to the
reigning champions _ the African men's team and the European
women's squad.
	   Jones and Kim Batten, world record-holder in the 400-meter
hurdles, lead the U.S. women. The U.S. men's team features Jerome
Young in the 400, Bryan Bronson in the 400-meter hurdles, pole
vaulter Jeff Hartwig and John Godina in the shot and discus.
	   The African men's contingent is led by 200-meter specialist
Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Kenyan distance stars, including
Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters and world record-holder Bernard
Barmasai in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
	   Distance standouts also highlight the European women's squad.
Romania's Gabriela Szabo enters with the fastest time this year
among World Cup competitors in the 3,000, and Ireland's Sonia
O'Sullivan heads the pack in the 5,000.
	   When Jones talks about fast times, she means really fast times _
faster even than anything she posted during an impressive Grand
Prix season that concluded last Saturday in Moscow. She claimed
more than dlrs 600,000 in Grand Prix prize money and pushed her
record to 35 wins out of 35 events this year.
	   Jones isn't predicting any world records in Johannesburg. Still,
she hopes to capitalize on the thin air to break the 10.7-second
barrier in the 100 and run under 21.76 seconds in the 200, which
would be a personal best.
	   ``That's if everything goes right,'' she said.
	   Her best times this year are 10.71 and 21.80.
	   Like Jones, American high jumper Charles Austin, Olympic gold
medalist in Atlanta, is eager to see what he can do at high
altitude. He's expecting a fierce showdown with Cuban Javier
Sotomayor, who holds the world record with a leap of 8 feet,
one-half inch (2.37 meters) in 1991.
	   ``It helps the jumpers a lot, so I like it here,'' said Austin,
whose best jump this year is 2.33 meters. ``The competition against
Javier will be really good.''
	   Some athletes had expressed concern about coming to South Africa
after a bomb exploded Aug. 25 at the Planet Hollywood restaurant in
Cape Town. The blast killed two people.
	   South African organizers brought in 2,000 police and defense
force members to provide security.
	   Austin said he thinks athletes will be satisfied with the safety
measures.
	   ``I've been to Sarajevo and Moscow. I'm not worried about being
in South Africa,'' he said.

graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Lauren Jackson scored 20 points
Wednesday as the Australian women's basketball team beat the world
champion United States 68-63 at the Derwent Entertainment Center.
	   Jo Hill added 11 and Rachael Sporn nine points for the winners
while DeLisha Milton scored 17 and Yolanda Griffith 11 for the
Americans in the first of a five-game series.
	   Despite the win, Australian coach Tom Maher was not impressed by
his team's performance.
	   ``Of course I am happy to win but I don't think we played that
well,'' he said. ``We were bullied away from the board by a more
muscular team but defensively we did OK.''
	   Both teams opened sloppily with the United States taking the
early advantage through Milton and Natalie Williams with some
strong work under the basket.
	   The visitors pulled away to a nine-point lead before Australia
stepped up defensive intensity and started forcing the opposition
into several turnovers.
	   The Opals hit the front with less than two minutes left in the
first half.
	   With Robyn Maher playing her trademark strong defensive game,
the Opals went to the break with a five-point lead, 41-36.
	   The second half belonged to the Australians. Coach Maher used 11
players and ran the Americans ragged up and down the floor.
	   Despite the United States holding a height advantage, the Opals
maintained their defensive pressure to lead by as many as 12 at one
stage.
	   The Americans won the battle of the boards, taking 52 rebounds
compared to the Opals' 36.
	   The Opals were missing three of their regulars in Carla Boyd,
Trish Fallon and Michelle Brogan, all fulfilling European
commitments.
	   The teams play again Thursday night at Melbourne. (djp)

ASEAN urges Cambodia to avoid violence, recognize elections
</HEADLINE>
results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The ASEAN regional group urged feuding
political groups in Cambodia on Wednesday to avoid violence and
recognize the results of general elections held in July.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations said in a statement
that the results of the July 26 vote ``were generally recognized by
the international community as free and fair.''
	   ASEAN also urged battling groups in Cambodia to ``exercise
restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts, and resolve
problems through dialogue and consultations.''
	   The statement was released by Singapore's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs after Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar, who also is the
chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, consulted other foreign
ministers in the organization.
	   Cambodian strongman Hun Sen's party won the elections, but
opposition leaders have alleged fraud and are protesting the
results.
	   Hun Sen on Tuesday ordered riot police to break up a makeshift
protest camp in front of the National Assembly, and clashes
continued on Wednesday.
	   Also Wednesday, a Thai foreign ministry spokesman said Cambodia
would not be able to join ASEAN if it doesn't have a stable
government by the time the regional grouping has a meeting in New
York on Sept. 23.
	   ``There has to be an acceptable political structure or a
transitional government by Sept. 23 or else we don't see how the
country could join ASEAN,'' said spokesman Kobsak Chutikul at a
news conference in Bangkok.
	   Foreign ministers from ASEAN countries are scheduled to meet on
Sept. 23 in New York City during the opening of the United Nations
General Assembly session to discuss Cambodia's application to join,
said Kobsak.
	   After the admittance of Myanmar _ also called Burma _ and Laos
last year, Cambodia is the only Southeast Asian country not holding
full membership in the group.
	   Cambodia had expected to join ASEAN last year, but its
application was put off because of political instability
highlighted by last July's coup d'etat by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Kobsak said ASEAN has few rigid requirement for membership,
other than the country applying be in Southeast Asia.
	   ``But there has to be a peaceful settlement in Cambodia,'' he
said. ``We would like to see the Cambodians display a spirit of
sacrifice for national interest and a spirit of compromise, and the
acknowledgement that the election results are final.''
	   He added, though, that ``It should not be seen as a do-or-die
conflict _ that if you lose this round of elections then you're out
forever.''
	   Kobsak said if matters are settled, the earliest Cambodia could
join ASEAN would be December of this year when the leaders of the
regional grouping meet in a formal summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Shoppers watch and wait amid rising prices, strengthening ruble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Shoppers in Moscow were calmer Wednesday as fresh
supplies arrived, some stores restocked shelves, and the ruble
actually gained against the dollar.
	   But the new supplies offered paltry consolation to many, who
took one look at the skyrocketed prices and refused to buy even
necessities.
	   ``I can understand that prices are rising for imported goods,''
said Natasha Krasnepyorova, a secretary who lost her job because of
the crisis. ``But why are they rising for Russian goods too? We
can't buy even the most basic products because of the price.''
	   Despite government promises to crack down on gouging, prices
vary widely in the city, with little logic. Cooking oil, which sold
for 8 rubles a month ago, was selling for 45 rubles in one place,
and 60 in another. The price of eggs, flour, and sugar had all at
least doubled.
	   ``No one's controlling the prices at all,'' Krasnepyorova said.
	   Shoppers were also unnerved by the latest twist in Russia's
crisis _ a shortage of rubles at exchange booths. After government
statements that a rush for dollars had left the ruble undervalued,
the ruble was trading at around 17 to the dollar Wednesday, down
from 20 the day before. The official rate climbed above 16.
	   ``I've been trying in the last few days to buy more,'' said
25-year-old Dmitry, a police officer who wouldn't give his last
name. ``But I can't change my money at a bank because there aren't
any rubles.''
	   The unpredictable ruble also added to the frustration of shop
owners, who found they couldn't even get new goods if they wanted
them.
	   ``Our suppliers are not letting anyone buy from them,'' said
Tatyana Yegorova, the director of a small supermarket whose shelves
were bereft of many staples like macaroni and fresh meat. ``They
just answer that they don't have goods, though they probably do.
They're waiting to see what the ruble does and if they can charge
us more.''
	   But with the political situation still volatile, few expressed
hope that the ruble's mini-rebound or the restocked shelves mean a
turn for the better.
	   ``We're all just working for kopecks now anyway,'' said
Alexander Oush, a 30-year-old construction worker from Moldova. ``I
don't think the economy is going to be any better soon because the
government hasn't done anything yet but steal from us.''

Greece's leading ferronickel miner says it may shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's leading miner of ferronickel ore
warned Wednesday it may have to shut down its operations because of
a four-day action by Greenpeace.
	   Environmental activists from the organization prevented waste
dumping ships from sailing from a loading and processing facility
owned by Larco in Larymna, 130 kilometers (81 miles) north of the
capital.
	   Their action came one day after coast guard officers released 12
Greenpeace members arrested late Monday for chaining themselves to
the facility's loading docks.
	   Greenpeace activists have prevented Larco ships from dumping
rust, a byproduct, into the nearby northern Euboean Gulf. Larco has
a government license to dump the rust, which it claims is harmless
to the environment.
	   The environmental organization said it will continue its action,
which it began Sunday, until the government revokes Larco's dumping
license.
	   ``If Greenpeace actions continue, Larco might have to close down
which would make (ferronickel) prices go up,'' said Constantinos
Daskalakis, Larco's chief executive officer.
	   Larco exports all of its production abroad to countries such as
Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and
Britain.
	   Daskalakis said the company was losing 100 million drachmas
(dlrs 336,700) a day because of the Greenpeace action, a loss
compounded by a global drop in metals prices.
	   Larco would not say what share of the European ferronickel
market it controls.
	   ``I can't understand why Greenpeace chose Larco, a firm that is
so sensitive to the environment, for their actions,'' Daskalakis
said.
	   Greenpeace claims dumping rust into the sea affects marine life
and the long-term health of people who eat fish from the region.
	   It contends that Greek and international laws ban such dumping.
It alleges Greece was required to stop such dumping by the 1996
London International Agreement for the prevention of marine
pollution.
	   Larco has argued the London agreement does not cover Greek seas.

Israel sends rabbi to confirm deaths in Swissair crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli police have sent a rabbi from their
criminal identification unit to confirm the deaths of Jewish
victims in last week's Swissair crash off Canada, a spokeswoman
said Wednesday.
	   Under Jewish law, a widow may not marry again until it is proven
beyond a doubt that her husband died. A woman whose husband's death
cannot be confirmed is called ``aguna,'' or anchored.
	   Orthodox Jewish leaders in the United States asked Israeli
police for the services of an Orthodox officer and rabbi to ensure
that none of the women widowed in the Sept. 2 crash will be
considered ``agunot.''
	   All 229 people aboard the Geneva-bound plane were killed.
	   The rabbi, Jay Levinson, will interview those who last saw the
Jewish victims get on the airplane before it took off, said police
spokeswoman Linda Menuchin.
	   He will then be called to testify before rabbinical courts in
the United States in regards to the status of the widows, just as
he has done many times in Israel, Menuchin said.
	   Levinson was also called to duty in the aftermath of the crash
of Pan Am Flight 747 in Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 that killed 270
people.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinian Authority have
consistently violated human rights in the name of security in the
five years since they signed their first peace agreement, the human
rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday.
	   During the five-year period, Israel has arrested more than 8,000
Palestinians and routinely subjected them to torture, the
London-based group said in a 40-page report.
	   Israel's Supreme Court has legitimized the use of torture and
detention without trial, the report said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has detained hundreds of suspected
Islamic militants and collaborators, and 19 people have died in
detention, most as a result of torture, the group said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Israel did not
allow blanket torture, but that in certain circumstances
interrogators were permitted to use physical force if they believed
this could stop a terror attack.

Russian ruble rebounds steeply against U.S. dollar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's battered ruble rebounded steeply against
the U.S. dollar on Wednesday amid an apparent shortage of the local
currency.
	   The dollar for next-day delivery was trading between 15 and 16
rubles at the central Moscow interbank exchange, down from 20 to 25
rubles at the start of the session and way below Tuesday's Central
Bank rate of 20.8.
	   There were ``more sellers of dollars than buyers'' on the
exchange's electronic system, said Dmitri Panteta, a trader at
International Moscow Bank.
	   While some Moscow traders did not rule out that the ruble's
gains could be caused by a Central Bank intervention, most said
that commercial banks apparently were selling dollars to obtain
rubles for client transactions.
	   Ruble supplies at Russian banks have dropped recently when most
rushed to invest in dollars or other foreign currencies, spooked by
the ruble's fall in the aftermath of the treasury market collapse
in August.
	   One major commercial bank, Oneximbank, on Wednesday called on
private clients to convert their ruble accounts to dollar deposit
accounts under favorable conditions.
	   Many street exchange points around Moscow appeared to have run
out of rubles and the exchange rate varied wildly, from a low of 12
rubles to the dollar to 18 or so.
	   Russian government officials, who on Tuesday attacked the
ruble's low rate as unrealistic, praised the currency's gains
Wednesday.
	   A rate above 20 rubles to the dollar had a ``considerable
speculative component'' and was largely due to psychological
factors, said government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   He also called on stores and wholesalers to lower the prices for
goods and food correspondingly. Although high post-crisis prices
did not go down, Moscow stores were restocking shelves and people
seemed less worried about food shortages.
	   Customs officials said Wednesday that economic turmoil has
halted about 300,000 tons of goods that were awaiting clearance at
customs warehouses, including 48,000 tons of foodstuffs in Moscow
region alone.
	   But imports in August were 32 percent down from July, deputy
customs committee chairman Oleg Svirodov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.

Vogts' monument loses head, police say no crime involved

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Berti Vogts not only lost his job as
Germany's soccer coach, he also lost his head.
	   But police said Wednesday there was no connection between the
two.
	   Vogts' head is missing from a monument in Moenchengladbach,
where he played club soccer, and the mass-circulation Bild
newspaper claimed the monument had been vandalized after his
resignation on Monday.
	   But police said the head had been wobbly for some time and fell
off two weeks ago when city workers came to look at it. It has been
taken away for repairs.
	   The monument depicts Vogts and two other former stars of
Borussia Moenchengladbach from the team's glory days in the 1970s _
Guenter Netzer and Herbert Wimmer.

Buffaloes blank Fighters 7-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Phil Clark smashed a two-run homer in the first
inning and Rob Mattson hurled a three-hitter as the Kintetsu
Buffaloes blanked the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters 7-0 at Osaka Dome on Wednesday.
	   Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 27 homers this
season, and Mattson, formerly with a Mexican League team, is 7-5.
	   The Fighters are still one game ahead of the second-place Seibu
Lions, who lost to the Orix BlueWave 6-1 at Kobe.
	   The Buffaloes stood third, but only .003 percentage points
behind the Lions.
	   Troy Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, went 3-for-4,
including a double, and drove in three runs for the BlueWave.
	   At Chiba, Luis Lopez drove in two runs with an infield hit in
the three-run fourth and smashed a home run in the two-run ninth as
the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 7-4.
	   Lopez, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has 16 homers.
	   In the Central League, Eric Anthony smashed a home run in the
two-run fourth, leading the Yakult Swallows to a 4-2 victory over
the front-running Yokohama BayStars at Yokohama.
	   Anthony, formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, has nine homers.
	   The BayStars ended their winning streak at five, but still have
a five-game lead over the second-place Chunichi Dragons who lost to
the Hanshin Tigers at Nagoya Dome.
	   The Dragons led 2-0 in the second inning on a two-run home run
by Takeshi Yamasai, but the Tigers scored three runs in the fifth
on a one-run single by Tomochika Tsuboi and a two-run double by
Taiwanese Yasuyuki Taiho, or Cheng Tai-feng.
	   At Tokyo Dome, the Yomiuri Giants extended their winning streak
to five with a 6-5 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.

Western Christians ``apologize'' for 11th century Crusade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BEI-101
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Benjamin Gibson is a boy on a mission _ a
modern-day crusade _ to ``apologize'' for destruction and plunder
wrought by Christian Crusaders 900 years ago in the Middle East.
	   The 12-year-old from Mansfield, Texas, hopes the
``Reconciliation Walk'' he and 13 other Western Christians are
making will foster better understanding between Christians and
Muslims and between Western countries and the Middle East.
	   ``The conflict of East and West, Christians and Muslims, the
roots are in the Crusade,'' the golden-haired, blue-eyed boy said
Wednesday.
	   ``I've been doing research on the Crusaders since I was 6. I
told my mom I want to apologize for this,'' Benjamin told The
Associated Press. ``It's like a debt that hasn't been paid. It's
something that I feel strongly about.''
	   So strong were his feelings that he took time off from school
and persuaded his mother to join him.
	   ``He brought me with him,'' said his mother, Nancy Gibson. ``He
was fascinated by the stories.... He really was moved, struck by
the horror and how Christ was misused to slaughter people.''
	   Benjamin and his colleagues from the United States, Britain and
Australia arrived in Lebanon last week and have been walking the
streets apologizing to people they meet. They wear T-shirts and
baseball caps printed with the words ``We Apologize'' and read out
and hand out a letter.
	   ``We deeply regret the atrocities committed in the name of
Christ by our predecessors,'' the letter says.
	   While apologizing for something committed by one's extremely
remote ancestors may seem unrealistic, the walkers believe their
message has contemporary relevance.
	   ``Crusader mentality colors our relationship today and is
reflected in many of the conflicts the West is involved in,'' said
the group's Middle Eastern director, Matthew Hand, a Lutheran
minister from Fort Pierce, Florida.
	   Many Arabs regard the West, and the United States in particular,
as behind many of the troubles in the Middle East today. Britain
and France ruled much of the region between the world wars,
defining borders that are still controversial, and the United
States is seen as supporting Israel's occupation of Arab land.
	   Hand said the walkers are volunteers, who pay their own expenses
with support from friends and their local churches.
	   The ``walk'' began in Cologne, Germany, in 1996, and aims to
retrace in stages the path of the First Crusade which invaded the
Middle East in the 11th century and captured Jerusalem,
slaughtering Muslims, Jews and Eastern Christians along the way.
	   Last year, some 1,000 people took part in the walk through
Turkey and apologized to individuals and religious leaders. The
group's expects some 200 members to rotate through its Lebanese
walk.
	   Next March, the project will restart in Israel for the final
walk to Jerusalem, which the group plans to reach on July 15, 1999,
the 900th anniversary of the fall of the Holy City to the
Crusaders.
	   In Beirut this week, the group met Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir,
patriarch of the Maronite Catholics, Lebanon's largest Christian
sect and one whose forefathers welcomed the Crusaders.
	   ``He blessed our efforts,'' said Hand.
	   On Wednesday, the group stopped at City Hall, where the Rev. Tim
Atkins of Britain presented Mayor Abdul-Munem Ariss with a framed
apology letter printed in Arabic.
	   ``This is, of course, our apology for the atrocities committed
so many years ago,'' said Atkins, an Anglican.
	   Ariss, a Muslim, accepted the apology and replied with a
well-known Arabic saying: ``Admission of a mistake is a virtue.''
	   ``I hope it causes other people to come and say sorry,'' Ariss
added.

Faction leader: Planned city rule could lead to renewed fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A faction leader in the Somali capital
Mogadishu on Wednesday warned rival factions were creating ``a new
dictatorship'' as they prepared to form the city's first government
in seven years.
	   Hussein Hajji Bod said the new plan could lead to renewed
fighting and accused Egypt of sponsoring the new administration.
	   The new municipal plan was agreed to in late July by north
Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, his main rival, Bod,
and Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto from south Mogadishu.
	   Bod and Atto later withdrew their support for the Mogadishu
agreement, which Aidid and Mahdi have begun to implement by
demobilizing their militiamen, searching for offices and raising
funds from local businesses.
	   Egpyt's role in the new administration is unclear, but in
December, Cairo sponsored peace talks that brought together 24
faction leaders who agreed to set up a transition government for
Somalia and hold a national reconciliation conference. The
conference has since been repeatedly postponed.
	   On Wednesday, Egypt's ambassador to Somalia, Mohamed Mustafa,
toured camps where militiamen loyal to Ali Mahdi and Aidid are
being demobilized.
	   ``It is unfortunate that Egypt is now siding with a new
dictatorship led by Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi,'' Bod told
reporters at his north Mogadishu home.
	   ``The Somalis prefer to sink back into a new round of civil war
rather than accepting unlawful dictatorship,'' he warned.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since late 1991, when
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by a coalition of
clan-based factions that later began fighting amongst themselves.
	   Under the municipal plan, a committee is to be nominated to
draft laws to govern the city, the separate currencies of north and
south Mogadishu are to be consolidated and the country's main air
and sea ports, closed since 1995, reopened.

Dutch chemical giant delaying Russia project due to crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch chemical giant Akzo Nobel
said Wednesday it has delayed construction of a paint factory in
Russia because of the political and economic crisis there.
	   ``We're not canceling the project. It's just a delay. With the
present financial and political situation, it's difficult for
projects to go according to earlier plans,'' said Akzo spokesman
Raymond Frenken.
	   The company doesn't know when construction of the new factory,
which was supposed to start later this year just outside of Moscow,
will begin.
	   Frenken declined to give financial details on the project.
	   Akzo's annual sales in Russia, which include paint and
pharmaceutical products, amounts to about 250 million guilders
(dlrs 128 million), or about 1 percent of the company's total
sales.
	   For this reason, Akzo expects the total impact of the Russian
crisis to be ``fairly modest,'' Frenken said.
	   But in the wake of Russia's troubles, the company doesn't expect
its earlier growth predictions for the country to materialize.
	   ``Let's just say that for Russia, the growth we had expected for
1998 may only be realized by 1999,'' Frenken said without
elaborating.
	   In July, Akzo posted a 12 percent rise in its half-year net
profit to 893 million guilders (dlrs 458 million), but said it
expected growth to slow down in the second half of the year.

Iran's longest-held political prisoner arrested again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities have arrested Abbas Amir
Entezam, a former government spokesman who was Iran's longest-held
political prisoner before he was freed in 1996.
	   Entezam was sent to Tehran's Evin prison following a complaint
filed by the family of Assaddollah Lajevardi, a former prosecutor
assassinated last month, the Kayhan daily reported Wednesday.
	   The family objected to Entezam's comments about Lajevardi in an
interview with a foreign radio station after the assassination, the
newspaper said. The charge was not made public.
	   The paper did not say when Entezam was arrested.
	   Entezam was deputy prime minister and spokesman in the interim
government that took over after the shah of Iran was ousted during
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The Berkeley-educated Entezam was sent to prison after being
charged with spying for the United States, an accusation he denied.
	   Entezam, who was never given a trial, has vowed to fight on
against Iran's Islamic government until it clears his name.

Report: Thai police seek arrest of Cambodian tycoon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thai police have ordered the arrest on fraud
charges of a Cambodian tycoon who is suspected of drug trafficker
and is banned from entering the United States, the Far Eastern
Economic Review reported.
	   Teng Boonma, the president of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce,
is to be arrested and will be stripped of his Thai nationality,
according to an arrest warrant and other documents obtained by the
weekly magazine.
	   The warrant says Boonma allegedly provided false information to
obtain a Thai passport under two different names, a press release
from the magazine said Wednesday. He is also Cambodian national.
	   Hong Kong government sources said they are investigating whether
Teng Boonma used false documents in registering his Tai Boon Roong
company in the territory, the magazine said.
	   Teng Boonma is reputedly the richest man in Cambodia with
business interests ranging from a five-star hotel in Phnom Penh to
his own international airline. He also has shares in Cambodia's
largest newspaper, banks, and casinos, the release said.
	   The tycoon, who has close ties with Cambodian strongman Hun Sen,
told reporters last year he helped finance the July coup d'etat in
which Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as the country's
first prime minister.

Industrial fishing increasingly threatens fish, jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Industrial fishing fleets from wealthy
nations are endangering the world's fish stocks and pillaging the
supplies of developing nations, a report from an environmental
group said Wednesday.
	   The size and fishing capacity of vessels that seek their catch
in international waters or off the coast of a third country, has
increased fivefold over the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund
report said.
	   Unfortunately, ``there is a total lack of control of the
activities'' of these so-called distant water fleets, said Mike
Sutton director of the WWF's Endangered Seas Campaign.
	   At least 60 percent of the world's most valuable fish stocks are
either overfished or fished to the limit, the report said.
	   The activities of these fleets in third countries are sometimes
ruled by agreements, or they simply take place illegally, said
Sutton.
	   The United States and Japan account for over half of the world's
total catches by distant water fleets, followed by Spain.
	   In many cases, the victims of this industrial fishing are poor
or developing countries - particularly in Africa - with few
monitoring and enforcement capabilities, the WWF report says.
	   WWF spokesman Ezequiel Navio Vasseur cited an example in
Mauritania, where ``seven Dutch supertrawlers - giant floating fish
factories - have been dragging their mammoth nets behind them since
January.''
	   The ships haul in an average 3,500 tons of fish in less than a
month, he said. One catch by such a vessel is roughly equivalent to
the total catch of 23 local boats in the same period, he added.
	   The WWF says rich countries, including some of the 15 European
Union nations, are largely responsible for the overfishing, as they
support distant water fishing by heavily subsidizing the industry.
	   While global fish stocks consistently dropped, EU support to its
fishing industry rose from 175 million European currency units
(dlrs 192.5 million) to 875 million ecu (dlrs 962.5 million)
between 1985 and 1996.
	   Sutton urged countries to ratify a 1995 United Nations treaty
that sets the rules for distant water fishing. Thirty countries
must ratify the treaty for it to enter into force. So far, only 18
have done so.
	   Of the 20 top fishing nations in the world, only four have
ratified the treaty. These are the United States, Russia, Iceland
and Norway.

Russia's acting deputy finance minister charged with corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prosecutors filed formal corruption charges
Wednesday against acting first deputy finance minister who was
arrested last week, a news report said.
	   Vladimir Petrov, who was involved in the government's
negotiations on a massive International Monetary Fund bailout
package, is accused of taking dlrs 520,000 in bribes for using his
position to benefit a commercial bank, Eskado, the Interfax news
agency reported, citing prosecutor's office.
	   He was detained last week, when economic turmoil was already
sweeping Russia, and the detention was expected to further
undermine the credibility of the interim government.
	   Eskado bank deputy chief, Alexander Frangopulov, has also been
arrested and accused of bribing an official, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A U.S. Navy salvage ship carrying
deep-sea divers and equipment capable of lifting up to 300 tons
arrived Wednesday to help search for the wreckage of Swissair
Flight 111.
	   The USS Grapple, which helped with the undersea recovery of
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996, steamed in with
117 on board, including 30 divers.
	   Before heading out, the ship was to be equipped with diving
equipment and a remote-controlled submarine with a black-and-white
video camera and two retrieval arms.
	   While searching, most of the divers will wear hardhats with
attached hoses through which air will be pumped directly from the
boat, allowing them to stay under water longer.
	   Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on
Sept. 2, killing all 229 people aboard. The McDonnell-Douglas MD-11
jetliner went down more than an hour after taking off from New York
for Geneva.
	   Another Swissair MD-11 was unable to take off from Zurich on
Wednesday because of problems with its air conditioning system,
Swissair spokesman Peter Gutknecht said. More than 200 Los
Angeles-bound passengers had to be put on a replacement plane while
the MD-11 was taken to the hangar for repairs.
	   Another Navy team arrived at the crash scene Tuesday, equipped
with an experimental laser camera to cut through the undersea
gloom. The laser camera was expected to provide investigators with
images to map and locate objects as small as a seashell, said Gary
Kekelis, who heads the sensing technologies division at the Navy's
Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, Florida.
	   Kekelis said the equipment is designed for use in coastal waters
where turbid seas and underwater noise can complicate searches with
conventional sonar and photography.
	   The images will be taken from a 25-foot (7 1/2 meter) unmanned
torpedo-shaped craft dragged deep below the surface by the Canadian
coast guard boat Hudson. Surrounded by computer monitors and in
small rooms aboard the boat, the Navy team will examine the data
and report what they find to the searchers.
	   A Canadian navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine, said the
U.S. help is welcome.
	   ``Let's face it, the U.S. Navy is probably the most capable in
the world,'' he said. ``We would like to think that if the tables
were reversed and there was something we could do to help them, we
would.''
	   On Tuesday, investigators released a more complete version of
the last minutes of conversation between Flight 111's pilots and an
air traffic control tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   New details in the transcript included the pilots reporting that
they put on their oxygen masks and telling the controllers they
would have to fly the plane manually instead of by autopilot.
	   Most of the conversation, which was heavy in technical
terminology, involved directing the plane to an area over water
where it could dump fuel. At one point, one pilot asked another, in
German, if he had the emergency checklist for solving problems with
smoke in the air conditioning system.
	   Divers are trying to retrieve the plane's cockpit voice
recorder, which is still on the sea bottom. A signal from that
recorder has been detected, but bad weather Tuesday forced a
suspension of diving operations.
	   The plane's other ``black box,'' the flight data recorder, has
been recovered and sent to a laboratory in Ottawa for examination.
	   Canadian divers have also been trying to confirm if three large
pieces of wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections
of the plane's fuselage.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, expressed hopes of
gaining valuable data from the data recorder even though it stopped
working during the final six minutes.
	   The recorder, retrieved by divers 190 feet (58 meters)
underwater, might show how systems aboard the plane failed between
the pilots' initial distress call 16 minutes before the crash and
when the machine shut off, he said.
	   Gerden also said investigators have detected signs of heat
damage on fragments of the MD-11's cockpit, evidence that could
help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots before the
jetliner crashed.
	   Gerden said the signs of heat stress have been found so far only
on wreckage from the cockpit, not from the passenger cabin. He
refused to speculate on the extent of the damage or the cause.

Belgium lifting food into Kinshasa; says humanitarian tragedy near
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium is ready to start lifting food
into the Congolese capital Kinshasa to boost dwindling stocks and
stave off a humanitarian crisis, the government said Wednesday.
	   Belgium has sent a C-130 military transport plane to Pointe
Noire in neighboring Republic of Congo, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) from Kinshasa, and the plane is ready to start transporting
700 tons of food to the capital.
	   Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said food supplies were
increasingly scarce in Kinshasa, raising the threat of a
humanitarian crisis in the capital of 3.8 million people.
	   ``Sometimes I have the impression we are the only one's
realizing this,'' Derycke told Knack magazine Wednesday.
	   Belgium this week sent a small shipment from Brazzaville, the
Republic of Congo's capital, across the Congo river into Kinshasa
for distribution by non-governmental organizations.
	   Congo is in the midst of a civil war, making it difficult for
supplies to arrive in the capital.
	   The United Nations world food program is willing to let Belgium
transport its 700 tons of stocks from Pointe Noire, but so far,
shipments have been held up by practical and diplomatic
difficulties.
	   ``We are looking for practical solutions,'' said Derycke's
spokesman Hubert Cooreman, listing problems ranging from landing
rights to distribution facilities in Kinshasa.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was considering compromise
candidates for prime minister Wednesday, including an ex-Soviet
official, as political leaders called for swift action to pull
Russia out of an economic nosedive.
	   Government officials gave conflicting signals on how soon
Yeltsin would announce a decision, with some saying he would act
Wednesday. Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he did
not know if a decision had been made.
	   ``We are waiting for the decision of the president,'' he said,
refusing to speculate on possible candidates for the post.
	   Yeltsin was closeted at his country home outside Moscow, meeting
with top aides and deciding if he would agree to a compromise
candidate for prime minister.
	   There was speculation Wednesday in the Duma, the lower chamber
of parliament, that Yeltsin may be considering Yuri Maslyukov, a
Soviet-era economic official and a member of the Communist Party.
Maslyukov has worked with Yeltsin before, resigning last week as
trade and industry minister.
	   Communist and centrist leaders praised Maslyukov, saying they
would back him for prime minister. Maslyukov met Wednesday with
Yeltsin's chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, but there were no
details on what they discussed, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Maslyukov was not offered any government post, his press
secretary, Anton Surikov, told reporters late in the day, according
to Interfax.
	   Two other names that prompted speculation were Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ both of whom
have indicated they were not interested.
	   One Duma leader said he thought it was a positive sign that
Yeltsin was not immediately naming a nominee. Oleg Morozov, head of
the Russian Regions group, said the president's hesitation
suggested he was taking parliamentary criticism to heart.
	   ``It is a very positive moment,'' he said, according to
ITAR-Tass. ``Everyone understands that there is a chance to
agree.''
	   The ruble, the Russian currency, strengthened dramatically
Wednesday, rising to an exchange rate of about 15 to the U.S.
dollar. That compared to an exchange rate of around 20 to the
dollar on Tuesday.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate reflected a
shortage of rubles and sales of dollars by some banks. Stores in
Moscow were restocking shelves and people seemed less worried about
food shortages.
	   ``I'm buying but I haven't been in panic. We see people
hoarding, but we don't do it. There's no reason for it, you can't
buy for your entire life,'' said Tatyana Shishkova, 57, a retired
teacher.
	   ``I personally am an optimist. I think in the end everything
will fall back into place. It's a temporary panic,'' she added.
	   A compromise candidate could resolve a deadlock between the
president and parliament that has paralyzed the political system
even as the country's economy flounders.
	   Ever since the Duma resoundingly rejected his unpopular choice
of Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday, Yeltsin has been meeting with
aides, but has said nothing publicly.
	   In previous situations, he has made a new nomination within
hours of a no vote, and the delay spurred speculation he was
considering a change of heart.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned Wednesday that the Duma
would begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. A vote to start impeachment
proceedings blocks Yeltsin from dissolving the Duma.
	   ``If Chernomyrdin is nominated again we will immediately launch
the impeachment motion,'' he told journalists.
	   But the Duma needs a two-thirds majority to begin impeachment,
and government supporters predicted it could not be passed.
	   Yeltsin has one more chance to propose a candidate _ either
Chernomyrdin or someone else. If the Duma rejects the third choice,
Yeltsin is required to disband the chamber and call new elections _
unless an impeachment motion is passed.
	   Opposition and religious leaders warned that unless a solution
is found quickly, the political standoff could spark civil war.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, a presidential aspirant,
said Wednesday he was ready to take charge of the government,
adding that Yeltsin should resign. ``A paralysis of power is
obvious now,'' he said.
	   The nation's top clergyman, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II,
even prayed publicly before Russia's holiest icon, Our Lady of
Vladimir, seeking divine protection against ``misfortunes, sorrows
and internecine war.''

Denmark to give Ukraine dlrs 100 million loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Denmark will provide a dlrs 100 million
loan to Ukraine under a bilateral agreement signed in Kiev on
Wednesday, officials said.
	   The agreement was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys
Tarasyuk and his Danish counterpart Niels Helveg Petersen, who
arrived in Ukraine Wednesday for a two-day visit.
	   The loan would target such industries as ship building,
agriculture and energy saving, Tarasyuk told reporters after the
signing ceremony.
	   The sides also signed an agreement on cooperation between
Ukrainian and Danish car producers.
	   Tarasyuk and Petersen noted that trade turnover between the two
countries has been steadily increasing since Ukraine's independence
in 1991, rising from dlrs 86 million to dlrs 181 million last year.
	   ``The documents we signed would allow us to significantly
increase cooperation in near future,'' Petersen said.
	   Later in the day, the Danish foreign minister was to hold
meetings with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and Foreign Trade Minister Serhy Osyka.
	   On Thursday, Petersen and a delegation of businessmen
accompanying him are scheduled to meet Agriculture Minister Borys
Supikhanov and Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov.

EU Commission says Malpensa airport plan illegal, offers week

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
gave Italy one week to craft a new airlines distribution plan for
Milan's soon-to-open Malpensa airport, saying current plans
unfairly favor Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
	   The 20-member commission demanded Italy change current plans
that force foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan to move to
Malpensa airport, which opens as the city's second airport and
Italy's second national hub on Oct. 25.
	   If the Italian government fails to act before Sept. 16, the
commission will officially rule the system discriminatory, said EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   Nine European airlines have complained about the plan to move
them to Malpensa, claiming poor road and rail links from Malpensa
to downtown Milan 33 miles (50 kms) away means they'll lose
passengers to Italy's national carrier Alitalia.
	   Under the Italian government's plans, flights to Milan will be
switched to the new terminal from the current Linate airport,
located just six miles (10 kms) from the city center.
	   An exception will be made for Alitalia's shuttle flights between
Rome and Milan, which will be allowed to stay at Linate.
Competitors fear that long-haul passengers will prefer flying with
the Italian carrier from Linate to Rome and on to their final
destination, rather than trekking out to Malpensa.
	   Kinnock said he will make sure the conditions for all airlines
from the 15-nation EU would have to be equal. ``Operating
conditions and access to air markets must be equitable,'' he said.
	   The heart of the problem lies with the criteria Italy used to
leave Alitalia at Linate. It said all routes with more than 2
million passengers a year will stay at Linate ``and all other
flights will operate out of Malpensa,'' Kinnock said.
	   The practical effect of that was that ``only flights from Rome
may operate from Linate'' and that means Alitalia, he said.

Commission disbands after 52 years of work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The tripartite gold commission, set up more than a
half-century ago to oversee the return of some dlrs 4 billion in
gold looted by the Nazis, disbanded on Wednesday, its mission
accomplished but some questions left unanswered.
	   With the end of its work, the Tripartite Commission for the
Restitution of Monetary Gold, made up of the United States, Britain
and France, opened its archives to the public.
	   ``We are conscious that, with this work accomplished, we are
turning a page,'' said French representative Claude Martin. But he
added: ``We are conscious that, whatever the efforts and their
results, there will be ... victims who have not received.''
	   He was referring to individuals whose jewelery and even gold
teeth were looted by the Nazis _ objects, the commission learned,
that were smelted into bars to disguise their source.
	   The commission was set up by the Allies in September 1946 to
find and return gold confiscated by the Nazis from various
governments to finance its war effort. Finding and returning gold
stolen from individuals was not within the mandate.
	   The Allies recovered about 337 metric tons of gold _ about dlrs
4 billion worth in current prices _ far less than the actual claims
of gold lost.
	   U.S. representative Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state
for economic affairs, said the commission determined that claimants
would receive some 64 percent of their claims. Today, only the
former Yugoslavia has not received its distribution.
	   Also, the commission's efforts to get the Vatican to provide
information have thus far proved in vain.
	   The commission had learned that some looted gold ended up in the
hands of Croatian priests in Rome, and Eizenstat said he traveled
twice to the Vatican in the last six to eight months _ but to no
avail.
	   Last year, a fund was set up for individual victims of Nazi
persecution. Eizenstat said it has so far collected almost dlrs 60
million in contributions _ some from governments offering the
shares due them.
	   The commission represents ``one of the most noble, selfless,
just and moral actions taken by the Allies in the post-World War II
era,'' Eizenstat said at a news conference.
	   The commission hopes that the opening of its archives, housed at
the French Foreign Ministry, as well as the national archives of
Britain, France and the United States will encourage other nations
to do likewise.

police said. The attack occurred late Tuesday evening near the

Vietnam denies illegal construction near disputed reefs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam on Wednesday denied illegally
constructing installations near islets in the South China Sea that
are also claimed by China.
	   China on Tuesday accused Vietnam of occupying a pair of
submerged reefs in the disputed Spratly islands and demanded Hanoi
immediately withdraw its troops.
	   ``We once again assert that the two economic, scientific,
technological stations servicing Vietnam's fisheries are only
civilian projects in the Ba Ke reef in Vietnam's continental
shelf'' said Vietnam's Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday.
	   The reef ``does not belong to the Spratlys,'' said the official.
``This is a normal civilian activity under Vietnam's sovereignty
rights in accordance with international laws, particularly the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.''
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao had repeated what
China calls its indisputable and ancient claim to sovereignty over
the South China Sea islands.
	   By its ``recent'' occupation of the two submerged reefs, Zhu
said, Vietnam was ``seriously endangering China's territorial
sovereignty.''
	   ``The Chinese side has made solemn representations to the
Vietnamese side, strongly demanding the Vietnamese side immediately
withdraw from the Chinese reefs it has illegally seized, dismantle
all the installations illegally built and guarantee no similar acts
of seizure occur in the future,'' Zhu said at regularly scheduled
press briefing.
	   Both Vietnam and China claim historical and legal bases for
sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes.
	   The Spratlys, believed to lie atop potentially valuable oil, gas
and mineral deposits, have been claimed in whole or part by
Vietnam, China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A piece of machinery at a BASF plant
in Ludwigshafen exploded Wednesday, killing a worker, a spokesman
for the chemical company said.
	   Authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion at a
fiber factory workshop.
	   Last month, two BASF employee died in an explosion at another of
BASF's 350 factories at its 7.5-square-kilometer (3-square-mile)
complex in Ludwigshafen, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of
Frankfurt. The explosion occurred during repair work in the
basement of a plant that makes a form of polystyrene for insulation
boards.
	   BASF is Germany's third-largest chemical group after Hoechst and
Bayer.

Egypt criticizes Turkish-Israeli exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt criticized Wednesday military
maneuvers planned by Israel and Turkey later this year as a
dangerous exercise ``directed toward Arabs.''
	   Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who visited Israel earlier
this week, said the two non-Arab Middle Eastern countries would
hold the naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea.
	   ``The matter is very dangerous when a non-Arab alliance is set
up in the region because it appears directed toward Arabs,'' said
Osama el-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's top political adviser.
	   El-Baz made his comments at the presidential palace in Cairo
after Mubarak met several visiting officials, including Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also criticized the
maneuvers, calling them a ``negative development.''
	   ``It comes in the time we are trying to revive the peace
process,'' Moussa said at a news conference with his Italian
counterpart, Lamberto Dini.
	   The negotiations have been stalled since March 1997.
	   Yilmaz said the Israeli and Turkish navies would conduct a joint
search and rescue naval exercise in November, their second this
year. But Jane's Defense Weekly said an air exercise would also
take place in Israel from Sunday to Wednesday.
	   Turkish F-16 jet fighters from Diyarbakir air base will take
part, the British journal said.
	   Israel and Turkey say their cooperation is not directed against
other countries and is aimed at promoting stability in the region.
But several Arab countries in the region, especially Syria, have
expressed concern about the emerging alliance.

Head of Japan's nuclear program vows to regain people's trust
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 8-9 with court ruling on disputed nuclear
plant. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's state-run nuclear power company has
reformed itself and will regain the public's trust following a
series of accidents and cover ups at reactors, the company's new
president said Wednesday.
	   The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, or
Donen, launched a restructuring program last year and the new
company will open Oct. 1 as the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development
Institute.
	   ``Our major obligation is to regain the public trust as soon as
possible and the new organization will attach the top priority on
the guarantee of safety.'' Donen President Yasumasa Togo told
reporters.
	   Togo, who was named president of the company in July after a
career in academia, promised greater transparency in his public
company's operations.
	   ``We believe that openness in exchanging information is the very
basis of the survival of our organization,'' he said.
	   Japan's faith in nuclear power was shaken after plant officials
tried to cover up the extent of damage from a fire at Donen nuclear
reprocessing facility in March 1997 that exposed 37 workers to
low-level radiation.
	   Longstanding opponents of nuclear energy cited the incident as
evidence that the nation's atomic power program lacks
accountability and ignores serious safety hazards.
	   In a ruling Wednesday, a regional high court in central Japan
dismissed a case filed to stop operations at a nuclear plant
located on the Sea of Japan coast which is run by one of the
country's nine electric power firms, Keizo Yamada, president of
Hokuriku Electric Power Co., said in a statement.
	   The Nagoya High Court upheld a 1994 decision by a lower court
which found that the plant posed no safety threat even in the event
of a major earthquake, as had been alleged by the citizen's group
which lodged the case.
	   In Tokyo, Donen head Togo said a long restructuring process that
began in April of last year after a fire and explosion at a Donen
nuclear facility has resulted in a trimmer, more efficient and more
responsible company.
	   The first major stain on the company's reputation came in 1995
when officials were forced to admit they concealed the severity of
a liquid sodium leak at the prototype Monju reactor in western
Japan.
	   Togo also said the new company will intensify research into
effective ways to dispose of nuclear waste, which has been a source
of deep controversy in Japan.
	   ``Disposal of high-level nuclear waste is the most important
challenge to the nuclear energy community,'' he said. ``The new
organization will function as the core of research and development
of these efforts.''
	   Natural resources poor Japan now has 51 commercial nuclear power
plants, supplying about one-third of the nation's electricity,
according to government figures.

Sun and Mirror battle it out over Murdoch deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ BSkyB's record dlrs 1 billion takeover offer for
Manchester United has set off a vicious war between Britain's two
biggest tabloids, the Murdoch-owned Sun and the rival Daily Mirror.
	   The Sun's front-page headline Wednesday screamed in massive bold
type: ``IT'S A DEAL.''
	   The Mirror countered with: ``Sold to the Red Devil,'' including
a picture of Murdoch with red horns.
	   The two papers attacked each other in their editorials.
	   ``Football is the big winner _ from top to bottom,'' the Sun
said.
	   Referring to the Mirror, it said, ``One paper, edited by an
immature joker with a somewhat limited future in journalism,
portrayed him as a red devil.
	   ``A bit rich coming from the paper the crooked Robert Maxwell
owned (he had his own football club too). The illogical hysteria
whipped up against BSkyB has been pathetic.''
	   The Sun said the satellite network had invested millions into
the Premier League and transformed the national game for the
better.
	   ``There is a big world out there,'' it said. ``It's a pity our
rivals prefer not to look at it. Anyone who thinks the Sun will now
be biased in favor of Manchester United is either brain dead or the
jealous editor of a rival editor. Or both.''
	   The Mirror's editorial said:
	   ``This is a sad day for soccer. The day when money talked louder
than the road of the fans. The day when control of Manchester
United was grabbed from the people who love the club and the game.
...
	   ``The problem is not what Mr. Murdoch's newspapers will report
(no one believes what they say anyway). The crisis is over BSkyB's
control of the Premier League. ...
	   ``Rupert Murdoch can be stopped. Must be stopped. Remember the
motto: United we stand _ for the sake of Manchester United and ALL
soccer fans.''

Britain, France, Germany and Italy sign arms procurement treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Air Show &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Defense ministers from four nations
on Wednesday signed a treaty paving the way for a European arms
procurement agency.
	   Britain, Germany, France and Italy took the first steps in 1996
toward forming the Organization for Joint Armaments Cooperation,
which now has 20-staff and headquarters in Bonn. It is known as
OCCAR, an acronym for the initials of the title in French.
	   The convention signed during the third day of the Farnborough
International 98 air show was the next legal step toward setting up
the agency. It still needs to be ratified.
	   ``This treaty, once ratified, will give OCCAR the scope to
develop its own procurement procedures, contract rules and
regulations, helping it deliver joint programs faster, cheaper and
better,'' said British Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   ``OCCAR offers us the opportunity to avoid 'reinventing the
wheel' every time work starts on a collaborative equipment
project,'' he added.
	   Robertson said the agency was not an exclusive club, but was
expected to expand and become the foundation of an eventual
European Armaments Agency.
	   Robertson signed the treaty with French Defense Minister Alain
Richard, Beniamino Andreatta of Italy, and Germany's Gunnar Simon.

EU head office can see December nod for Malta membership talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission, expecting to
have Malta's reapplication for EU membership in a matter of days,
said Wednesday the green light for entry talks may come as soon as
mid-December.
	   ``We haven't received (the new application) yet but expect it in
the coming days,'' said EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan.
	   The EU agreed to membership talks with Malta in April, 1995.
However, the Labor government that came to power in October, 1996,
put the application on hold. Last Sunday, the conservative
Nationalist Party regained power saying it will pursue membership
anew.
	   Van der Laan said the EU must determine if it can simply pick up
where it left Malta in 1996.
	   She said if Malta _ population only 376,000 _ is found
economically and politically fit for membership, the European
Commission will recommend that to the EU leaders who meet in Vienna
Dec. 11-12. It would be up to them to approve the start of
negotiations.
	   EU figures put Malta's 1997 unemployment and inflation rates at
4 percent and 3 percent respectively. That compares favorably to
the EU but Malta's per capita annual income of dlrs 12,000 a year
makes it a poor EU neighbor.
	   ``We have to see how we can integrate Malta in the enlargement
process,'' said Van der Laan.
	   The EU is negotiating membership with 11 nations. The Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus are on a
fast-track, meaning they'll join in the next decade. Lithuania,
Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria may have to wait longer.
	   Van der Laan could not say if Malta would be a fast-tracker. One
problem looming ahead: Malta has no value added taxes, a source of
EU income in each member state.
	   If it joins the EU, Malta must adopt all EU legislation as its
own. In return, it will qualify for EU aid for such projects as
road building in support of tourism, Malta's number one source of
income.

NATO completes plan for eventual operations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO has finished contingency planning
for allied military operations in and around the southern Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, a NATO official said Wednesday.
	   ``We have completed contingency planning for the full range of
options that may have to be used to support international
diplomacy,'' said the official, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
	   The aim of the plan, he said, is ``to give political leaders
maximum flexibility'' in dealing with the Yugoslav government in
Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian rebels in the province. The
official spoke after a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO
nations.
	   The planning involves three basic options:
	   - A preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania along the
border with Kosovo, where Serb security forces have been attempting
to put down a rebellion by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   - Air operations inside Yugoslavia, both limited and full scale.
	   - Deployment of ground troops backed by air power to support a
cease-fire or a peace agreement for Kosovo. That could involve as
many as 60,000 troops.
	   Such operations, should they become necessary, could involve
both NATO and non-member countries, but it was too early for that
kind of decision yet, the official said.
	   The NATO ambassadors welcomed recent indications that a peaceful
settlement may be taking shape in Kosovo, while repeating that NATO
believes the Yugoslav government in Belgrade is largely responsible
for creating the problems.
	   The official said that in the event of a ceasefire or a peace
plan, NATO would expect to receive a mandate from the U.N. Security
Council before implementing military action.

For the people of Kabul, life goes from bad to worse

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 19th graf to CORRECT that U.S. officials say there was no
attempt to kill bin Laden. PICKUP 20th graf pvs. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A poor family, hoping for a few coins,
tries to sell what little they have left: chipped cups and saucers,
an ornate vase and broken kitchen appliances little better than the
row of derelict refrigerators others have dumped nearby.
	   No one gives their meager wares a second glance. Everyone is
selling something in Afghanistan's battered capital. But no one is
buying.
	   Outside a carpet shop _ really an old railroad freight car _
bearded men sit sipping sweet green tea and puffing lazily on their
cigarettes. They seem to be there out of habit, rather than in any
real hope of a customer turning up.
	   Since 1996, Kabul has been in the hands of the Taliban religious
army, which controls roughly 90 percent of the country. The
militia, known for its strict form of Islam, is battling a
coalition of northern-based armies, mostly small parties
representing ethnic groups.
	   The only shoppers on Kabul's dust-clogged streets are women,
dressed in the all-enveloping burqas, who sail past the ramshackle
shops. Occasionally, the women pause for a heartbeat or two, and
only then to buy food.
	   Cars are scarce. Most people ride bicycles.
	   ``It just keeps going from bad to worse,'' complains Ismatullah,
a young man with a wispy black beard and starched blue shalwar
kameez, the loose pants and dress-length shirt favored in the
region.
	   People seem confused that their old friend, the United States,
which aided Afghan rebels who ousted a Soviet-backed government,
would fire missiles at their country. They seem unaware that the
Aug. 20 strike was actually aimed at suspected terrorist training
camps, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southeast of Kabul, funded
by Saudi millionaire dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   ``We need help and instead the Americans fire missiles at us,''
said Ismatullah.
	   The stench from an open sewer wafts inside the decrepit
drugstore where Ismatullah is passing time with his friend, Saeed
Zabiullah. Zabiullah hasn't gotten around to cleaning up after the
opposition force's last rocket strike, which smashed his counter
and sprayed bits of glass over the few medicines on display.
	   Business is bad, says Zabiullah. But he refuses to blame the
hard-line Taliban, and he says both good and bad have come of the
Taliban's rule of Kabul.
	   The Taliban's strict religious rule has been relatively
peaceful, putting an end to four years of rocket attacks by rival
Islamic groups that left the city in ruins and killed 50,000
people.
	   Corruption and crime, once widespread, have all but disappeared
because of the Taliban's severe Islamic punishments. Theft, for
example, is punished by chopping off a culprit's limb.
	   ``That was good,'' said Zabiullah, bearded and his head covered
as the Taliban demand.
	   The bad has been the Taliban's seemingly endless Islamic edicts,
such as a ban on women working and the closure of all girls'
schools, he said.
	   And he misses foreigners. Under the Taliban's heavy-handed rule,
virtually all foreigners have fled the city, except for a few
employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Ahmed Jan, an old man seeking buyers for his rapidly rotting
watermelons, said the U.S. missile strike did not scare him.
	   ``We have had thousands of rockets land on our heads,'' said the
survivor of a four-year civil war that left much of his hometown in
ruins.
	   He doesn't know bin Laden, blamed by the United States for
financing attacks on American embassies in eastern Africa that
killed 258 people. Nor does he understand why the United States
would attack Afghanistan as a way to strike at bin Laden.

	   NISHINOMIYA, Japan, (AP) _ Japan routed China 11-0 Wednesday for
its second straight victory in the final round of the Asian AAA
Baseball Championship for the age group of 17 and 18 years old.
	   China fell to 0-2.
	   In the other final-round action, Taiwan trimmed defending
champion South Korea 7-2. Both teams are 1-1.
	   The four countries have advanced to the round following an
eight-nation preliminary round-robin tournament that ended Sunday.
	   In a consolation round to decide fifth to eighth places,
Australia scored 34 runs in the fourth inning en route to a 51-0
victory over Mongolia. In the other match in the group, the
Philippines beat Indonesia 13-1.

Airbus, Boeing lock horns in fresh jet-selling duel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The intense air show rivalry between
Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Co. tilted toward the Europeans
early Wednesday, as Airbus announced dlrs 4 billion in new jet
orders and dlrs 3 billion more in options.
	   Boeing bounced back with orders for airplanes that list at about
dlrs 2.3 billion.
	   But after most of the new airplane deals apparently had been
unveiled at the Farnborough International 98 air show, it appeared
that Airbus has landed the biggest share of business at the
industry's top event of the year _ including a major new deal with
United Parcel Service.
	   Airbus announced firm new orders for airplanes with a list value
totaling dlrs 6.7 billion in the first three days of the show,
along with options on more planes with an asking price of dlrs 4.5
billion.
	   Boeing's firm orders came close to dlrs 5.2 billion _ with about
another dlrs 1 billion in options, a spokesman said.
	   ``This comes and goes, and really you have to look at it over a
period of time,'' spokesman Mark Hooper said. Boeing maintains a
sizable lead over Airbus and should capture about 70 percent of the
money brought in from actual airplane deliveries this year, he
said.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard was all smiles as he
unveiled big deals with UPS _ an important new customer _ and a
large U.S. leasing company, General Electric Capital Aviation
Services, a subsidiary of GE Capital.
	   The big U.S. purchasers are becoming increasingly aware that it
doesn't matter where their airplanes are made, Forgeard told
reporters in a thinly concealed swipe at his competitor,
Seattle-based Boeing.
	   Boeing had a somewhat slower day, at a show where much attention
has been focused on its recent assembly line problems and a
management shakeup.
	   One of Boeing's more colorful deals was a memorandum of
understanding _ not a firm order _ to sell one big 747-400 to a
startup Sri Lankan carrier called PeaceAir that plans, among other
things, to fly religious pilgrims to holy sites.
	   ``Peace begins with a smile,'' said PeaceAir's chairman, Gamini
Wethasinghe, his voice choking with emotion as he described plans
to give 80 percent of profits to charity. ``When PeaceAir starts,
we hope to bring peace and joy.''
	   Boeing soon rolled out dlrs 1.67 billion in jet orders to GE
Capital _ which is taking 12 of Boeing's longhaul 767 models.
Boeing also said it sold five 737-800s in a deal listed at about
dlrs 255 million to the San Francisco aircraft leasing company GATX
Capital Corp.
	   Boeing said earlier it had gotten five new orders for 737s from
Scandinavian Airlines System, which also is converting 11 options
into firm orders in a dlrs 600 million deal. Boeing also sold one
737 to a small Greek carrier, Cronus Airlines, which took an option
on another 737 as well.
	   A Boeing regional vice president, Tom Basacchi, tried to show
Boeing was doing well off its home turf, saying the 737 orders from
SAS ``reaffirms that we have the right product for the European
market.''
	   But the biggest deal of the day _ and thus far of the whole show
_ was the Airbus sale to UPS, the Atlanta-based delivery company
that made its first purchase from the European planemaking
consortium from France, Germany, Britain and Spain.
	   UPS ordered 30 A300FR-600R cargo jets and took options on 30
more in a package priced at around dlrs 5 billion if it takes all
of the airplanes.
	   Earlier, Airbus said GE Capital had placed firm orders for 30
models from the Airbus A320 series _ with options for 10 more in a
deal worth up to dlrs 2 billion. GE Capital and its competitors
lease out jets to airlines that don't buy their own fleets.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks stabilized on Wall Street Wednesday after
Tuesday's stunning rally.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up a record 380.53 points
Tuesday, opened lower but then nudged higher. The Dow was up 5.41
at 8,026.19 at 1000 a.m. (1400 GMT) after a half hour of trading.
	   Broader-market indicators were mixed after record point gains
Tuesday and the best daily percentage increases in nearly 11 years.
	   Share prices were lower in afternoon trading in Britain and
Germany and finished lower after a strong start in Japan and Hong
Kong.
	   Markets got a psychological lift as the trading week began from
comments late Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
indicating the central bank was prepared to lower interest rates if
worsening global economic problems had a bigger impact on the U.S.
economy.
	   Asian markets roared higher Monday. And on Tuesday, when Wall
Street returned from the Labor Day holiday, major indexes not only
had their best point gains ever but also their biggest percentage
gains since Oct. 21, 1987, two days after the ``Black Monday''
crash.
	   The Dow had climbed almost 5 percent Tuesday, while the Nasdaq
composite index record rise of 94.34 points was a 6 percent gain.
	   Although Wall Street is trying to bounce back from a late-summer
selling stampede, economic problems persist in Asia and Russia,
which still threaten to spread greater pain elsewhere in the world.
	   As word of New York's rebound on Tuesday reached Asia Wednesday
morning, people seemed happy but uncertain, given how much
turbulence has wracked the world's markets lately.
	   In Tokyo, Masahiko Shimizu, 31, an insurance salesman who had
just completed a stock transaction at Nomura Securities Co., said:
``The Dow surge won't have a direct effect on the Japanese economy.
It has its own problems, and they are mostly political.''
	   When trading began Wednesday, Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average moved higher but closed off 1.07 percent because of new
concerns about a major part of Asia's economic crisis _ the
weakness of Japanese banks burdened with bad loans.
	   As Japan's political parties continue to wrangle over a proposed
bailout for the banks, rumors surfaced on the market that Fuji Bank
Ltd. was facing huge derivatives losses overseas. That triggered
selling in the banking sector, traders said, even though the bank
later called the rumors ``totally groundless.''
	   After Tokyo markets closed, Japan's central bank lowered its
target for a key interest rate to the lowest level ever. The move
would make it cheaper for banks to raise funds and should reduce
corporate borrowing costs.
	   In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, Wall Street initially lifted the
index Wednesday but ended with a decline of 3.5 percent. Traders
attributed selling to profit-taking.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index closed at
885.46, up 16.78 points, or 1.9 percent.

Veteran U.S. diplomat to oversee U.S.-backed broadcasts to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ David Newton, a veteran American diplomat
and Middle East expert, will head the U.S.-sponsored Radio Free
Europe's broadcasts to Iraq, a radio official said.
	   Kamran Karadaghi, the newly named editor-in-chief of the
service, said Newton would soon take over responsibility for the
radio programs, which will broadcast from the Czech Republic.
	   Karadaghi, an Iraqi journalist who works for the London-based
Al-Hayat newspaper, will serve as Netwon's assistant and oversee
the broadcasts, which will be in Arabic, he told The Associated
Press.
	   Newton, a Middle East expert, served as the first American
ambassador to Iraq after the two countries resumed diplomatic ties
in 1984 following an 18-year break. In February, he traveled to the
Middle East during a standoff between Iraq and U.N. inspectors.
	   The Czech government has agreed to allow Radio Free Europe to
broadcast to Iran and Iraq, although it said it wanted the programs
to be monitored for objectivity.
	   ``This will a professional operation which will be run by
non-partisan and objective journalists,'' Karadaghi said from
London.
	   The Iraqi government criticized the operation, which will begin
next month, and warned Prague that it would lose its trade deals
with Iraq if the program went ahead as scheduled.
	   The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmissions from
Munich, Germany, in 1951 with uncensored news to communist
countries during the Cold War. The station moved to Prague in 1995,
following the collapse of communism.

 &UR; Indian government cancels transfer of official investigating
politicians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Criticized by the Supreme Court, the
government on Wednesday canceled the transfer of the chief
investigator of corruption cases against politicians, domestic news
agencies reported.
	   The decision came a day after the Supreme Court accused the
government of lying about the transfer of M.K. Bezborouah, the
chief of the Enforcement Directorate.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose government ordered
the transfer, said he was ``extremely unhappy'' with his lawyers
for misrepresenting facts before the justices. He asked officials
to probe the fiasco.
	   Bezborouah's transfer to the low-profile transport department
apparently was ordered following pressure from a powerful southern
politician who is being investigated for violating foreign exchange
laws.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha's support is crucial for the survival of the
government and she reportedly had threatened to topple the minority
coalition if Bezborouah was not transferred, media reports had said
last month. The government and Jayalalitha denied the reports.
	   Bezborouah was transferred even though the Supreme Court had
ordered the government not to transfer any official investigating
corruption cases, which have been in progress under successive
governments.
	   The government said Tuesday that his transfer was premature. The
court criticized the government for hiding facts from it and for
selectively using earlier rulings.
	   On Wednesday, Solicitor-General Santosh Hegde told the court
that it will cancel the transfer to disprove reports that it was
done with an ulterior motive, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
	   Bezborouah had ordered a probe into Jayalalitha's television
channel in the southern city of Madras. His department filed
charges against her for violating complex foreign exchange laws in
floating the channel.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's leading miner of ferronickel ore,
used to manufacture stainless steel, warned Wednesday it may have
to shut down its operations because of a four-day action by
Greenpeace.
	   Environmental activists from the organization prevented waste
dumping ships from sailing from a loading and processing facility
owned by state-controlled Larco in Larymna, 130 kilometers (81
miles) north of the capital.
	   Their action came one day after coast guard officers released 12
Greenpeace members arrested late Monday for chaining themselves to
the facility's loading docks.
	   Greenpeace activists have prevented Larco ships from dumping
rust, a byproduct, into the nearby northern Euboean Gulf. Larco has
a government license to dump the rust, which it claims is harmless
to the environment.
	   The environmental organization said it will continue its action,
which it began Sunday, until the government revokes Larco's dumping
license.
	   ``If Greenpeace actions continue, Larco might have to close down
which would make (ferronickel) prices go up,'' said Constantinos
Daskalakis, Larco's chief executive officer.
	   If shut down, Larco would need at least 20 days to bring its
production facility back on line. Larco exports all of its
production abroad to countries such as Belgium, Canada, Finland,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Britain.
	   Larco did not say when it would have to shut down because of the
Greenpeace blockade.
	   According to the company, Larco controls about 2 percent of the
global ferronickel market and about 8 percent in the European
Union. If the scrap processing is excluded, Larco's share of the
European market is closer to 20 percent, it said
	   Daskalakis said the company was losing 100 million drachmas
(dlrs 336,700) a day because of the Greenpeace action, a loss
compounded by a global drop in metals prices.
	   ``I can't understand why Greenpeace chose Larco, a firm that is
so sensitive to the environment, for their actions,'' Daskalakis
said.
	   Greenpeace claims dumping rust into the sea affects marine life
and the long-term health of people who eat fish from the region.
	   It contends that Greek and international laws ban such dumping.
It alleges Greece was required to stop such dumping by the 1996
London International Agreement for the prevention of marine
pollution.
	   Larco has argued the London agreement does not cover Greek seas.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect officially placed in detention, Germany
interested in what he knows about Stasi, fixes typo in name `Ilich'
in graf 3. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police entered a bar in a tiny Normandy
village and arrested a German believed to be a former accomplice of
``Carlos the Jackal'' and wanted for a bloody 1975 terror attack,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Hans-Joachim Klein, 50, had been sought for more than 20 years.
He is wanted for a 1975 attack against OPEC oil ministers in
Vienna, in which three people were killed and 70 taken hostage.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Ilich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is now in a French
jail serving a life term for a triple murder.
	   Klein had been living under a false identity in
Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume, a village of about 300 people, for
five years. Townspeople called him Dick, and believed he was a
journalist.
	   At about 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, plainclothes police barged into
the only bar in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume and surprised Klein
drinking his nightly beer.
	   Klein was unarmed and offered no resistance, police said.
	   ``He was well integrated into the village,'' said the town's
mayor, Remy Clerembaux, in a telephone interview.
	   ``For everyone here he was Dick,'' the mayor said. ``He said he
wrote articles and books, but it was clear he was a bit marginal,
because he always lived alone and never had guests.''
	   Klein was officially placed in detention Wednesday afternoon. In
Germany, the Federal Crime Office in Wiesbaden said Frankfurt
prosecutors plan to request his extradition.
	   Germany is interested not only in what Klein might have to say
about Carlos' terror network, but also about activities at the time
of the Stasi, the East German secret police, French officials say.
	   During the 1975 attack, Klein was wounded by a gunshot to the
stomach, and was clearly identified at the time as a suspect.
	   The attackers managed to negotiate their escape with Austrian
authorities, flying to Algeria with 35 hostages. After the crisis
ended in Algeria, Klein disappeared.
	   Since then, he'd been sighted in Yemen and Libya as well as
Algeria, but then intelligence services lost track of him.
	   In 1978, Klein gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine in
which he renounced terrorism.
	   Frankfurt prosecutors received new information last year
indicating Klein spent at least some of his time in the Benelux
countries and France. German investigators and French police found
that he was posing as a German journalist.
	   Klein had no identity papers when arrested, but conceded his
identity during questioning.
	   Ramirez, one of the world's most-wanted terrorists during the
Cold War, was convicted last December of shooting two French police
investigators and a Lebanese man.

<TEXT>
	   PAU, France (AP) _ Police on Wednesday arrested nearly a dozen
prominent figures tied to the underground separatist group that has
claimed responsiblity in recent terrorist bombings in the French
Basque country, officials said.
	   Gendarmes from this southwestern French city also conducted
house searches in the town of Saint-Palais, about 60 kilometers (34
miles) east of Bayonne.
	   Police said a cache of weapons was discovered. No further
details were immediately available.
	   The early-morning sweep of well-known figures connected to the
Basque separatist organization Iparretarrak was carried out as
police stepped up their investigation into the bombings in recent
months that ripped through the picturesque Basque country in
France's southwest corner.
	   Among those arrested was Jean-Pierre Sainte-Marie, a Basque
militant who spent several years in jail for belonging to
Iparretarrak.

Western Christians ``apologize'' for 11th century Crusade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Benjamin Gibson is a boy on a mission _ a
modern-day crusade _ to ``apologize'' for destruction and plunder
wrought by Christian Crusaders 900 years ago in the Middle East.
	   The 12-year-old from Mansfield, Texas, hopes the
``Reconciliation Walk'' he and 13 other Western Christians are
making will foster better understanding between Christians and
Muslims and between Western countries and the Middle East.
	   ``I've been doing research on the Crusaders since I was 6. I
told my mom I want to apologize for this,'' Benjamin said. ``It's
like a debt that hasn't been paid.''
	   About 200 colleagues from the United States, Britain and
Australia have been walking Lebanese streets since last week clad
in T-shirts and baseball caps printed with the words ``We
Apologize.''
	   ``We deeply regret the atrocities committed in the name of
Christ by our predecessors,'' the letter says.
	   Many Arabs regard the West, and the United States in particular,
as behind many of the troubles in the Middle East today. Britain
and France ruled much of the region between the world wars,
defining borders that are still controversial, and the United
States is seen as supporting Israel's occupation of Arab land.
	   The ``walk'' began in Cologne, Germany, in 1996, and aims to
retrace in stages the path of the First Crusade which invaded the
Middle East in the 11th century and captured Jerusalem,
slaughtering Muslims, Jews and Eastern Christians along the way.
	   Last year, some 1,000 people walked through Turkey and
apologized to individuals and religious leaders.
	   Next March, the project will restart in Israel for the final
walk to Jerusalem, which the group plans to reach on July 15, 1999,
the 900th anniversary of the fall of the Holy City to the
Crusaders.
	   In Beirut this week, the group met Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir,
patriarch of the Maronite Catholics, Lebanon's largest Christian
sect and one whose forefathers welcomed the Crusaders.
	   ``He blessed our efforts,'' said Hand.
	   Mayor Abdul-Munem Ariss, a Muslim, accepted the apology and
replied with a well-known Arabic saying: ``Admission of a mistake
is a virtue.''
	   ``I hope it causes other people to come and say sorry,'' Ariss
added.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A poisonous chemical was found from a carton of
liquid coffee bought in a store Wednesday, the latest in a string
of apparent attempted poisonings in Japan.
	   A 30-year-old man reported the coffee smelled of chemicals when
he poured the coffee into a cup, said a police official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   Police found a kind of postassium cyanide, but they will
investigate the chemical further. The man _ who was not identified
_ did not drink the coffy, the official said.
	   The incidents follow a string of poisonings that have killed
five people, starting in July with a mass poisoning at a community
festival where four people died after eating curry spiked with
arsenic.
	   A 58-year-old man died last week after drinking canned tea
poisoned with potassium cyanide. The tea had been bought at a
supermarket.

EU gives Italy week to rethink Malpensa Airport traffic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Italian minister in new 2nd graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BRU1-101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission gave Italy one
week Wednesday to craft a new airlines distribution plan for
Milan's soon-to-open Malpensa Airport saying current plans unfairly
favor Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
	   In Rome, Italian Transport Minister Claudio Burlando called the
one-week reprieve ``a very important step for reopening the
dialogue between the two sides. Now, an accord with the EU is much
closer.''
	   If Italy misses the Sept. 16 deadline, the European Commission
will reject its plans to allocate foreign carriers to Malpensa, 53
kilometers (33 miles) out of Milan and suffering from poor road and
rail links to the city due to construction delays.
	   Citing such inadequate access, nine European carriers have
complained about being moved to Malpensa from Linate Airport, 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Milan while Alitalia may stay there.
	   They fear passengers will inevitably opt for Alitalia's
hassle-free connection from Linate to its hub airport at Rome.
	   Other carriers say they cannot feed passengers from Malpensa,
which is due to open Oct. 25, to their hubs due to the poor
connection with Milan.
	   On Wednesday, the EU executive Commission unanimously agreed to
draw a line in the sand, telling Italy to rethink its Malpensa
plans. If it ignores the EU, Italy opens itself up to legal action
from Alitalia competitors and the European Commission.
	   Under EU law, EU governments can distribute air traffic as they
wish across several airports but ``without discrimination on
grounds of nationality or identity of the air carrier,'' said EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   ``It is my duty to uphold European law and, in this case, to
protect the competitive interests of European air carriers and
their passengers,'' he told a news conference.
	   In the afternoon, Kinnock met with Burlando, the Italian
transport minister, who flew here from Rome.
	   Kinnock said he will make sure conditions for all EU airlines to
be the same at Malpensa.
	   The heart of the problem lies with the criteria Italy used to
leave Alitalia at Linate. It said all routes with more than 2
million passengers a year will stay at Linate ``and all other
flights will operate out of Malpensa,'' Kinnock said.
	   He said the practical effect of that was that ``only flights
from Rome may operate from Linate'' and that means Alitalia.
	   The nine airlines that complained to the European Commission
about this back in February are: British Airways, Iberia, TAP,
Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic Airways, SAS and Austrian
airlines. KLM, the Dutch carrier which is an Alitalia code-sharing
partner, did not join the chorus of protesters.

Industrial fishing increasingly threatens fish, jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Industrial fishing fleets from wealthy
nations are endangering the world's fish stocks and pillaging the
supplies of developing nations, a report from an environmental
group said Wednesday.
	   The size and fishing capacity of vessels that seek their catch
in international waters or off the coast of a third country, has
increased fivefold over the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund
report said.
	   Unfortunately, ``there is a total lack of control of the
activities'' of the so-called distant water fleets, said Mike
Sutton director of the WWF's Endangered Seas Campaign.
	   At least 60 percent of the world's most valuable fish stocks are
either overfished or fished to the limit, the report said.
	   The activities of these fleets in third countries are sometimes
ruled by agreements, or they simply take place illegally, said
Sutton.
	   The United States and Japan account for over half of the world's
total catches by distant water fleets, followed by Spain.
	   In many cases, the victims of this industrial fishing are poor
or developing countries _ particularly in Africa _ with few
monitoring and enforcement capabilities, the WWF report says.
	   WWF spokesman Ezequiel Navio Vasseur cited an example in
Mauritania, where ``seven Dutch supertrawlers, giant floating fish
factories, have been dragging their mammoth nets behind them since
January.''
	   The ships haul in an average 3,500 tons of fish in less than a
month, he said. One catch by such a vessel is roughly equivalent to
the total catch of 23 local boats in the same period, he added.
	   The WWF says rich countries, including some of the 15 European
Union nations, are largely responsible for the overfishing, as they
support distant water fishing by heavily subsidizing the industry.
	   While global fish stocks consistently dropped, EU support to its
fishing industry rose from 175 million European currency units
(dlrs 192.5 million) to 875 million ecu (dlrs 962.5 million)
between 1985 and 1996.
	   Sutton urged countries to ratify a 1995 United Nations treaty
that sets the rules for distant water fishing. Thirty countries
must ratify the treaty for it to enter into force. So far, only 18
have done so.
	   Of the 20 top fishing nations in the world, only four have
ratified the treaty. These are the United States, Russia, Iceland
and Norway.

EU head office can see December nod for Malta membership talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission, expecting to
have Malta's reapplication for EU membership in a matter of days,
said Wednesday the green light for entry talks may come as soon as
mid-December.
	   ``We haven't received (the new application) yet but expect it in
the coming days,'' said EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan.
	   The EU agreed to membership talks with Malta in April, 1995.
However, the Labor government that came to power in October, 1996,
put the application on hold. Last Sunday, the conservative
Nationalist Party regained power saying it will pursue membership
anew.
	   Van der Laan said the EU must determine if it can simply pick up
where it left Malta in 1996.
	   She said if Malta _ population only 376,000 _ is found
economically and politically fit for membership, the European
Commission will recommend that to the EU leaders who meet in Vienna
Dec. 11-12. It would be up to them to approve the start of
negotiations.
	   EU figures put Malta's 1997 unemployment and inflation rates at
4 percent and 3 percent respectively. That compares favorably to
the EU but Malta's per capita annual income of dlrs 12,000 a year
makes it a poor EU neighbor.
	   ``We have to see how we can integrate Malta in the enlargement
process,'' said Van der Laan.
	   The EU is negotiating membership with 11 nations. The Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus are on a
fast-track, meaning they'll join in the next decade. Lithuania,
Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria may have to wait longer.
	   Van der Laan could not say if Malta would be a fast-tracker. One
problem looming ahead: Malta has no value added taxes, a source of
EU income in each member state.
	   If it joins the EU, Malta must adopt all EU legislation as its
own. In return, it will qualify for EU aid for such projects as
road building in support of tourism, Malta's number one source of
income.

Faction leader: Planned city rule could lead to renewed fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A faction leader in the Somali capital
Mogadishu on Wednesday warned rival factions were creating ``a new
dictatorship'' as they prepared to form the city's first government
in seven years.
	   Hussein Hajji Bod said the new plan could lead to renewed
fighting and accused Egypt of sponsoring the new administration.
	   The new municipal plan was agreed to in late July by north
Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, his main rival, Bod,
and Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto from south Mogadishu.
	   Bod and Atto later withdrew their support for the Mogadishu
agreement, which Aidid and Mahdi have begun to implement by
demobilizing their militiamen, searching for offices and raising
funds from local businesses.
	   Egpyt's role in the new administration is unclear, but in
December, Cairo sponsored peace talks that brought together 24
faction leaders who agreed to set up a transition government for
Somalia and hold a national reconciliation conference. The
conference has since been repeatedly postponed.
	   On Wednesday, Egypt's ambassador to Somalia, Mohamed Mustafa,
toured camps where militiamen loyal to Ali Mahdi and Aidid are
being demobilized.
	   ``It is unfortunate that Egypt is now siding with a new
dictatorship led by Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi,'' Bod told
reporters at his north Mogadishu home.
	   ``The Somalis prefer to sink back into a new round of civil war
rather than accepting unlawful dictatorship,'' he warned.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since late 1991, when
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by a coalition of
clan-based factions that later began fighting amongst themselves.
	   Under the municipal plan, a committee is to be nominated to
draft laws to govern the city, the separate currencies of north and
south Mogadishu are to be consolidated and the country's main air
and sea ports, closed since 1995, reopened.

	   ROME (AP) _ An earthquake shook the mountain towns of southern
Italy on Wednesday, killing a man in a cascade of falling rocks and
shaking buildings to the point of collapse.
	   Panicked residents fled into the streets in towns close to the
quake's epicenter, about 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of
Rome. The quake hit at midday, striking hardest between the towns
of Castelluccio Inferiore and Laino Borgo, where the regions of
Calabria and Basilicata meet.
	   A 24-year-old Italian who tried to get to safety by parking his
car and fleeing on foot died after he was hit by rocks shaken loose
from an adjacent cliff.
	   One woman broke her arm while she was fleeing her home and
another five people were hospitalized for shock.
	   Authorities said dozens of buildings had been damaged and some
appeared on the brink of collapse.
	   The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, according to the
National Institute of Geophysics.
	   A year ago, a series of earthquakes struck the central region of
Umbria, killing 10 people and damaging century-old churches and
artwork, including the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Disaster officials prepared Wednesday
to evacuate some 600,000 people on the outskirts of Dhaka, fearing
collapse of an embankment protecting Bangladesh's capital from
rising floodwaters.
	   Half the capital is already under knee-deep water. An influx of
people seeking shelter in its schools and government offices would
further strain Dhaka's resources.
	   Across Bangladesh, more than 800 people have been killed and 35
million displaced or marooned in flooding since monsoon rains began
July 10. Waterborne diseases continued to spread; so far hospitals
have reported 175,000 serious diarrhea cases. Diarrhea can lead to
fatal dehydration.
	   Authorities have not yet ordered an evacuation of the capital,
which seemed inevitable.
	   Hundreds of thousands of government workers and other residents
were stacking sandbags atop the strained Dhaka-Narayanganj
embankment. Soldiers patrolled the 35-kilometer (22-mile) earthen
embankment to spot breaches, and authorities appealed through the
loudspeakers of mosques for help plugging leaks.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center predicted the
embankment, built in 1952, could collapse Wednesday, which would
raise the water level in the capital by at least two feet (more
than half a meter).
	   It noted breaches at 36 points and river levels were rising,
putting further pressure on the earthen structure, which encircles
large areas south of Dhaka. Some people living near the embankment,
which holds back the Sitalakhoia River, were already fleeing their
homes.
	   Weather officials said the situation in and around Dhaka, a city
of 9 million, was reaching ``a serious proportion.''
	   An official at the Water Development Board, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that all major
highways connecting the capital with rest of the country were under
waters at different places.
	   This year's floods, which have lasted two months, are the
deadliest in a decade, in the impoverished nation of 120 million
people at the foot of the Himalayas.
	   The government Tuesday increased its request for foreign help to
dlrs 889 million from an earlier plea for dlrs 879 million,
including dlrs 112 million needed right away. Bangladesh has so far
received flood aid pledges totaling dlrs 104 million.
	   The U.N. World Food Program diverted a ship headed to Africa
with 15,000 tons of wheat to Bangladesh. The ship was expected to
reach Bangladesh next week, the government said Wednesday.

Serbian police, KLA guerrillas clash in northwest Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police battled independence-minded
Albanian militants at a gold and zinc mine Wednesday in a rare
instance of fighting in the Serbian province's northwest, while
thousands more refugees fled shelling in the southwest.
	   The Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia _
said fighting began after members of the Kosovo Liberation Army
attacked police and guards at the Stari Trg mine, about 30
kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, continuing shelling drove thousands more
people out of at least five villages being targeted by a heavy Serb
police and army offensive, according to a U.N. spokesman. At least
three civilians were killed in the region southwest of Pec,
Fernando del Mundo said.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which wayto go,'' said del Mundo, of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees. He estimated that as many as 25,000 had
fled in the previous 24 hours.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has been to the southwest
of Pristina, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up
to push KLA fighters out of their strongholds there. With the area
around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was possible that a
similar government offensive had been ordered in that region.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, said strong detonations could be heard
in Kosovska Mitrovica town, and at Podujevo, further east.
	   Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanians, most of them
supportive of the KLA's armed struggle for independence after
decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most of them ethnic Albanian _ have been
killed in the 6-month-old crackdown on the guerrillas and more than
265,000 others have been forced to flee their shelled and
burned-out villages.
	   The Serbs, for their part, also have accused the militants of
massacring Serb civilians.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegations, police for a second
day showed reporters and international observers bodies of some
alleged victims near the rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where they
claimed some 40 Serb civilians were executed.
	   Reporters on Wednesday saw at least eight badly decomposed
bodies lying twisted and partially buried in a silty ditch
alongside the concrete irrigation canal that waters cornfields near
Glodjane village.
	   Empty casings from Chinese-made Kalashnikov assault rifles and
9mm pistols lay scattered on the grass and among the raspberry
bushes a few meters (yards) from the bodies.
	   The bodies of four other victims whom police say were killed
about 10 days ago were swept downstream late Tuesday in torrential
rains.
	   Serb police Col. Dragulin Adamovic accused KLA soldiers of
executing prisoners one by one or in small groups since May as they
stood in or around the knee-deep canal. He told reporters he
believes most of the victims were Serbs, and said forensic teams
started Wednesday to try to identify the bodies.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo. They
claim the rebels kidnapped them.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to order a
stop to the offensive against Kosovo villages. Authorities say they
have no intention of ending the fight against the province's
``terrorists.''

Pierre Cardin plans fluorescent obelisk for Alexandria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six centuries after the celebrated Alexandria
lighthouse tumbled into the Mediterranean, Pierre Cardin is
unveiling a fluorescent obelisk meant to recall the lost seventh
wonder of the world.
	   Cardin's column of colored light _ concrete covered with
mirrored glass _ will rise 145 meters (435 feet) and cast beams 60
kilometers (34 miles) out to sea from the tip of a jetty
overlooking the Bay of Alexandria.
	   That's just a stone's throw from where the original lighthouse
stood before it was destroyed by two earthquakes in 1349.
	   ``It's a project that makes people dream about the past and the
future,'' Cardin told Associated Press Television.
	   Head of a worldwide empire of fashion, food and cosmetics,
Cardin, 76, is no stranger to grandiose projects.
	   He once staged a fashion show in Moscow's Red Square for 200,000
people, used the gardens of Beijing's Temple of Heaven as a
catwalk, and has opened boutiques in such far-flung places as
Vietnam and Latvia.
	   Cardin says approval of the 500-million franc (dlrs 86.2
million) obelisk came from Egyptian officials on Aug. 31 after
months of negotiation.
	   ``It's now a question of financing,'' he said.
	   The designer, who takes seriously his role as UNESCO peace
ambassador, was to travel to Lisbon on Thursday to present the
scale model _ about 1.3 meters tall (about four feet) _ at the
World's Fair. It will be displayed through Sept. 30.
	   The obelisk was designed by Jacques Darolles, a French lighting
engineer and director of France's National Center for Art and
Technology in Reims.
	   ``The column is a gift to Egypt, which gave us the obelisk
standing at the Place de la Concorde,'' Darolles said in an
interview, as hues of blue, green, red and pink pulsated up and
down the model column.
	   Some 16,500 computer-controlled lights inside will illuminate
the column. Powerful laser beams will pierce the darkness of the
sea before swinging back and around to light up Alexandria's
historical monuments.
	   Darolles said the obelisk will be built with special concrete
designed to withstand earthquakes and tidal waves.
	   Its facades will be inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphics and
Greek, Latin and Arabic letters. An archaeology research center and
cultural facility with an amphitheater also are planned for the
site.
	   In recent years, French underwater archaeologists have dredged
up huge chunks of granite from the giant statue of Ptolemy II,
which stood guard by the lighthouse until tremors sent both
toppling into the sea more than 600 years ago. The original
lighthouse dates to 281 B.C.
	   The real obelisk is expected to be completed by June 2000.
	   ``The lighthouse announces the Third Millennium the same way the
Eiffel Tower symbolized the beginning of the 20th century,'' Cardin
said.

Thousands fill Kinshasa's streets to welcome back Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Thousands of cheering Congolese residents
spilled into the streets Wednesday afternoon to welcome President
Laurent Kabila, newly returned from failed peace talks in Zimbabwe.
	   Stores closed throughout the capital and people shouting the
president's name thronged through the city waiting for Kabila's
motorcade to come in from the airport.
	   The peace talks, held in the Zimbabwean resort town of Victoria
Falls and attended by seven African presidents, failed after Kabila
refused to meet face-to-face with the rebels, who are trying to
oust him.
	   On Wednesday, Congolese officials said they would continue their
war against the rebels until Rwanda and Uganda pull their soldiers
from the fight.
	   ``Rwanda and Uganda should have been asked to withdraw so that
there could have been a start to the solution,'' said Justice
Minister Mwenze Kongolo, angrily dismissing the failed talks.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda, though, deny they have sent troops in
support of the rebels.
	   Warning of a humanitarian crisis in Kinshasa, Belgian officials
also said Wednesday they were ready to start airlifting food into
Kinshasa to boost dwindling stocks.
	   Belgium has sent a C-130 military transport plane to Pointe
Noire in neighboring Republic of Congo, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) west of Kinshasa, and the plane is ready to start
transporting 700 tons of food donated by the U.N. food agency to
the capital.
	   Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said food supplies were
increasingly scarce in Kinshasa, raising the threat of a
humanitarian crisis.
	   ``Sometimes I have the impression we are the only ones realizing
this,'' Derycke told Knack magazine Wednesday.
	   But the shipments from Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler,
have so far been held up by transportation and diplomatic
difficulties.
	   Congolese officials, meanwhile, said electricity would return
Wednesday evening to Kinshasa. While power has returned for some
parts of the city, much of the capital has been dark for weeks,
since rebels seized control of a key power plant.
	   In Zimbabwe, a rebel delegation stormed out of peace talks on
Tuesday, ending hopes for a cease-fire agreement that was expected
to be signed.
	   The summit was the third formal attempt at a peace deal since
the rebel insurrection began in early August, and the first time
rebels were invited.
	   But Kabila, who has refused to meet directly with his opponents,
snubbed them again, causing the delegation to walk out in anger.
	   After the rebels left, the seven heads of state said defense
ministers would meet Thursday at the Organization of African Unity
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to work out details of a
cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops and political reform
in Congo.
	   But Kongolo insisted that the war would continue despite those
talks unless Rwanda and Uganda _ both of which helped Kabila oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just last year _
withdraw their soldiers.
	   Soldiers from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened on
Kabila's behalf as the rebels appeared poised to capture Kinshasa
last month.

mission is open-ended and may be extended if progress is being made
toward a deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that an accord was not yet
within reach since Israel and the Palestinians still differ on key
issues, such as the scope of withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Ross arrived Wednesday and was to hold talks with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in the evening. On Thursday, Ross was to meet
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Toddler left behind during duty-free shopping spree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The empty seat revealed what the security
check, the short bus ride and the trip down the airplane aisle had
not: the toddler was missing!
	   An Israeli couple had forgotten their two-and-a-half-year-old
girl during a shopping spree last week at Ben Gurion International
Airport's duty free stores, Nachman Klieman, a spokesman for
Israel's El Al airlines, said Wednesday.
	   Only once the couple had boarded the plane, along with four
other children, did they realize they were one kid short.
	   The parents alerted a flight attendant who messaged a
description of the girl to the terminal. An El Al ground hostess
found the girl within 10 minutes, safe and asleep in her stroller,
in the same spot where her older brother, had left her to browse
through a shoe store.
	   The family was reunited in time to leave on schedule for its
holiday to Paris, that other shoppers' paradise.

Rival racing fans get married at Monza

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Chris Balfe and Gillian Spiers put aside
their auto racing rivalry on Wednesday and got married at Monza
Royal Villa, a few hundred yards from the autodrome where they will
be supporting rival sides on Sunday.
	   Balfe, an Englishman and a fan of Ferrari and its German driver
Michael Schumacher, wore a necktie with the symbol of the Italian
team _ a prancing stallion.
	   Spiers, his Scottish bride, did not wear any sign of her support
for David Coulthard, the Scotsman who drives with McLaren-Mercedes.
	   ``We argued following the Belgian GP collision between
Schumacher and Coulthard,'' Balfe said. ``She sided with Coulthard
of course.''
	   Schumacher, who was leading the race at the time, was forced to
withdraw after ramming into Coulthard's car during a rainstorm.
	   After the ceremony in the ancient villa, neighboring the park
where the autodrome is located, the couple left for a brief
honeymoon along the shores of Como lake.
	   They will be back to Monza on Sunday when Schumacher, Coulthard
and other F-1 drivers will be battling in the Italian Grand Prix.

Last Hong Kong governor says he won't be Tory leader now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong and
once regarded as a possible leader of Britain's Conservative Party,
said Wednesday he will not try for the job, hinting that at 54 he
is too old.
	   Patten, who returned last year, was still in Hong Kong when the
Conservatives lost power in May 1997 and elected a new leader,
William Hague who is on the center-right of the party.
	   ``I don't think I will be leader of the Conservative party.
William Hague is the leader. Not least, he's 17 years younger than
me and a more centrist figure in the party,'' Patten said in an
interveiw on Talk Radio.
	   Patten, who was on the left of the Tories, added that he is no
longer a party member and would have to ``think very hard'' before
rejoining.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ With the end of apartheid and the
lifting of trade sanctions, wine lovers worldwide are discovering
they like South Africa's wines, causing exports to rocket.
	   South African wine exporters posted a 35 percent increase in
bottled wine exports during the first five months of 1998.
	   From January to May, bottled white wine exports increased 22
percent while bottled red wine exports surged 55 percent
year-on-year, according to the South African Wine and Spirit
Exporters' Association.
	   ``If the honeymoon is over, then we can assume from these
figures that we are starting a good and adult relationship,'' said
SAWSEA chairman Graham de Villiers.
	   He said areas importing more South African wine include the
United States, Europe and Asia.
	   The increase in bulk wine exports, meanwhile, was slowing, de
Villiers said.
	   Wines exported in bulk and bottled overseas are usually cheaper,
higher volume wines. The industry had been trying to market bottled
wine in favor of bulk wine, which would boost international
perceptions of South Africa being a top quality wine producer, de
Villiers said.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The Nigerian-led West African
intervention force that helped bring stability to Liberia is moving
its regional base from that country to neighboring Sierra Leone,
the group's commander has said.
	   Gen. Timothy Shelpidi, who heads the force known as ECOMOG, told
state-owned radio Monday that the headquarters would be moved from
Monrovia, Liberia, to Freetown.
	   Earlier this year, ECOMOG ousted the Sierra Leonean junta and
returned the country's elected president to power. Intervention
force soldiers continue to battle junta supporters and their rebel
allies in the interior of the country.
	   Shelpidi did not give a reason for the move, but said it would
happen in the coming days.
	   ECOMOG, which was established by the Economic Community of West
African States, presided over Liberia's 1996 presidential elections
that ended seven years of civil war.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A pharmaceutical company said Wednesday it
will provide low-cost or free drugs to some Africans infected with
the AIDS virus.
	   F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., based in Basel, Switzerland, said the
program would be launched in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast and
Cameroon, and later be expanded to cover other countries in
sub-Saharan Africa.
	   Roche said it would donate drugs including three powerful
medications commonly used in state-of-the-art anti-HIV therapy in
Western countries.
	   The company did not specify how much it would subsidize or
donate.
	   Other drug companies announced during the 12th International
AIDS Conference in early July that they would cut prices on drugs
for HIV-infected
	   people in developing nations by up to 75 percent.
	   Even with massive price cuts, the highly expensive drugs _
estimated to cost dlrs 10,000 per person for a full treatment _ are
beyond the reach of many Africans.
	   The United Nations reported last year that in sub-Saharan
Africa, 7.4 percent of those aged 15 to 49 are infected with the
AIDS virus.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The son of Nobel laureate
Desmond Tutu appeared in court Wednesday to answer to a charge of
reckless driving.
	   Trevor Tutu, 42, has pleaded not guilty.
	   The son of the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission is charged in connection with a rush-hour traffic
accident in Johannesburg on Jan. 22 in which his BMW allegedly
smashed into a Toyota at an intersection.
	   Tutu sustained minor injuries and his car was badly damaged.
Three other cars were damaged and one other driver was slightly
injured.

Israeli official says bridge built on river slope despite warnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Contractors who built a temporary bridge
that collapsed last year, killing four Australian athletes, ignored
warnings not to build on the edge of the river, an official
testified Wednesday.
	   Dozens of athletes were plunged into the polluted Yarkon river
when the bridge broke in two on July 14, 1997 at the opening of the
Maccabiah games in Tel Aviv.
	   Five people, including the bridge contractors and engineer, are
on trial in the Tel Aviv District court on charges of criminal
negligence.
	   Yonatan Raz, an ecologist with the Yarkon River Authority, told
the court Wednesday that he had warned contractor Baruch Karagula
that the slopes of the river could not hold the bridge.
	   ``I was told by Baruch Karagula that the span of the bridge
would stand a meter (yard) away from the top of the slopes'' Raz
told the court, adding he ``raised an eyebrow'' when he inspected
the bridge before the event and found it resting on the slopes.
	   The ecologist said he also recommended that the number of people
allowed on the bridge at a time be limited.
	   According to a report by the Botan committee investigating the
collapse, 160 people were on the bridge at the time it buckled _
despite warnings from engineers that only 100 people be allowed on
at a time.
	   Morri Ben-Bessat, the head of the national building institute,
testified Wednesday that he had never heard of any complaints about
the contractors who built the bridge.
	   At least 50 witnesses have already been called by the
prosecution to testify at the trial that officials have said could
take as much as another year.

Japan files formal protest over North Korea's missile launch'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Japan-NKorea Missile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Japan filed a formal protest Wednesday
with the Security Council over North Korea's recent launch of an
apparent medium-range ballistic missile.
	   ``The government of Japan considers that this act of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea directly affects the security
of Japan and the peace and stability of the entire northeast Asian
region,'' according to a letter from Ambassador Hisashi Owada.
	   The letter to the Security Council president did not ask for any
specific action against North Korea, which is widely believed to
have fired a two-stage ballistic missile Aug. 31 from its eastern
coast.
	   North Korea has said it simply sent a scientific satellite into
orbit and accused Japan of overreacting.
	   In Tokyo, Akitaka Saiki, deputy press secretary to the Japanese
prime minister, said the letter was filed in hopes of calling a
formal meeting to condemn North Korea's action.
	   The Japanese government also filed a ``strong protest'' with
North Korea, but has yet to receive a response, according to the
letter.
	   The U.S. State Department said Tuesday it has not been able to
observe any orbiting object which correlates with data on a
satellite provided by North Koreans in public statements.
	   Japan's letter said the missile was launched without prior
warning ``in the vicinity of frequently used air space'' and
``landed in the vicinity of frequently used sea lanes.''
	   Meantime, Japan has stopped food aid, frozen its pledge to
contribute dlrs 1 billion to an international nuclear power plant
project in North Korea and halted charter flights between the two
nations.
	   Japan said North Korea's action ``raises a serious concern about
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
systems.''
	   Also, it has been widely reported that North Korea may secretly
be building a huge underground nuclear reactor complex.

Yugoslav airlines stops flying to some EU countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with JAT not flying to Sweden and Austria,
Germany criticizing Britain, deportations of Kosovo Albanians from
Germany affected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national airline
stopped flying Wednesday to Germany, Sweden and Austria after the
European Union suspended its landing rights.
	   Other EU member countries have yet to do so, and Yugoslav
Airlines (JAT) planes flew to Greece, Britain and some other EU
destinations Wednesday.
	   Britain on Tuesday announced that under a 1959 air services
agreement it is required to give 12 months' notice before canceling
flights. Italy banned JAT's charter flights to Bergamo and Trieste,
but has not yet suspended its regular flights to Rome, JAT's
information center said.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   Germany sharply criticized Britain on Wednesday for not adopting
the ban immediately. When one agrees to a decision, it is desirable
``that one also sticks with it,'' government spokesman Otto Hauser
said in Bonn.
	   German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said that
sanctions or reprisals like the flight ban supersede national law.
He said Britain risked being hauled before the European Court by
the EU commission.
	   In a separate development, German states said Wednesday they
have had to release dozens of Kosovo Albanians about to be deported
because of the flight cancellations.
	   JAT, banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo against
Yugoslavia for its involvement in the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo.
	   The Serbian government, while condemning the ban, has not
suggested reciprocal measures against foreign carriers flying to
Belgrade. But showing authorities' displeasure, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic canceled a meeting with the Belgian foreign
minister at the last moment Wednesday.
	   ``The EU decision irritates the Yugoslav authorities,'' said
Hubert Cooreman, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Erik Derycke who
was on an official visit to Serbia on Wednesday.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A piece of machinery at a BASF plant
in Ludwigshafen exploded Wednesday, killing a worker, a spokesman
for the chemical company said.
	   Authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion at a
fiber factory workshop.
	   Last month, two BASF employee died in an explosion at another of
BASF's 350 factories at its 7.5-square-kilometer (3-square-mile)
complex in Ludwigshafen, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of

basement of a plant that makes a form of polystyrene for insulation

responsible for an explosion late Tuesday of a hydrogen peroxide
tank at the Belgian-owned Solvay plant at Bad Hoenningen, near
Koblenz.

Mbeki leaves to present Lesotho election report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki left
on Wednesday for the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho to hand over
a report on possible fraud in recent elections.
	   Drawn up by a South African-sponsored committee, the report was
to be handed over to the government and opposition parties in
Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa.
	   Rev. Frank Chikane, director-general of Mbeki's office, declined
to discuss the report's findings, but told a news conference that
he hoped it would help calm the volatile situation in Lesotho,
whose capital Maseru has been wracked by unrest in recent weeks.
	   ``We are hoping that the leadership of Lesotho handles this
matter in a way that would actually stabilize the situation,'' he
said.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party have agreed to step down if
the report finds that the elections in May were seriously flawed.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties have regularly
protested outside the palace of King Letsie III the past month,
claiming the election was rigged in favor of the ruling party,
which won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.
	   Earlier this week, the United States warned American citizens
living in or traveling to Lesotho to use caution because of the
worsening political violence. The nation of 2 million that has long
been plagued by political upheaval.

U.S. Jewish group urges Germany to build Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAREN CARSTENS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A U.S. Jewish group urged the German government on
Wednesday to build its national Holocaust memorial, suggesting that
canceling the controversial project could send a negative message
about Germany's willingness to confront its Nazi past.
	   Bruce Raber, president of the Washington, D.C.-based American
Jewish Committee, said Germany should not underestimate the
symbolic importance of the memorial project.
	   ``We would be surprised and more than disappointed if a decision
was made not to build the monument,'' said Raber, whose group has
an office in Berlin.
	   The project, first proposed in 1988, has been repeatedly delayed
by debate over what it should look like, who should be remembered
and where it should be built. Some also question whether the
killing of 6 million Jews can ever be expressed through art, and
have proposed instead that more be done to preserve Germany's
decaying concentration camps or to support research.
	   German politicians agreed three weeks ago to postpone a decision
on the project until after national elections on Sept. 27, fearful
that the sensitive issue would become central to the political
campaign.
	   While Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pushed for the project, his
rival, Gerhard Schroeder, has questioned the wisdom of building the
memorial.
	   Raber called for the new government to decide on the memorial
immediately after the election. He applauded the postponement,
calling the memorial ``too important'' and the ``historical
consequences far too great'' for it to be cast as a subject of
partisan politics.
	   The private group that launched the memorial project, led by TV
journalist Lea Rosh, made a similar appeal in a Berlin press
conference Wednesday. Rosh also reiterated demands that the
memorial be built on a site designated by Kohl, near the
Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin.
	   Kohl favors a design for the memorial by U.S. architect Peter
Eisenman _ a labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a cemetery. The
design was one of four finalists from a competition organized by
Rosh's group.

Tribunal asks Security Council to ensure cooperation from Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Calling Yugoslavia a safe haven
for war crimes suspects, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Wednesday
asked the Security Council to ensure Belgrade authorities cooperate
with the U.N. court.
	   Yugoslavia has, for three years, been harboring three army
officers charged by the tribunal with planning and carrying out a
1991 massacre of 200 non-Serbs near the Croatian city of Vukovar.
	   The three Yugoslav National Army officers _ Mile Mrksic,
Miroslav Radic and Veselin Slijvancanin _ all are believed to be in
Yugoslavia despite international arrest warrants issued nearly
three years ago.
	   ``Not only does the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)
consider itself to be outside international law, it has become a
haven for fugitives from international law,'' Judge Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald of the United States, the tribunal's president, wrote to
the Security Council.
	   The three-page letter concluded: ``I respectfully submit that it
is imperative that the reprehensible conduct of the government of
the FRY ... should no longer be tolerated.''
	   The 11-judge court appears particularly frustrated at a recent
Security Council resolution calling on Libya to turn over for trial
two of its citizens charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The resolution offered to drop sanctions if Libya complies, but
also threatened further action if the suspects fail to appear for
trial before a specially-convened court in The Hague.
	   ``This resolution stands in stark contrast with the lack of
action by the Council regarding a case which offers much similarity
to the Lockerbie case,'' Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour wrote in a
separate letter asking McDonald to remind the Security Council of
Belgrade's noncompliance.
	   At a press conference announcing that the letter had been sent,
Arbour said the tribunal would not be suggesting ways of forcing
Belgrade's hand.
	   But she added: ``It would be, to say the least, extremely
disappointing not to see a positive response to this initiative.''
	   Arbour added that sending a strong message to Belgrade now could
prevent possible atrocities by forces involved in the raging
conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo by demonstrating
``unambiguously that indicted persons will indeed be brought to
justice in The Hague.''
	   Although the tribunal is investigating the Kosovo conflict, in
which Yugoslav forces are battling separatist ethnic Albanian
rebels, no indictments have yet been issued.
	   Authorities at the Hague tribunal also fear that Yugoslavia's
consistent refusal to send the so-called ``Vukovar three'' for
trial also undermines the court's credibility.
	   ``It sets an example that one state can basically thumb its nose
at the tribunal,'' Kirk McDonald said.
	   Muslim, Croat and, to a lesser extent, Bosnian Serb authorities,
all have boosted cooperation with the tribunal over the last two
years, leaving Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, alone
in its defiance.
	   Established by the Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
publicly indicted 58 suspects and has 25 in custody. The vast
majority of suspects still at large are ethnic Serbs living in
Bosnia.
	   Its two most notorious suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic,
are both still at large despite international warrants for their
arrests on genocide charges.

Volvo to close plant in Halifax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker Volvo announced
Wednesday that it would close its final-assembly plant in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, in December.
	   About 200 people work at the plant, which began operations in
1963 and now does final assembly on the V70 and S70 models.
	   ``Our analysis has determined that it is not economically viable
to produce cars for the Canadian mrket in Halifax as we expand our
product line,'' Volvo's senior vice president for manufacturing
Curt Germundsson said in a prepared statement.
	   The Halifax plant is to cease operation on Dec. 18.

Bombay director tackles Tudor England
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ With a director from Bombay and an
Australian star, ``Elizabeth,'' the story of the early years of the
great Tudor monarch, might be called the ``revenge of the
colonies.''
	   The producers _ the same team that made the hits ``Four Weddings
and a Funeral,'' ``Fargo'' and ``Dead Man Walking'' _ said they
wanted to give the story a modern feel.
	   So they turned to an outsider, someone unencumbered with the
historical baggage that might have weighed down a British director.
	   ``We didn't want to make an ordinary, historical ``frock
flick','' said Ted Bevan, co-chairman of Working Title Films.
	   Bombay director Skekhar Kapur, who Bevan said ``loves chaos and
fantasy,'' was their man.
	   ``They were looking for an ignorant, chaotic director,'' Kapur
joked before ``Elizabeth'' premiered Tuesday night to a standing
ovation at the Venice Film Festival.
	   The festival boasts a number of world premieres this year,
including Woody Allen's new movie, ``Celebrity,'' on Thursday and
Abel Ferrara's ``New Rose Hotel'' on Wednesday.
	   Kapur hit the world cinema scene with a splash in 1994 with the
Hindi-language film, ``The Bandit Queen,'' the true story of
Phoolan Devi, an Indian Robin Hood who turns to crime after her
lover was killed and she was repeatedly raped by upper-caste men.
	   Like Devi, Elizabeth I had ``enormous self-preservation
instincts,'' Kapur said.
	   The daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, she took the throne
is 1554 at 21 and survived conspiracies and coup attempts to rule
for decades over what became known as England's Golden Age.
	   The movie tracks the early years of her reign as she evolves
from a girl into an iron-willed monarch who put aside her personal
desires to transform herself into an icon: The Virgin Queen.
	   Elizabeth is played by Australian actress Cate Blanchett, whose
fragile, translucent beauty lights up the screen. Blanchett said
she immersed herself in research on Elizabeth to prepare for the
role, reading hundreds of the legendary monarch's letters.
	   Kapur said Blanchett kept him from veering too far off the track
into fantasy.
	   ``I would go on telling the story I wanted to tell, knowing full
well that she would fight me all the time,'' he said.
	   The movie they ended up with is a tightly plotted, gorgeously
filmed tale of love, conspiracy and self-invention. It has a solid
supporting cast, including Geoffrey Rush, who won an Academy Award
for best actor in 1997 for ``Shine,'' and veterans like Sir Richard
Attenborough and Fannie Ardant.
	   The Elizabeth portrayed in the film is, by the way, no virgin.
She has a passionate affair with a childhood sweetheart, whose
eventual betrayal helps her decide to ``marry'' her throne instead
of a man.
	   Kapur and Blanchett said they had no qualms about challenging
historical assumptions about Elizabeth's virginity.
	   ``Her virginity was a political statement, not necessarily a
physical fact,'' Kapur said. ``History is interpretation. And this
is ours.''

FIFA issues warning in wake of Murdoch buyout of Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Manchester United-Murdoch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Amid the controversy over media
tycoon Rupert Murdoch's billion-dollar buyout of Manchester United,
soccer's world governing body FIFA warned Wednesday that
multi-ownership of soccer clubs by big business won't be tolerated.
	   Ownership of more than one team by the same organization could
give grounds for suspicion of a ``hidden agenda'' in the outcome of
matches, said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper.
	   ``Every effort must be made to exclude that possibility,''
Cooper said. ``If you endanger the integrity of the game as it is
played, then the whole thing collapses. The higher the stakes, the
greater the temptation for certain other influences to come into
play.''
	   In an editorial due to appear in September's edition of FIFA's
newsletter FIFA News, the body's acting general secretary Michel
Zen-Ruffinen recalled its recent adoption of a new rule preventing
commercial companies owning or controlling more than one club in
the same country. Clubs must adhere to FIFA rules in order to have
their affiliation to FIFA approved.
	   Financial interests taking a stronger hold of soccer have
weakened the traditional ideals on which the game has been based,
Zen-Ruffinen said.
	   ``By limiting the control of financially strong third parties to
only one club in the same country, any fear of conflicting
interests resulting in match manipulation will be dispelled.''
	   Earlier Wednesday, Manchester United, among the world's
wealthiest soccer clubs, said its board has accepted a record 623.4
million pound (dlrs 1 billion) buyout offer from Murdoch's BSkyB
satellite television company.
	   Cooper refused to comment on the deal, saying it was the club's
affair. But he said FIFA now fears the involvement of major media
organizations in big soccer clubs could be ``dangerous.''
	   Concern has been heightened by Milan-based Media Partners' plans
to begin operating a breakaway Europe-wide Super League by 2000.
The league may include many of the continent's most famous clubs.

Italy ready to mediate among Libya, U.S. and Britain over suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italy is ready to mediate among Libya, the
United States and Britain to help bring about the trial of two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Wednesday.
	   Italy, which enjoys relatively good relations with Libya, ``is
ready to cooperate with Libya and establish a dialogue with the
British and American authorities,'' Dini said.
	   The United Nations imposed an air embargo in 1992 after Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi refused to hand over the two men suspected
in the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The United States and Britain recently reversed long-standing
demands that the two men be tried only in their countries and urged
a trial before Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya has said it accepts the offer but wants guarantees to
ensure the safety of the two men. In the past, it urged a trial in
a third country, arguing the two suspects could not get a fair
trial in the United States or Britain.
	   But Gadhafi said Saturday that Libya did not recognize the
agreement between Britain and the Netherlands to stage the trial
nor the U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing it.
	   The U.N. resolution calls for lifting trade sanctions once the
suspects are transferred to the Netherlands.
	   Dini, who arrived in Egypt on Tuesday, called Libya an important
country that should not be treated as a pariah.
	   Libya ``must be returned to the international community,'' he
said at a news conference with his Egyptian counterpart, Amr
Moussa.
	   In a speech later in the day, Dini reiterated the point, saying
that Italy ``has constantly pursued a policy so that the countries
being kept on the sidelines of the international community can be
brought back in on reasonable terms.''
	   Italy, which depends on Libyan oil and gas, signed an agreement
in July with Libya on fighting terrorism and other measures.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Even in the world's wealthiest
countries, the ranks of the poor are growing and many are being
denied the basic rewards of affluence _ getting a job, learning to
read and living longer _ a U.N. report revealed Wednesday.
	   Poor people living in leading industrialized countries such as
the United States and Britain suffer from ``multiple deprivation''
of basic human needs, the Human Development Report said.
	   Researchers with the United Nations Development Program examined
income, education, life expectancy and health care in assessing the
quality of life in 174 countries.
	   Among their findings: 16.5 percent of Americans live in poverty
despite the fact that the United States leads the world in
per-capita consumption of goods and services.
	   In Ireland, 15.2 percent of people struggle in poverty; Britain
follows closely with 15 percent. Sweden was ranked the best among
developed nations in spreading the wealth, with fewer than 7
percent of its citizens living in poverty.
	   Worldwide, the richest nations are home to more than 100 million
people who live in poverty, the report said, describing the number
of those barely getting by as ``shockingly high.'' In the
industrialized world, it said, at least 37 million people are
unemployed, 100 million are homeless and nearly 200 million have a
life expectancy of less than 60 years.
	   Their plight is worsened by economic crises like the one now
raging in Asia, said Richard Jolly of Britain, chief author of the
228-page report.
	   ``The world, in economic terms, is in a perilous situation at
the moment,'' he said. ``We need to emphasize the human development
possibilities, not just the financial recovery priorities.''
	   This year's report again included the UNDP's ``human development
index'' ranking 174 countries according to their progress in
improving life expectancy, education and income.
	   For the fifth consecutive year, Canada topped the human
development index for enabling the ``average person'' to enjoy a
decent standard of living, followed by France, Norway, the United
States and Iceland.
	   Five African countries _ Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and
Sierra Leone _ rounded off the bottom of that list.
	   Worldwide, in nations rich and poor, runaway consumption of good
and services _ expected to top dlrs 24 trillion this year _ is
leaving those in poverty farther behind, the report said.
	   Despite the global boom in available goods, the poor still lack
the most basic items needed for survival, it said. The report
stopped short of condemning consumption, and Jolly even described
it as ``the lifeblood of human progress.''
	   Researchers, however, warned that it is the poor who bear the
brunt of the environmental damage as the rich get richer _ and
spend more. The poor, they said, are the ones who generally live
closest to smoke-spewing factories, busy roads and waste dumps.
	   ``Though the rich create most of the damage, the poorest in the
world suffer most of the consequences,'' Jolly said.
	   The report offered this message of hope: Third World countries
avoid the earlier mistakes of industrialization by ``leapfrogging''
to cheaper and cleaner technology.
	   It also noted that despite alarming setbacks in some countries,
every region of the world has made at least some gains in human
development over the past 30 years.
	   Since 1960, infant mortality rates in developing nations have
decreased by more than half, child malnutrition has declined by 25
percent and school enrollment has more than doubled, the report
said.

Israel says it's trying for peace, Egypt is skeptical
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 14th graf with Hariri's comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli official said Wednesday that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing his best to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, but Egyptian officials were
skeptical any progress has been achieved.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh spoke after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled peace process, saying Israel
wants to restart full negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Naveh read a statement saying Netanyahu was ``doing his best to
reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.''
	   ``We have a desire, from our side, to return to negotiations
with the Palestinians until we reach an agreement,'' Naveh said.
	   He refused to answer reporters' questions about the status of
negotiations, but said Netanyahu had sent him to Egypt to inform
Mubarak of the latest developments between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Naveh's visit came hours before U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to
arrive in the region for talks with Arafat and Netanyahu about a
reported American plan to restart talks by having Israeli troops to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which calls for them to
step up efforts to curb attacks on Israel, but Netanyahu's
government has so far refused to go along with the plan.
	   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, who attended
Wednesday's meeting along with Israel's ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel, told reporters that ``the situation, until now, does not
show that tangible progress has been made.''
	   He added that Mubarak believes failure to reach an agreement
will lead to tension and instability in the region ``and this is
not in the interest of any side, including Egypt.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed skepticism
about any progress Tuesday, describing the Middle East peace
process as frozen.
	   ``According to what we are hearing and reading, there is little
hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa told
reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen after
Ross arrives.''
	   Later in the day, Mubarak held talks with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
	   The talks with Dini concentrated on the Middle East peace
process as well as security in the Mediterranean, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
	   MENA also quoted Hariri as saying his talks with Mubarak were
mainly on the Mideast peace process.

Russian ruble rebounds steeply against U.S. dollar

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's battered ruble rebounded steeply against
the U.S. dollar on Wednesday amid an apparent shortage of the local
currency.
	   The dollar for next-day delivery was trading between 15 and 16
rubles at the central Moscow interbank exchange, down from 20 to 25
rubles at the start of the session and way below Tuesday's Central
Bank rate of 20.8.
	   There were ``more sellers of dollars than buyers'' on the
exchange's electronic system, said Dmitri Panteta, a trader at
International Moscow Bank.
	   While some Moscow traders did not rule out that the ruble's
gains could be caused by a Central Bank intervention, most said
that commercial banks apparently were selling dollars to obtain
rubles for client transactions.
	   Ruble supplies at Russian banks have dropped recently when most
rushed to invest in dollars or other foreign currencies, spooked by
the ruble's fall in the aftermath of the treasury market collapse
in August.
	   One major commercial bank, Oneximbank, on Wednesday called on
private clients to convert their ruble accounts to dollar deposit
accounts under favorable conditions.
	   Many street exchange points around Moscow appeared to have run
out of rubles and the exchange rate varied wildly, from a low of 12
rubles to the dollar to 18 or so.
	   Russian government officials, who on Tuesday attacked the
ruble's low rate as unrealistic, praised the currency's gains
Wednesday.
	   A rate above 20 rubles to the dollar had a ``considerable
speculative component'' and was largely due to psychological
factors, said government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   He also called on stores and wholesalers to lower the prices for
goods and food correspondingly. The State Statistics Committee
released figures Wednesday showing that consumer prices rose 35.7
percent in the first week of September, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Although prices remained high on Wednesday, Moscow stores were
restocking shelves and people seemed less worried about food
shortages.
	   Customs officials said Wednesday that economic turmoil has
halted about 300,000 tons of goods that were awaiting clearance at
customs warehouses, including 48,000 tons of foodstuffs in Moscow
region alone.
	   But imports in August were 32 percent down from July, deputy
customs committee chairman Oleg Svirodov said, according to
Interfax.

	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police scuffled with protesters
and fired warning shots Wednesday when about 4,000 students staged
one of the biggest protests so far against Indonesia's president
over skyrocketing food prices.
	   Students from several universities, along with supporters of a
prominent opposition figure, gathered outside a government office
where President B.J. Habibie was staying during his visit to the
nation's second-largest city, Surabaya.
	   Hundreds of security forces in riot gear split the protesters
into two groups, while armored vehicles waited nearby. There were
no confirmed reports of injuries, although some witnesses said
members of the crowd had thrown rocks at passing vehicles.
	   Wednesday's protest came a day after police and troops used
sticks, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of students from the
grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta. Two students
underwent surgery after they were allegedly stabbed by bayonets.
	   The protests flared after Habibie officiated at a ceremony in a
sports stadium in Surabaya to mark national sports day. He warned
that the economic crisis is threatening national unity and appealed
for calm.
	   ``In dealing with these heavy challenges, I would like to call
on all people to remain patient and to keep clear minds,'' he said
in a speech.
	   Social unrest has wracked Indonesia since last year when it
entered its worst economic crisis in three decades. In recent
weeks, protests, looting and riots have hit several cities and
towns as criticism of Habibie's presidency mounts.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and protests forced
authoritarian President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
Although Habibie has said he has done much to attack corruption and
nepotism, there has been growing discontent as prices for basic
food and other commodities soar and unemployment climbs.
	   On Wednesday, the demonstrators chanted antigovernment slogans
and waved red and white Indonesian flags outside the East Java
governor's office, where Habibie was staying.
	   ``We don't want Habibie. We want lower food prices'' read one
banner.
	   Witnesses said riot police fired two or three shots into the air
to disperse a protesting crowd in one city street.
	   Habibie left the office after several hours, and his heavily
guarded motorcade went immediately to Surabaya airport, where he
boarded a jet to Jakarta, 400 miles (650 kilometers) to the west.
	   After Habibie's departure, thousands of protesters pushed
through a line of troops and demonstrated on the steps of the
white-pillared governor's office.
	   Earlier witnesses said security personnel had beaten and
arrested several protesters. Police, however, reported no arrests.

Manchester United: Big club, small beginnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United, the biggest and most profitable
soccer club in the world, now has the world's biggest price tag to
go with it.
	   The club grew out of the industrial heartland of England and
over 120 years has spread its influence around the world, boasting
100 million supporters spanning every continent.
	   The team's on-field success, with 11 league championships, a
European Cup and nine FA Cup titles, has played a major role in its
global appeal.
	   But as the most popular club in the world, with a ready-made
audience of dedicated fans, Manchester United has become an obvious
target for a man with one of the world's biggest media empires.
	   The 625 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) take-over by Rupert
Murdoch's satellite television company BSkyB has created a storm of
controversy among loyal fans.
	   Manchester United is the most followed club in Britain, arguably
the world, but it was out of adversity that the club built its
support in the 1960s.
	   The team's universal appeal sprouted from its fightback from
disaster after the Munich air tragedy in 1958, a time when
television was in its infancy.
	   The club earned international admiration when manager Matt Busby
and his ``Busby Babes'' became the stars of European soccer.
	   Busby recruited a team of young players to fill the void of the
eight players killed in the crash on a snowbound Munich airport.
	   The Red Devils had been champions in 1956 and 1957 but fell into
a slump in the wake of the disaster. And when Busby's Babes emerged
in the 1960s, it seemed the whole world wanted them to win.
	   Soccer legends Bobby Charlton and George Best were at the
forefront of the attacking flair which became the trademark of
Busby's Babes, the first English team to win the European Cup in
1968.
	   Under current manager Alex Ferguson, the club has dominated the
English championship in the 1990s, winning the Premier League title
four of the past six seasons. Players like Eric Cantona have been
superceded by rising stars like David Beckham as the club maintains
its place at the top season after season.
	   Last season the Old Trafford club made a 27.6 million pound
(dlrs 45.3 million) profit. The bulk of profit was earned through
the turnstyles and the sale of merchandise and the club is on the
brink of launching its own television station.
	   United has also been a mover in the Premier League's increasing
popularity. The league has become the richest domestic league in
the world and this, in turn, has created record sponsorship and
transfers in the game.
	   Manchester United has 140,000 official members world-wide and
40,000 season-ticket holders. Old Trafford is packed with 55,000
for almost every game.
	   There are 200 official fan clubs in 24 countries, 17,000
unofficial internet websites devoted to Manchester United, and the
official club magazine has a paid circulation of almost 118,000 in
30 countries.
	   The club did have a history of being bailed out of dire
financial strife by wealthy benefactors but the current take-over
by Murdoch did not entirely fit with tradition.
	   In 1902, wealthy businessman John Davies saved the original
club, Newtown Heath, from bankruptcy and transformed it into a
public company. Folklore says Davies found a St. Bernard dog, owned
by the team captain, wandering the street with a donation box tied
to its collar.
	   Newtown Heath Cricket and Football Club was formed by Lancashire
and Yorkshire railway workers in 1878. It won its first trophy, the
Manchester Cup, in 1886 and was admitted to the national league in
1892.
	   But when Davis became chairman in 1902, he paid off the club
debts, changed the name to Manchester United, instituted the new
red and white colors and embarked on building new grounds at Old
Trafford.
	   The club moved into Old Trafford in 1910 and prospered until
Davies died in the 1920s. However, Manchester United fell into
decline and nearly went broke again before it was rescued by
another local businessman, James Gibson, in the 1930s.
	   When Matt Busby joined as manager at the end of World War II,
the club's performance rose to unprecedented levels on and off the
field.
	   During Busby's period at the helm, Louis Edwards, father of
Martin Edwards, bought the club. Martin Edwards took over as
chairman in 1980 after his father died.
	   Robert Maxwell and Michael Knighton made unsuccessful bids for
the club in the 1980s, Knighton just failing with a 10 million
pound (dlrs 16.5 million) bid in 1989. Manchester United was
floated on the stock market in 1991 for 47 million pounds (dlrs
77.55 million).
	   Last Friday, at the close of markets, the club was valued at 413
million pounds (dlrs 685.5 million).
	   On Monday BSkyB confirmed its bid for 575 million pounds (dlrs
685.5 million) and Tuesday night the Manchester United board
accepted a price of 625 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion).

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ On March 2, 1921, in a cloud of dust, King
Abdullah arrived in Jordan on his horse from present-day Saudi
Arabia to find descendants from Russia's Caucasus mountains.
	   The community greeted him and paid loyalty to his new kingdom.
	   Three generations later, Abdullah's great-grandson, Prince Ali,
got on his horse Wednesday to lead another group of Circassians on
a 45-day horseback trek through Syria, Turkey, former Soviet
republics in the Caucasus and then to Russia.
	   The tour is meant to cast light on the Circassians' heritage and
pay tribute to the minority's devotion to Jordan's throne.
	   ``The trip is for a worthwhile cause,'' said the 23-year-old
Ali, King Hussein's son from his third marriage to Palestinian-born
Alia Touqan, who was killed in a helicopter crash in 1977.
	   ``We want the world to know about such unique people with rich
and ancient culture and background, but whose identity appears to
have been forgotten,'' the prince said.
	   Ali left his father's hilltop palace in downtown Amman on a gray
Arabian horse, seated on a red saddle.
	   He was followed by 10 other Circassian leaders riding black and
brown horses and carrying Jordanian flags. The group was expected
to cross the Syrian border late Wednesday evening.
	   Jordanians lined the streets of downtown Amman to greet the
prince, who wore a thick black Russian hat and the traditional
white Circassian robe. Swords and knives hung from his waist.
	   The Circassians lived between the Black Sea, the Kuban River and
the Caucasus in what is now southwestern Russia. They fought the
czar in the 19th-century Russo-Turkish war.
	   About 400,000 fled to Turkey and later came to Jordan and Syria
after Russia conquered their homeland.
	   Today, more than 4 million Circassians live outside the
Caucasus, mostly in Turkey, making them one of the world's largest
diasporas.
	   In Jordan, the Circassian community is estimated at 70,000 of
Jordan's 3.8 million people.
	   Its loyalty to Abdullah _ King Hussein's grandfather and founder
of Jordan _ has paid off. Circassians hold senior posts in the
government and army. King Hussein has entrusted them with his life,
filling his elite palace guard with Circassian soldiers.
	   Majida Mufti, a Circassian, said Ali ``would shed the light
again to the plight of a silent minority which all that what it
wants is self-determination'' in Russia.
	   ``Now that the cold war is over, it is possible for us to
express this wish,'' added Mufti, the daughter of Jordan's late
prime minister, Saed, who led Jordan's 2,000-strong community in
1921 to welcome Abdullah.

Leaders in Russian Far East set price controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Leaders in Russia's eastern Primorsky
region imposed price controls on an array staple foods Wednesday to
try and preserve residents' buying power as the ruble crumbles.
	   Primorye Vice Gov. Valentin Dubinin signed a decree establishing
a detailed index of price limits, which will affect local
enterprises, as well as domestic and foreign companies importing
goods into the region.
	   ``There isn't order in the country,'' Dubinin said during
meetings with regional officials in Vladivostok, about 6,400
kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow. ``We don't even know who's
at the country's head, for God's sake.''
	   He said the region would also take aggressive measures to crack
down on unlicensed street-traders and so-called ``spekulyanty,'' or
traders who sharply mark up retail prices on goods.
	   Other regions across Russia have taken similar steps as the
nation's economic crisis has kicked off massive price increases
even on the most basic goods, like sugar and flour.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees, many apparently from Kosovo,
are waiting near the Czech border for a shot at slipping undetected
into Germany, border patrol officials said Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, German officials said dozens of Kosovo Albanians in
custody and and about to be deported would have to be released
instead because of the European Union's decision to deny landing
rights to the Yugoslav airline.
	   Fighting in the southern Serbian province has forced more than
200,000 people from their homes this summer, and Germany is afraid
many of them will head north to join family or friends.
	   German officials are already seeking to deport some 140,000
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo who are here illegally.
	   But those deportations were effectively halted by the EU's
flight ban on the Yugoslav airline, JAT, which Germany began
enforcing Tuesday. Germany is bound by treaty with Belgrade to use
JAT for such repatriations.
	   ``If JAT has no landing rights, there are no more deportations
possible,'' said Michael Ziegler, spokesman for the Bavarian
Interior Ministry.
	   Steffen Claussner, of the German border patrol office in Pirna,
said there were signs that a growing number of people from Kosovo
were headed toward Germany by land.
	   ``We know from our Czech colleagues that the relevant pensions
and hotels (in border towns) are completely full,'' he told the
Saechsische Zeitung. All were waiting to ``make the jump to
Germany,'' often with the help of smugglers, he added.
	   Germany has spent more than any other European land _ some 20
billion marks (dlrs 11.2 billion) _ since 1991 caring for 450,000
war refugees, mostly from Bosnia.

Jewish emigration from Russia may increase during crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The number of Jews looking to emigrate from Russia
to Israel is likely to increase because of Russia's continuing
economic crisis, a leader of Russia's Jewish community said
Wednesday.
	   ``The process of emigration, involving not only Jews but other
nationalities, is a direct consequence of the situation inside
Russia,'' Alexander Osovtsov, the executive vice president of
Russia's Jewish Congress, told the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The better off the country, the fewer people wish to leave it.
The worse off the country, the more people wish to do so,'' he
said.
	   If the economic crisis continues, the flow of immigrants from
Russia and other former Soviet republics into Israel could swell
from about 50,000 a year to 80,000 or even 120,000, Israeli
immigration officials have said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Anger soared Wednesday against
Cambodian strongman Hun Sen after riot police shot Buddhist monks
and used clubs, guns and water cannons to scatter rock-throwing
demonstrators demanding his ouster.
	   Defiant opposition leaders vowed to intensify mass protests now
in their third day and showed no readiness to compromise with Hun
Sen over his disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26
they say he won by massive fraud.
	   About 1,000 protesters were dispersed in morning clashes near
the U.S. Embassy and nearby residence of opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, a new focal point of discontent since riot
police smashed a protest camp Tuesday at the National Assembly.
	   Human rights workers reported a Buddhist monk was killed by
gunfire in the Wednesday morning clash. At least one other monk was
wounded and others were beaten and pounded by a water cannon. The
death could not be confirmed despite an exhaustive search of
morgues and hospitals.
	   But on the streets people believed several monks had been
killed, stoking anger against Hun Sen. They erected shrines where
the monks were shot, burning incense and piling up the monks'
broken parasols.
	   An interior ministry statement read over the radio Wednesday
night denied that any demonstrators had been killed or injured,
aside from one man who died Monday night under what it said were
unclear circumstances. It blamed foreign news organizations for
fabricating news of the monk's death.
	   Despite extensive video and photographic evidence to the
contrary, it said that the crackdowns Tuesday and Wednesday had
been peaceful.
	   Leaflets circulated in the name of a monks organization urging
people to rise up and overthrow Hun Sen. Many people expressed hope
the United States would help drive him from power.
	   ``People are sorrowful and angry,'' said Lem Tong, 34, a
businessman. ``Monks are holy people. Hun Sen will keep killing
people if he can. We want to overthrow this dictator.''
	   Scattered hit-and-run demonstrations were broken up by police.
In the late afternoon, thousands returned to the embassy
neighborhood and stayed into early evening, anticipating a police
assault at any time. Most left when a monsoon storm threatened.
	   Earlier, Ranariddh told supporters that Hun Sen sparked a ``real
revolution'' by sending police Tuesday to destroy the protest camp
known as Democracy Square, where an unprecedented 16-day vigil had
been mounted against his rule.
	   An angry Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy applied for
permission to hold a peaceful mass rally Sunday.
	   ``It is in the interests of this government to authorize a
peaceful demonstration, rather than letting what is happening now
to continue,'' the prince said.
	   Such rallies have drawn as many as 20,000 people. One now could
provoke more violence as Hun Sen moves to reassert the power he has
held for 13 years.
	   The violence is the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago.
	   Hun Sen drew a tougher line following a grenade attack Monday
against his home. He was not present and no one was hurt. Hun Sen
has denied opposition allegations that he staged the attack as a
pretext.
	   Sam Rainsy sought refuge in the local U.N. offices after Hun Sen
ordered his arrest. The order has been rescinded, but his
supporters doubt Hun Sen's intentions.
	   Sam Rainsy emerged from the offices, with a U.N. escort, to meet
Ranariddh on Wednesday. He called the violence ``unacceptable'' and
the allegations he was behind the grenade attack ``ridiculous.''
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N. representative, was traveling to the
northern city of Siem Reap to enlist the help of King Norodom
Sihanouk, the prince's father, to defuse the crisis.
	   The prince said the violence was deepening, not resolving, the
deadlock resulting from the elections. The opposition has
threatened to withhold support Hun Sen needs for a two-thirds
majority in the National Assembly to form a new government.
	   In the morning protest, police fired warning shots to scatter
protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, and charged. APTV
cameraman Jerry Harmer was struck in the head by a rock and
required 10 stitches. Several other people were injured.
	   Human-rights workers said at least six people were arrested.
	   ``The cleanup is going to continue,'' government spokesman Khieu
Kanharith declared. ``If the opposition is willing to carry on the
demonstrations, they will be held responsible before the law.''
	   About 120 people driven out of Democracy Square on Tuesday were
camped out against the walls of the embassy, which afforded the a
modicum of unofficial protection.
	   San Than, 38, who had two of her five children with her, said
that she was beaten Tuesday despite pleas from her 10-year-old son
for police to leave his mother alone.
	   ``They turned the fire hoses on me,'' she said, tears welling.
``If I die, I'd rather die by the embassy.''

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Leaders in Russia's eastern Primorsky
region imposed price controls on an array of staple foods Wednesday
to try to preserve residents' buying power as the ruble crumbles.
	   Primorye Vice Gov. Valentin Dubinin signed a decree establishing
a detailed index of price limits, which will affect local
enterprises, as well as domestic and foreign companies importing
goods into the region.
	   ``There isn't order in the country,'' Dubinin said during
meetings with regional officials in Vladivostok, about 6,400
kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow. ``We don't even know who's
at the country's head, for God's sake.''
	   He said the region would also take aggressive measures to crack
down on unlicensed street-traders and so-called ``spekulyanty,'' or
traders who sharply mark up retail prices on goods.
	   Other regions across Russia have taken similar steps as the
nation's economic crisis has kicked off massive price increases
even on the most basic goods, like sugar and flour.

NATO completes plan for eventual operations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO has finished contingency planning
for allied military operations in and around the southern Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, a NATO official said Wednesday.
	   ``We have completed contingency planning for the full range of
options that may have to be used to support international
diplomacy,'' said the official, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
	   The aim of the plan, he said, is ``to give political leaders
maximum flexibility'' in dealing with the Yugoslav government in
Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian rebels in the province. The
official spoke after a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO
nations.
	   The planning involves three basic options:
	   - A preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania along the
border with Kosovo, where Serb security forces have been attempting
to put down a rebellion by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   - Air operations inside Yugoslavia, both limited and full scale.
	   - Deployment of ground troops backed by air power to support a
cease-fire or a peace agreement for Kosovo. That could involve as
many as 60,000 troops.
	   Such operations, should they become necessary, could involve
both NATO and non-member countries, but it was too early for that
kind of decision yet, the official said.
	   The NATO ambassadors welcomed recent indications that a peaceful
settlement may be taking shape in Kosovo, while repeating that NATO
believes the Yugoslav government in Belgrade is largely responsible
for creating the problems.
	   The official said that in the event of a cease-fire or a peace
plan, NATO would expect to receive a mandate from the U.N. Security
Council before implementing military action.

Pierre Cardin plans fluorescent obelisk for Alexandria

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six centuries after the celebrated Alexandria
lighthouse tumbled into the Mediterranean, Pierre Cardin is
unveiling a fluorescent obelisk meant to recall the lost seventh
wonder of the world.
	   Cardin's column of colored light _ concrete covered with
mirrored glass _ will rise 145 meters (435 feet) and cast beams 60
kilometers (34 miles) out to sea from the tip of a jetty
overlooking the Bay of Alexandria.
	   That's just a stone's throw from where the original lighthouse
stood before it was destroyed by two earthquakes in 1349.
	   ``It's a project that makes people dream about the past and the
future,'' Cardin told Associated Press Television.
	   Head of a worldwide empire of fashion, food and cosmetics,
Cardin, 76, is no stranger to grandiose projects.
	   He once staged a fashion show in Moscow's Red Square for 200,000
people, used the gardens of Beijing's Temple of Heaven as a
catwalk, and has opened boutiques in such far-flung places as
Vietnam and Latvia.
	   Cardin says approval of the 500-million franc (dlrs 86.2
million) obelisk came from Egyptian officials on Aug. 31 after
months of negotiation.
	   ``It's now a question of financing,'' he said.
	   The designer, who takes seriously his role as UNESCO peace
ambassador, was to travel to Lisbon on Thursday to present the
scale model _ about 1.3 meters tall (about four feet) _ at the
World's Fair. It will be displayed through Sept. 30.
	   Cardin is lending his name, fame and fortune to the project,
though he declined to say how much of his own money he would
contribute. He has successfully launched other peace-related
cultural projects, including the hoisting of ``Flags of Tolerance''
in 1996.

Mexican peso opens at a record low

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's peso opened at a record low against
the U.S. dollar Wednesday as a sharp rise in interest rates
unsettled investors.
	   On 48-hour spot markets in Mexico City, Banking leader Banamex
quoted the peso at a mid rate of 10.36 to the dollar against 10.27
at Tuesday's close.
	   Banamex quoted the spot peso opening at a mid rate of 10.35 to
one dollar.
	   The rate on Mexico's bellwether 28-day Cetes, or Treasury bill,
soared 9.78 percentage points to 36.94 percent at the Bank of
Mexico's weekly auction Tuesday, causing unease among investors.
The government canceled last week's auction because it was
unwilling to pay rates that the market demanded.
	   Revised trade figures for July, due for release sometime
Wednesday, are expected to have little impact, traders said. The
preliminary shortfall was dlrs 692 million.

Australia thrashes India 5-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Veteran Stephen Davies scored
twice Wednesday, leading Australia to a 5-2 victory over India in a
preliminary match of the Commonwealth Games men's field hockey.
	   India suffered from a patchy defense, conceding a goal in the
2nd minute to Davies, who deftly converted a pass from Daniel
Sproule.
	   Less than 20 minutes later, India's defense was once again
stunned as Davies rushed in to make the score 2-0. Lachlan
Vivian-Taylor made it 3-0 in the 27th minute.
	   ``There was misunderstanding between the defense, certainly
there was,'' said Indian coach M.K. Kaushik.
	   India came back strong just before halftime but two chances by
captain Dhanraj Pillay and Mukesh Kumar went astray.
	   The first penalty corner of the game was taken by India in the
37th minute and Dilip Kumar Tirkey shot the ball into the net to
make it 3-1. Repeated assaults, crafted by brilliant dribbling and
passes by Kumar, Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon, failed to produce
results.
	   In the 43rd minute, Pillay made it 3-2. But Australia needed
only a minute to widen the gap again as Michael Brennan scored with
a powerful left-handed shot from short range. In the 57th minute,
Jermey Hiskins made it 5-2.

embarrassment with an equalizing goal in a 1-1 tie against Canada
in their men's field hockey preliminary match Wednesday.

Short deflected a ball past England goalkeeper Simon Mason.
	   Wyatt's leveler came after Rick Roberts conceded a penalty
stroke.
	   England coach Barry Dancer said, ``I am very disappointed. I
expected to win. We started in a very tentative fashion and never

Amsterdam Stock Exchange closes lower amid jittery markets

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with market closing 1.7 percent lower. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Shares on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange closed sharply lower Wednesday as traders reacted to a
market made jittery by the financial crises in Russia and Asia.
	   The 27-share AEX index closed at 1076.59 points, down 19.09
points, or 1.7 percent, off its earlier high of 1102.82 shortly
after the start of trade Wednesday.
	   Traders blamed the downturn in part on low expectations from
Wall Street and on news that Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse is
suffering from exposure to Russia and other emerging markets.
	   Swiss's Credit Suisse, despite posting a half-year net profit
rise of 36 percent, sent ripples of concern throughout Europe after
the financial giant said its second-half profits will suffer
because of the financial turmoil in emerging markets.
	   Financial stocks were the main losers, with leading Dutch bank
ABN Amro closing down 4.2 percent and ING bank falling by 4.9
percent.

Parliament discusses opening communist-era files
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated parliament
discussed on Wednesday a government draft that would allow
individuals to look into their files set up by the communist secret
service.
	   The draft is a part of Poland's efforts to deal with the evils
of the communist era and would help in screening secret service
collaborators in order to bar them from top state posts.
	   ``Without this law we will not be able to build a genuine
law-abiding state,'' said Jan Olszewski, the head of the rightist
Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland.
	   The vote on the draft is expected in about two weeks, but it is
possible that the president, who has spoken against disclosing the
informers' names, will veto the law.
	   The draft calls for creating the Institute of National
Remembrance to collect communist secret service files from 1944-89
as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. It would make
them available to individual victims of the totalitarian regimes
and reveal who informed on them.
	   Andrzej Szkaradek, a deputy of the ruling Solidarity Electoral
Action, said disclosure of the names of the informers will be a
proof that ``in a law-abiding state anyone who does evil to others
will face individual responsibility. Even if it is only moral
responsibility.''
	   If approved by parliament and the president, the law could take
effect Jan. 1 and the first of the estimated 120 kilometers (74
miles) of files would be available in the fall of 1999, according
to Marek Biernacki, head of the parliamentary commission hammering
out the law.
	   The files would also be available to judges and prosecutors in
cases of politicians or candidates for top state posts suspected of
collaboration with the communist secret service.

	   High pressure centered over the central Atlantic northeast of
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will continue to dominate
weather across the northeast Caribbean, with a moderate to strong

Russia awaits signal from president to break political deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Luzhkov saying
Chernomyrdin to be nominated again, ruble stronger, details,
background. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia spent another day without a fully
functioning government Wednesday, its economy unraveling while
President Boris Yeltsin pondered the next move in his political
chess game with parliament.
	   Yeltsin was apparently considering alternatives to acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, including a Communist whose
nomination would undoubtedly sail through the leftist-dominated
parliament. But there were signs that Yeltsin might insist on
Chernomyrdin after all.
	   The political stalemate is exacerbating Russia's economic
collapse, which was reflected Wednesday by rising prices and a
spread of emergency measures, such as price controls, in some
regions of the country.
	   Surprisingly, however, the country's tattered currency, the
ruble, bounced back a bit. Rubles, which were selling at about 20
to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street sales to as strong as
10 to the dollar, although rates varied widely. The official rate
was 15.77 rubles to the dollar.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange more of their dollar savings for rubles. Many
Russians keep their savings in U.S. dollars.
	   The lack of rubles sent the currency's value up _ and added a
new dimension to people's worries.
	   ``I've been trying in the last few days to buy more,'' said
25-year-old Dmitry, a police officer who wouldn't give his last
name. ``But I can't change my money at a bank because there aren't
any rubles.''
	   Meanwhile, stores in Moscow were restocking shelves and people
seemed less worried about food shortages.
	   ``I'm buying but I haven't been in panic. We see people
hoarding, but we don't do it. There's no reason for it, you can't
buy for your entire life,'' said Tatyana Shishkova, 57, a retired
teacher.
	   Yeltsin spent the day at his country house outside Moscow,
meeting with top aides and deciding if he would agree to a
compromise candidate for prime minister.
	   There was speculation in the Duma, the lower chamber of
parliament, that Yeltsin was considering Yuri Maslyukov, a
Soviet-era economic official and a member of the Communist Party.
Maslyukov has worked with Yeltsin before, resigning last week as
trade and industry minister.
	   Communist and centrist leaders praised Maslyukov, saying they
would back him for prime minister. Maslyukov met Wednesday with
Yeltsin's chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, but there were no
details on what they discussed, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Maslyukov's spokesman said he hadn't been offered any government
post yet, according to Interfax.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, whose name has been prominently
mentioned as a potential prime minister, met with Yeltsin and
predicted afterward that Chernomyrdin would be nominated a third
time, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The Duma has twice rejected Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime
minister. If it rejects Yeltsin's nominee a third time, Yeltsin
would be forced by law to dissolve parliament and call new
elections.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   A compromise candidate could resolve a deadlock between the
president and parliament that has paralyzed the political system
even as the country's economy flounders.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned that the Duma would
begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. A vote to start impeachment
proceedings blocks Yeltsin from dissolving the Duma, although it
was not clear if the opposition has enough votes to get such a
motion passed.
	   Opposition and religious leaders warned that unless a solution
is found quickly, the political standoff could lead to civil war.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, a presidential aspirant,
said Wednesday he was ready to take charge of the government,
adding that Yeltsin should resign. ``A paralysis of power is
obvious now,'' he said.

Floods in northeastern India kill 162 animals, including 17 rhinos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Floods in an Indian nature reserve have
killed 17 endangered rhinos and 145 other animals, a domestic news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   Torrential rains in northeastern India and adjoining Bangladesh
have submerged large areas in the region, killing hundreds of
people and rendering millions of people homeless.
	   Almost the entire Kazhiranga National Park in the state of Assam
has been submerged by the unusual floods, Press Trust of India news
agency reported.
	   Carcasses of animals were floating in the park and officials
said they would have a clear idea of the devastation only when the
water recedes, PTI said.
	   It quoted unconfirmed reports as saying as many as 1,000 deer
may have perished in the park.
	   Seventeen rhinos were among the animals killed, it said. Three
of them were gunned down by poachers this week when the animals
strayed outside the park to escape the floods, it said.
	   Rhinos are hunted for their horns, which many people wrongly
believe is an aphrodisiac. Indian law bans killing the rhinos.

European Union warns Mugabe on Zimbabwe land reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The European Union on Wednesday warned
President Robert Mugabe against the government's planned takeover
of 1,400 mostly white-owned farms for redistribution to landless
blacks.
	   Mugabe is seeking to raise over dlrs 2 billion at a three-day
conference of donors for the proposed land takeover. The conference
opened on Wednesday.
	   Austrian Ambassador Peter Leitenbauer, representing the EU at
the conference, urged Mugabe to think of resettling people on land
the state has not yet fully utilized instead of grabbing more land.
	   ``The European Union would urge that the second phase of land
reform should start with initial programs for land already
available,'' Leitenbauer said.
	   Austria is the current holder of the EU presidency.
	   Leitenbauer said the European Union was unanimous in its opinion
that resettlement had to be consistent with reform of government,
the economy and agriculture.
	   The success of land reform will depend on Mugabe's ``energetic
pursuit of economic reform'' together with reform of his civil
service, Leitenbauer said.
	   Mugabe wants to resettle 150,000 black families on 5 million
hectares (12 million acres) now held by private commercial farmers.
	   The first resettlement phase between 1980-1990 moved only 71,000
families onto land intended for more than twice that many. Much of
that land ended up in the hands of the political elite.
	   Mugabe refrained from repeating past threats to commandeer
white-owned land without compensating the owners, and Leitenbauer
did not specifically rule out funding the new purchase.
	   The issue of exclusively male land ownership surfaced at the
meeting when World Bank representative Barbara Kafka said the bank
wanted to see women's have titles to land.
	   Her suggestion was greeted with cheers and ululation by members
of the ruling ZANU (PF) party women's league who were bussed in for
the opening ceremony.

Bishop cancels land deal that caused tension with government

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Orthodox Church has agreed to return
money it received from the Cypriot government in a disputed land
deal that caused tension between the government and church
authorities, a Cabinet minister said Wednesday.
	   Commerce Minister Nicos Rolandis this week accused Bishop
Chrysanthos of the southern port city of Limassol of overcharging
up to 700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.37 million) for the land and
threatened to deduct the difference from the state's 1.7 million
pound (dlrs 3.3 million) annual subsidy to the church.
	   Rolandis said after a Cabinet meeting that the church,
reportedly embarrassed by the charges, had decided to return the
money.
	   The announcement came two days after the bishop, who is already
entangled in a web of allegations over his business dealings,
responded defiantly to Rolandis' threat, saying the 1.4 million
pound (dlrs 2.74 million) deal was legal and binding.
	   The bishop is also suspected of financial fraud and taking part
in investment scams involving millions of dollars in Latin America,
the United States, Portugal and Britain.
	   The bishop strongly denies the accusations, but is under
investigation by Cypriot police, Scotland Yard and a committee
appointed by the church, a powerful institution in Cyprus.
	   The allegations, which first surfaced a month ago, prompted some
members of Parliament to demand legislation to control the
lucrative business activities of the church. They also led to
debate on whether the church has gone too far in the pursuit of
wealth at the expense of its spiritual role on the island.

Earthquake shakes southern Italy, killing at least one person

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An earthquake shook the mountain towns of southern
Italy on Wednesday, killing one person in a cascade of falling
rocks, injuring others and shaking buildings to the point of
collapse.
	   Panicked residents fled into the streets in towns close to the
quake's epicenter, about 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of
Rome. Italy's National Institute of Seismology put the preliminary
magnitude at 5.5; the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado said 5.2.
	   The quake hit at midday, striking hardest between the towns of
Castelluccio Inferiore and Laino Borgo, where the regions of
Calabria and Basilicata meet.
	   A 24-year-old Italian tried to get to safety by parking his car
and fleeing on foot, only to be struck and killed by rocks shaken
loose from a cliff.
	   A dozen people were hospitalized, including a woman who broke
her arm as she fled her home. The others were being treated either
for cuts from falling plaster or for shock.
	   Authorities said dozens of buildings had been damaged and some
appeared on the brink of falling. The quake toppled the belltower
of one church in Castelluccio Superiore and officials closed
another damaged church as a precaution.
	   Fearing more damage, many families were planning to spend the
night outdoors.
	   A year ago, a series of earthquakes struck the central region of
Umbria, killing 10 people and damaging century-old churches and
artwork, including the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German share prices closed slightly
lower Wednesday, with bank sector losses fed by uncertainty in
Russia and Asia driving the market's retreat, traders said.
	   The Xetra DAX index, which tracks electronic trading, closed at
5069.38 points, down 26.24 points, or 0.5 percent.
	   Dealers had hoped German share would open significantly higher
on the back of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's greatest-ever
point gain at the close of Tuesday's session.
	   But prices went down unexpectedly Wednesday. Traders blamed the
downturn in part on news that Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse is
suffering from exposure to Russia and other emerging markets.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A U.S. Navy salvage ship carrying
deep-sea divers and equipment capable of lifting up to 300 tons
arrived Wednesday to help search for the wreckage of Swissair
Flight 111.
	   The USS Grapple, which helped with the undersea recovery of
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996, steamed in with
117 on board, including 30 divers.
	   Before heading out, the ship was to be equipped with diving
equipment and a remote-controlled submarine with a black-and-white
video camera and two retrieval arms.
	   While searching, most of the divers will wear hardhats with
attached hoses through which air will be pumped directly from the
boat, allowing them to stay under water longer.
	   Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on
Sept. 2, killing all 229 people aboard. The McDonnell-Douglas MD-11
jetliner went down more than an hour after taking off from New York
for Geneva.
	   Swissair and the Boeing Co. were served with a dlrs 50 million
lawsuit Wednesday morning by former boxing champion Jake LaMotta
whose son was aboard the flight, in what appeared to be the first
suit filed after the crash.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Benjamin Gibson is a boy on a mission _ a
modern-day crusade _ to ``apologize'' for destruction and plunder
wrought by Christian Crusaders 900 years ago in the Middle East.
	   The 12-year-old from Mansfield, Texas, hopes the
``Reconciliation Walk'' he and 13 other Western Christians are
making will foster better understanding between Christians and
Muslims and between Western countries and the Middle East.
	   ``The conflict of East and West, Christians and Muslims, the
roots are in the Crusade,'' the golden-haired, blue-eyed boy said
Wednesday.
	   ``I've been doing research on the Crusaders since I was 6. I
told my mom I want to apologize for this,'' Benjamin told The
Associated Press. ``It's like a debt that hasn't been paid. It's
something that I feel strongly about.''
	   So strong were his feelings that he took time off from school
and persuaded his mother to join him.
	   ``He brought me with him,'' said his mother, Nancy Gibson. ``He
was fascinated by the stories.... He really was moved, struck by
the horror and how Christ was misused to slaughter people.''
	   Benjamin and his colleagues from the United States, Britain and
Australia arrived in Lebanon last week and have been walking the
streets apologizing to people they meet. They wear T-shirts and
baseball caps printed with the words ``We Apologize'' and read out
and hand out a letter.
	   ``We deeply regret the atrocities committed in the name of
Christ by our predecessors,'' the letter says.
	   While apologizing for something committed by one's extremely
remote ancestors may seem unrealistic, the walkers believe their
message has contemporary relevance.
	   ``Crusader mentality colors our relationship today and is
reflected in many of the conflicts the West is involved in,'' said
the group's Middle Eastern director, Matthew Hand, a Lutheran
minister from Fort Pierce, Florida.
	   Many Arabs regard the West, and the United States in particular,
as behind many of the troubles in the Middle East today. Britain
and France ruled much of the region between the world wars,
defining borders that are still controversial, and the United
States is seen as supporting Israel's occupation of Arab land.
	   Hand, 34, said the walkers are volunteers, who pay their own
expenses with support from friends and their local churches. The
inspiration for the idea came during his travels in the Middle East
as a relief worker, he said.
	   The ``walk'' began in Cologne, Germany, in 1996, and aims to
retrace in stages the path of the First Crusade which invaded the
Middle East in the 11th century and captured Jerusalem,
slaughtering Muslims, Jews and Eastern Christians along the way.
	   Last year, some 1,000 people took part in the walk through
Turkey and apologized to individuals and religious leaders. The
group's expects some 200 members to rotate through its Lebanese
walk.
	   Next March, the project will restart in Israel for the final
walk to Jerusalem, which the group plans to reach on July 15, 1999,
the 900th anniversary of the fall of the Holy City to the
Crusaders.
	   In Beirut this week, the group met Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir,
patriarch of the Maronite Catholics, Lebanon's largest Christian
sect and one whose forefathers welcomed the Crusaders.
	   ``He blessed our efforts,'' said Hand.
	   On Wednesday, the group stopped at City Hall, where the Rev. Tim
Atkins of Britain presented Mayor Abdul-Munem Ariss with a framed
apology letter printed in Arabic.
	   ``This is, of course, our apology for the atrocities committed
so many years ago,'' said Atkins, an Anglican.
	   Ariss, a Muslim, accepted the apology and replied with a
well-known Arabic saying: ``Admission of a mistake is a virtue.''
	   ``I hope it causes other people to come and say sorry,'' Ariss
added.

Thousands fill Kinshasa's streets to welcome back Kabila

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Thousands of cheering Congolese residents
spilled into the streets Wednesday afternoon to welcome President
Laurent Kabila, newly returned from failed peace talks in Zimbabwe.
	   Stores closed throughout the capital and people shouting the
president's name thronged through the city waiting for Kabila's
motorcade to come in from the airport.
	   The peace talks, held in the Zimbabwean resort town of Victoria
Falls and attended by seven African presidents, failed after Kabila
refused to meet face-to-face with the rebels, who are trying to
oust him.
	   On Wednesday, Congolese officials said they would continue their
war against the rebels until Rwanda and Uganda pull their soldiers
from the fight.
	   ``Rwanda and Uganda should have been asked to withdraw so that
there could have been a start to the solution,'' said Justice
Minister Mwenze Kongolo, angrily dismissing the failed talks.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda, though, deny they have sent troops in
support of the rebels.
	   Warning of a humanitarian crisis in Kinshasa, Belgian officials
also said Wednesday they were ready to start airlifting food into
Kinshasa to boost dwindling stocks.
	   Belgium has sent a C-130 military transport plane to Pointe
Noire in neighboring Republic of Congo, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) west of Kinshasa, and the plane is ready to start
transporting 700 tons of food donated by the U.N. food agency to
the capital.
	   Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said food supplies were
increasingly scarce in Kinshasa, raising the threat of a
humanitarian crisis.
	   ``Sometimes I have the impression we are the only ones realizing
this,'' Derycke told Knack magazine Wednesday.
	   But the shipments from Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler,
have so far been held up by transportation and diplomatic
difficulties.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement
it will charter two aircraft in Kenya's capital of Nairobi to
deliver several tons medical supplies and chlorine for Kinshasa's
hospitals and water treatment plants.

Worst of famine over in southern Sudan, United Nations says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The worst of a famine in southern Sudan is
over, but too many people are still dying of hunger, the United
Nations said Wednesday.
	   ``The famine is not yet over,'' said Michael Sackett, regional
manager for the World Food Program, adding ``it is clear that the
trend is improving for the first time.''
	   Hunger is a persistent problem in southern Sudan, where a
15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militias burned or stole crops that their enemy
or civilians rely on. About 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and famines.
	   This year, the resources of Bahr el-Ghazal state quickly were
depleted, and international agencies sought to save the starving by
organizing air drops of food and opening feeding centers.
	   While those efforts have slowed the death rate, Sudanese will
face continued food shortages for at least another 14 months until
next season's crops are planted and harvested, Sackett said.
	   At the peak of starvation in mid-July, up to 50 people were
dying per day among a population of about 70,000 in Ajiep, where
one feeding center was established, Sackett said. By mid-August the
figure was down to 14, and now there are eight hunger-caused deaths
per day in the town 1,050 kilometers (660 miles) southwest of
Khartoum.
	   ``That is still unacceptably high, but it is a dramatic
improvement from what it was six weeks ago,'' Sackett said.
	   Operation Lifeline Sudan, a consortium of aid groups, and a
Sudanese relief agency also announced new measures to ensure that
relief food reaches the neediest people in the famine-stricken Bahr
el-Ghazal region.
	   Carl Tinstman, OLS coordinator, said the theft and
misappropriation of food aid had raised the death rate.
	   Some aid _ the United Nations could not specify how much _ was
stolen or taken in lieu of taxes by southern rebels.
	   Traditionally, southern Sudanese are required to contribute a
share of their harvests and herds to support rebels and other
authorities. Some authorities were applying the same requirement to
relief food, a task force found.
	   The United Nations, working with the humanitarian branch of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, stopped the imposition of taxes on
aid food, Tintsman said.
	   ``No leakage is acceptable to the U.N., and certainly no
diversion to military authorities is ever acceptable to the United
Nations,'' he said.
	   Other aid, targeted at the neediest people, was taken away by
chiefs and redistributed to others who were better off, a task
force report said.
	   Aid groups will continue to distribute at least 9,000 metric
tons of food per month for as long as necessary, and expand the
number of centers were food is cooked for immediate consumption,
the task force said.

Libyan Pan Am bomb suspects likely to walk free if tried, say
</HEADLINE>
experts &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Libya should not refuse an offer to see U.N.
sanctions lifted in exchange for surrendering the two suspected
bombers of Pan Am Flight 103 for trial in a Dutch courtroom under
Scottish law, Scottish legal experts say.
	   Scottish law requires one of the highest levels of proof in the
Western world, and the Libyans, effectively under house arrest for
nearly seven years, have a good chance of walking out of court free
men, the experts say.
	   Also, in addition to innocent or guilty, Scottish law provides
for a third verdict of ``not proven,'' effectively giving
defendants two chances of going free.
	   ``I think that has always been in the back of the Libyans'
minds,'' Robert Black, professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh
University, told The Associated Press.
	   ``I haven't seen the prosecution evidence, but I have seen some
of the evidence that will be led for the defense and, in my view,
based on that, it would be very difficult to get a guilty
verdict,'' he said.
	   It was Black who in 1994 initiated the idea of a non-jury trial
in a third country _ as a compromise between Libya's refusal to
extradite Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
the U.S.-British demand that the two men stand trial in Britain or
the United States.
	   British and U.S. prosecutors say the men were Libyan
intelligence officers who, ostensibly working for Libyan Arab
Airlines in Malta, planted the bomb, hidden in a radio. It blew up
the New York-bound Pan Am jumbo over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec.
21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Records at the Frankfurt airport in Germany, where the flight
originated, reportedly show that an unaccompanied suitcase holding
the bomb arrived from Malta that day and was put aboard Flight 103,
which shifted planes at London's Heathrow Airport before heading to
New York.
	   The men were indicted in 1991 and U.N. sanctions were imposed in
1992 to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to hand them
over.
	   Initially, Libya quickly accepted the compromise suggestion by
Black, who had been consulted by a group of British and American
businessmen wanting to get the sanctions lifted.
	   Britain and the United States held out until they announced on
Aug. 24 that they would accept a trial in the Netherlands by
Scottish judges. If convicted, the men would be jailed in Britain.
	   Now, Gadhafi and the suspects' lawyers are balking.
	   But if the experts are right, the Libyans should jump at the
chance.
	   ``It will be an enormously difficult thing for the crown (state)
to prove, although that doesn't mean they won't be able to do it,''
said John Grant, professor of international law at Glasgow
University.
	   For example, Grant said, a key state witness is likely to be a
Libyan defector who worked at the Libyan airlines office in Malta.
Abdul-Mejid Jiaaka fled to the United States in 1991, taking with
him documents proving Libyan involvement in the bombing, U.S.
investigators have said.
	   ``His credibility will be challenged by the defense as someone
who's been given bed and board in the United States,'' Grant said.
	   Scotland, which maintains a separate legal system from England,
also requires corroboration of witness testimony. Even if Jiaaka
were to say he saw the pair actually handle the suitcase with the
bomb, prosecutors would have to provide corroboration from another
witness or circumstantial evidence to back that assertion up.
	   Prosecutors also miss out by the absence of a jury, which in
Scotland consists of 15 people.
	   As Grant noted, ``Where in Scotland would you find 15 people who
didn't already think these two did it, given the publicity?''

Newspaper: Pakistani government wants to sign nuclear test ban
</HEADLINE>
treaty &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A leading Pakistani newspaper claimed
Wednesday that the government wants to sign the nuclear test ban
treaty and will seek parliament's approval, after months of
international sanctions pushed Pakistan's shaky economy to the
brink of collapse.
	   Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid Hussain confirmed that
parliament had been summoned for a special joint debate about the
issue on Friday, but insisted that the government had yet to take a
stand.
	   However, Pakistan's respected The Nation newspaper, citing
confidential government sources, said Prime Minister Newaz Sharif's
cabinet had already decided in principle to sign the accord. The
report said the real question was when, rather than if, this south
Asian nation of 130 million people signs the nuclear test ban
treaty.
	   The government has said it wants a broad public consensus on
whether to accept treaty, apparently fearing fierce opposition from
religious parties that could block the plan.
	   Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars since 1947,
drew international criticism this spring when each conducted a
series of nuclear tests. Pakistan's economic crisis later worsened
when essential foreign aid and loans were cut off by the major
economic powers and international lenders.
	   Signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a key condition for
the resumption of international funding Pakistan desperately needs
to cover it dlrs 4.5 billion balance of payments deficit. A key
meeting with international lenders is due to open in Islamabad on
Friday.
	   On Monday, a top official told The Associated Press that the
Pakistani government's powerful defense committee approved signing
the treaty, an essential step in securing support for the
agreement.
	   That senior government official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the decision was made following talks between
Pakistan and the United States last month in London. Major
countries, including the United States, want a firm commitment from
Pakistan on the treaty before they resume aid.

Russian ruble rebounds steeply against U.S. dollar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 3rd graf to UPDATE with stock market
closing down. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's battered ruble rebounded steeply against
the U.S. dollar on Wednesday amid an apparent shortage of the local
currency.
	   The dollar for next-day delivery was trading between 15 and 16
rubles at the central Moscow interbank exchange, down from 20 to 25
rubles at the start of the session and way below Tuesday's Central
Bank rate of 20.8.
	   There were ``more sellers of dollars than buyers'' on the
exchange's electronic system, said Dmitri Panteta, a trader at
International Moscow Bank.
	   The Russian stock market, meanwhile, declined 1.6 percent in
weak trading. Trading is expected to remain flat until a new
government is formed.
	   While some Moscow traders did not rule out that the ruble's
gains could be caused by a Central Bank intervention, most said
that commercial banks apparently were selling dollars to obtain
rubles for client transactions.
	   Ruble supplies at Russian banks have dropped recently when most
rushed to invest in dollars or other foreign currencies, spooked by
the ruble's fall in the aftermath of the treasury market collapse
in August.
	   One major commercial bank, Oneximbank, on Wednesday called on
private clients to convert their ruble accounts to dollar deposit
accounts under favorable conditions.
	   Many street exchange points around Moscow appeared to have run
out of rubles and the exchange rate varied wildly, from a low of 12
rubles to the dollar to 18 or so.
	   Russian government officials, who on Tuesday attacked the
ruble's low rate as unrealistic, praised the currency's gains
Wednesday.
	   A rate above 20 rubles to the dollar had a ``considerable
speculative component'' and was largely due to psychological
factors, said government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   He also called on stores and wholesalers to lower the prices for
goods and food correspondingly. The State Statistics Committee
released figures Wednesday showing that consumer prices rose 35.7
percent in the first week of September, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Although prices remained high on Wednesday, Moscow stores were
restocking shelves and people seemed less worried about food
shortages.
	   Customs officials said Wednesday that economic turmoil has
halted about 300,000 tons of goods that were awaiting clearance at
customs warehouses, including 48,000 tons of foodstuffs in Moscow
region alone.
	   But imports in August were 32 percent down from July, deputy
customs committee chairman Oleg Svirodov said, according to
Interfax.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World 110-meter hurdles record
holder Colin Jackson has joined the list of big name stars who will
skip the Commonwealth Games track meet.
	   The Welshman said he was too tired to compete in Kuala Lumpur,
which comes at the finish of the European track season. But Jackson
will compete at the World Cup this weekend.
	   ``After my success in the European Championships I feel mentally
tired,'' said Jackson. ``I do not believe I could perform at the
required level. I'm very disappointed I shall not be able to defend
my title and represent Wales, which I have always relished.''
	   Jackson joins world triple jump record holder Jonathan Edwards,
world 100-meter record holder Donovan Bailey and Olympic silver
medalist Frankie Fredericks as top class athletes who have decided
not to compete in KL.
	   European 400-meter champion Iwan Thomas, who will compete for
Wales in Malaysia after racing in Johannesburg, said he was ``quite
shocked'' at his team-mate's decision.
	   ``The Welsh people will be upset because that would have been a
gold medal for certain,'' said Thomas. ``It is a shame Colin will
not be there.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of people fled their homes
in southwestern Kosovo under heavy shelling by Serb security forces
Wednesday, jamming a dirt road with tractors and wagons piled high
with their belongings, a U.N. refugee official said.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus involving as many
as 25,000 civilians in an area about 30 kilometers (18 miles) south
of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a spokesman for the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The shelling is closing
in like a pincer.''
	   Del Mundo, who visited the area Wednesday, said he heard
shelling as Serb artillery apparently attacked five villages. He
said most of the refugees had apparently fled in the previous 24
hours and continued to stream out of their villages.
	   Tens of thousands of additional civilians remain dangerously
close to the shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the
number of Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   The situation threatens to create as many as 25 ghost towns in
Kosovo's southwest, del Mundo indicated.
	   Western officials fear a catastrophe if something isn't done for
the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests and
facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic
in what's left of Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, most of them supportive of rebels' armed struggle for
independence after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most ethnic Albanian _ have been killed in
a six-month crackdown by Serb forces on the guerrillas.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has wracked Kosovo's
southwest, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up to
crush KLA strongholds there.
	   But in the previously calm northwest, Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency reported that the Kosovo Liberation Army was
battling police and guards Wednesday at the Star Trg gold and zinc
mine, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   With the area around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was
possible that a similar government offensive had been ordered in
that region.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics, the Serbs also
accuse the militants of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegation, police for a second
day showed reporters and international observers bodies of alleged
victims near the southwestern rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where
they claimed some 40 Serb civilians were executed.
	   Reporters Wednesday saw at least eight badly decomposed bodies
lying twisted and partially buried in a silty ditch alongside a
concrete canal that waters cornfields near Glodjane village.
	   Empty casings from Chinese-made Kalashnikov assault rifles and
9mm pistols lay scattered on the grass and among the raspberry
bushes a few meters (yards) from the bodies.
	   The bodies of four other victims whom police say were killed
about 10 days ago washed downstream late Tuesday in torrential
rains.
	   Serb police Col. Dragutin Adamovic accused KLA soldiers of
executing prisoners one by one or in small groups since May as they
stood in or around the knee-deep canal. He told reporters he
believes most of the victims were Serbs, and said forensic teams
started Wednesday to try to identify the bodies.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo. They
claim the rebels kidnapped them.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
offensive. Plans for possible military intervention have been
blocked by the failure to reach an international consensus _ partly
because of world politics, partly due to the difficulties of
effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
in Washington on Wednesday that the alliance would need about
50,000 troops to monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire
in Kosovo.

Murdoch buys Manchester United for record price

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the largest amount ever paid for a sports team,
leaders of the Manchester United soccer club Wednesday announced a
623.4 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) agreement to sell the storied
franchise to one of Rupert Murdoch's television companies.
	   The deal with the BSkyB satellite TV company, which prompted
angry protests from fans vowing to block the sale, nearly doubles
what billionaire Alfred Lerner paid this week for the Cleveland
Browns football team, the most expensive sports team transaction in
U.S. history.
	   The Manchester United deal prompted concerns among both fans and
government officials that Murdoch, the Australian-born media
magnate, would have a stranglehold on televising Premier League
soccer games.
	   It still must be approved by shareholders and government
regulators.
	   In Manchester, supporters planned rallies and urged protests at
Wednesday night's match against Charlton Athletic.
	   ``Rupert Murdoch might have walked all over the U.S. and the
rest of the world, but he's not going to walk over Manchester
United,'' said Andy Walsh, chairman of the Independent Manchester
United Supporters' Association. ``It is now up to the fans to show
they are not going to stand idly by and let this club be ripped
from our grasp.''
	   But at joint news conferences Wednesday, Mark Booth, BSkyB's
chief executive officer, and Manchester United chief executive
Martin Edwards insisted the sale would do nothing but benefit fans.
	   ``All I say is, before you string me up, give me a chance,''
Edwards said. ``I am not about to do anything that destroys the
health and tradition of this club. If I do, I deserve to be strung
up. But give me a chance first.''
	   ``Our interests are 100 percent aligned with the Manchester
United fans,'' Booth said. ``They want to win the league, so do we.
They want to win the cup, so do we. They want to have the best
players and the best manager, so do we. They want to have Man
United compete at the highest level, so do we.''
	   Booth said other Premier League teams will have the same
entitlement to televised games, and that no Manchester United games
now scheduled to be televised as part of BSkyB's contract with the
Premier League would be changed to pay-per-view.
	   The structure of the club's organization will stay the same, he
said.
	   Edwards, who as part of the deal will become a member of the
BSkyB board, said he resents the suggestion fans are being
slighted.
	   ``I've been a supporter of Manchester United myself since 1958,
and my father and I have been running this club for the last 33
years,'' he said. ``I believe that what we've done today has
strengthened Manchester United, not weakened it, and we certainly
have not betrayed our supporters. What we've done is secured a safe
future and more prosperous future.''
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at about 240 pence (396 cents) each. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198
cents) plus 0.2537 BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share.
On Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester United
shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government reiterated
that the takeover will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The issue is sensitive for Blair. The Murdoch-owned Sun,
Britain's biggest selling daily newspaper, switched support from
the Conservative Party to Labor at national elections last year and
Blair is vulnerable to charges of owing Murdoch a favor.
	   The Sun, under a front-page headline ``It's A Deal,'' and the
other big British daily newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp.,
The Times of London, reported the takeover enthusiastically.
	   But rivals stoked the criticism.
	   ``Sold To The Red Devil,'' announced The Mirror, alongside a
front-page picture of Murdoch with horns.

Italian airports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Financier Carlo De Benedetti's industrial
holding company has signed a deal with British Airport Authority
creating a company to manage Italian airports, the holding company
said Wednesday.
	   The new company is meant to take advantage of the privatization
of Italy's Aeroporti di Roma, which manages the Rome airports of
Fiumicino and Ciampino and has equity stakes in Genoa and Lamezia
Terme airports.
	   De Benedetti's Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpAwill have the
majority stake in the new company.
	   Aeroporti will present an initial public offering for 54 percent
of the company later in September.
	   Market talk has been that Benetton SpA, Pirelli SpA (I.PIR) and
Trussardi SpA are interested in taking stakes in Aeroporti di Roma.
	   BAA was entirely privatized in 1987. BAA currently manages seven
airports in the United Kingdom and seven in other countries,
including four in the United States.
	   De Benedetti, one of Italy's most powerful industrialists, is
the former chairman of Olivetti.

Tribunal asks Security Council to ensure cooperation from Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Calling Yugoslavia a safe haven
for war crimes suspects, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Wednesday
asked the U.N. Security Council to ensure Belgrade authorities
cooperate with the international court.
	   Yugoslavia has, for three years, been harboring three army
officers charged by the U.N. tribunal with planning and carrying
out a 1991 massacre of 200 non-Serbs near the Croatian city of
Vukovar.
	   The three Yugoslav National Army officers _ Mile Mrksic,
Miroslav Radic and Veselin Slijvancanin _ all are believed to be in
Yugoslavia despite international arrest warrants issued nearly
three years ago.
	   ``Not only does the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)
consider itself to be outside international law, it has become a
haven for fugitives from international law,'' Judge Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald of the United States, the tribunal's president, wrote to
the Security Council.
	   The three-page letter concluded: ``I respectfully submit that it
is imperative that the reprehensible conduct of the government of
the FRY ... should no longer be tolerated.''
	   The 11-judge court appears particularly frustrated at a recent
Security Council resolution calling on Libya to turn over for trial
two of its citizens charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The resolution offered to drop sanctions if Libya complies, but
also threatened further action if the suspects fail to appear for
trial before a specially-convened court in The Hague.
	   ``This resolution stands in stark contrast with the lack of
action by the Council regarding a case which offers much similarity
to the Lockerbie case,'' Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour wrote in a
separate letter asking McDonald to remind the Security Council of
Belgrade's noncompliance.
	   Muslim, Croat and, to a lesser extent, Bosnian Serb authorities,
all have boosted cooperation with the tribunal over the last two
years, leaving Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, alone
in its defiance.
	   Established by the Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
publicly indicted 58 suspects and has 25 in custody. The vast
majority of suspects still at large are ethnic Serbs living in
Bosnia.
	   Its two most notorious suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic,
are both still at large despite international warrants for their
arrests on genocide charges.
	   Arbour added that sending a strong message to Belgrade now could
prevent possible atrocities by forces involved in the raging
conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo by demonstrating
``unambiguously that indicted persons will indeed be brought to
justice in The Hague.''
	   Although the tribunal is investigating the Kosovo conflict, in
which Yugoslav forces are battling separatist ethnic Albanian
rebels, no indictments have yet been issued.

Airbus edges Boeing in latest jet-selling duel

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airbus Industrie sold dlrs 4 billion
worth of new jets Wednesday _ giving the European planemaker a
sizable victory over the Boeing Co. in their latest air show order
duel.
	   The new firm orders at Airbus brought it dlrs 6.7 billion in
sales, based on list prices, compared to about dlrs 5.2 billion for
Boeing, after three days of Farnborough International 98.
	   Both planemakers also got more potential new business as
customers from the United States, Latin America and Europe took out
options to buy additional jets. Boeing and Airbus each said they
ancticipated no more big deals to be announced by the end of the
weeklong show that is the industry's top event of the year.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard was all smiles Wednesday as
he landed an important new customer, United Parcel Service, in what
has shaped up as the biggest deal of the show.
	   UPS took 30 orders and 30 options on Airbus cargo jets that
could be worth about dlrs 5 billion if all of the airplanes are
delivered. It was the first-ever order of Airbus jets by
Atlanta-based UPS.
	   Seattle-based Boeing sought to play down the air show numbers,
after carefully adding up its own to make the total as high as
possible.
	   ``This comes and goes, and really you have to look at it over a
period of time,'' spokesman Mark Hooper said.
	   Airbus has claimed it is moving close to parity with Boeing in
terms of new orders. Boeing says it will deliver more than twice as
many airplanes as Airbus this year, while capturing 70 percent of
the global business in dollar terms.
	   All of the airplanes sold this week may become part of a pattern
that spells trouble in the industry, analysts warn.
	   The airlines are booming, and experts say they will end up
buying too many airplanes, as they often have in the past, only to
run into problems in a few years as traffic slows. Analysts predict
the current aircraft sales surge will end in about a year, giving
way to a leaner period.
	   But with jets soaring above Farnborough's hospitality tents and
free drinks flowing, the planemakers seemed intent on letting the
good times roll as long as possible.
	   Also Wednesday, Airbus announced a dlrs 1.5 billion firm order
from a U.S. leasing company, General Electric Capital Aviation
Services, a subsidiary of GE Capital.
	   Boeing had a somewhat slower day, at a show where much attention
has been focused on its recent assembly line problems and a
management shakeup.
	   One of Boeing's more colorful deals was a memorandum of
understanding _ not a firm order _ to sell one big 747-400 to a
startup Sri Lankan carrier called PeaceAir that plans, among other
things, to fly religious pilgrims to holy sites.
	   ``Peace begins with a smile,'' said PeaceAir's chairman, Gamini
Wethasinghe, his voice choking with emotion as he described plans
to give 80 percent of profits to charity. ``When PeaceAir starts,
we hope to bring peace and joy.''
	   Any thoughts of peace soon gave way to hard commerce.
	   Boeing rolled out dlrs 1.67 billion in jet orders to GE Capital
_ which is taking 12 of Boeing's longhaul 767 models. Boeing also
said it sold five 737-800s in a deal listed at about dlrs 255
million to the San Francisco aircraft leasing company GATX Capital
Corp.
	   Boeing said earlier it had gotten five new orders for 737s from
Scandinavian Airlines System, which also is converting 11 options
into firm orders in a dlrs 600 million deal.
	   A Boeing regional vice president, Tom Basacchi, said Boeing was
doing well off its home turf, saying the 737 orders from SAS
``reaffirms that we have the right product for the European
market.''

Denmark to give Ukraine dlrs 100 million loan

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Denmark will provide a dlrs 100 million
loan to Ukraine under a bilateral agreement signed in Kiev on
Wednesday, officials said.
	   The agreement was signed after a meeting between Ukrainian
Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and his Danish counterpart Niels
Helveg Petersen, who arrived in Ukraine Wednesday for a two-day
visit.
	   The loan would target such industries as ship building,
agriculture and energy saving, Tarasyuk told reporters after the
signing ceremony.
	   The sides also signed an agreement on cooperation between
Ukrainian and Danish car producers.
	   Tarasyuk and Petersen noted that trade turnover between the two
countries has been steadily increasing since Ukraine's independence
in 1991, rising from dlrs 86 million to dlrs 181 million last year.
	   ``The documents we signed would allow us to significantly
increase cooperation in the near future,'' Petersen said.
	   During Petersen's meeting with President Leonid Kuchma later in
the day, the two men discussed increasing Ukraine's exports to
Denmark to lessen the former Soviet republic's negative trade
balance with the country.
	   Ukraine exported dlrs 12 million worth of goods to Denmark in
1997, according to Ukrainian government statistics.
	   Petersen was also to hold meetings Wednesday with Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign Trade Minister Serhiy Osyka.
	   On Thursday, Petersen and a delegation of businessmen
accompanying him are scheduled to meet Agriculture Minister Borys
Supikhanov and Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov.

competition Wednesday, despite his team's 6-0 win over Scotland.
	   Charlesworth, who led the Australians to the Olympic gold medal
in 1996 and the world No.1 ranking, said the PKNS Stadium was
``substandard.''
	   The men's and women's competitions are played in different
arenas and there have been no complaints about the brand-new men's
stadium.
	   Charlesworth believes the women's playing surface is dangerous
and too uneven for international competition and wants the women's
semifinals and final to be shifted to the men's arena.
	   The Games organizers rejected Charlesworth's call for the
change.
	   ``More than half of the penalty corners were unable to be
completed and it was frustrating,'' Charlesworth said. ``I still
think they should move it. I'm very disappointed and I think it
downgrades the standard of the women's competition.''
	   Charlesworth said a number of other nations also wanted to move
the competition into the purpose-built men's stadium.
	   He also criticized the scheduling of the tournament, the first
for field hockey at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Charlesworth said it was ``ridiculous'' that his players could
be forced to play a semifinal in the afternoon heat and face a
final the next day.
	   But he was pleased with his team's effort against the world
No.9-ranked Scottish team.
	   Canada opened its tournament with a 3-0 win over Namibia,
England beat New Zealand 1-0 and South Africa downed Wales 4-0.

Bishop cancels land deal that caused tension with government

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Orthodox Church has agreed to return
money it received from the Cypriot government in a disputed land
deal that caused tension between the government and church
authorities, a Cabinet minister said Wednesday.
	   Commerce Minister Nicos Rolandis this week accused Bishop
Chrysanthos of the southern port city of Limassol of overcharging
up to 700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.37 million) for the land and
threatened to deduct the difference from the state's 1.7 million
pound (dlrs 3.3 million) annual subsidy to the church.
	   Rolandis said after a Cabinet meeting that the church,
reportedly embarrassed by the charges, had decided to return the
money.
	   The announcement came two days after the bishop, who is already
entangled in a web of allegations over his business dealings,
responded defiantly to Rolandis' threat, saying the 1.4 million
pound (dlrs 2.74 million) deal was legal and binding.
	   The bishop is also suspected of financial fraud and taking part
in investment scams involving millions of dollars in Latin America,
the United States, Portugal and Britain.
	   The bishop strongly denies the accusations, but is under
investigation by Cypriot police, Scotland Yard and a committee
appointed by the church, a powerful institution in Cyprus.
	   ``In the end, the truth will shine. No money had disappeared, no
money just goes missing. The money must be in a bank account
somewhere,'' the bishop said in an interview on state television.
	   The allegations, which first surfaced a month ago, prompted some
members of Parliament to demand legislation to control the
lucrative business activities of the church. They also led to
debate on whether the church has gone too far in the pursuit of
wealth at the expense of its spiritual role on the island.

Roadside bomb kills two Israeli-allied militiamen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
in southern Lebanon Wednesday, killing two Israeli-allied
militiamen and wounding five others, security officials said.
	   The bomb blew up near Tallet Ahmadieh, where Israeli forces and
the allied Lebanese militia maintain an outpost. The camp is on the
edge of the enclave Israel occupies in southern Lebanon.
	   Four of the wounded were members of the militia, known as the
South Lebanon Army. The fifth was an Israeli soldier.
	   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group fighting to expel Israel from the
enclave, said its fighters also attacked the patrol with rockets
and machine gun fire, ``inflicting further casualties.''
	   The attack touched off an exchange of artillery and rockets that
lasted for more than two hours, said the Lebanese security
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two Lebanese villagers were wounded when Israeli forces shelled
the village of Marj Zhour, the officials said.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500
militiamen from the enclave, which Israel established in 1985 to
protect its northern settlements from guerrilla attacks.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli warplanes fired rockets at suspected
Hezbollah hideouts facing the enclave.

Fall registration sparks showdown over ban on Islamic attire at
</HEADLINE>
Turkey's universities &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The wife of an Islamic lawmaker launched a
legal challenge Wednesday against a head-scarf ban at Turkey's
universities, which are refusing to register women students this
fall unless they submit ID photographs with bared hair and necks.
	   On the urging of Turkey's staunchly pro-secular military, which
considers Islamic head scarves a political symbol, university heads
agreed earlier in the year to enforce a secular dress code that
bans wearing of Islamic attire in public.
	   Accompanied by a lawyer and her husband and clad in a colorful,
tightly pinned silk scarf, Hayrunisa Gul, wife of former
pro-Islamic minister Abdullah Gul, tried to register Tuesday at
Ankara University.
	   She was turned away when she handed over photographs with her
head covered. Wednesday, she filed a lawsuit against the higher
education board seeking cancellation of the ban.
	   ``We have no intention of making a show,'' Gul, a deputy of the
Islamic Virtue Party, told The Associated Press. ``We were merely
exposing something that was unlawful.''
	   At Istanbul University, scene of past clashes between police and
pro-Islamic students, some head-scarf-wearing students have also
been asked to sign documents promising they would abide by the
secular dress code before they could register.
	   ``This year, we want to overcome the head scarf problem by
convincing our students, without involving the police,'' said Nur
Serter, the university's deputy head.
	   About 200 students wearing head scarves who submitted uncovered
photographs have been registered, she said. About 20 were turned
away.
	   Most universities start classes in October. Some in Istanbul
have assigned people to stand watch at bus and train stations to
make sure new arrivals do not fall in the hands of militant Islamic
groups, reports said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several hundred Communists gathered in central
Moscow on Wednesday, waving red Soviet flags and calling for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin and the restoration of
Soviet rule.
	   Standing around a monument to Karl Marx, some 400 demonstrators
chanted ``Bandits, go away'' and discussed ways of overthrowing the
government.
	   ``Have you seen the prices lately? I am a pensioner and also
work at a factory _ and my pension and salary will only last me two
weeks,'' said Oleg Rumyantsev, a life-long Communist. ``I'm ready
to support the struggle against this government through any means,
including military action.''
	   Participants made few references to Russia's ongoing political
crisis, and the speakers' rhetoric was similar to protests that
have frequently taken place in Moscow for the past few years.
	   Viktor Anpilov, leader of the radical Russian Labor movement,
addressed the gathering from a makeshift podium at the foot of the
monument, calling for bringing down ``the most terrible, the most
shameful institution in our history _ the institution of
presidency.''
	   ``Our task is to cast away reforms and restore the state of
workers and peasants, the name of which is the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics,'' Anpilov declared, drawing cheers and
applause from the gathering.
	   A few neo-Nazis also mingled with the demonstrators _ a typical
sight at anti-Yeltsin rallies.
	   ``The way out of the crisis is a military coup and a harsh
dictatorship,'' said 23-year-old Mikhail Mitin, a member of the
neo-Nazi People's National Party.
	   ``Hitler had led his country out of a great crisis,'' Mitin
said. ``The main thing is to deport every Caucasus native, every
Jew from here.''
	   Hitler's ideology considered the Slavs, including Russians, as
subhuman and f only for menial labor. But few of his admirers here
have taken note.
	   ``If Hitler had won the war, I would have a wonderful life: I
would have a shop, and be very well off,'' Mitin said.

After 16 months, poll says popular prime minister looks more

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's honeymoon with British
voters _ by political standards, a long one _ is cooling, according
to an opinion poll published Wednesday.
	   Blair is not exactly unpopular now, but 16 months after his
Labor Party's landslide election victory, he is looking more like
an ordinary politician, the poll by ICM for London's Guardian
newspaper suggested.
	   Only 34 percent of the 1,178-strong sample of voters questioned
thought Blair is more honest than other politicians, down from 54
percent in a similar survey a year ago. Sixty perecent still
thought he has ``lots of personality,'' but a year ago it was 80
percent.
	   Then, two-thirds said Blair ``understands people like me,'' now
it is just under half at 48 percent.
	   For opposition Conservative Party leader William Hague, elected
after the party's defeat, there's no correlative hint of a
honeymoon starting, however. For being understanding, Hague rated
12 percent, and he polled just 8 percent approval for his
personality.
	   Labor remained well ahead in popularity at 48 percent, up one
point from a month ago. The Conservatives had 29 percent support,
down two points, and the Liberal Democrats were unchanged at 17
percent.
	   The error margin was 3 percentage points either way.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Excerpts from the full transcript,
released by the Canada Transportation Safety Board, of
conversations between crew of Swissair Flight 111 and air traffic
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick and Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Material in parenthesis was added by way of explanation. Times in
parentheses are p.m. Atlantic Daylight Time. ADT is three hours
ahead of GMT.
	   Swissair 111 (9:58:15.8): Moncton Center, Swissair one-one-one
heavy (a term for a wide-bodied plane) good, uh, evening, level
three-three-zero (flying level at 33,000 feet _ 10,000 meters).
	   Moncton controller (9:58:20.4): Swissair one-eleven heavy,
Moncton Center, good evening. Reports of occasional light
turbulence at all levels.
	   ___
	   Swissair 111 (10:14:18.0): Swissair one-eleven heavy is
declaring pan pan pan (``panne,'' the French word for breakdown, is
an urgent message short of a distress call). We have, uh, smoke in
the cockpit. Uh, request immediate return, uh, to a convenient
place, I guess, uh, Boston.
	   Moncton controller (10:14:33.2): Swissair one-eleven, roger . .
. turn right proceed . . . uh . . .you say to Boston you want to
go.
	   Swissair 111 (10:14:33.2): I guess Boston . . . we need first
the weather so, uh, we start a right turn here. Swissair
one-one-one heavy.
	   Moncton controller (10:14:45.2): Swissair one-eleven, roger, and
a descent to flight level three-one-zero (31,000 feet _9,500
meters). Is that OK?
	   Swissair 111 (10:14:50.3): Three-one-zero. (Unintelligible words
obscured by a noise. Possibly the noise associated with donning
oxygen masks.) Three-one-zero . . . one-one heavy.
	   ___
	   Moncton controller (10:15:08.6): Uh, would you prefer to go into
Halifax?
	   Swissair 111 (10:15:11.6): Uh, standby.
	   Swissair 111 (10:15:38.4): Affirmative for Swissair one-eleven
heavy. We prefer Halifax from our position.
	   Moncton controller (10:15:43.8): Swissair one-eleven, roger.
Proceed direct to Halifax. Descend now to flight level
two-niner-zero (29,000 feet _ 8,800 meters).
	   ___
	   British Airways 214 (10:15:58.3): And, uh, Swissair one-eleven
heavy, from Speedbird (British Airways flight) two-one-four, I can
give you the Halifax weather if you like.
	   Swissair 111 (10:16:04.1): Swissair one-eleven heavy, we have
the, uh, the oxygen mask on. Go ahead with the weather.
	   ___
	   Halifax controller (10:19:14.5): OK, can I vector (direct) you,
uh, to set up for runway zero-six at Halifax?
	   Swissair 111 (10:19:19.4): Ah, say again latest wind, please.
	   Halifax controller (10:19:22.1): OK, active runway Halifax
zero-six. Should I start you on a vector for six?
	   Swissair 111 (10:19:26.3): Yes, uh, vector for six will be fine.
Swissair one-eleven heavy.
	   ___
	   Halifax controller (10:19:39.5): OK, it's a back course approach
for runway zero-six (the runway is equipped with a ``localizer''
radio signal that shows the runway's location, but the system does
not automatically show the pilot the precise descent angle). The
localizer frequency one-zero-niner-decimal-niner. You've got thirty
miles (50 kilometers) to fly to the threshold.
	   Swissair 111 (10:19:53.3): Uh, we need more than thirty miles.
	   ___
	   Halifax controller (10:21:23.1): Swissair one-eleven, when you
have time could I have the number of souls on board and your fuel
on board please for emergency services.
	   Swissair 111 (10:21:30.1): Roger. At the time, uh, fuel on board
is, uh, two-three-zero tons. We must, uh, dump some fuel. May we do
that in this area during descent? Two-three- zero tons represents
the current gross weight of the aircraft, not the amount of fuel on
board.)
	   ___
	   Halifax controller (10:22:04.2): Swissair one-eleven, uh roger,
uh turn to the ah, left, heading of, ah, two-zero-zero degrees and
advise time when you are ready to dump. It will be about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) before you are off the coast. You are still within
about 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the airport.
	   Swissair 111 (10:22:20.3): Roger, we are turning left and, ah,
in that case we're descending at the time only to ten thousand feet
(3,000 meters) to dump the fuel.
	   Halifax controller (10:22:29.6): OK, maintain one-zero-thousand.
I'll advise you when you are over the water and it will be very
shortly.
	   Swissair 111 (10:22:34.4): Roger.
	   Swissair 111 (10:22:36.2): (conversation between the pilots,
inadvertently broadcast on the air) Du bisch i dr emergency
checklist fuer air conditioning smoke? (German translation: Are you
looking in the emergency checklist for air conditioning smoke?)
	   ___
	   Swissair 111 (10:24:28.1): (Background phone). Ah, Swissair
one-eleven. At the time we must fly, ah, manually. Are we cleared
to fly between, ah, ten thou . . . eleven thousand and nine
thousand feet (2,799-3,300 meters)? (Sound of audible signal when
the autopilot is switched off)
	   ___
	   Swissair 111 (10:24:45.1): Swissair one-eleven heavy is
declaring emergency.
	   ___
	   Swissair 111 (10:24:56.5): Eleven heavy, we starting dump now,
we have to land immediate.
	   Halifax controller (10:25:00.7): Swissair one-eleven, just a
couple of miles, I'll be right with you.
	   ___
	   Halifax controller (10:25:19.2): Swissair one-eleven, you are
cleared to, ah, commence your fuel dump on that track (while
maintaining your present direction) and advise me, ah, when the
dump is complete.
	   Halifax controller (10:25:43.0): Swissair one-eleven, check
you're cleared to start the fuel dump.
	   ___
	   No further communications were heard from the Swissair plane. It
disappeared from radar screens about six minutes later.

Nepal gets its first radar system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal got its first radar system at the
Katmandu airport on Wednesday.
	   Katmandu airport is known among commercial pilots for its
treacherous landing and has the reputation as ``flying in on wings
and a prayer.''
	   A Thai Airways and a Pakistan International jetliner crashed
there in 1992, killing 280 people in all.
	   The airport is 4,200 feet (1,250 meters) above sea level and is
in middle of a valley. Pilots all along resorted to radio
directions and visual sighting of the runway.
	   Air traffic controllers guide the pilots of large-bodied
aircraft through a gorge and the planes then dive toward the
runway. Pilots also must make quick ascents during takeoff to avoid
the mountains.
	   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala inaugurated the dlrs 25
million system, built with help from Japan.
	   Civil Aviation officials said the radar will help in
surveillance, traffic separation, optimum use of air space and
enhance flight safety.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities have arrested Abbas Amir
Entezam, a former government spokesman who was Iran's longest-held
political prisoner before he was freed in 1996.
	   Entezam was sent to Tehran's Evin prison following a complaint
filed by the family of Assaddollah Lajevardi, a former prosecutor
assassinated last month, the Kayhan daily reported Wednesday.
	   The family objected to Entezam's comments about Lajevardi in an
interview with a foreign radio station after the assassination, the
newspaper said. The charge was not made public.
	   The paper did not say when Entezam was arrested.
	   Entezam was deputy prime minister and spokesman in the interim
government that took over after the shah of Iran was ousted during
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The Berkeley-educated Entezam was sent to prison after being
charged with spying for the United States, an accusation he denied.
	   Entezam, who was never given a trial, has vowed to fight on
against Iran's Islamic government until it clears his name.

Religious freedom advocate backs out of conducting civil wedding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Bowing to political pressure, Tel Aviv
mayor Roni Milo, an advocate of religious freedom, decided
Wednesday not to preside over a civil wedding ceremony for a young
couple.
	   Milo told the couple that his participation would polarize Tel
Aviv residents, who are sharply divided on the issue of civil
marriage.
	   Civil weddings held in Israel are not recognized by Israeli
religious authorities, who hold a legal monopoly over marriage and
divorce. Interfaith couples or couples who do not want to be
married by an Orthodox rabbi often go abroad for their weddings.
	   The couple said they were disappointed but will hold the
symbolic ceremony as planned. It was to take place Thursday as part
of a festival celebrating religious freedom.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians fled
their homes in southwestern Kosovo under heavy shelling by Serb
security forces Wednesday, jamming a dirt road with tractors and
wagons piled high with their belongings, a U.N. refugee official
said.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus involving as many
as 25,000 civilians in an area about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``The shelling is closing in like a
pincer.''
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic
in what's left of Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, most of whom support the armed struggle for independence
after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most ethnic Albanian _ have been killed in
a six-month crackdown by Serb forces on the guerrillas.
	   Del Mundo, who visited the area Wednesday, said he heard
shelling as Serb artillery apparently attacked five villages. He
said most of the refugees had apparently fled in the previous 24
hours and continued to stream out of their villages.
	   Tens of thousands of additional civilians remain dangerously
close to the shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the
number of Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   The situation threatens to create as many as 25 ghost towns in
Kosovo's southwest, del Mundo indicated.
	   Western officials fear a catastrophe if something isn't done for
the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests and
facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has wracked Kosovo's
southwest, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up to
crush KLA strongholds there.
	   But in the previously calm northwest, Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency reported that the Kosovo Liberation Army was
battling police and guards Wednesday at the Star Trg gold and zinc
mine, 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   With the area around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was
possible that a similar government offensive had been ordered in
that region.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics, the Serbs also
accuse the militants of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegation, police for a second
day showed reporters and international observers bodies of alleged
victims near the southwestern rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where
they claimed some 40 Serb civilians were executed.
	   Reporters Wednesday saw at least eight badly decomposed bodies
lying twisted and partially buried in a silty ditch alongside a
concrete canal that waters cornfields near Glodjane village.
	   Empty casings from Chinese-made Kalashnikov assault rifles and
9mm pistols lay scattered on the grass and among the raspberry
bushes a few meters (yards) from the bodies.
	   The bodies of four other victims whom police say were killed
about 10 days ago washed downstream late Tuesday in torrential
rains.
	   Serb police Col. Dragutin Adamovic accused KLA soldiers of
executing prisoners one by one or in small groups since May as they
stood in or around the knee-deep canal. He told reporters he
believes most of the victims were Serbs, and said forensic teams
started Wednesday to try to identify the bodies.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo. They
claim the rebels kidnapped them.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
offensive. Plans for possible military intervention have been
blocked by the failure to reach an international consensus _ partly
because of world politics, partly due to the difficulties of
effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
in Washington on Wednesday that the alliance would need about
50,000 troops to monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire
in Kosovo.

Icelanders amused, puzzled, by hoopla over movie star whale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRAD CAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a land where orcas abound, all the
hoopla surrounding the around-the-world airlift of just one whale _
``Free Willy'' movie star Keiko _ has some locals asking: ``What's
the big deal?''
	   Many here question why Keiko's handlers are spending more than
dlrs 2 million to fly the long-captive whale from an Oregon
aquarium to a place where orcas are a dime a dozen _ tantamount to
shipping a steer to Texas.
	   ``It seems kind of strange,'' said Halla Einarsdottir, who
operates a photography business. ``That's a lot of money to spend
for something like that.''
	   Added artist Eva Benjaminsdottir: ``It's ridiculous to have a
21-year-old orca come back here to Iceland.''
	   Others see the whale's move as an example of American
extravagance and misplaced priorities.
	   ``I've heard people say, `With this money, you could buy food
for an African nation where the people are starving,' '' said
Hannes Hjalmarsson, a marketing consultant with the Trade Council
of Iceland.
	   Still, the return of Keiko to his native waters _ and the
hundreds of reporters following the event _ has created the biggest
spectactle in this sleepy fishing village on the southern Iceland
coast since a 1973 volcanic eruption.
	   Life hasn't been the same here since the government of Iceland
agreed this summer to allow Keiko to be repatriated to his native
waters.
	   The Free Willy Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale,
immediately set about building an enclosed sea pen the size of a
football field, which now is anchored and ready for its famous
occupant in a small protected bay.
	   The whale's move could be a tourism boon for Heimaey, the
largest in a string of 13 rugged but starkly beautiful islands
called Vestmannaeyjar, or the Westmann Islands.
	   Most people said they welcome anything that will boost the
economy of Heimaey, which with nearly 5,000 residents is almost
totally dependant on the fishing industry for its livelihood.
	   Already, stores and shops around Heimaey are stocking up on
Keiko Christmas ornaments, Keiko sweaters, Keiko stuffed toys,
Keiko jewelry and other products bearing the famous whale's image.
	   Spurred on by the ``Free Willy'' movie about a young boy who
helps an orca find its way to freedom, children around the world
sent in pennies to help rescue Keiko from a cramped pool in Mexico
City and ship him to Oregon in 1996.
	   The children of Heimaey are equally jazzed about the prospect of
bringing Keiko to their island and putting him in a sea pen that
could serve as his halfway house to the open ocean.
	   In the first-grade classroom at the Children's School here, one
wall is adorned with 20 student-drawn pictures of Keiko, with some
of them showing him swimming to freedom.
	   A sixth-grader at the school, Asgeir Hjaltalin, said he has seen
the movie more than once and is happy to have Keiko coming this
way. Asgeir also sees a practical side to the move as well.
	   ``We will get more tourists. We will make more money,'' he said.
	   The principal at Asgeir's school, Hjalmfridur Sveinsdottir, said
that while most Icelanders welcome Keiko's arrival, some fear
environmentalists will use Keiko's presence to attack the fishing
industry.
	   ``The fishermen are worried that Greenpeace will say to them,
`You may not fish anymore,' '' Sveinsdottir said.
	   In July, an angry Icelander threatened to kill Keiko by tossing
poisoned fish into the whale's new bay pen. Police weren't able to
determine the motive behind the anonymous letter.
	   In fact, whaling remains a political controversy in Iceland. The
government banned whaling in 1989, but left open the door to a
possible resumption of the practice.
	   Some people in the fishing industry worry that an increase in
the wild whale population will hurt stocks of cod, herring and
other fish that supply Iceland's fishing industry.
	   There also is concern that environmentalists might capitalize on
Keiko's presence in Iceland and turn him into a symbole of the
campaign to keep whaling illegal.
	   ``Maybe this will affect public opinion. Nobody can tell about
that,'' said Sigurdur Einarsson, managing director of Isfelag, the
second-largest fishing business on the island.
	   Those concerns aside, Einarsson said he still thinks Keiko's
move will be an overall benefit to Iceland.
	   ``Maybe it will bring more tourists here,'' he said. ``It's good
for our country to have something other than fishing.''

As Moscow surrenders power, Russian regions take charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 16th graf, `In the ...,' to UPDATE with
Norway, Denmark considering aid. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In one Russian region, the local government has
created a barter bank, where people can swap timber or cardboard
for food. In another, local officials have begun manufacturing
macaroni to stave off people's hunger.
	   With only a temporary government in Moscow, power in Russia is
quickly devolving to the country's regions, where governors are
adopting widely divergent policies to deal with the worst economic
crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Where it will all lead, nobody knows. But more than one observer
has warned that Russia could be heading down a road toward
division, separatism and collapse.
	   Igor Farkhutdinov, the governor of Sakhalin island in Russia's
Far East, noted Wednesday that his counterpart in the Kaliningrad
region, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) to the west, had
suspended payments to the federal budget.
	   That act, Farkhutdinov, was ``the beginning of Russia's
dissolution.''
	   That will probably prove to be an overstatement. But other
political observers say what is happening across Russia, as
regional governments are forced to deal with the crisis by
themselves, has solidified a trend: Power in Russia, once strongly
anchored in Moscow, is beginning to spread across the country.
	   Some think the devolution of power could be positive, leading to
a confederation of semi-autonomous regions that could shape polices
more finely tailored to their needs.
	   At this point, ``It's not dissolution,'' said Sergei Markov, an
independent political analyst in Moscow. ``But on the other hand,
if the crisis continues, if there's no government for one year,
there would be the dissolution of the country.''
	   For now, Markov thinks the makeshift policies being formed at
the regional level will mostly cause headaches in the Kremlin when
a new government sets out to enforce a new national economic
policy.
	   In many cases, the policies being introduced in regions
contradict the spirit of market-oriented economic reforms that
President Boris Yeltsin has haltingly sought to impose on a
national level.
	   Many regions have introduced price controls of various sorts.
Others have imposed limits on bulk buying to discourage hoarding.
	   In the city of Tambov, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
southeast of Moscow, local authorities limited bread sales
Wednesday to five loaves per customer, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   They also said they would try to limit traders from hauling
``socially important goods,'' such as bread, sugar, salt and meat,
out of the region.
	   In Arkhangelsk, about 960 kilometers (600 miles) north of
Moscow, the regional government has resumed operations at a closed
fish processing plant and begun producing macaroni, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The regional authorities also slashed prices of potatoes and
cooking oil. They noted that most residents had exhausted their
savings and could not afford to hoard food.
	   In the Saratov region, authorities opened several fall harvest
fairs so that residents could buy food directly from growers,
eliminating costs added by retailers. In the Novgorod region, known
for its progressive economic policies, officials established a
commodity bank, which will give out food in exchange for various
non-edible products, such as timber, fertilizer and cardboard.
	   In the far northern region of Murmansk, Gov. Yuri Yevdokimov
requested humanitarian assistance _ primarily food _ from provinces
in Norway, Sweden and Finland, Interfax reported. Later in the day,
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek was quoted as saying
Norway would consider the request.
	   Danish officials were said to be considering aid to the far
western region of Kaliningrad.
	   In the vast Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, newly elected Gov.
Alexander Lebed imposed prices controls. Lebed, who is considered a
likely presidential candidate, said he felt he had no choice.
	   ``The emergency situation forces me to take emergency
measures,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I am determined to stave off
starvation in the region. I believe that businessmen ... should
understand me. They should understand that I am acting in their
interests, in order to prevent a situation in which huge crowds of
hungry and angry people take to the streets and smash everything.''

Roadside bomb kills two Israeli-allied militiamen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli air raids in 7th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
in southern Lebanon Wednesday, killing two Israeli-allied
militiamen and wounding five others, security officials said.
	   The bomb blew up near Tallet Ahmadieh, where Israeli forces and
the allied Lebanese militia maintain an outpost. The camp is on the
edge of the enclave Israel occupies in southern Lebanon.
	   Four of the wounded were members of the militia, known as the
South Lebanon Army. The fifth was an Israeli soldier.
	   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group fighting to expel Israel from the
enclave, said its fighters also attacked the patrol with rockets
and machine gun fire, ``inflicting further casualties.''
	   The attack touched off an exchange of artillery and rockets that
lasted for more than two hours, said the Lebanese security
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two Lebanese villagers were wounded when Israeli forces shelled
the village of Marj Zhour, the officials said.
	   The Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said Israeli planes also
attacked suspected guerrilla targets in the enclave. There was no
immediate word on damages or casualties.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500
militiamen from the enclave, which Israel established in 1985 to
protect its northern settlements from guerrilla attacks.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli warplanes fired rockets at suspected
Hezbollah hideouts facing the enclave.

Stocks fall, failing to follow through on Tuesday's record gains

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were retreating Wednesday, failing to
follow through on Tuesday's stunning rally, as Wall Street returned
to worries about global economic woes and their impact on the
earnings of U.S. businesses.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up a record 380.53 points
Tuesday, was off 122.55 at 7,898.23 this afternoon. Its rise
Tuesday to 8,020.78 was the Dow's first return above 8,000 since
the 512-point pasting of Aug. 31.
	   Broader-market indicators also turned lower after record point
gains Tuesday and the best daily percentage increases in nearly 11
years.
	   Share prices also fell in Europe, with London's main stock index
closing down off 0.6 percent. Shares fell 1.2 percent in Frankfurt,
Germany, and dropped 1.1 percent in Paris. Stocks also finished
lower after a strong start in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
	   Markets got a psychological lift as the trading week began from
comments late Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
indicating the central bank was prepared to lower interest rates if
worsening global economic problems had a bigger impact on the U.S.
economy.
	   Asian markets roared higher Monday. And on Tuesday, when Wall
Street returned from the Labor Day holiday, major indexes not only
had their best point gains ever but also their biggest percentage
gains since Oct. 21, 1987, two days after the ``Black Monday''
crash.
	   The Dow had climbed almost 5 percent Tuesday, while the Nasdaq
composite index record rise of 94.34 points was a 6 percent gain.
	   Although Wall Street is trying to bounce back from a late-summer
selling stampede, economic problems persist in Asia and Russia,
which still threaten to spread greater pain elsewhere in the world.
	   As word of New York's rebound on Tuesday reached Asia Wednesday
morning, people seemed happy but uncertain, given how much
turbulence has wracked the world's markets lately.
	   In Tokyo, Masahiko Shimizu, 31, an insurance salesman who had
just completed a stock transaction at Nomura Securities Co., said:
``The Dow surge won't have a direct effect on the Japanese economy.
It has its own problems, and they are mostly political.''
	   When trading began Wednesday, Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average moved higher but closed off 1.07 percent because of new
concerns about a major part of Asia's economic crisis _ the
weakness of Japanese banks burdened with bad loans.
	   As Japan's political parties continue to wrangle over a proposed
bailout for the banks, rumors surfaced on the market that Fuji Bank
Ltd. was facing huge derivatives losses overseas. That triggered
selling in the banking sector, traders said, even though the bank
later called the rumors ``totally groundless.''
	   After Tokyo markets closed, Japan's central bank lowered its
target for a key interest rate to the lowest level ever. The move
would make it cheaper for banks to raise funds and should reduce
corporate borrowing costs.
	   In Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, the index initially rose Wednesday
but ended with a decline of 3.5 percent. Traders attributed selling
to profit-taking.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index closed at
885.46, up 16.78 points, or 1.9 percent.

Italy ready to mediate among Libya, U.S. and Britain over suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italy is ready to mediate among Libya, the
United States and Britain to help bring about the trial of two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Wednesday.
	   Italy, which enjoys relatively good relations with Libya, ``is
ready to cooperate with Libya and establish a dialogue with the
British and American authorities,'' Dini said.
	   The United Nations imposed an air embargo in 1992 after Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi refused to hand over the two men suspected
in the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The United States and Britain recently reversed long-standing
demands that the two men be tried only in their countries and urged
a trial before Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya has said it accepts the offer but wants guarantees to
ensure the safety of the two men. In the past, it urged a trial in
a third country, arguing the two suspects could not get a fair
trial in the United States or Britain.
	   But Gadhafi said Saturday that Libya did not recognize the
agreement between Britain and the Netherlands to stage the trial
nor the U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing it.
	   The U.N. resolution calls for lifting trade sanctions once the
suspects are transferred to the Netherlands.
	   Dini, who arrived in Egypt on Tuesday, called Libya an important
country that should not be treated as a pariah.
	   Libya ``must be returned to the international community,'' he
said at a news conference with his Egyptian counterpart, Amr
Moussa.
	   In a speech later in the day, Dini reiterated the point, saying
that Italy ``has constantly pursued a policy so that the countries
being kept on the sidelines of the international community can be
brought back in on reasonable terms.''
	   Italy, which depends on Libyan oil and gas, signed an agreement
in July with Libya on fighting terrorism and other measures.

Former minister, aide in countdown to prison over 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
against Basques &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former interior minister and his deputy
shared a farewell meal Wednesday with their mentor Felipe Gonzalez
as the two prepared to go to jail for a kidnapping linked to a
``dirty war'' against Basque separatists.
	   The ex-minister, Jose Luis Barrionuevo, and his security chief
Rafael Vera also met with other senior Socialist Party officials in
what could be their last day in freedom before starting to serve
10-year prison terms.
	   The Supreme Court sentenced Barrionuevo and Vera at the end of
July, following a politically explosive trial stemming from the
1983 abduction of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for hitman
belonging to the separatist group ETA.
	   On Tuesday the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict and
sentences, rejected the former officials' plea to remain out of
jail pending appeals before the Constitutional Tribunal and ordered
them to prison ``immediately.''
	   The court told the Interior Ministry Wednesday to execute the
order, but as of Wednesday evening the two ex-officials were still
free.
	   A ministry spokesman said officials were awaiting instructions
from the court on how to carry out the order, that is, should
police go and arrest Barrionuevo and Vera or should they be given a
deadline to surrender.
	   Vera, speaking to reporters outside Barrionuevo's home, hinted
they would remain free a bit longer. ``They are going to allow me
freedom of movement .. at least until tomorrow,'' he said.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to death squads
known as the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, that
targeted ETA between 1983 and 1987. The GAL killed at least 27
people. Many of its victims were mistaken targets.
	   The convicted kidnappers began Wednesday's countdown to
imprisonment by breakfasting with former prime minister Gonzalez _
``Our friend, lawyer and party colleague,'' Vera told reporters.
	   Vera said the atmosphere was one of ``a certain sadness and
worry'', although he insisted that he and Barrionuevo were in good
spirits, both emotionally and physically. ``We are going to keep
this up in prison, no doubt,'' he said.
	   GAL was allegedly set up by Gonzalez' Socialist governments, and
the scandal surrounding the shadowy group directly contributed to
his electoral defeat in 1996 after more than 13 years in office.
	   Gonzalez, who recently returned to the legal profession to
represent his former subordinates in the appeal stage of the
kidnapping case, denies any association with the GAL.
	   Also Wednesday, the Socialist's executive committee responded to
the prison-order with a statement saying the party respected the
courts but rejected the verdict.
	   ``Today those people who, led by (Prime Minister Jose Maria)
Aznar, have done all they could to put a Socialist minister behind
bars, can finally feel satisfied,'' the statement read.
	   But government spokesman Josep Pique refused to publicly gloat
over the Socialists' difficulties. ``This is about the fulfillment
of a sentence and from that perspective there is nothing more to
add,'' he told reporters.
	   Ten 10 lower officials and police officiers who were also
convicted for the kidnapping, but admitted their guilt during the
trial and have since appealed to the government for pardon, have
yet to be ordered to jail.

Roadside bomb kills two Israeli-allied militiamen

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
Wednesday in southern Lebanon, killing two Israeli-allied
militiamen and wounding five others, security officials said.
	   The bomb blew up near Tallet Ahmadieh, where Israeli forces and
the allied Lebanese militia maintain an outpost. The camp is on the
edge of the enclave Israel occupies in southern Lebanon.
	   Four of the wounded were members of the militia, known as the
South Lebanon Army. The fifth was an Israeli soldier.
	   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group fighting to expel Israel from the
enclave, said its fighters also attacked the patrol with rockets
and machine gun fire, ``inflicting further casualties.''
	   The attack touched off an exchange of artillery and rockets that
lasted for more than two hours, said the Lebanese security
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two Lebanese villagers were wounded when Israeli forces shelled
the village of Marj Zhour, the officials said.
	   The Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said Israeli planes also
attacked suspected guerrilla targets in the enclave. There was no
immediate word on damages or casualties.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500
militiamen from the enclave, which Israel established in 1985 to
protect its northern settlements from guerrilla attacks.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli warplanes fired rockets at suspected
Hezbollah hideouts facing the enclave.

Terror suspect wanted for more than 20 years arrested in village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Germany, no Austrian comment

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police entered a bar in a tiny Normandy
village and arrested a German believed to be a former accomplice of
``Carlos the Jackal'' and wanted for a bloody 1975 terror attack,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Hans-Joachim Klein, 50, had been sought for more than 20 years.
He is wanted for a 1975 attack against OPEC oil ministers in
Vienna, in which three people were killed and 70 taken hostage.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Ilich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is now in a French
jail serving a life term for a triple murder.
	   Klein had been living under a false identity as a writer in
Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume, a village of about 300 people, for
five years.
	   At about 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, plainclothes police barged into
the only bar in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume and surprised Klein
drinking his nightly beer.
	   Klein was unarmed and offered no resistance, police said. He had
no identity papers when arrested, but conceded his identity during
questioning.
	   ``He was well integrated into the village,'' said the town's
mayor, Remy Clerembaux, in a telephone interview.
	   ``For everyone here he was Dick,'' the mayor said. ``He said he
wrote articles and books, but it was clear he was a bit marginal,
because he always lived alone and never had guests.''
	   Klein was officially placed in detention Wednesday afternoon. In
Germany, the Federal Crime Office in Wiesbaden said Frankfurt
prosecutors plan to request his extradition. There was no immediate
comment from the Austrian government.
	   But outrage came from German Greens party politician Daniel
Cohn-Bendit, who said Klein had already decided to give himself up
to German authorities, and that negotiations had already taken
place with Frankfurt prosecutors to arrange that.
	   But Frankfurt prosecutor Job Tilmann said that with no time set
for an agreement, prosecutors kept the search for him active.
	   Germany is interested not only in what Klein might have to say
about Carlos' terror network, but also about activities at the time
of the Stasi, the East German secret police, French officials say.
	   During the 1975 attack, Klein was wounded by a gunshot to the
stomach. The attackers managed to negotiate their escape with
Austrian authorities, flying to Algeria with 35 hostages.
	   Klein then disappeared, though he'd been sighted in Yemen and
Libya as well as Algeria.
	   In 1978, Klein gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine in
which he renounced terrorism.
	   Ramirez, one of the world's most-wanted terrorists during the
Cold War, was convicted last December of shooting two French police
investigators and a Lebanese man.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijani officials blasted recent suggestions
by neighboring Armenia that the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh become
an independent country, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   Azerbaijan Foreign Affairs Advisor Vafa Guluzade said Armenia's
demands for the enclave's freedom were contradictory and could
never become a reality, the Turan news agency said.
	   Armenia called recently for independence for the separatist
region, but said Armenia does not plan yet to recognize the enclave
as a sovereign country.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.

Ukraine's reserves slightly up despite pressure from Russia's
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's foreign currency reserves have
registered a minor increase since the end of August, the central
bank chief said Wednesday.
	   The central bank's reserves stood at more than dlrs 860 million
as of Wednesday, up some dlrs 50 million from the last week of
August, National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Ukraine's reserves, which stood at dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of 1998, have shrunk significantly in recent weeks as the
National Bank tried to defend the national hryvna currency from the
financial crisis in Russia.
	   However, it could not stop the hryvna's steady fall and was
forced to effectively devalue the currency last Friday by
announcing a new, wider trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   The old corridor, which the government originally announced last
January for the whole of 1998, set the hryvna rate limits at 1.8 to
2.25 to the dollar.
	   The hryvna was trading at 2.52 to the dollar Monday, down from
2.25 to the dollar at the previous trading.
	   Desperate not to let the hryvna slip out of the new corridor,
the government ordered exporters Monday to sell 75 percent of their
dollar revenues at Ukraine's main currency exchange, hoping to
create a supply of dollars to cover at least partially growing
demand for the U.S. currency.
	   In another move aimed at keeping the hryvna stable, the National
Bank banned commercial banks from trading dollars among themselves
and restricted the number of financial operations they were allowed
to conduct.
	   Ukraine's reserves are expected to further increase in the next
few days as the International Monetary Fund is to disburse the
first dlrs 257 million tranche of its new loan to Ukraine.
	   The IMF approved a three-year, dlrs 2.2 billion to Ukraine last
Friday.

Iranian police seize 1.7 tons of drugs, kill seven drug traffickers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities seized 1.7 metric tons
(1.9 tons) of drugs and killed seven traffickers in northeastern
Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Anti-drug agents confiscated 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds) of
opium and 120 kilograms (264 pounds) of heroin after clashing with
the drug traffickers in Khorasan Province on Monday.
	   Police also seized 96 pounds (211 pounds) of opium in Torbat
Heidariyeh, a town 1,100 kilometers (682 miles) southeast of
Tehran.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the
oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.

Slovak army chief leaves, but threatens legal action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's long-time army chief of
staff left office Wednesday but threatened legal action over the
choice of his successor, leaving unresolved a politically charged
dispute over army control.
	   The resignation of Jozef Tuchyna, who asked to step down to run
in Sept. 25-26 parliamentary elections, touched off a huge
controversy last month when Marian Miklus was selected to replace
him.
	   Under Slovak law, the defense minister must name the chief of
staff. But the chairman of parliament, Ivan Gasparovic, took action
while Defense Minister Jan Sitek was on vacation, firing Tuchyna
and naming Miklus on the recommendation of authoritarian Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   The 56-year-old Tuchnya, who held the job for five years,
initially refused to leave office, leaving two men in the crucial
position.
	   Even though Sitek confirmed the Miklus appointment and
ultimately made it official on Wednesday, Tuchnya threatened to
take the matter to court, saying he has not yet been legally
dismissed.
	   ``If Miklus is given access to top-secret materials, than I will
take the minister and the people that will give Miklus access to
the secret materials to court,'' he said. ``He does not have the
right to act as army chief of staff and have access to top-secret
materials.''
	   The campaign battle between Meciar and opposition parties
figures significantly in the dispute.
	   Tuchyna said he was pushed out hastily and unlawfully because he
is running for the opposition Party of the Democratic Left.

Soldiers plug leaks to prevent collapse of embankment in Dhaka

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladeshi soldiers and residents
dumped thousands of sandbags Wednesday to plug 36 breaches in an
embankment along a swollen river that officials feared would flood
areas occupied by 600,000 people near the capital.
	   ``The situation is now under control. We have been able to plug
the breaches,'' Abul Kashem, an engineer at state-run Water
Development Board said.
	   Disaster management officials earlier prepared to evacuate the
more than half a million residents living near the 35-kilometer
(22-mile) embankment that protects Dhaka from the overflowing
Buriganga River.
	   Half the capital is already at least under knee-deep water and
the influx of so many people seeking shelter in its schools and
government offices would have further strained Dhaka's resources.
	   Also Wednesday, at least 25 people were feared drowned when a
boat evacuating them from their flooded village sank in Padma River
in Rajbari district, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Dhaka, police
said.
	   Another eight people riding in the boat were rescued by local
boatmen, a police official said.
	   Across Bangladesh, more than 800 people have been killed and 35
million displaced or marooned in flooding since monsoon rains began
on July 10, Waterborne diseases continued to spread; so far
hospitals have reported 175,000 serious diarrhea cases. Diarrhea
can lead to fatal dehydration.
	   The impoverished nation of 124 million people at the foot of the
Himalayas is a basin for several major rivers that regularly flood
it. This year's floods, which have lasted two months, are the
deadliest in a decade.
	   In the capital, government ministers and military commanders
supervised the day-long repair work as thousands of residents
worked along with soldiers in filling the breaches with sand bags
and rocks.
	   Leaks were discovered early Wednesday and authorities used the
loudspeakers at the area's mosques for help to plug the damages.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center had predicted that the
embankment, built in 1952, could collapse sometime Wednesday. That
would have raised the water level in the capital city by at least
two feet (half a meter).
	   The earthen structure encircles a large area south and east of
Dhaka. Some people have already fled their homes near the
embankment, which holds back waters from Sitalakhya and Buriganga
Rivers.
	   ``We have passed many sleepless nights fearing that the
embankment will give in,'' said Shireen Akhter, who has moved with
four children to her relative's house in Dhaka.
	   All the major highways connecting the capital with the rest of
the country were under waters at different places, the
Communications Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The government Tuesday increased its request for foreign help to
dlrs 889 million from an earlier plea for dlrs 879 million,
including dlrs 112 million needed right away. Bangladesh has so far
received food aid pledges totaling dlrs 104 million.
	   The U.N. World Food Program diverted a ship headed to Africa
with 15,000 tons of wheat to Bangladesh. The ship was expected to
reach Bangladesh next week, according to a government press
release.

Pakistan signs dlrs 1.5 billion finance package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Pakistan signed a dlrs 1.5 billion
financing package Wednesday with a consortium of Islamic and Middle
Eastern banks, Pakistani diplomats said.
	   The package, called ``Pakistan Fund,'' was signed in the Saudi
Arabian Red Sea port of Jiddah by Pakistani Finance Minister Hafeez
Pasha, the diplomats said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fund is lead-managed by the Jiddah-based Islamic Development
Bank, whose members include 52 Muslim countries.
	   Banking officials said more than 30 banks participated in the
fund, which they said have been structured on a complex formula.
	   The package will try to offset Pakistan's economic crisis
triggered by sanctions imposed on Islamabad following its nuclear
tests in May.
	   Details of the package were not immediately available.

Italy optimistic that Libya will implement Lockerbie plan

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
expressed optimism Wednesday that Libya could be persuaded to
implement the U.N. plan for a trial of the two men accused of
blowing up Pan Am Flight 103.
	   ``Libya has accepted the U.S.-U.K. proposal concerning ways of
closing the Lockerbie case,'' Dini told an audience of academics
and diplomats at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
	   Dini said he regarded Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
reservations as a demand for ``clarification of certain points that
also in my view require clarification.''
	   Gadhafi said Saturday that Libya did not recognize the agreement
between the United States, Britain and the Netherlands to stage the
trial in Holland nor the U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing
it.
	   Gadhafi has repeatedly called for the negotiations over the U.N.
plan. The United States and Britain have said it is
``non-negotiable.''
	   Approved unanimously by the Security Council last month, the
plan represents a further bid to bring to trial two Libyans accused
of planting the bomb that blew up the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
	   It calls for the suspects to be transferred to Dutch custody for
a trial in the Netherlands conducted by Scottish judges under
Scottish law. If the men are convicted, they will serve their time
in a British prison.
	   Gadhafi initially said he accepted the plan, but he said
Saturday it was not the trial in a ``neutral'' country that Libya
had demanded.
	   Dini said he accepted there could be no negotiations over what
the Americans and British consider as not negotiable, ``but each of
the parties must know what it is up to, what will happen once the
two suspects are turned over, how they are going to be held to
ensure their security.''
	   ``I think these are legitimate questions to which the (U.N.)
Secretary-General has been asked to provide a reply. I trust a
satisfactory reply can be provided,'' Dini said.
	   Earlier the foreign minister said Italy is ready to mediate
among Libya, the United States and Britain to help bring the
suspects to trial.
	   Italy, the former colonial power, has substantial trade and
investment in Libya, particularly in its oil industry.
	   The Security Council has maintained an embargo on air links
against Libya since 1992 in a bid to procure the surrender of the
two suspects. The United States and Britain had until last month
demanded they be tried on their territory, but Libya argued that
such a trial would not be fair.
	   Dini told a press conference that Libya was an important country
that should not be treated as a pariah.
	   Libya ``must be returned to the international community,'' he
said.
	   Dini left Egypt late Wednesday at the end of two-day visit.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of people fled their homes
in southwestern Kosovo under heavy shelling by Serb security forces
Wednesday, jamming a dirt road with tractors and wagons piled high
with their belongings, a U.N. refugee official said.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus involving as many
as 25,000 civilians in an area about 30 kilometers (18 miles) south
of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a spokesman for the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The shelling is closing
in like a pincer.''
	   Del Mundo, who visited the area Wednesday, said he heard
shelling as Serb artillery apparently attacked five villages. He
said most of the refugees had apparently fled in the previous 24
hours and continued to stream out of their villages.
	   Tens of thousands of additional civilians remain dangerously
close to the shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the
number of Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   The situation threatens to create as many as 25 ghost towns in
Kosovo's southwest, del Mundo indicated.
	   Western officials fear a catastrophe if something isn't done for
the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests and
facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic
in what's left of Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, most of them supportive of rebels' armed struggle for
independence after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most ethnic Albanian _ have been killed in
a six-month crackdown by Serb forces on the guerrillas.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has wracked Kosovo's
southwest, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up to
crush KLA strongholds there.
	   But in the previously calm northwest, Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency reported that the Kosovo Liberation Army was
battling police and guards Wednesday at the Star Trg gold and zinc
mine, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.
	   With the area around Stari Trg also a guerrilla pocket, it was
possible that a similar government offensive had been ordered in
that region.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics, the Serbs also
accuse the militants of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Seeking to back up their newest allegation, police for a second
day showed reporters and international observers bodies of alleged
victims near the southwestern rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where
they claimed some 40 Serb civilians were executed.
	   Reporters Wednesday saw at least eight badly decomposed bodies
lying twisted and partially buried in a silty ditch alongside a
concrete canal that waters cornfields near Glodjane village.
	   Empty casings from Chinese-made Kalashnikov assault rifles and
9mm pistols lay scattered on the grass and among the raspberry
bushes a few meters (yards) from the bodies.
	   The bodies of four other victims whom police say were killed
about 10 days ago washed downstream late Tuesday in torrential
rains.
	   Serb police Col. Dragutin Adamovic accused KLA soldiers of
executing prisoners one by one or in small groups since May as they
stood in or around the knee-deep canal. He told reporters he
believes most of the victims were Serbs, and said forensic teams
started Wednesday to try to identify the bodies.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo. They
claim the rebels kidnapped them.
	   International efforts to end the fighting have been stymied by
the refusal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
offensive. Plans for possible military intervention have been
blocked by the failure to reach an international consensus _ partly
because of world politics, partly due to the difficulties of
effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
in Washington on Wednesday that the alliance would need about
50,000 troops to monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire
in Kosovo.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Even in the world's wealthiest
countries, the ranks of the poor are growing and many people are
being denied the basic rewards of affluence, a U.N. report said
Wednesday.
	   Poor people living in leading industrialized countries like the
United States and Britain are deprived of employment and education
and have a shorter life span, the Human Development Report said.
	   Researchers with the U.N. Development Program examined income,
education, life expectancy and health care in assessing the quality
of life in 174 countries.
	   Among their findings: 16.5 percent of Americans live in poverty
despite the fact that the United States leads the world in
per-capita consumption of goods and services.
	   In Ireland, 15.2 percent of people struggle in poverty, and in
Britain, 15 percent. Sweden was ranked the best among developed
nations in spreading the wealth, with fewer than 7 percent of its
citizens living in poverty.
	   Worldwide, the richest nations are home to more than 100 million
people who live in poverty, the report said, describing the number
of those barely getting by as ``shockingly high.''
	   In the industrialized world, at least 37 million people are
unemployed, 100 million are homeless and nearly 200 million have a
life expectancy of less than 60 years, the report said.
	   Their plight is worsened by economic crises like the one now
raging in Asia, said Richard Jolly of Britain, chief author of the
228-page report.
	   This year's report again included the U.N.'s ``human development
index'' that ranks countries according to their progress in
improving life expectancy, education and income.
	   For the fifth consecutive year, Canada topped the human
development index for enabling the ``average person'' to enjoy a
decent standard of living, followed by France, Norway, the United
States and Iceland.
	   Five African countries _ Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and
Sierra Leone _ were at the bottom of that list.
	   Worldwide, the runaway consumption of goods and services _
expected to top dlrs 24 trillion this year _ is leaving those in
poverty further behind, the report said.
	   Despite the global boom in trade, the poor still lack the most
basic items needed for survival, the report said. Still, it stopped
short of condemning consumption.
	   Researchers, however, warned that the poor bear the brunt of the
environmental damage, while the rich get richer and spend more. The
poor live closest to smoke-spewing factories, busy roads and waste
dumps.
	   ``Though the rich create most of the damage, the poorest in the
world suffer most of the consequences,'' Jolly said.
	   Despite alarming setbacks in some countries, every region of the
world has made at least some gains. Since 1960, infant mortality
rates in developing nations have decreased by more than half, child
malnutrition has declined by 25 percent and school enrollment has
more than doubled, the report said.

Floods send over 200,000 people homeless
</HEADLINE>

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Floods and heavy rains have destroyed
119,000 houses and rendered homeless more than 200,000 people in
nine Sudanese states, Sudan's Humanitarian Aid Commission said.
	   The government commission, in a statement published in
newspapers Wednesday, said 65 schools and 60 health institutions
have also been destroyed and vast cultivated lands were inundated.
	   The government has mobilized its military reservists and
militiamen to help counter the worst flooding of the Nile River to
hit the country in half a century.
	   It has been also considering the evacuation of thousands of
people in districts near Khartoum ``in a bid to put an end to the
vicious circle of floods and destruction,'' said Sharaf el-Deen
Banga, state minister for housing and engineering affairs.
	   The worst hit regions in Sudan, Africa's largest country, are
the Shamalia and el-Nil states north of Khartoum.
	   On Tuti Island, located in the Blue Nile, a few hundred meters
from where the river meets with the White Nile, more than 10,000
inhabitants have been battling day and night for the past three
days to save the island's 25,000 people from the devastating
floods.
	   Some 90 houses have been already destroyed on the island, where
a four-kilometer (2.5-mile) long wall of sandbags is being
maintained to save the remaining 3,000 houses.
	   The government fears this year's floods will be second only to
those of 1946, which devastated parts of the country.
	   In 1988, Sudan declared most areas along the Nile disaster areas
because of floods that left hundreds of thousands of people
homeless.
	   The country often has a flooding problem in September, when the
rivers are at their highest and seasonal rains begin.

European Union warns Mugabe on Zimbabwe land reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS remarks by Britain, the former colonial ruler

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The European Union on Wednesday warned
President Robert Mugabe against the government's planned takeover
of 1,400 mostly white-owned farms for redistribution to landless
blacks.
	   Mugabe is seeking to raise over dlrs 2 billion at a three-day
conference of donors for the proposed land takeover. The conference
opened on Wednesday.
	   Britain, the former colonial power, also cautioned against land
seizures that could further imperil the ailing economy.
	   British High Commissioner Peter Longworth called for a ``sound
economic and budgetary framework'' as the foundation of land
reform.
	   Austrian Ambassador Peter Leitenbauer, representing the EU at
the conference, urged Mugabe to consider resettling people on land
the state has not yet fully utilized instead of grabbing more land.
	   ``The European Union would urge that the second phase of land
reform should start with initial programs for land already
available,'' Leitenbauer said.
	   Austria is the current holder of the EU presidency.
	   Leitenbauer said the European Union was unanimous in its opinion
that resettlement had to be consistent with reform of government,
the economy and agriculture.
	   The success of land reform will depend on Mugabe's ``energetic
pursuit of economic reform'' together with reform of his civil
service, Leitenbauer said.
	   Mugabe wants to resettle 150,000 black families on 5 million
hectares (12 million acres) now held by private commercial farmers.
	   The first resettlement phase between 1980-1990 moved only 71,000
families onto land intended for more than twice that many. Much of
that land ended up in the hands of the political elite.
	   Mugabe refrained from repeating past threats to commandeer
white-owned land without compensating the owners, and Leitenbauer
did not specifically rule out funding the new purchase.
	   Longworth, the British representative, said Zimbabwe was asking
donors for funding for land redistribution at a time it had to
reform its own public spending.
	   The government has been accused lavish spending on its
bureaucracy and luxuries and perks for the ruling elite.
	   It has also been criticized at home for spending up to dlrs 1
million a day to keep 2,800 combat troops and warplanes in the
Congo supporting President Laurent Kabila against a rebel
insurrection.
	   Zimbabwe faced ``difficult choices which have to be made on all
aspects of government spending, including ... it has to be said,
military matters,'' Longworth told the conference.
	   White farmers who risk having their land nationalized are mainly
the descendants of British settlers.
	   The issue of exclusively male land ownership surfaced at the
meeting when World Bank representative Barbara Kafka said the bank
wanted to see women have titles to land.
	   Her suggestion was greeted with cheers and ululation by members
of the Mugabe's ruling party women's league who were bussed in for
the opening ceremony.

Seven more American crews advance, 21 total in finals and semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The United States qualified a further
seven crews at the world rowing championships on Wednesday, for a
total of 21 boats in the final and semifinal rounds, just one fewer
than host Germany.
	   Leading the way in Thursday's semifin1als, American James Koven
will attempt to defend his crown in the men's single scull.
	   Koven, who became world champion in his first season as a single
sculler last year, will face Olympic champion Xeno Mueller of
Switzerland, still strong despite taking a year off. Runnerup at
last year's worlds, Andre Willms of Germany, and 1997 bronze
medallist Greg Searle of Britain will also offer Koven tough
competition.
	   Olympic bronze medallist Trine Hansen of Denmark will try to
improve on last year's silver medal in the women's single scull,
profiting from the absence of reigning world and Olympic champion
Ekaterina Khodotovitch, who took a season off to have a baby.
	   Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept the three World Cup events
this season, and last year's bronze medalist Maria Brandin of
Sweden will be Hansen's toughest competitors.
	   With defending champion Sarah Garner of the United States moving
to the lightweight double, Sherri Kiklas will attempt to keep the
women's lightweight single scull crown in American hands, and fend
off top contender Benedicte Luzuy of France, the 1996 champion and
runnerup last year.
	   Two-time defending world champion Karsten Nielsen of Denmark is
looking for a third title in the men's lightweight single scull.
After eking into the semifinal through repechage, Britain's Peter
Haining is hoping to add a record fourth title to his collection.
	   In the men's coxless four, the British crew of James Cracknell,
Tim Foster, Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave, the only rower to
win gold medals in four consecutive Olympics, continue their bid
for a second straight title.
	   The foresome, who dominated at the World Cup in Lucerne, are
expected to cruise into the final, despite taking on their two
toughest rivals, Australia and Romania, in their semifinal heat.
	   Last year's silver and bronze medallists, Romania and Australia
finally secured their places in the finals of the men's eights,
after qualifying in repechage Wednesday.
	   The Romanian crew, the 1998 World Cup champions, won their
repechage heat, covering the 2,000-meter (1.25-mile) course along
the Fuehlinger See lake in 5 minutes, 51.79 seconds, just .03
seconds ahead of Italy, which also qualified for Sunday's final.
Finishing one and two in their leg, Australia and Russia advanced
as well.
	   Australia's women also qualified for the eights finals, winning
their repechage race in 6:30.26, ahead of Germany, which also made
the cut. Clocking the fastest time of the day in the women's event,
Canada earned a berth in the final, crossing in 6:28.21, ahead of
Belarus.
	   Blustery weather forced organizers to delay the start of four
races Wednesday, a localized back-wind giving boats in the fifth
lane an unfair advantage. Foul weather is expected to continue
through the weekend.

Dutchman wins fifth leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MURCIA, Spain (AP) _ Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands and
TVM became the first Tour of Spain racer to win two legs, taking
the fifth stage on Wednesday in a sprint across the finish line.
	   The overall leader remained Italy's Fabrizio Guidi of Polti.
	   Blijlevens, who won the second stage on Sunday, finished in a
time of 3 hours, 41 minutes and 31 seconds.
	   Second went to Italian rider Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom and
third to Sven Teutenberg, a German racing for US Postal Service.
Both were credited with the same time as Blijlevens.
	   In the overall standings, second place is held by France's
Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and third by Switzerland's
Markus Zberg of Post Swiss.
	   Jalabert suffered a flat tire in the last few kilometers of
Wednesday's leg, held on broad, flat highways, but teammates helped
him finish, practically without any loss of time.
	   Thursday's leg covers 201.5 kilometers (126 miles) between
Murcia and Xorret de Cati, including four mountain passes and an
uphill stretch with a 23 percent incline just before the finish
line.

Floods send over 200,000 people homeless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Floods and heavy rains have rendered
homeless more than 200,000 people in Sudan, the nation's
Humanitarian Aid Commission said Wednesday.
	   The government has mobilized its military reservists and
militiamen to help counter the worst flooding of the Nile River to
hit Africa's largest country in half a century.
	   On Tuti Island, located in the Blue Nile, a few hundred meters
(yards) from where the river meets with the White Nile, more than
10,000 inhabitants have been battling day and night for the past
three days to save the island's 25,000 people from the devastating
floods.
	   Some 90 houses have been already destroyed on the island, where
a four-kilometer (2.5-mile) long wall of sandbags is being
maintained to save the remaining 3,000 houses.
	   The worst hit regions in Sudan are the Shamalia and el-Nil
states north of Khartoum. A total of 119,000 homes have been
destroyed, leaving more than 200,000 people homeless.
	   The government commission said 65 schools and 60 health
institutions have also been destroyed and vast cultivated lands
were inundated.
	   It has been also considering the evacuation of thousands of
people in districts near Khartoum ``in a bid to put an end to the
vicious circle of floods and destruction,'' said Sharaf el-Deen
Banga, state minister for housing and engineering affairs.
	   The government fears this year's floods will be second only to
those of 1946, which devastated parts of the country.
	   In 1988, Sudan declared most areas along the Nile disaster areas
because of floods that left hundreds of thousands of people
homeless.
	   The country often has a flooding problem in September, when the
rivers are at their highest and seasonal rains begin.

Fashanu committed suicide fearing unfair trial in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Suicide was ruled Wednesday as the official cause
of death of the former English soccer star Justin Fashanu, four
months after he was found hanging in a derelict building in east
London.
	   Fashuna, 37, who was found hanging from rafters in an old
garage, had written a suicide note claiming he would not get a fair
trial in the U.S. on sexual assault charges because he was
homosexual.
	   The former Nottingham Forest star was reportedly in Britain on
the run from American police on charges that he sexually assaulted
a 17-year-old boy after a party at his apartment on March 25.
	   On April 3, Maryland police charged him with second-degree
sexual assault, first-degree assault and second-degree assault.
Under Maryland law, the sex offense carries a maximum 20-year jail
term.
	   In Fashanu's suicide note, read out during the inquest
Wednesday, he denied assaulting the boy.
	   ``He willingly had sex with me and then the next day asked for
money. When I said no he said `you wait and see','' the note said.
	   ``...justice isn't always fair. I felt I wouldn't get a fair
trial because of my homosexuality.''
	   Coroner Stephen Ming Chan said Fashanu was a man who had
triumphed in the face of prejudice against his color and hostility
against his sexual preference but had been overwhelmed by recent
pressure.
	   ``Indeed, it is clear from his note he made a declaration of his
innocence and expressed his lack of faith in a fair trial,'' Chan
said.
	   ``Clearly he did not wish to cause more pain or more distress to
his family or loved ones. Sadly he decided that death was the only
way out for him.''
	   Justin's younger brother, former England and Wimbledon star John
Fashanu, said the matter was settled.
	   ``I beg everybody to look at the coroner's report, listen to
what the coroner had to say, and I think that says it all.''
	   English police detective constable Andrew Ormison told the
inquest that, contrary to media reports at the time of Fashanu's
death on May 2, no warrant existed for his arrest.
	   However, Maryland police confirmed Wednesday that an arrest
warrant had been out for Fashanu.
	   A Howard County police spokesman said officers were in the
process of getting the British police to check if Fashanu had
returned home.
	   ``We didn't know he was in Great Britain. We didn't know where
he was in the world. At (the time of his death) no international
arrest warrant had been asked for but there was an arrest warrant
here in the United States.''
	   Fashanu was accused of inviting six youngsters to a beer party
at the apartment.
	   According to court documents, a 17-year-old awakened after the
party to find Fashanu performing a sex act on him. A subsequent
medical examination revealed evidence of a sexual assault,
documents said.
	   Fashanu was set to coach a new minor league soccer team, the
Maryland Mania of Columbia, Md., and was living in Ellicott City.

Branson will again try round-the-world balloon trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ubiquitous Virgin boss Richard Branson is planning
a fourth attempt at circumnavigating the world in a hot air
balloon, his spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Branson, whose Virgin company name is on everything from record
stores to an airline, is hoping to take off in the Virgin Global
Challenger before the end of the year after rival Steve Fossett's
latest attempt ended in 30,000-foot plunge into the Pacific Ocean
last month.
	   Branson's previous attempts have been hampered by weather, and
the only time he managed to take off _ in January 1997 _ his
balloon crash-landed in the Algerian desert.
	   He will outline his plans for the journey at a news conference
Thursday, his spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan said.

Police investigate violent anti-pope fliers found at site of

upcoming pastoral visit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP) _ Police searched Wednesday for the people
responsible for violent anti-pope fliers that appeared in the
northern coastal city of Chiavari, site of a pastoral visit next
week by Pope John Paul II.
	   The fliers accused the pope of supporting racism, the death
penalty and compromise with dictators. One urged murder of the
``Pope of Rome, killer of liberty and tyrant.''
	   The authors signed themselves only as ``anarchists.''
	   Authorities removed the fliers from the sites where they were
posted in the center of the town, 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of
Italy's border with France. Police started an investigation.
	   John Paul is to visit Sept. 18 and 19. A Vatican spokesman did
not return a call for comment Wednesday.
	   The pope survived a 1981 assassination attempt in which an
assailant shot him in the abdomen in St. Peter's Square, and is
believed to have been the target of other plots since then.

	   MAKHACHKALA, Dagestan (AP) _ Heavily-armed police intercepted a
car Wednesday and seized opposition leader Magomed Khachilayev, who
was wanted for storming a government building this spring.
	   A stun device, which produces a loud blast but causes little
damage, was detonated on a road in central Makhachkala, forcing
Khachilayev's car to stop.
	   Police with automatic rifles then seized Khachilayev, said
officers who took part in the operation. Khachilayev's brother,
Nadirshakh, was also in the car but managed to escape, police said.
	   Late Wednesday, hundreds of people had gathered outside
government building to protest the arrest, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. Police went on high alert, and have sealed off the
center city to prevent violence, the report said.
	   Both Nadirshakh Khachilayev _ a member of the Russian parliament
and head of Russia's Muslim Union _ and Magomed Khachilayev, who
heads a group representing an ethnic minority in Dagestan, the
Laks, are accused of organizing an attack on a government building
in Makhachkala, capital of the Dagestan region last May.
	   Supporters of the Khachilayev brothers then held several
policemen and government officials hostage. They left peacefully
after receiving promises of a shakeup in the local government.

India's corruption crusader jailed for defamation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A frail social activist known for his
relentless campaign against corruption in public life was sentenced
Wednesday to three months in jail for defaming a government
minister.
	   Anna Hazare said he could not afford the 5,000-rupee (dlrs 117)
bond for good conduct over two years. The judge offered the
alternative punishment in view of Hazare's age and poor health.
	   Hazare, 60, told the judge, ``I will gladly go to jail as I have
no savings to pay the bond. ... I will go to the peoples' court.''
	   Hazare was convicted for defaming Maharashtra state Social
Welfare Minister Babanrao Gholap in an interview to a local
newspaper. The judge said Hazare was unable to prove that Gholap
had been found guilty of corruption by a government investigation
panel.
	   The judge acquitted the newspaper editor, giving him the benefit
of doubt.
	   Hazare is known in India for his simple living and his tireless
campaign to improve the lives of poor people. He particularly
worked hard to rehabilitate leprosy patients.
	   Two years ago, he went on a fast-unto-death to campaign against
government ministers who allegedly were corrupt. The state
government set up an investigation panel, which exonerated all the
ministers. Hazare then held public meetings across the state with
his supporters to highlight the issue.

Royal Opera shakeup should bring lower prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The troubled Royal Opera, criticized as overpriced
and mismanaged, will stop performing for a year and plans to reopen
with lower ticket prices.
	   The strategy announced Wednesday is a response to July's
government-commissioned report, which accused the Royal Opera House
management of arrogance and said it needed to slash prices and
salaries to help overcome the elitist image of opera and ballet.
	   The government-subsidized opera house has teetered on the brink
of insolvency in recent years and a new board, headed by Sir Colin
Southgate, was brought in seven months ago to set the house in
order.
	   The staff have been told they must accept renegotiated working
conditions and a substantially reduced workforce. Negotiations lie
ahead.
	   ``The days for fudging are long passed,'' Southgate announced at
a news conference. ``The board is sad at the pain this will cause
to our workforce but only a total restructuring will achieve real
results.''
	   The Royal Opera House building in Covent Garden _ which houses
the Royal Ballet as well as the Royal Opera _ is closed for
refurbishment, so the two companies have been performing in other
theaters and around the country.
	   Under the new plan, the opera company will cease performing on
Jan. 18, and resume when the Covent Garden building reopens the
following December. The ballet is expected to perform in April and
July if staff negotiations are successful.
	   During the first full season in the re-opened theater, the
number of performances and new productions will be reduced by about
a third, with 120 ballet and 100 opera performances.
	   Southgate said the rescue package was reliant on more government
money.
	   Gerry Robinson, chairman of the Arts Ccouncil, which dispenses
the government funds, welcomed promises of better working practices
and said, ``we believe that the promise of affordable tickets, in
particular, can usher in a new era for Covent Garden.
	   ``We hope that its employees will cooperate in bringing about
reform.''
	   No details of tickets price cuts were announced.
	   In a letter to Southgate, government Culture Secretary Chris
Smith suggested that conditional on the house improving access to
its performances he would expect the council to make available
``substantial additional funding''.

Heavy rains continue to feed Mexican floods; dozens killed

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Troops, doctors and rescue workers
struggled Wednesday to reach scores of southern Mexican communities
swamped or nearly destroyed by floodwaters, as heavy rains
continued to fall on the southern Pacific coast.
	   At least 32 people had been reported killed in flooding across
the country, most in the devastated coastal zones of Chiapas state.
Dozens more were missing.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' said Marco Antonio Santiso, a resident of Huixtla, a town
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of Tapachula on the Pacific
coast.
	   Parts of Tapachula, a township of 250,000 people 10 miles (15
kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, received 18 inches (46
centimeters) of rain in the last three days.
	   Some residents huddled in their homes under a driving downpour
in Huixtla, ignoring calls by police to evacuate the town, even as
huge pieces of riverbank and the brick walls of homes were torn
away and swallowed by the swollen Huixtla River.
	   Government pilots at the Tapachula airport said a seventh day of
rain Wednesday made it impossible for airplanes or helicopters to
fly.
	   And with roads and bridges washed away, air was the only way to
reach many communities, where local reporters said dozens of people
are trapped by floodwaters on rooftops and river islands.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo late Tuesday ordered 1,100 troops and
two large jets loaded with doctors, medical equipment and
specialized personnel to Chiapas.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast, and said at least 25,000 people in more
than 50 towns and villages were driven from their houses by
rampaging rivers and creeks.
	   State officials said 25 people had drowned in Chiapas by Tuesday
night and nearly 50 more were missing. Another seven people died in
flash flooding in other parts of Mexico, which is being battered by
a tropical storm in the Pacific and a tropical depression in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the threat of overflowing
dams forced workers to cut away road repairs made after the passage
of Hurricane Isis last week so that the new waters could escape.
	   Lines outside grocery stores in Tapachula extended for a block
as residents sought to buy foodstuffs. But the situation was worse
further northwest along the coast.
	   ``We are very afraid that the death toll will increase, people
are dying because their houses suddenly were swept up in the
river,'' said Gilberto de los Santos, mayor of the coastal town of
Pijijiapan where 18 people have drowned so far.
	   ``There is no way to bury the corpses ... the river keeps rising
and the rain still keeps coming,'' De los Santos told Associated
Press Television.
	   The rain has swollen rivers on the coastal plain into raging,
muddy-brown torrents that have swept away entire neighborhoods and
at least 10 bridges in the region.
	   In Pijijiapan, authorities stopped even reporting on rainfall
after 5 inches (13 centimeters) of precipitation fell there Sunday.

Serb shelling reportedly forces 25,000 from homes in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of people fled their homes
in southwestern Kosovo under heavy shelling by Serb security forces
Wednesday, jamming a dirt road with tractors and wagons piled high
with their belongings, a U.N. refugee official said.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus involving as many
as 25,000 civilians in an area about 30 kilometers (18 miles) south
of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a spokesman for the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The shelling is closing
in like a pincer.''
	   In a news release issued later by the UNHCR, the column of
refugees was described as 12 kilometers (over seven miles) long.
	   ``UNHCR fears slaughter may occur if a shell hits the column of
people,'' the statement said.
	   Del Mundo, who visited the area Wednesday, said he heard
shelling as Serb artillery apparently attacked five villages. He
said most of the refugees had apparently fled in the previous 24
hours and continued to stream out of their villages.
	   Tens of thousands of additional civilians remain dangerously
close to the shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the
number of Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   The situation threatens to create as many as 25 ghost towns in
Kosovo's southwest, del Mundo indicated.
	   Western officials fear a catastrophe if something isn't done for
the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests and
facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic
in what's left of Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, most of them supportive of rebels' armed struggle for
independence after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most ethnic Albanian _ have been killed in
a six-month crackdown by Serb forces on the guerrillas.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has wracked Kosovo's
southwest, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up to
crush KLA strongholds there.
	   But in the previously calm northwest, Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency reported that the Kosovo Liberation Army was
battling police and guards Wednesday at the Stari Trg gold and zinc
mine, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina.
Tanjug said a mine employee was killed.

 &UR; From OPEC hostage ordeal to Normandy village, terrorist hunt ends
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with Cohn-Bendit quote

<TEXT>
	   ARGENTAN, France (AP) _ Since the spectacular capture of OPEC
oil ministers in 1975, police were looking for Hans-Joachim Klein.
The trail ended in a Normandy village, while the now middle-age
terrorist suspect quaffed his beer in a cafe.
	   French police entered the cafe in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume on
Tuesday night and arrested Klein, a German believed to be a former
accomplice of Cold War terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal.''
	   Klein was officially placed in detention Wednesday afternoon in
the nearby town of Argentan. In Germany, the Federal Crime Office
in Wiesbaden said Frankfurt prosecutors plan to request his
extradition.
	   Klein is wanted for the 1975 drama in which 70 people were taken
hostage in Vienna and three people were killed.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Ilich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is now in a French
jail serving a life term for a triple murder in another case.
	   Klein had been living for the past five years under a false
identity as a writer in the village of about 300 people.
	   At about 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, plainclothes police barged into
the only bar in Saint-Honorine-la-Guillaume and surprised Klein
drinking his nightly beer.
	   Klein was unarmed and offered no resistance, police said. He had
no identity papers when arrested, but conceded his identity during
questioning.
	   ``He was well integrated into the village,'' said the town's
mayor, Remy Clerembaux, in a telephone interview.
	   ``For everyone here he was Dick,'' the mayor said. ``He said he
wrote articles and books, but it was clear he was a bit marginal,
because he always lived alone and never had guests.''
	   There was no immediate comment from the Austrian government.
	   Outrage came from German Greens party politician Daniel
Cohn-Bendit, who said Klein was negotiating to give himself up to
German authorities.
	   ``You arrest a man who we know he is packing his bags and is
getting ready to turn himself in,'' Cohn-Bendit told France-Info
radio.
	   But Frankfurt prosecutor Job Tilmann said that with no time set
for an agreement, so prosecutors kept the search for him active.
	   Germany is interested not only in what Klein might have to say
about Carlos' terror network, but also about activities at the time
of the Stasi, the East German secret police, French officials say.
	   During the 1975 attack, Klein was wounded by a gunshot to the
stomach. The attackers managed to negotiate their escape with
Austrian authorities, flying to Algeria with 35 hostages.
	   Klein then disappeared, though he'd been sighted in Yemen and
Libya as well as Algeria.
	   In 1978, Klein gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine in
which he renounced terrorism.

	   MURCIA, Spain (AP) _ Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands and
TVM became the first Tour of Spain racer to win two legs, taking
the fifth stage on Wednesday in a sprint across the finish line.
	   The overall leader remained Italy's Fabrizio Guidi of Polti.
	   Blijlevens, who won the second stage on Sunday, finished in a
time of 3 hours, 41 minutes and 31 seconds.
	   Second went to Italian rider Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom and

Both were credited with the same time as Blijlevens.
	   In the overall standings, second place is held by France's
Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and third by Switzerland's
Markus Zberg of Post Swiss.
	   Jalabert suffered a flat tire in the last few kilometers (miles)
of Wednesday's leg, held on broad, flat highways, but teammates
helped him finish, practically without any loss of time.
	   Thursday's leg covers 201.5 kilometers (126 miles) between
Murcia and Xorret de Cati, including four mountain passes and an
uphill stretch with a 23 percent incline just before the finish
line.

Socialist supporter dies at Sofia rally marking Soviet invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ An elderly man collapsed and died
Wednesday at a rally of communist sympathizers celebrating the 54th
anniversary of the Soviet Army invasion.
	   The man was pronounced dead on the scene at the gathering of
2,000 mainly elderly people in a Sofia park. Leaders of the
opposition Socialist Party continued giving speeches but canceled a
concert that was to follow.
	   Some of the aging communist backers in the crowd surrounded the
man's body and refused to allow photographers to take pictures of
him.
	   Until the death, the rally was a nostalgic gathering of people
waving red banners and cheering speakers who paid tribute to the
birth of the communist regime in Bulgaria. ``Katyusha'' and other
Soviet-era favorites blared from loudspeakers.
	   At a memorial mass at a Sofia cathedral, supporters of the
ruling Union of Democratic Forces paid homage to victims of the
communist regime.
	   ``We are thankful to the Soviet army with whose decisive help
the Hitlerists were expelled from Bulgaria on Sept. 9, 1944,''
Socialist leader Georgi Parvanov told his supporters.
	   ``Sept. 9 is a date that marks half a century of upward trend in
Bulgaria's history,'' Socialist lawmaker Nikola Koichev said,
referring to the 45 years of communist dictatorship that ended in
1989.
	   Bulgaria has been continuously polarized between Socialists and
anti-communists since the fall of communism.
	   The Socialist Party has been rocked by struggles between Social
Democrat-minded reformers and die-hard communists since it was
forced to cede power in the wake of massive street protests
triggered by unprecedented economic crisis in early 1997.

Seven more American crews advance, 21 total in finals and semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The United States qualified a further
seven crews at the world rowing championships on Wednesday, for a
total of 21 boats in the final and semifinal rounds, just one fewer
than host Germany.
	   Leading the way in Thursday's semifin1als, American James Koven
will attempt to defend his crown in the men's single scull.
	   Koven, who became world champion in his first season as a single
sculler last year, will face Olympic champion Xeno Mueller of
Switzerland, still strong despite taking a year off. Runnerup at
last year's worlds, Andre Willms of Germany, and 1997 bronze
medallist Greg Searle of Britain will also offer Koven tough
competition.
	   Olympic bronze medallist Trine Hansen of Denmark will try to
improve on last year's silver medal in the women's single scull,
profiting from the absence of reigning world and Olympic champion
Ekaterina Khodotovitch, who took a season off to have a baby.
	   Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept the three World Cup events
this season, and last year's bronze medalist Maria Brandin of
Sweden will be Hansen's toughest competitors.
	   With defending champion Sarah Garner of the United States moving
to the lightweight double, Sherri Kiklas will attempt to keep the
women's lightweight single scull crown in U.S. hands, and fend off
top contender Benedicte Luzuy of France, the 1996 champion and
runnerup last year.
	   Two-time defending world champion Karsten Nielsen of Denmark is
looking for a third title in the men's lightweight single scull.
After eking into the semifinal through repechage, Britain's Peter
Haining is hoping to add a record fourth title to his collection.
	   In the men's coxless four, the British crew of James Cracknell,
Tim Foster, Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave, the only rower to
win gold medals in four consecutive Olympics, continue their bid
for a second straight title.
	   The foursome, who dominated at the World Cup in Lucerne, are
expected to cruise into the final, despite taking on their two
toughest rivals, Australia and Romania, in their semifinal heat.
	   Last year's silver and bronze medallists, Romania and Australia
finally secured their places in the finals of the men's eights,
after qualifying in repechage Wednesday.
	   The Romanian crew, the 1998 World Cup champions, won their
repechage heat, covering the 2,000-meter (1.25-mile) course along
the Fuehlinger See lake in 5 minutes, 51.79 seconds, just .03
seconds ahead of Italy, which also qualified for Sunday's final.
Finishing one and two in their leg, Australia and Russia advanced
as well.
	   Australia's women also qualified for the eights finals, winning
their repechage race in 6:30.26, ahead of Germany, which also made
the cut. Clocking the fastest time of the day in the women's event,
Canada earned a berth in the final, crossing in 6:28.21, ahead of
Belarus.
	   Blustery weather forced organizers to delay the start of four
races Wednesday, a localized back-wind giving boats in the fifth
lane an unfair advantage. Foul weather is expected to continue
through the weekend.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Former Jamaican track champion Herb
McKenley was in stable condition in a Miami hospital Wednesday,
recovering from an emergency triple bypass operation.
	   McKenley, 76, suffered a heart attack Sunday while in Miami to
give a speech. Doctors at the Miami Heart Institute said he was in
good spirits following surgery.
	   McKenley was to have been part of the coaching staff for the
Jamaican team in the Commonwealth Games this week in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia.
	   McKenley won two silver medals in the quarter-mile event at the
1948 Olympic Games in London. He won another silver at the 1952
Games in Helsinki, Finland.

FRANKFURT: Stielike's superior.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``Ribbeck will be clearly No. 1, he is the team chief,'' said
DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach.
	   ``He has great experience and he can start the job
immediately,'' Niersbach said.
	   Vogts also carried the official title of ``team chief.''
	   Ribbeck, a veteran 61-year-old coach, has a tough job ahead of
him.
	   Germany is in a deep slump after its ouster by Croatia in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup this summer in France and the
retirement of a talented, but aging generation that had carried the
national team for a decade.
	   The World Cup failure and two dismal performances in exhibition
matches last week in Malta triggered a growing public outcry and
forced Vogts to step down after eight years in the job.
	   Several candidates had turned down the job, while Franz
Beckenbauer, still an influential figure in German soccer, had
suggested former Dutch star Johan Cruyff for the job.
	   Jupp Heynckes turned down the job on Tuesday. Heynckes, who was
sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite leading the Spanish
club to the Champions Cup title, said he was too worried about his
wife's health to take on a new responsibility.
	   Three other Bundesliga coaches have said they want to stay with
their clubs _ Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich, Christoph Daum of
Bayer Leverkusen and Otto Rehhagel of champion Kaiserslautern.
	   The front runner for the job appeared to be Stielike, a junior
coach with the German soccer federation (DFB) who has coached the
Swiss national team.
	   Stielike, 43, played 42 games for the German national team and
like Vogts and Heynckes was the product of the great Borussia
Moenchengladbach team of the 1970s. He has never coached a big
German club.
	   In his first interview since stepping down, Vogts was quoted
Wednesday as saying he hoped Germany would qualify for the 2000
European Championship now that he had left the team.
	   Germany, the reigning European champion, travels to Turkey for
its first qualifying match Oct. 10.
	   In an interview with the Sport-Bild weekly, Vogts blasted
Germany's media and said he had been chased out of the job by their
criticism.
	   ``My entire work was never respected,'' he said. ``Now I am
finding my dignity again.''

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann on Wednesday
laid the cornerstone for Berlin's planned magnetic train station,
kicking off the controversial 10 billion marks (dlrs 5.8 billion)
project that environmentalists want stopped.
	   Wissmann conducted the ceremony at Berlin's former Lehrter train
station, the location of the planned, ultra-modern station that is
to be completed by 2003.
	   The magnetic levitation train link between Germany's two biggest
cities, Berlin and Hamburg, is to be completed by 2005 and cut
travel time on the 297-kilometer (185-mile) trip by two-thirds, to
about an hour.
	   Opponents have challenged the project because of its cost and
charge the powerful electromagnetic force that will drive the train
could have adverse health consequences for humans and animals.
	   Advocates say the train will be the most environment-friendly
way to travel, producing no pollution and using less energy than
planes or cars.
	   They also expect the prestige project to showcase German
technology and win orders from abroad for German industry.
	   The train is to be built jointly by Thyssen AG, Siemens AG and
Adtranz, a joint venture of Daimler-Benz and the Swiss-Swedish
electrical engineering group ABB.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross headed into
talks Wednesday with Yasser Arafat amid reports the Palestinian
leader was worried the Americans might backtrack on prior
agreements.
	   Ross did not speak to reporters as he arrived at Arafat's
headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah for the evening
meeting. On Thursday, he was to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The mission of the American mediator may be extended if progress
is being made toward a deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, a U.S. official said earlier Wednesday.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that an accord was not yet
within reach since Israel and the Palestinians still differ on key
issues, such as the scope of withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   The U.S. envoy will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement
appears close, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Israel's Channel 1 said Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had talked by telephone hours before the
Ramallah meeting.
	   Ross could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to work
out in advance of a possible summit in New York later this month
when the two leaders, as well as U.S. President Bill Clinton,
attend the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli newspapers said.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross would focus on the biggest stumbling
block _ negotiating a new agreement on security issues which Israel
has made a precondition for a troop withdrawal.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   In a meeting Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Palestinian security officials
told CIA representatives they were not willing to renegotiate the
whole agreement, but would consider suggested changes.
	   Both sides have in principle agreed to an Israeli pullback from
13 percent, but the Palestinians have rejected an Israeli
stipulation that 3 percent of the area be turned into a nature
reserve with building restrictions for the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians originally accepted the
nature reserve idea but then backed down, reportedly due to
pressure from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   TV reports said Arafat was afraid Ross would try to change the
terms of the U.S. peace initiative, initially presented in January.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said the ball was
in Israel's court. ``I hope that Mr. Ross will choose the shortest
way to have Mr. Netanyahu say yes to the American initiative,'' he
said.

Former minister, aide in countdown to prison over 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
against Basques &QR; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS report that jailing set for Thursday evening &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An ex-interior minister and an aide shared
a farewell meal Wednesday with their mentor, former Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, as the two prepared to go to jail for a kidnapping
linked to a ``dirty war'' against Basque separatists.
	   The ex-minister, Jose Luis Barrionuevo, and his security chief
Rafael Vera also met with other senior Socialist Party officials in
what could be their last day in freedom before starting to serve
10-year prison terms.
	   In late July the Supreme Court convicted Barrionuevo and Vera of
orchestrating the 1983 abduction of a Basque businessman who was
mistaken for hitman belonging to the separatist group ETA.
	   On Tuesday the court rejected the former officials' plea to
remain free pending appeals before the Constitutional Tribunal and
ordered them to prison ``immediately.''
	   The court told the Interior Ministry Wednesday to execute the
order, but as of Wednesday evening the two ex-officials were still
free.
	   A ministry spokesman said officials were awaiting instructions
from the court on how to carry out the order, that is, should
police go and arrest Barrionuevo and Vera or should they be given a
deadline to surrender.
	   Vera, speaking to reporters outside Barrionuevo's home, hinted
they would remain free a bit longer. ``They are going to allow me
freedom of movement .. at least until tomorrow,'' he said.
	   State-run RNE radio quoted senior Socialist Party sources as
saying the two would surrender Thursday evening at a prison in the
central town of Guadalajara.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to death squads
known as the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, that
targeted ETA between 1983 and 1987. The GAL killed at least 27
people. Many of its victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA is an armed group that has killed nearly 800 people in its
30-year-old drive for an independent Basque homeland in the north
of Spain.
	   The convicted kidnappers began Wednesday's countdown to
imprisonment by having breakfast with Gonzalez _ ``Our friend,
lawyer and party colleague,'' Vera told reporters.
	   Vera said the atmosphere was one of ``a certain sadness and
worry.''
	   GAL was allegedly set up by Gonzalez' Socialist governments, and
the scandal surrounding the shadowy group directly contributed to
his electoral defeat in 1996 after more than 13 years in office.
	   Gonzalez, who recently returned to the legal profession to
represent his former subordinates in the appeal stage of the
kidnapping case, denies any association with the GAL.
	   He insists the Supreme Court came under pressure from the
current conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
in convicting Barrionuevo and Vera.
	   Ten 10 lower officials and police officers who pleaded guilty in
the same case have requested pardons. They have yet to be ordered
to jail.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The last entry in the ledger is dated July 13,
1998, a distribution to Albania -- 1,571.543 ounces of gold.
	   On Wednesday, the Allied commission set up 52 years ago to
return gold plundered from European treasuries by the Nazis
concluded its work, opened its archives to the public and urged an
all-out effort to give something back to individual victims before
they die.
	   The Tripartite Gold Commission, made up of the United States,
Britain and France, tracked and returned some 337 tons of looted
gold, valued at nearly dlrs 4 billion, to 10 countries.
	   Eleven nations -- Albania, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia (formerly Czechoslovakia), Greece, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Poland and the former Yugoslavia -- had claimed of
a total of 514 tons of gold.
	   The only outstanding claim is that of the former Yugoslavia, now
splintered into five countries, which is to be resolved when the
conflict there is settled, according to the French Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``We are conscious that, with this work accomplished, we are
turning a page,'' said French representative Claude Martin.
	   The commission ends its work to return gold looted from
governments as pressure mounts from individuals demanding
restitution for losses from the Nazis, who plundered Europe to fund
their war effort and enrich their leadership.
	   Last month, Swiss banks, which accepted large quantities of gold
from Nazi Germany, reached a dlrs 1.25 billion out-of-court
settlement with Holocaust survivors. In December, a conference in
Washington will address plundered art and insurance policies.
	   The commission represents ``one of the most noble, selfless,
just and moral actions taken by the Allies in the post-World War II
era,'' U.S. representative Stuart Eizenstat told a news conference.
	   But for Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic affairs,
that is not enough. There is, he said, a ``moral imperative'' to
address claims by individual victims of Nazi persecution. And there
is a ``real sense of urgency'' because survivors are aging.
	   The commission, before retiring, urged nations to be what
Eizenstat called ``instruments for doing justice'' by contributing
to a fund set up by France, Britain and the United States to give
something back to victims.
	   The fund now contains nearly dlrs 60 million, contributed by 14
countries, including nine of those who claimed looted gold.
Austria, for instance, pledged its dlrs 7.85 million gold share.
The United States has pledged dlrs 25 million over four years.
	   Switzerland has estimated that over dlrs 100 million was
confiscated by the Nazis from individuals, the commission officials
said.
	   The moral imperative to help individuals arises, in part, from
evidence that gold in national coffers was intermingled with
personal items, the U.S. representative said.
	   ``The Nazis had a practice of stealing everything, from jewelry
to gold teeth,'' and these personal items were smelted into
``disguised gold bars,'' Eizenstat said.
	   The archives, housed at the French Foreign Ministry, spell out
in detail the 52-year search for European government gold and
meticulously note the distributions.
	   Albania, the last country to receive a distribution, had sought
1,583.566 ounces of gold and, like the other countries, got less.
	   For the commission members, what is at stake is worth more than
gold.
	   ``We would like for the messages and the lessons of the
Holocaust to be enshrined,'' said British representative Anthony
Layden.
	   On Sept. 21, representatives of Sweden, Israel, Britain and the
United States are to meet to discuss a Swedish initiative to
further education on the Holocaust.
	   People will die ``but education is enduring and it's important
the lessons not be forgotten,'' Eizenstat said.

German television market reporter investigated for scalping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ State prosecutors searched offices and
private apartments in Frankfurt, Berlin, Duesseldorf and Coesfeld
Wednesday in an investigation of alleged stock scalping by a
television personality.
	   Job Tilmann, a Hesse state prosecutor in Frankfurt, said
officials from his office are trying to determine whether Egbert
Prior, host of the weekly TV show 3-Sat-Boerse, bought stocks
before talking them up on his show.
	   Usually, prices of the stocks Prior recommends surge on the next
trading day on high demand from individual investors.
	   The investigation concentrates on Egbert Prior who hosts the
show in which he gives stock recommendations before an audience of
between 250,000 and 500,000.
	   The allegations of scalping also concern Berlin-based investment
bank and brokerage Berliner Freiverkehr AG, Tilmann said. Its
chairman, Holger Timm, is alleged to have bought 1,000 Sixt AG
(G.SIX) shares after Egbert Prior tipped him off and before Prior
gave the recommendation in his TV show, he said.
	   Prior is also suspected of having taken a position in Sixt
before his recommendation, he said.
	   Tilmann wouldn't comment on the outcome of Wednesday's raid.
There were still other suspects involved in the investigation, he
said.
	   A scalper is an investment adviser who takes a position in a
security before recommending it, then sells out after the price has
risen as a result of the recommendation.

New session kicks off; disarmament, terrorism and reform topping

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Disarmament, terrorism, human rights and
reform top the agenda of the 53rd session of the General Assembly,
which gets under way Wednesday with the election of a new
president.
	   Uruguay's foreign minister, Didier Opertti, will replace
Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine as the president of the 185-member
assembly.
	   For the next week and a half, the assembly will elect committee
heads and adopt agendas, leading up the start of the two-week
marathon of speeches by world leaders on Sept. 21 that set the tone
for the assembly's work.
	   After that, member states gets down to business, conferring on
matters as diverse as international seabeds, decolonization and the
year 2000 computer bug.
	   In his farewell speech, Udovenko lamented that the assembly's
52nd session failed to overcome regional interests and reach
consensus on reforming the world body to make it more efficient and
representative of the globe itself.
	   Among other things, the assembly postponed action on enlarging
the 15-member Security Council, effectively the U.N. board of
directors, and setting time limits for new U.N. programs so they
don't outlive their effectiveness.
	   Although the U.N. chief's proposals for reform were embraced,
``all we can offer was the decision to send a considerable bulk of
them for additional consideration during the 53rd session,''
Udovenko said.
	   The assembly did take action on one major issue this year,
granting the Palestinian observer mission special status _ enabling
it to participate in more assembly matters than was available to
the mission as a regular observer, and allowing the Palestinians to
take part in general debate for the first time.
	   PLO leader Yasser Arafat plans to use his speech to try to gain
support for plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999,
Palestinian officials have said.
	   Two new items on this years agenda involve granting observer
status for two inter-governmental organizations _ the Association
of Caribbean States and the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development.
	   The general themes of disarmament, terrorism, human rights and
reform, however, are expected to dominate the work of the assembly
and are expected to figure prominently in speeches by world leaders
beginning Sept. 21.
	   Nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have brought the issues of
disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation to the foreground while
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have prompted
some calls for a U.N. conference on terrorism. No such conference
is yet on the agenda.
	   Planned special meetings include one on Oct. 6 to commemorate 50
years of U.N. peacekeeping operations and one on Dec. 10 marking
the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   Other special sessions will cover population and development,
sustainable growth for small island states, and the social and
economic impact of globalized, interdependent economies _
precipitated by the Asian financial crisis.

Serb shelling reportedly forces 25,000 from homes in southwest

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of people fled their homes
in southwestern Kosovo under heavy shelling by Serb forces
Wednesday, jamming a dirt road with tractors and wagons piled high
with their belongings, a U.N. refugee official said.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus by as many as
25,000 civilians in a region about 18 miles south of Pec, Kosovo's
second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``The shelling is closing in like a
pincer.'' The UNHCR later estimated the refugee column was 12
kilometers (7.5 miles) long.
	   Del Mundo, who visited the area Wednesday, said he heard
shelling as Serb artillery apparently attacked five villages. He
said most of the refugees appeared to have fled their homes in the
previous 24 hours, but some continued to stream out of their
villages.
	   Tens of thousands of additional civilians remain dangerously
close to the shelling and may also flee, he said, swelling the
number of Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic
in what's left of Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, most of them supportive of the rebels' armed struggle
for independence after decades of repression by Serbian
authorities.
	   Hundreds of people _ most ethnic Albanian _ have been killed in
a six-month crackdown by Serb forces on the guerrillas.
	   The situation threatens to create as many as 25 ghost towns in
Kosovo's southwest, del Mundo said.
	   Western officials fear a catastrophe if something isn't done for
the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests and
facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Much of the fighting of recent weeks has wracked Kosovo's
southwest, with Serbian police and the Yugoslav army teaming up to
crush KLA strongholds there.
	   But in the previously calm northwest, Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency reported the Kosovo Liberation Army was battling
police and guards Wednesday at the Stari Trg gold and zinc mine, 18
miles (29 kilometers) northwest of the capital Pristina. Tanjug
said a mine employee was killed.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics, the Serbs also
accuse the militants of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Serb police for a second day showed reporters and international
observers bodies of alleged victims near the southwestern rebel
stronghold of Glodjane, where they claimed about 40 Serb civilians
were executed.
	   On Wednesday, reporters saw at least eight badly decomposed
bodies lying partially buried in a silty ditch alongside a canal
that waters cornfields near Glodjane.
	   Empty casings from Chinese-made Kalashnikov assault rifles and
9mm pistols lay scattered on the grass and among the raspberry
bushes a few yards (meters) from the bodies.
	   The bodies of four other victims police say were killed about 10
days ago washed downstream late Tuesday in torrential rains.
	   Serb police Col. Dragutin Adamovic accused KLA soldiers of
executing prisoners since May as they stood in or around the
knee-deep canal.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo and claim
the rebels kidnapped them.

Ribbeck gets top job, Stielike to be trainer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, adds quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Erich Ribbeck, a veteran 61-year-old
coach, on Wednesday got the job of restoring Germany's soccer glory
when he was named national team chief.
	   In a surprise decision, the German soccer federation named
Ribbeck to take over from Berti Vogts, who resigned Monday.
	   Ulli Stielike, who had seemed to be the front runner earlier in
the day, got the job of national team trainer instead, in effect
acting as Ribbeck's assistant.
	   ``Ribbeck will be clearly No. 1, he is the team chief,'' said
DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach.
	   ``He has great experience and he can start the job
immediately,'' Niersbach said.
	   Vogts also carried the official title of ``team chief.''
	   Ribbeck and Stielike will be responsible for the national team
through the 2000 European Championship.
	   Ribbeck's appointment came as a surprise. His name had not been
mentioned before as a possible candidate. He had not coached a
Bundesliga club since April 1996, when he was fired by Bayer
Leverkusen.
	   Ribbeck has a tough job ahead of him.
	   Germany is in a deep slump after its ouster by Croatia in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup this summer in France and the
retirement of a talented, but aging generation that had carried the
national team for a decade.
	   The World Cup failure and two dismal performances in exhibition
matches last week in Malta triggered a growing public outcry and
forced Vogts to step down after eight years in the job.
	   ``Within two days of the resignation of Berti Vogts, which took
us by surprise, we have found a very good solution,'' DFB president
Egidius Braun said.
	   ``Erich Ribbeck and Ulli Stielike can start their job
immediately. I am convinced that they will achieve the goal of
qualifying for the finals of the European Championship,'' Braun
said.
	   Ribbeck said he will start immediately. ``I will talk with all
the players that have retired,'' he said.
	   This could mean that Ribbeck may try to persuade some of the
players to come back.
	   Nearly an entire 11 quit the national team after the World Cup,
including Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Klinsman, Juergen Kohler and
others.
	   Vogts had tried to rejuvenate the team with new, young players
but his new-look team managed only a slim 2-1 win over soccer
weakling Malta and drew 1-1 with Romania.
	   Ribbeck had already worked for the DFB and was assistant coach
when Germany won the European title in 1980 and finished as
runner-up in the 1982 World Cup in Spain.
	   He won the UEFA Cup with Bayer Leverkusen in 1988, and also
coached other top Bundesliga clubs, such as Bayern Munich,
Kaiserslautern, Borussia Dortmund, and Eintracht Frankfurt.
	   The appointment ended a hectic 48 hours, during which several
candidates had turned down the job for various reasons.
	   Jupp Heynckes turned down the job on Tuesday. Heynckes, who was
sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite leading the Spanish
club to the Champions Cup title, said he was too worried about his
wife's health to take on a new responsibility.
	   Three other Bundesliga coaches have said they want to stay with
their clubs _ Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich, Christoph Daum of
Bayer Leverkusen and Otto Rehhagel of champion Kaiserslautern.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, who led Germany to its third and last World
Cup title in 1990, on Wednesday again ruled himself out and
suggested former Dutch star Johan Cruyff would the ideal man for
the post.
	   But DFB officials had indicated that the post was unlikely to go
to a foreigner.

Italy optimistic that Libya will implement Lockerbie plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASPER MORTIMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
expressed optimism Wednesday that Libya could be persuaded to
implement the U.N. plan for a trial of the two men accused of
blowing up Pan Am Flight 103.
	   ``Libya has accepted the U.S.-U.K. proposal concerning ways of
closing the Lockerbie case,'' Dini told an audience of academics
and diplomats at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
	   Dini said he regarded Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
reservations as a demand for ``clarification of certain points that
also in my view require clarification.''
	   Gadhafi said Saturday that Libya did not recognize the agreement
between the United States, Britain and the Netherlands to stage the
trial in Holland nor the U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing
it.
	   Gadhafi has repeatedly called for negotiations over the U.N.
plan, which the United States and Britain have said is
``non-negotiable.''
	   Approved unanimously by the Security Council last month, the
plan represents a further bid to bring to trial two Libyans accused
of planting the bomb that blew up the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 lives.
	   It calls for the suspects to be transferred to Dutch custody for
a trial in the Netherlands conducted by Scottish judges under
Scottish law. If the men are convicted, they will serve their time
in a British prison.
	   Gadhafi initially said he accepted the plan, but he said
Saturday it was not the trial in a ``neutral'' country that Libya
had demanded.
	   Dini said he accepted there could be no negotiations over what
the Americans and British consider as not negotiable, ``but each of
the parties must know what it is up to, what will happen once the
two suspects are turned over, how they are going to be held to
ensure their security.''

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Troops, doctors and rescue workers
struggled Wednesday to reach scores of southern Mexican communities
swamped or nearly destroyed by floodwaters, as heavy rains
continued to fall on the southern Pacific coast.
	   At least 32 people had been reported killed in flooding across
the country, most in the devastated coastal zones of Chiapas state.
Dozens more were missing.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' said Marco Antonio Santiso, a resident of Huixtla, a town
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of Tapachula on the Pacific
coast, told AP Television.
	   Parts of Tapachula, a township of 250,000 people 10 miles (15
kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, received 18 inches (46
centimeters) of rain in the last three days.
	   Some residents huddled in their homes under a driving downpour
in Huixtla, ignoring calls by police to evacuate the town, even as
huge pieces of riverbank and the brick walls of homes were torn
away and swallowed by the swollen Huixtla River.
	   Government pilots at the Tapachula airport said a seventh day of
rain Wednesday made it impossible for airplanes or helicopters to
fly.
	   And with roads and bridges washed away, air was the only way to
reach many communities, where local reporters said dozens of people
are trapped by floodwaters on rooftops and river islands.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo late Tuesday ordered 1,100 troops and
two large jets loaded with doctors, medical equipment and
specialized personnel to Chiapas.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast, and said at least 25,000 people in more
than 50 towns and villages were driven from their houses by
rampaging rivers and creeks.
	   State officials said 25 people had drowned in Chiapas by Tuesday
night and nearly 50 more were missing. Another seven people died in
flash flooding in other parts of Mexico, which is being battered by
a tropical storm in the Pacific and a tropical depression in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the threat of overflowing
dams forced workers to cut away road repairs made after the passage
of Hurricane Isis last week so that the new waters could escape.
	   Lines outside grocery stores in Tapachula extended for a block
as residents sought to buy foodstuffs. But the situation was worse
further northwest along the coast.
	   ``We are very afraid that the death toll will increase, people
are dying because their houses suddenly were swept up in the
river,'' said Gilberto de los Santos, mayor of the coastal town of
Pijijiapan where 18 people have drowned so far.
	   ``There is no way to bury the corpses ... the river keeps rising
and the rain still keeps coming,'' De los Santos said.

Security Council moves closer to suspending Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with UN chief saying Iraq must
cooperate, vote on resolution possible Wednesday night. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday Iraq must allow U.N. arms inspectors to do their job
before the Security Council can even consider easing or lifting
economic sanctions.
	   Annan said he was prepared to do whatever he could to help
defuse the latest impasse over the stalled inspections but said he
had no immediate plans to visit Baghdad. The U.N. chief's visit to
the Iraqi capital in February, when the last crisis over
inspections arose, staved off threatened U.S. and British
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Annan spoke to reporters as the council prepared to adopt a
resolution that would punish Iraq for freezing cooperation with
U.N. weapons experts by suspending periodic reviews of economic
sanctions.
	   The council president, Hans Dahlgren of Sweden, said a vote
could come as early as Wednesday night, though no vote had been
scheduled by Wednesday afternoon.
	   Though highly symbolic, the move would essentially leave Iraq
with no means to have the 8-year-old measures lifted.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   As a concession to permanent council members Russia, France and
China, the U.S.-British sponsored draft allows for a comprehensive
look at sanctions once Iraq resumes cooperation. Such a review
could lead to the council acknowledging some progress in the United
Nations' effort to disarm Iraq.
	   France, which along with Russia and China takes a more
sympathetic line towards Baghdad, wants the resolution to call for
the U.N. chief to report to the council as soon as possible on the
status of Iraq's overall disarmament, diplomats said. That report
could set the stage for a comprehensive review, which Annan himself
has proposed.
	   When asked how he would proceed with such a review, Annan
deferred to the council. ``I think it is something the council will
have to decide how they want to proceed with the review,'' he said.
	   He said he had urged Iraq to rescind its decision to stop
cooperation during a meeting with Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan at the recent Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South
Africa.
	   ``I did tell them that it was essential that they rescind the
decision and come back into compliance,'' he said. ``For quite a
while they've been anxious to see light at the end of the tunnel
and the only way that will happen and quickly is enhanced
cooperation.''
	   ``Because without that they would be making it difficult for the
council to talk of lifting sanctions,'' he said.

Annan welcomes charges dropped against all Nigerian exiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The stated intention by Nigeria's military
leader to drop charges against all Nigerian exiles was welcomed
Wednesday by the U.N. secretary-general.
	   Kofi Annan welcomed Tuesday's release of 20 Ogoni political
prisoners arrested for murder alongside Nigerian author Ken
Saro-Wiwa.
	   Nigeria's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has freed
scores of detainees and pledged a return to civilian rule by the
end of May. National elections are scheduled for Feb. 27.
	   ``The secretary-general continues to be encouraged by positive
actions taken by General Abubakar to restore confidence in
government institutions and facilitate a democratic transition to
civilian rule,'' Annan said in a statement.
	   Abubakar, who assumed power in early June following Gen. Sani
Abacha's sudden death, on Tuesday again invited the country's
political exiles to return, saying he had asked his justice
minister to drop felony charges against many of them.
	   Although the international community began rebuilding diplomatic
ties with Nigeria since then, some activists remain wary of the
military regime's promises for democratic change.
	   Nigeria's last presidential elections, held in 1993, were
annulled by the military.
	   Under Saro-Wiwa's leadership, Ogoni activists had campaigned
against alleged pollution by Shell Oil in the oil-producing Niger
Delta. Violent disruptions of oil production by disgruntled
communities still occur.
	   The prisoners had been held without trial since 1994 for the
slayings of four traditional chiefs allied to Abacha. Saro-Wiwa, an
award-winning playwright and author, and eight others were put to
death in November 1995 in connection with the killings, sparking
widespread international outrage and condemnation of Nigeria's
military rulers.
	   There were originally 20 accused, but one youth died in custody.

U.S. Embassy cites threats in warning citizens in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon warned
Americans Wednesday to exercise ``extreme caution'' after it
received threats that the compound may be attacked.
	   Embassy spokeswoman Maha Hamdan said the U.S. government
``received information about the possibility that the U.S. Embassy
in Beirut be subject to an attack similar to those carried out
against its embassies'' in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The statement said no threats were made against Americans or
U.S. companies in Lebanon and no specific information was available
on the threats against the embassy compound.
	   But ``U.S. subjects may be in danger and therefore the embassy
urges its citizens to exercise extreme caution,'' she said.
	   Hamdan said stepped-up security around the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut was part of routine precautionary measures taken around the
world in the wake of the bombings in Africa.
	   Security around the U.S. Embassy, located in the hilltop Beirut
suburb of Aukar, is generally tight.
	   The compound was the target of a suicide bombing in September
1984 that killed 14 people.
	   In April 1983, the main embassy building in Beirut was
devastated by a suicide bomber, killing 63 people. The Marine base
at Beirut airport was destroyed by another suicide bomber in
October 1983, killing 241 American servicemen.
	   Muslim extremists claimed responsibility for those attacks.
	   Today, the compound at Aukar is protected by metal gates, barbed
wire, floodlights and detection equipment. Scores of Lebanese
guards help a Marine contingent protect the compound and its
periphery. Lebanese troops also are stationed outside the compound
for extra protection.
	   A 10-year-old travel ban against American travel to Lebanon was
lifted in July last year because of improved security as the
country shed the violent image it acquired during the 1975-90 civil
war. But American diplomats continue to drive in the country in
heavily guarded motorcades and fly in and out of the country by
U.S. military helicopter through the neighboring island of Cyprus.
	   In June three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a crude
detonator exploded near the embassy compound, causing no casualties
and little damage.
	   There had been warnings in the Arab world that the Aug. 20 U.S.
missile strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for
the embassy bombings could spark more attacks against Americans in
the Arab and Muslim world.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was instrumental in persuading
the U.S. government to lift the travel restrictions, said Wednesday
that Lebanese security agencies have no information about a
possible attack on the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``Security in Lebanon is stable and security agencies are doing
their job of protecting residents, Americans and non-Americans,''
he told Lebanese reporters accompanying him on a visit to Egypt.

McGwire's home run heard round the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise Japanese reax; UPDATES with Nicaraguan reax &QL; 
 &UR; By RAVI NESSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Baseball may provoke yawns and confusion in most
of the world where soccer is king, but Canada, parts of Latin
American and Asia are as baseball crazy as the United States.
	   From Central America to Japan, fans were transfixed and even
politicians took note when Mark McGwire broke one of the most
storied records in professional baseball Tuesday night by hitting
his 62nd home run of the season.
	   The Japanese, who adore baseball, greeted McGwire's home run
with front-page newspaper stories and a congratulatory telegram
from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, an avid baseball fan who called
McGwire a ``superman.''
	   ``You have brightened up the world, which needed good news. Let
me wish you continued success in your play,'' read the telegram
from Obuchi, a baseball player in his youth.
	   In Nicaragua, the daily La Prensa greeted the feat by saying
``McGwire entered into heaven.'' and the vice president of the
country, Enrique Bolanos, said the first thing discussed at a
government meeting was McGwire's home run.
	   Even bastions of baseball apathy found the feat difficult to
ignore.
	   Italians, who normally care little about baseball, were greeted
with a full-page spread on McGwire in the country's major sports
daily, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   In Thailand, the vast majority of people have never heard of
McGwire or legendary Yankee slugger Babe Ruth. And the World Series
_ North American baseball's championship _ does not even rate a
passing mention on television newscasts.
	   But at least one television station made room in its midday news
to broadcast McGwire's home run to a population that was likely as
confused as it was excited.
	   In most European countries, where the home run chase has
received only minor attention, McGwire's record came too late in
the night to make it into most Wednesday newspapers.
	   But many papers did run stories on his 61st homer, including a
front-page report in Tuesday's editions of the Daily Telegraph, a
British newspaper.
	   Many American fans themselves were disillusioned with the sport
after a 1994-95 players' strike. But the excitement of watching
McGwire's assault on the record has put some magic back in the game
for them and brought the sport to the attention of others.
	   ``He's made a fan of the world,'' Houston Astros player Craig
Biggio said.
	   In the United States, McGwire's homer was huge news.
	   At the U.S. Open, the large scoreboards atop Arthur Ashe Stadium
flashed word of the home run to the crowd there for the night
tennis matches.
	   In Seal Beach, California, hundreds of fans packed into The
Abbey, the small restaurant put on the map when McGwire made a
``The Abbey Seal Beach'' cap his lucky hat.
	   ``I gave up on baseball a few years back when the strike was
on,'' said prodigal fan Barney Caton. ``McGwire brought it back.
He's made the game fun again.''

UN sending advisers to Addis Ababa despite failed talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The latest peace talks on Congo have
collapsed, but sending political and military advisers to confer
with African officials on implementing a cease-fire in that country
is still timely, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation stormed out of peace talks in
Zimbabwe on Tuesday, just before a draft of a cease-fire agreement
was expected to be signed. More talks are scheduled Thursday in
Ethiopia.
	   ``What we see is a process moving in the right direction, and
the secretary-general wants to offer whatever support he can,''
Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for U.N. chief Kofi Annan said Wednesday.
	   The team of U.N. advisers was expected to meet Thursday with
defense ministers of the five African nations involved in the
conflict, as well as those from two neutral countries, at the
Organization of African Unity headquarters in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, Eckhard said.
	   A lot depends on the ``political will'' of the countries at the
meeting, the senior U.N. official said.
	   ``Those participating in this process include countries
supporting the current government, countries supporting the rebels
and countries that are neutral,'' Eckhard said. ``We think there
are the elements here of an eventual agreement.''
	   The OAU was considering sending in peacekeepers to help
implement the cease-fire. The U.N. team would provide technical
assistance and help monitor compliance.
	   The Security Council supports ``regional diplomatic initiatives
aimed at a peaceful settlement of this conflict,'' said council
president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden.
	   The failed summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe marked the third
formal attempt at a peace deal since the conflict began in early
August, and the first time rebels were invited.
	   Although the rebels left the summit, neighboring countries
embroiled in the Congolese conflict have agreed to try to work out
details of a cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops and for
political reform in Congo, where rebels are seeking to oust
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has stirred
ethnic hatred.
	   Kabila is backed by armies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
Uganda and Rwanda, who backed Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu

it has troops in Congo, but says they are only protecting its
borders.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross headed into
talks Wednesday with Yasser Arafat amid reports the Palestinian
leader was worried the Americans might backtrack on prior
agreements.
	   Ross did not speak to reporters as he arrived at Arafat's
headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah for the evening
meeting. He was to meet Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Ross may stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement appears close
on a deal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank, a
U.S. official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that Israel and the
Palestinians still differ on key issues, such as the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Israel's Channel 1 said Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had talked by telephone hours before the
Ramallah meeting.
	   Ross could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to work
out in advance of a possible summit in New York later this month,
when the two leaders, as well as U.S. President Bill Clinton,
attend the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli newspapers said.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross would focus on the biggest stumbling
block _ negotiating a new agreement on security issues, which
Israel has made a precondition for a troop withdrawal.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   In a meeting Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Palestinian security officials
told CIA representatives they would not renegotiate the whole
agreement, but would consider suggested changes.
	   Both sides have agreed in principle to an Israeli pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank, but Palestinians have rejected an
Israeli stipulation that 3 percent of the area be turned into a
nature reserve with building restrictions.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians originally accepted the
nature reserve idea but then backed down, reportedly due to
pressure from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   TV reports said Arafat was afraid that Ross would try to change
the terms of the U.S. peace initiative, initially presented in
January.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said Israel had to
make the next move. ``I hope that Mr. Ross will choose the shortest
way to have Mr. Netanyahu say yes to the American initiative,'' he
said.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ While the leaders of Canada and
Switzerland joined in mourning the victims of Swissair Flight 111
on Wednesday, lawyers filed a dlrs 50 million lawsuit over the
crash, blaming technical defects on the aircraft.
	   The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of
former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, whose son, Joseph, was among
the 229 people killed in the Sept. 2 crash in the Atlantic off Nova
Scotia.
	   The suit claims there were wiring problems on the MD-11 aircraft
that should have been corrected. The suit named Swissair; its
partner, Delta Airlines; McDonnell Douglas, which manufactured the
aircraft, and Boeing Co., which now owns McDonnell Douglas.
	   The suit is likely to be followed by many others as lawyers try
to hold the airlines and aerospace companies liable for an
as-yet-unexplained crash that happened 16 minutes after the pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit. The trouble started about an hour
into a New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   In Indian Harbor, Nova Scotia, the largest of a series of
memorial services was scheduled Wednesday evening at an elementary
school sports field.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien planned to attend the service, which called for a
wreath-laying, an artillery salute, and prayers for the victims'
families and the search crews still trying to locate bodies.
	   At the crash site, five miles (eight kilometers) offshore from
the fishing village of Peggy's Cove, divers and navy ships were
trying to pinpoint signals to recover the plane's cockpit-voice
recorder.
	   A U.S. Navy ship, the Grapple, arrived from Philadelphia to join
the recovery operation, equipped with huge cranes strong enough to
lift the plane's fuselage from the seabed.
	   Investigators thus far have been extremely cautious in avoiding
any public speculation about the cause of the crash, but aviation
experts not involved in the probe have offered some theories.
	   One target of suspicion is Kapton, a tape widely used as
insulation in commercial jets although the U.S. military banned its
use 11 years ago because it was prone to breakdown.
	   Some experts suggest that Kapton-encased wiring on the Swissair
plane may have started smoking, and that the captain may have
inadvertently triggered an electrical failure by resetting circuit
breakers as part of an emergency checklist of procedures to follow
when smoke enters the cabin.
	   A detailed air traffic control transcript released Tuesday
indicates that pilot Urs Zimmermann and co-pilot Stephan Loew were
following a checklist as they battled the emergency.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, has said it is
possible there was an electrical failure aboard the plane, causing
the flight-data recorder to stop working six minutes before the
crash. Before it stopped, the data recorder showed various systems
on the plane going out in stages.
	   Gerden says the possible role of Kapton will be examined, but he
has steered away from pointing any fingers and has refused to
second-guess the pilots.
	   ``The crew was facing a challenging situation from the start of
this,'' Gerden said. ``It was dark, there were some mechanical
things that may have caused this data from the flight data recorder
to degrade, they had heavy fuel, and they had passengers that had
to be prepared for an emergency landing.''
	   Swissair confirmed Wednesday that the plane used Kapton. The
airline's chief pilot for MD-11s, Christian Stuessi, told a news
conference in Zurich, Switzerland, that no link had been
established to Kapton and a possible fire in the cockpit wasn't
confirmed. To his knowledge, he said, the manufacturer had never
called for the wiring to be replaced.
	   Swissair said that as smoke appeared in the cockpit of Flight
111, ``the crew knew exactly what it had to do:'' refer to the
emergency checklist.
	   ``The crew must locate the source of the smoke as quickly as
possible,'' Stuessi said. He said Flight 111's crew also did the
right thing in trying to bring the plane down to about 10,000 feet
(3,300 meters), where cabin pressure would allow them to open a
cockpit window to vent the smoke.
	   Wiring problems aboard MD-11s have been the subject of several
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration directives warning of
potentially hazardous configurations in the cockpit and in a rear
console for flight attendants.
	   Swissair president Jeffrey Katz has said his company complied
with all FAA directives. Those directives did not deal with Kapton,
however.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The trial of Aleksandras Lileikis,
charged with genocide for allegedly turning over Lithuanian Jews to
a Nazi execution squad, was postponed Wednesday after Lileikis
failed to show up for the opening day.
	   Lileikis, 91, is seriously ill and has been in a hospital since
last week, his defense team told the court. Judge Viktoras Kazhys
postponed the trial by one day to allow the defense time to present
proof of Lileikis' hospitalization.
	   Although Lithuanian law allows war-crimes suspects to be
indicted in absentia, prosecutors said the trial likely would have
to be cancelled if Lileikis cannot speak in his own defense.
	   ``The court's hands are tied,'' prosecutor Jonas Martinaitis
said after the court adjourned.
	   Lithuania has been widely criticized by Jewish groups for the
frequent delays in bringing Lileikis to trial.
	   Although he returned to Lithuania from the United States in
1995, as the United States was beginning moves to revoke his
citizenship, he was not charged until this year.
	   ``All this shows the reluctance in Lithuania to prosecute Nazi
collaborators,'' said Efraim Zuroff of the Nazi-hunting Simon
Wiesenthal Center, who was among the spectators in the tense
courtroom. ``They could have tried him much earlier when he was a
healthier man.''
	   But many Lithuanians oppose prosecuting Lileikis.
	   ``Are they still trying to try this poor old man,'' said Jurgis
Nainys, a 23-year-old student outside the courthouse. ``If I had my
way, I would let him die in peace.''
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in the Lithuanian
capital during the Nazi occupation of 1941-44. The charges allege
that he ordered scores of Jews arrested and handed over to a Nazi
squad that executed an estimated 70,000 people.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955. He lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, and worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.

Study finds diet drug risk to heart is small

 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The risk of serious heart valve problems among
people who took the diet drugs Redux and phen-fen appears to be
small, especially if they used them for only a few months.
	   Redux and the chemically similar ``fen'' half of phen-fen were
pulled from U.S. drugstores a year ago under pressure from the Food
and Drug Administration because of concern that the medicines cause
leaky valves. Other countries followed suit.
	   Three studies on the subject were published in Thursday's issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine. Together, they suggest that
while subtle heart valve damage may be fairly common, especially
among longtime users, it rarely is serious enough to cause symptoms
during the first few years after going off the pills.
	   In one of the studies, doctors looked at data on nearly 10,000
people in Britain who took Redux or the drugs phentermine or
fenfluramine, the components of phen-fen. They were treated by
general practitioners between 1988 and 1996, well before the scare
over the drugs.
	   During this time, doctors had no reason to suspect that the
drugs harmed the heart, so they did not routinely screen their
patients for heart valve damage. Only cases that were bad enough to
cause symptoms typically came to their attention.
	   During an average of four years of follow-up, 11 new cases of
heart valve damaged were detected in those who took either Redux or
fenfluramine. No cases were diagnosed in a comparison group of
overweight people who did not take the diet drugs.
	   The researchers calculated that there were seven cases of heart
valve among every 10,000 people who took Redux or fenfluramine for
less than four months and 35 cases among those who took them
longer.
	   ``The risk of developing clinically important valve disease if
they took the drugs for three months or less is extremely low,''
said Dr. Hershel Jick of Boston University Medical Center, the
study's director. ``If they took it longer, it's measurable but not
very high.''
	   In another report in the journal, conducted by Dr. Mehmood A.
Khan and others from the Hennepin County Medical Center in
Minneapolis, doctors did echocardiograms on 233 people who had
gotten Redux or phen-fen. They found that 23 percent had heart
valve abnormalities, compared with just 1 percent among a similar
group of overweight people who did not use the drugs.
	   Khan cautioned that much longer follow-up will be needed to know
if the valve damage causes ill effects later in life.
	   Another journal report, conducted by Dr. Neil J. Weissman of
Washington's Georgetown University Medical Center, analyzed the
results of a study of a new sustained-release form of Redux. The
study was stopped when Redux was pulled from the market. By then,
most had taken the medicine for less than three months.
	   The study, conducted on 1,072 overweight patients, showed little
evidence of significant heart valve damage after such short use.
These results were first reported by The Associated Press when they
were presented last March at a medical conference in Atlanta.
	   In an editorial, Dr. Richard B. Devereux of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said the latest evidence about the
diet drugs ``reaffirms the wisdom of the FDA's decision to withdraw
them from the market.''

Dust cloud find could broaden search for other planets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Astronomers have found a
mysterious dust cloud far outside our solar system that may be
giving birth to a planet in distant orbit around a dying sun.
	   That's a far different arrangement from our solar system, in
which the planets orbit in a relatively tight formation around a
star in the prime of life.
	   The finding, if confirmed, would help demonstrate that planets
can form even around very old stars. And it suggests that planets
populate the universe in greater numbers than astronomers had
realized.
	   ``I take a look at this and I say, `Hmm, planet formation is
going on all over the place. Maybe it's under our noses!''' said
astronomer Susan Kleinmann at the University of Massachusetts.
	   The mysterious cloud, which is larger than our whole solar
system, was identified by astronomers Michael Jura and Jean Turner
at the University of California at Los Angeles. The discovery was
published Thursday in the science journal Nature.
	   The astronomers located the cloud by measuring the invisible
electromagnetic radiation emitted by the dust grains.
	   Planets are believed to form when wheeling clouds of dust and
rock become compacted under the force of gravity.
	   Scientists are only now beginning to identify planets outside
our solar system. They have found as many as 12 planetary systems
in the universe. A few of them are near pulsars, or older stars
that give off pulses of radio waves. But most of them are
associated with younger stars.
	   The mystery dust cloud, with an estimated overall mass equal to
that of Jupiter, floats near a star known as HD44179, about 1,100
light-years from Earth.
	   In a surprise to the astronomers, the dust cloud is about 1,600
times farther from its visible sun than Earth is from ours, and far
beyond where planets are expected to take shape. Its parent sun
appears to be close to burning itself out, unlike our stable,
middle-aged sun.
	   If the cloud turns out to be a planet or planets in formation,
it may suggest that stars ``even in the process of dying create new
systems in their immediate environment,'' Jura said.
	   Such planets, if confirmed, would almost certainly be too cold
for life.
	   The UCLA astronomers acknowledged that the cloud's presence so
far from an old star may hint at the existence of a closer, unseen
star.
	   Other astronomers are also uncertain about the findings.
	   ``There just aren't a lot of observations of this kind of object
at this wavelength,'' said David Koerner, an astronomer at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``We don't know if it's unusual or
typical.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports Ross-Netanyahu meeting in doubt &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross held talks
Wednesday with Yasser Arafat amid reports the Palestinian leader
was worried the Americans might backtrack on prior agreements.
	   Ross did not speak to reporters as he arrived at Arafat's
headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah for the evening
meeting.
	   The American envoy was to meet Thursday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israeli television said those
talks were in doubt because the prime minister was suffering from
the flu.
	   Netanyahu canceled a trip to the former Soviet republic of
Georgia Wednesday because of his illness. His doctor ordered him to
rest for a day or two.
	   The mission of the American mediator may be extended if progress
is being made toward a deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, a U.S. official said earlier Wednesday.
	   Ross will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement appears close,
said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that an accord was not yet
within reach since Israel and the Palestinians still differ on key
issues, such as the scope of withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Prior to Wednesday night's meeting, Arafat and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright talked by telephone, according to media
reports.
	   Ross could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to work
out in advance of a possible summit in New York later this month

Tourists dive down to see Titanic

 &UR; Eds: Submersibles expected to return between 2300 GMT Wednesday and
0100 GMT Thursday; lead prospects uncertain. &QL;

	   OFF THE COAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND (AP) _ Four tourists were ushered
to the Atlantic floor on Wednesday to see the rusting hulk of the
Titanic _ suddenly a sightseeing attraction, 86 years after its
ill-fated voyage.
	   Two Americans and two Germans boarded submersibles that took
them 2 1/2 miles under the North Atlantic's surface, 368 miles (592
kilometers) off Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province. The
price: dlrs 32,500 per person.
	   The dives were made in defiance of a federal judge's order
barring anyone from visiting the site, because of another company
that owns salvage and other rights to the wreck of the legendary
ocean liner.
	   ``What right has an American court to stop me from visiting a
piece of history on international seas?'' asked Anne White of
England, one of a dozen tourists who joined 85 crew members and
scientists on the expedition.
	   ``After all,'' she said, ``the British built the ship.''
	   The first to go down were two Californians. Their fellow
tourists cheered them on as they climbed into a 23-foot (7-meter)
submersible along with a Russian pilot, and then were lowered by
crane into the ocean.
	   An hour later, a German student and a photographer followed in
another mini-submarine. The trip to the wreckage takes about 2 1/2
hours.
	   Each of the egg-like submersibles, Mir 1 and Mir 2, has tiny
portholes with thick windows and floodlights to allow a view of the
Titanic's carcass.
	   The trip was planned about a year ago by Mike McDowell, an
Australian living in Germany who organizes adventurous expeditions
around the world.
	   McDowell and his company, Deep Sea Expeditions Ltd., had planned
to bring 60 tourists on the trip, but that was before an injunction
was sought by RMS Titanic Inc., a U.S. company that holds salvage
and photographic rights to the shipwreck.
	   This summer, that company brought up a number of pieces from the
wreck, including a 26-by-20-foot (7.9 by 6.1-meter) segment of
rusted hull.
	   Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. ruled RMS Titanic had exclusive
rights to excavate, view and photograph the ship because it was
``preserving the artifacts salvaged from the wreck for the benefit
of all mankind.''
	   He barred anyone from going within 10 nautical miles of the
wreck. The ship, billed as unsinkable, hit an iceberg and went down
on its maiden voyage in 1912, with a loss of more than 1,500 lives.
	   McDowell is appealing the ruling. He argues that a U.S. court
has no right to prevent anyone from viewing the wreck in
international waters.
	   His ship ``has every right to be here on international waters
doing scientific research and programs, especially in this area
where no attempt at salvaging is being undertaken,'' he said as he
paced the deck.
	   The ship _ the Akademik Keldysh, owned by the Shirshov Institute
of Oceanology _ has made numerous trips to the site, and even took
James Cameron, director of the film ``Titanic,'' to see the wreck.
	   McDowell says the money from tourists is funding scientific
exploration, though he concedes that he envisions long-term profits
from other such expeditions.
	   Almost all of the tourists pulled out of the trip after the
lawsuit, but a few _ five Americans, five Germans, the Englishwoman
and an Australian _ agreed to go ahead. Some won trips in
competitions, while others paid the full price by themselves.
	   ``They are going to have to catch up with me in Sydney,'' said
Andrew Rogers, a 34-year-old Australian restaurateur who won his
voyage.
	   Nonetheless, the trip was planned at the last minute in a cloak
of secrecy, lest word get out and the law move in. The tourists
boarded the ship in stormy weather Sunday at St. John,
Newfoundland, and spent nearly 48 hours steaming south.
	   The dives take eight to 10 hours, depending on the vagaries of
weather and technology, and are scheduled for the rest of the week.
The ship is to go back to Newfoundland late next week.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross headed into
talks Wednesday with Yasser Arafat amid reports the Palestinian
leader was worried the Americans might backtrack on prior
agreements.

headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah for the evening
meeting
	   The American envoy was to meet Thursday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israeli television said those
talks were in doubt because the prime minister was suffering from

Oldest extraterrestrial debris offers clues to early conditions on
</HEADLINE>
Earth
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Cosmic grit that survived a fiery ride from space
1.4 billion years ago has been discovered in a layer of sandstone
in Finland, offering scientists a glimpse at conditions on Earth
during the earliest stages of life's formation.
	   The micrometeorites are by far the oldest extraterrestrial
debris found on this planet, according to the German and Finnish
field team, which published its discovery in Thursday's issue of
the journal Nature.
	   The particles are known as cosmic spherules, and they measure a
fraction of a millimeter in diameter. At least 18 of them were
deposited in a layer of red sandstone that is 1.4 billion years
old, at a time when oxygen-rich, life-giving conditions on Earth
were just developing.
	   Red sandstone beds of a similar age have been mapped in North
America and Asia and could yield more such deposits, said lead
author Alexander Deutsch of Germany's Institute for Planetology.
	   Astronomers who specialize in cosmic dust described the
discovery as spectacular. They said the composition of the Finnish
micrometeorites will open a window onto the environmental
conditions of the early Earth.
	   The particles also could help explain the behavior of
meteorites, comets and other features of the solar system that
probably generated the bombardment.
	   Spherules have been found all over the world since 1876, most
frequently in core samples of deep ocean sediments and polar ice.
Until now, the oldest known spherules were less than 200 million
years old, and their condition had been distorted by time and
weathering.
	   ``These spherules hit the Earth far earlier than any other
meteoric material we have, and yet they are in an excellent state
of preservation,'' said University of Washington astronomer Don
Brownlee. ``Until now, there was little hope that the historical
record could be extended further back into time.''
	   The Earth is pelted by an estimated 40,000 tons of rocky space
debris every year.
	   Hollywood movie producers and, to a lesser degree, space
scientists, are concerned that mountain-sized asteroids might
someday slam into the planet and extinguish life.
	   But the vast majority of extraterrestrial material arrives in
the form of microscopic grit. Much of it is believed to have been
shed by passing meteors and comets, but some may be spawned by
distant dust clouds that are the raw material for new solar
systems.
	   Scientists said the Finnish samples were preserved over a vastly
longer period because upon impact they were rapidly covered by
particles of quartz, feldspar and other minerals.

Anderlecht's ominous slide in Belgian league continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The ominous slide downwards of
Anderlecht, Belgium's most famous club, continued Wednesday when it
lost 2-3 at home to archrival FC Brugge and remained dead last in
the Belgian league.
	   Wednesday's painful loss at the hands of reigning champion FC
Brugge followed its worst defeat in 61 years, a 6-0 weekend loss
against first division newcomers Westerlo.
	   That stunning loss was supposed to be the wakeup call for a
glorious revival, making Wednesday defeat all the worse.
	   With an annual budget of some 800 million francs (dlrs 25
million), by far the biggest in the Belgian league, Anderlecht now
trails clubs that survive on a tenth of that total.
	   Anderlecht fans leaving the Constant Vanden Stock stadium early,
when their team was already trailing 3-0, tried to break into the
club's parking lot and fought pitched battles with police guarding
the cars of executives and players.
	   The loss increased the pressure on coach Arie Haan to resign.
Anderlecht now has a record of three losses and two draws, one of
the worst league starts in its existence.
	   Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times and won the
European Cupwinners Cup twice. Two decades ago, it was one of
Europe's premier clubs.
	   FC Brugge took the lead in the first half through Darco Anic and
when Anderlecht started looking for an equalizer early in the
second half, Brugge defender provided the perfect counterpunch.
Milan Lesnjak put the game away. Anderlecht made an attempt at a
comeback with goals from Par Zetterberg, on a penalty, and Oleg
Iachtchouk, but fell short.

British hostages in Chechnya appear in video message
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two British charity workers taken hostage more
than a year ago in the breakaway Russian state of Chechnya appeared
in a taped video message released on Wednesday.
	   The two-minute video footage was the first time Camilla Carr and
Jon James had been seen since they were taken captive last July
while on a charitable mission in Chechnya with a Quaker affiliate,
The Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Carr and James looked tired but healthy in the footage, which
was shown on the British Broadcasting Corp. The video, dated Aug.
24, was obtained by the Foreign Office on Tuesday and shown
privately to the hostages' families.
	   The couple sat in front of a dark background, and confirmed that
they had received letters from family and had access to a radio.
James said he hoped they would be freed soon. There was no message
from the kidnappers, however.
	   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity,
called the video encouraging because it was proof that the pair
were still alive.

Cofidis rider quits Tour of Spain over old drug charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MURCIA, Spain (AP) _ Philippe Gaumont of the French team Cofidis
has withdrawn from the Tour of Spain to address allegations that he
took a banned substance for a race four months ago, the team said
Wednesday.
	   In the tour's first doping-related development, Gaumont quit
after completing Wednesday's fifth leg, which left him fourth in
the overall standings, sports director Alain Deloeuil told The
Associated Press.
	   Gaumont is accused of having taken nandrolone, an anabolic
steroid that boosts muscle development and reduces fatigue, in the
Midi Libre race in France in May, Deloeuil said.
	   Gaumont denies the allegations and has pulled out to submit to a
drug test ``and prove his innocence,'' Deloeuil said.
	   The International Cycling Union, which examined a urine sample
provided then by Gaumont, found it did not exceed its permitted
level of nandrolone, which also exists naturally in the body.
	   But the International Olympic Committee sets a much lower
threshold for it, and French authorities apparently have seized on
these lower limits to go after Gaumont, Deloeuil said.
	   ``There is disagreement among doctors,'' he said.
	   Deloeuil said the allegations against Gaumont apparently come
from French government sports officials. The team was not formally
notified, and only learned of the charges through the media,.
	   ``We are stunned'' that the French have reopened this case, he
said. ``How and why, we don't know.''
	   The Tour of Spain is cycling's biggest event since the Tour of
France was marred by a doping scandal in which top-rated team
Festina admitted to systematic drug use. Festina was subsequently
expelled, and six other teams pulled out to protest what they
called harassment from police and the media.

UN chief says his lawyers ready to provide Libya with

clarifications &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya is prepared to turn over two
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, the U.N. chief said Wednesday,
and he has agreed to a Libyan request to clarify the details of a
U.S.-British proposal to bring the suspects to trial.
	   ``The Libyans have indicated that they would need certain
clarifications, which my office is prepared to provide to the
extent that we can,'' Kofi Annan told reporters.
	   Annan was meeting Wednesday with Libyan Ambassador Abuzed Omar
Dorda on the U.S.-British plan, which proposes a trial in the
Netherlands, presided over by Scottish judges and under Scottish
law.
	   Libya has already outlined its questions in a letter to the U.N.
chief that has been turned over to the top U.N. legal officer, Hans
Corell, diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Security Council has agreed to lift economic sanctions
imposed on Libya if it abides by the proposal.
	   A suitcase bomb exploded on board Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people on board and on the ground.
	   The proposal says if convicted, the suspects must serve their
sentences in Britain. But last Saturday, Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi said that if convicted, the men should serve their time in
Libya.
	   A U.S. official said the demand could be a sticking point in the
proposal, which U.S. and British officials have said was a
one-time, take-it-or-leave-it deal.
	   Annan met with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser at a
summit last week of the Nonaligned Movement in Durban, South Africa
and briefed the council on the talks Wednesday.
	   Al-Muntasser ``confirmed to me that they are prepared to comply
with the decision of the council and reminded me that that
suggestion of trial by a Scottish court in a third country came
from them and that they are prepared to go ahead with that,'' Annan
said.
	   ``But the details, the fine print _ there are certain things in
the fine print _ they would want some clarification on,'' he said.

	   ROME (AP) _ An earthquake shook the mountain towns of southern
Italy on Wednesday, killing one person, injuring others and shaking
some buildings to the point of collapse.
	   Panicked residents fled into the streets in towns close to the
quake's epicenter, about 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of
Rome.
	   Italy's National Institute of Geophysics put the preliminary
magnitude at 5.5; the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado said 5.2.
	   The quake hit at midday, striking hardest between the
communities of Castelluccio Inferiore and Laino Borgo, where the
regions of Calabria and Basilicata meet.
	   A 24-year-old Italian tried to get to safety by parking his car
and fleeing on foot, only to be struck and killed by rocks that
tumbled loose from a cliff.
	   A man in his 70s died of a heart attack blamed on the quake.
	   A dozen people were hospitalized, including three hurt when
their house collapsed around them and a woman who broke her arm
fleeing her home. Some of the others were treated for shock.
	   Authorities said dozens of buildings had been damaged and some
appeared on the brink of falling. In the 14,000-resident town of
Lauria. the mayor said 70 percent of the buildings had some degree
of damage.
	   The region's old churches, some dating back to medieval times,
were hit particularly hard. The quake toppled the belltower of one
and damaged another badly enough that authorities closed it as a
precaution.
	   Many fearful families were planning to spend the night outdoors.
	   A year ago, a series of earthquakes struck the central region of
Umbria, killing 10 people and damaging century-old churches and
artwork, including the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks faltered Wednesday, failing to follow
through on Tuesday's stunning rally, as Wall Street's attention
returned to worries about global economic woes and their impact on
corporate earnings.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up a record 380.53 points
Tuesday, fell 155.76 _ or 2 percent _ to close at 7,865.02. Its
rise Tuesday to 8,020.78 was the Dow's first return above 8,000
since the 512-point pasting of Aug. 31.
	   The drop left the Dow 43 points below where it began the year
and 1,473 points, or 15.8 percent, beneath July 17's all-time high
of 9,337.97.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish All Stars tied 4-4 with a
World All Stars team in Istanbul Wednesday in a soccer match to
mark the 75th anniversary of the Turkish Republic.
	   Romania's Gheorge Hagi scored three goals for the World All
Stars, a team comprising many internationals playing for Turkish
clubs, while Turkey's first two goals came from two Bosnian-born
players.
	   Elvir Balic, who plays for Fenerbahce, opened the scoring in the
24th minute with a powerful shot but the World team hit back five
minutes later when Hagi, who plays for Turkish giant Galatasaray,
fired his first.
	   The World team suffered an early setback when it's Brazilian
goalkeeper Claudio Andre Taffarel _ a team-mate of Hagi at
Galatasaray _ was sent-off for fouling Ayhan Akman in the penalty
area.
	   He was replaced by Jacques Songo'o of Deportivo La Coruna, who
couldn't save the penalty attempt by Elvir Bolic which resulted
from Taffarel's foul, and the Turks took a 2-1 lead.
	   The Turkish All Stars increased its lead to 3-1 in the 69th
minute but it was erased as the World All Stars scored two goals in
five minutes, Hagi netting his second in the 70th minute and
Frenchman Jean-Pierre Papin slamming the equalizer in the 74th
minute.
	   Galatasaray's Umit Davala scored a fourth goal for the Turks in
the 87th minute but Hagi made a hat-trick three minutes later,
right on full-time, when he drove a penalty into goal to level the
scores.

Anderlecht's slide in Belgian league continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The downward slide of Anderlecht,
Belgium's most famous club, continued Wednesday when it lost 2-3 at
home to archrival FC Brugge and remained dead last in the Belgian
league.
	   Wednesday's loss at the hands of reigning champion FC Brugge
followed Anderlecht's worst defeat in 61 years, a 6-0 weekend loss
against first division newcomers Westerlo.
	   With an annual budget of some 800 million francs (dlrs 25
million), by far the biggest in the Belgian league, Anderlecht now
trails clubs that survive on a tenth of that total.
	   Anderlecht fans leaving the Constant Vanden Stock stadium early,
when their team was already trailing 3-0, tried to break into the
club's parking lot and fought with police guarding the cars of
executives and players.
	   The latest loss increased the pressure on coach Arie Haan to
resign. Anderlecht now has a record of three losses and two draws,
one of the worst league starts in its existence.
	   Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times and won the
European Cupwinners Cup twice. Two decades ago, it was one of
Europe's premier clubs.
	   FC Brugge took the lead in the first half on a goal by Darco
Anic. When Anderlecht started looking for an equalizer early in the
second half, Brugge defenders provided the perfect counterpunch
when Milan Lesnjak put the game away.
	   Anderlecht made an attempt at a comeback with goals from Par
Zetterberg, on a penalty, and Oleg Iachtchouk, but fell short.

Brazilian star rusty in Italian Cup match with Inter Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Playing for the first time since a
disappointing World Cup final, Brazilian superstar Ronaldo was
rusty Wednesday as his club Internazionale of Milan edged
second-division Cesena 1-0 in an Italian Cup second round game.
	   Ronaldo, back from what he has called the longest layoff of his
career, stayed in the game for the full 90 minutes and showed only
glimpses of the form that has earned him two straight FIFA world
player of the year awards.
	   The 21-year-old had one apparent goal waved off in the second
half because of a teammate's foul on a defender.
	   Ronaldo fired the ball off the mark after a clean assist from
Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone in the 68th minute and, in the
closing minutes, made a signature run through the Cesena defense _
putting the ball through the legs of one opponent _ before seeing
his meek shot cleared away.
	   He reported to the Serie A club two weeks ago.
	   Inter owner Massimo Moratti gave Ronaldo a month off in the
aftermath of the World Cup final. The player was taken to the
hospital hours before the July 12 game and was scratched from the
lineup _ then inexplicably put back in. He played lethargically as
Brazil lost 3-0 to France. Later, Ronaldo said he had gone into
convulsions, and Moratti publicly questioned why the striker had
played at all.
	   While most eyes at San Siro Stadium were on Ronaldo and his new
teammate, Italian veteran Roberto Baggio, it was Ivan Zamorano who
scored the winning goal. The Chilean broke away from a defender and
sent a diagonal shot inside the far post in the 27th minute.
	   The second leg, at Cesena, is in two weeks.
	   Inter opens Serie A play Sunday at Cagliari.

Report: Jordan still open to returning to Bulls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ There still may be a chance that Michael Jordan
and former coach Phil Jackson would both return to the Chicago
Bulls, Jordan's agent told a newspaper.
	   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that agent David Falk
said Jordan ``definitely wants to come back.
	   ``But only in a situation where he feels he has a chance to win
another championship. So, he wants to see what happens with Scottie
Pippen, who else will be on the team and who the coach will be.
	   ``Personally, without being too much of a wide-eyed dreamer, I
still believe there are some scenarios where Phil Jackson can come
back despite the fact he has said he won't come back,'' Falk told
the newspaper.
	   Calls to Falk's office Wednesday were referred to his public
relations department, where a woman refused to comment on the
accuracy of Falk's reported remarks.
	   ``There will be no further comment on this story,'' she said.
	   A message left at the office of Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger,
was not immediately returned.
	   Falk told the Sun-Times that if Jordan would let him get
involved, he believes he could work out an arrangement with Bulls
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf where both Jordan and Jackson could
return.
	   ``But right now, Michael wants me to stay out of it,'' Falk
said. ``He wants things to unfold naturally. He wants to see what
the Bulls do on their own and what his 14 years of service really
means to them.''
	   Jackson left the six-time North American National Basketball
Association champions in June, and Jordan has long said he will
only play for Jackson.
	   Scottie Pippen said in August that he doesn't expect to return
to the Bulls after the NBA lockout ends and he doesn't think Jordan
will either.
	   The Bulls have hired Tim Floyd as their coach-in-waiting, giving
him the title of director of basketball operations until the NBA
lockout ends and Jordan announces his decision on whether to stay
or retire.
	   Reinsdorf also said he would try one last time to coax Jackson
to return, but Musburger has said that will not happen.

Former minister, aide in countdown to prison over 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
against  &UR; Basques &QR; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with confirmation that jailing set for Thursday, quote
from Vera, details on prison &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former Spanish interior minister and a
top aide will go to jail Thursday for a kidnapping linked to a
``dirty war'' against Basque separatists.
	   Ex-minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo, speaking to reporters outside
his home along with his former deputy Rafael Vera, said they would
report to a prison in the central town of Guadalajara at 7 p.m.
(1700 GMT) on Thursday to start serving 10-year sentences.
	   In late July the Supreme Court convicted Barrionuevo and Vera of
orchestrating the 1983 abduction of a Basque businessman who was
mistaken for a hitman belonging to the separatist group ETA.
	   On Tuesday the court rejected their plea to remain free while
they appeal to the Constitutional Court and ordered them to prison
``immediately.''
	   Barrionuevo said the Interior Ministry notified him Wednesday
evening that he and Vera had 24 hours to report to prison.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to death squads
calling themselves the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL,
which targeted ETA between 1983 and 1987 while Socialist Felipe
Gonzalez was prime minister.
	   The GAL killed at least 27 people. Many of its victims were
mistaken targets.
	   ETA is an armed group that has killed nearly 800 people in its
30-year-old drive for an independent Basque homeland in the north
of Spain.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera are to start serving their sentences in a
small, 100-year-old prison located in the center of Guadalajara,
which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Madrid.
	   It currently houses about 100 inmates. Vera said that as far as
he knew, none were members of ETA. ``I am sort of happy about
that,'' he said.
	   He and Barrionuevo shared a farewell breakfast with Gonzalez on
Wednesday.
	   Gonzalez has steadfastly denied allegations that it was he who
ordered the creation of the GAL. The scandal surrounding the death
squads helped oust him in 1996 elections after nearly 14 years in
power.
	   He insists the Supreme Court came under pressure from the
current conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
in convicting Barrionuevo and Vera.
	   Ten 10 lower-ranking officials and police officers who pleaded
guilty in the case have requested pardons, and yet to be ordered to
jail.

More than 4,000 minks freed from fur farm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Thousands of minks caused havoc on
roads in southern Finland Wednesday after they were released from a
fur farm in the early hours of the morning, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police believe
that animal rights activists were behind the action.
	   ``Many of the freed minks were run over by cars or killed each
other because they are predatory animals even though they have
lived in captivity,'' said Police Chief Inspector Rune Swahn.
``Many will also disturb the wildlife in the forests and many won't
survive because they are used to being fed.''
	   No other damage was reported at the farm in Kirkkonummi, 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Helsinki.
	   Officials feared similar attacks in the near future.
	   ``Fur farmers have had several letters recently in which (animal
rights) activists have warned that they will disrupt fur farming,''
said Kai Lindh from the Finnish Fur Breeders Association.
	   Some 2,000 people live off fur farming in Finland which is the
world's largest producer of fox furs. This season, it sold 2.5
million fox pelts and 4 million mink furs.
	   In Britain last month, activists of the Animal Liberation Front,
an extremist group linked to past acts of violence, smashed cages
and cut wire at a fur farm southwest of London.
	   The released minks killed three rare owls at a nearby bird
sanctuary in that case.

Night matches light up the U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ At the U.S. Open, the matches begin in the
morning and the energy arrives at night.
	   After dark, when the lights come on, the National Tennis Center
takes on a buzz nowhere to be found during the day.
	   It's like the difference between Times Square at midday and
midnight, and the players notice.
	   ``It's a bit more electric at night,'' defending champion
Patrick Rafter said. ``The noise seems to really radiate at night
more than the daytime.''
	   In fact, the place can turn absolutely raucous when the lights
go on. The noise tumbles down from the upper reaches of the
stadium, spilling section by section until it surrounds the players
at center court.
	   Open organizers understand the dynamic and often schedule crowd
favorites at night through the first 11 days. There are no night
sessions after Thursday as the tournament moves into its final
three days.
	   Tracy Austin, who won the Open twice and now broadcasts the
event for USA Network, remembered the energy generated after dark.
	   ``People just seem more into the match and more excited under
the lights,'' she said. ``You won't find tennis fans any louder or
more vocal than in New York at night.''
	   In the daytime, tennis at the Open sometimes seems like an
afterthought to the fans milling around the food court or sunning
in the stands. At night, the crowd is wired, entirely tuned to
tennis.
	   The result can often be dramatic.
	   Typical was Andre Agassi's fourth-round match against Karol
Kucera, scheduled for daytime but delayed until late afternoon. At
the start, it was routine tennis. When the lights went on, the
match turned electric.
	   Agassi became annoyed when Kucera began tossing the ball several
times before hitting. He did not hide his irritation and the crowd
picked up on it, egging him on.
	   He fed off the energy, staging a rally that was interrupted by
the rain, forcing the match to be completed the next day. By then,
the nature of the showdown had changed.
	   Agassi thought about that after losing in five sets.
	   ``Last night, it just got so competitive we could have put on
boxing gloves, thrown darts, done anything not to do with tennis,''
he said. ``Today was all about tennis, trying to execute game
plans.''
	   It was the difference between emotion and precision, the
difference between night and day.
	   It's been that way since 1975, when the Open first added night
matches to the program. There have been some memorable after-dark
confrontations on the hardcourts at Flushing Meadows.
	   In 1979, the Ilie Nastase-John McEnroe match turned contentious.
Umpire Frank Hammond disqualified Nastase for stalling, touching
off a series of disturbances. The trouble was quelled only when
tournament officials overruled Hammond, replacing him in the chair
and reinstating Nastase. McEnroe wound up winning, anyway.
	   Nobody flourished better in the evening air than five-time
champion Jimmy Connors, whose fist-pumping exchanges with the crowd
pushed him to a number of big victories. Among them was a
first-round comeback against Patrick McEnroe in 1991.
	   Connors, ranked 174th in the world at age 39, dropped the first
two sets and was one point from trailing 4-0 in the third when he
turned the match around.
	   Every point became a battle for survival, with the crowd urging
him on.
	   ``He used the crowd's adrenaline,'' McEnroe said. ``If I were in
the stands, I probably would have been cheering for him, too,''
	   Connors won in five sets, finishing at 1:35 a.m., well past
bedtime in most places but prime time at the U.S. Open.

Ajax coasts to third win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Relaxed to the point of apparent
laziness, Ajax Amsterdam almost literally strolled to its third
straight win this season, downing AZ Alkmaar 5-1 Wednesday.
	   Despite its nine points, goal difference puts Ajax third in the
league behind Feyenoord Rotterdam and FC Utrecht, which stormed to
a 4-1 victory at MVV Maastricht tonight.
	   With Ajax's fluid passing movements dominating, man-of the-match
Portuguese midfielder Dani opened the scoring on 13 minutes with a
shot off the underside of the crossbar.
	   And even sharper shooting from South African international Benni
McCarthy took the Amsterdammers into half time at 2-0.
	   But with the game seemingly won, the Ajax machine shifted to a
kind of sleep-walking auto-pilot, as surprised AZ forwards were
handed six or seven clear-cut chances.
	   But a combination of wild AZ shooting and inspired blocking from
Ajax keeper Edwin van der Sar preserved the lead.
	   Then suddenly Jari Litmanen's dribble was interupted by a clumsy
AZ challenge, and the Finn picked himself up to stroke home the
resulting penalty.
	   Sunday Oliseh's casual side-footed free kick made it 4-0, but
then Ajax finally paid for its lackadaisical attitude as Van der
Sar was booked for fouling Max Huiberts in the act of scoring.
	   By the time Peter Hoekstra drove home the fifth with the outside
of his boot all competition had drained from the game.
	   In Wednesday's other games NAC Breda and FC Twente drew 1-1,
Cambuur Leeuwarden and NEC Nijmegen tied 2-2 and Nikos Machlas' two
goals gave Vitesse Arnhem a 2-0 win at Fortuna Sittard.

A bad back and lost summer for Ernie Els
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ Ernie Els slumped in his chair, his
back still aching.
	   He is the biggest name in the field at the Bell Canadian Open,
which starts Thursday at the Glen Abbey Golf Club, and that
explains what kind of year it has been for the two-time U.S. Open
champion.
	   Call it a lost summer.
	   ``I didn't make a lot of money because I didn't play that
much,'' Els said Wednesday. ``I missed out on my summer run, and
that's probably why I'm in this situation.''
	   Here's the situation: Els is 31st on the money list, only dlrs
175 behind Trevor Dodds but needing by his own estimate about dlrs
140,000 to secure a spot in the top 30 and a berth in the dlrs 4
million Tour Championship.
	   Since joining the PGA in 1994, the year he won his first U.S.
Open as a 24-year-old, Els has never finished worse than 19th in
the money. But then, he's never had the kind of back problems that
still cause a twinge or two.
	   He had to withdraw from the Buick Classic a week before his
defense of the U.S. Open, and he hasn't been the same.
	   ``It's pretty good,'' Els said. ``It's not where it was, but
it's not where I'd like it to be. It's been a little frustrating.
I'm really looking forward to next year.''
	   That's a far cry from March, when Els atoned for his collapse in
Thailand by whipping Tiger Woods and Davis Love III in a 36-hole
Sunday to win the Bay Hill Invitational _ the only one of his six
American victories that didn't come in May or June.
	   Talk blossomed about a natural rivalry between Els and Woods,
and the 28-year-old South African looked committed to having his
biggest season ever. It turned into a big pain.
	   His back was so bad at the U.S. Open that it was difficult to
stand still for long. He finished tied for 49th, then took three
weeks off before going to Britain for the Loch Lomond Invitational
and British Open.
	   He took another month off and returned for the PGA Championship,
where he closed with a 66 _ his first round in the 60s at a major
this year _ and tied for 21st. Until this year, Els had finished no
worse than seventh in at least one major since 1992.
	   Only two of the top 10 players on the money list _ Vijay Singh
and Jim Furyk _ are at the Canadian Open. Asked why so many have
stayed away, Els spoke from experience in mentioning a long season,
the end of the majors and some marquee events in Europe in the
coming weeks.
	   A year ago, Els played the World Series of Golf and then didn't
show up again until the Tour Championship. This year is a little
different.
	   For starters, Els has only played 14 PGA events this year and,
with no guarantee he'll qualify for the Tour Championship, he had
to pick up the minimum 15th tournament somewhere.
	   Now, he's thinking about adding the Disney Classic _ a week
before the Tour Championship _ if he's still on the bubble of the
top 30.
	   ``I need a good week here, or I'll have to play another one,''
Els said. ``I would love to play the Tour Championship. I've played
in it the last four years and I've always pretty easily been in
it.''
	   Steve Jones is the defending champion at the Canadian Open, the
third-oldest national championship in the world behind the British
Open and U.S. Open. Others in the field include Tom Lehman, Mark
Calcavecchia and Jeff Sluman, who won last week in Milwaukee.
	   Singh is playing for the fifth straight week after winning the
PGA Championship, his sixth straight week in all.
	   ``I don't feel tired, and I'm playing well,'' he said with a
shrug.
	   Besides, six in a row is nothing unusual for Singh. Earlier this
year, he played seven straight weeks, from the Colonial the third
week in May through the Greater Hartford Open the first week of
July.
	   If Els' back had allowed him that kind of schedule, he probably
would be at home and poolside in Orlando, Florida, instead of
worrying about making the Tour Championship.

U.S. Embassy cites threats in warning citizens in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon warned
Americans Wednesday to exercise ``extreme caution'' after it
received threats that the compound may be attacked.
	   Embassy spokeswoman Maha Hamdan said the embassy has been
threatened with an attack similar to ones that destroyed U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 and killed 258 people.
	   No threats were made against Americans or U.S. companies in
Lebanon and no specific information was available on the threats
against the embassy compound, the spokeswoman said.
	   But ``U.S. subjects may be in danger and therefore the embassy
urges its citizens to exercise extreme caution,'' she said.
	   Hamdan said stepped-up security around the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut was part of routine precautionary measures taken around the
world in the wake of the bombings in Africa. Security around the
embassy, located in the hilltop Beirut suburb of Aukar, is
generally tight.
	   The compound was the target of a suicide bombing in September
1984 that killed 14 people.
	   In April 1983, the main embassy building in Beirut was
devastated by a suicide bomber, killing 63 people. The Marine base
at Beirut airport was destroyed by another suicide bomber in
October 1983, killing 241 American servicemen.
	   Muslim extremists claimed responsibility for those attacks.

South American stars make strong start to Italian soccer season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Ronaldo's Return &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There was a distinct South American flavor as Serie
A clubs began Italian Cup play Wednesday night, with Marcelo Salas
and Ivan Zamorano of Chile and Ariel Ortega and Abel Balbo of
Argentina contributing to their teams' victories.
	   Salas scored twice in the second half to help defending champion
Lazio of Rome avert an upset against visiting second-division
Cosenza and rally to win 2-1, while Zamorano's goal in the 27th
minute lifted Internazionale of Milan past Cesena 1-0.
	   Zamorano's more lauded teammate, Brazilian striker Ronaldo, had
an off-night in his first game action since the World Cup final.
	   Sampdoria of Genoa beat Verona 2-0 thanks in part to Ortega's
opening goal, and Balbo scored in AC Parma's 3-0 rout of Genoa.
	   There were 16 first leg, second round games Wednesday, and the
biggest upset saw second-division Brescia edge Vicenza 3-2. AS Roma
had a difficult time at Chievo Verona, but fought back from a
two-goal deficit to draw 2-2.
	   In one game played Tuesday, Torino shocked AC Milan 2-0.
	   Other results Wednesday were: Cagliari 0, Venezia 0; Reggina 1,
Bologna 1; Lecce 1, Piacenza 2; Padova 0, Fiorentina 1; Atalanta 2,
Empoli 1; Gualdo 2, Udinese 2; Lucchese 1, Bari 0; and Castel di
Sangro 0, Salernitana 0.
	   Juventus of Turin faces Ravenna Thursday.
	   The second legs are in two weeks.

Ajax coasts to third win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam strolled to an easy
5-1 victory over AZ Alkmar on Wednesday, its third straight win
this season.
	   Despite its nine points for the season, goal difference puts
Ajax third in the league behind Feyenoord Rotterdam and FC Utrecht,
which stormed to a 4-1 victory at MVV Maastricht Wednesday.
	   In Wednesday's other games: NAC Breda and FC Twente drew 1-1,
Cambuur Leeuwarden and NEC Nijmegen tied 2-2 and Nikos Machlas' two
goals gave Vitesse Arnhem a 2-0 win at Fortuna Sittard.
	   Ajax's Portuguese midfielder Dani opened the scoring at 13
minutes with a shot off the underside of the crossbar.
	   And even sharper shooting from South African international Benni
McCarthy took the Amsterdammers into half time at 2-0.
	   With the game seemingly won, the Ajax machine shifted into
auto-pilot, as surprised AZ forwards were handed six or seven
chances.
	   But a combination of wild AZ shooting and inspired blocking from
Ajax keeper Edwin van der Sar preserved the lead.
	   The third goal came on a penalty after Jari Litmanen's dribble
was interupted by a clumsy AZ challenge.
	   Sunday Oliseh's casual side-footed free kick made it 4-0.
	   Van der Sar was booked for fouling Max Huiberts in the act of
scoring giving AZ its only goal.

U.S. Navy divers brace for descent to airplane wreck, bodies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Swissair-Crash
 &UR; By DAVE HOWLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Equipped with thick, powerful cranes
and the strength to tow a battleship, the USS Grapple is a veteran
of gruesome search and recovery missions.
	   But some of the younger crew members on the U.S. Navy salvage
ship, including divers who search the ocean bottom, say they are
anxious about their current mission: recovering the crushed remains
of Swissair Flight 111 from the chilly North Atlantic.
	   Among them is deep sea diver Jason Hall, a 24-year-old ensign
from Lakewood, Colo.
	   Hall knows all he needs to about his gear _ the gasses he will
breathe to stay alive, the water pumped through hoses to warm his
rubber suit, and the danger of cutting his lifeline on jagged
wreckage.
	   But even good training can never quite prepare a diver for the
likelihood of having to pull bodies from the wreckage of the doomed
MD-11 plane.
	   ``Obviously it's going to be tough,'' said Hall, who arrived
aboard the ship Monday at the Shearwater military base near
Halifax. ``I think the only way to do it is to think about staying
busy.''
	   Among 30 divers who will work in two-person shifts are veterans
of the mission to recover the wreckage of TWA Flight 800, which
crashed in July 1996. The Grapple's crew collected most of the TWA
Boeing 747, as well as the remains of 215 of the 230 victims of the
New York-to-Paris flight.
	   Navy Commander William Robertson, who led the Grapple's TWA
recovery, said his crew was helped by a team of chaplains and
counselors who spoke to them before the mission and paid regular
visits to the ship in the following weeks.
	   ``The best thing to do is to talk,'' Robertson said. ``If you
need to talk to somebody there's someone available. Don't feel like
you have to keep it bottled up inside.''
	   Hall said he is concentrating on the good that can come from
bringing bodies to the surface and collecting pieces of the wreck.
	   ``You're helping somebody bring closure with it,'' he said of
surviving family members. ``And you're trying to see if there's a
way to prevent this from happening again.''
	   The crew of the Grapple prepared the boat Wednesday for its
mission in 190-foot (58-meter) waters about five miles off Peggy's
Cove, Nova Scotia. Lt. Commander Dave Davis, who is now in charge
of the ship, said he did not know how long the operation would
take.
	   The ship spent 98 days at the site of the TWA crash site off
Long Island.
	   The 12-year-old Grapple also helped recover heavily damaged
boats and other debris after Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South
Carolina. It pulled three crashed fighter planes from the sea and
towed frigates and nuclear submarines to be mothballed.
	   Davis said the Grapple is capable of lifting objects weighing up
to 300 tons, about 50 tons more than the weight of Flight 111 when
it crashed on Sept. 2.
	   The crew will use an unmanned remote-control submarine about the
size of a minivan _ equipped with a color video camera and grabbing
arms _ to help survey the wreckage. Large sections of wreckage will
be wrapped in a sling and lifted to the surface by one of the
ship's cranes.
	   Lt. John Oliviera, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet,
said the divers' work is inherently dangerous.
	   ``Physically, it's demanding, and mentally, it's demanding all
the time,'' he said. ``Now you throw in the victims and then throw
in all the carnage, emotionally it's exhausting.''

China wants to expand oil deals with Venezuela
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ China wants to follow its dlrs 360
million purchase of drilling and exploitation rights for two oil
fields in Venezuela with similar deals, Vice Premier Wu Bangguo
said Wednesday.
	   ``Venezuela is the first country in Latin America to receive
Chinese investments, and we are so satisfied ... we have come to
strengthen this relationship and look for other areas of
cooperation,'' Wu told reporters.
	   The state oil monopoly China National Petroleum Corporation
bought the rights in 1997. The deal was part of Venezuela's plan to
open its state-controlled oil industry to foreign and national
companies.
	   China also is a major buyer of Venezuela's trademark Orimulsion,
a tar-based boiler fuel.
	   ``China is a country with an enormous population and a huge
industrial capacity that demands more and more energy, and
Venezuela is a country immensely rich in energy,'' said Miguel
Burelli Rivas, Venezuela's foreign minister.
	   Wu is on a three-day visit to Venezuela that is part of a tour
of South America.

Report: Jordan still open to returning to Bulls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS; UPDATES with comment from Jackson's agent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ There's still a chance Michael Jordan and Phil
Jackson will both return to the Chicago Bulls, Jordan's agent told
the Chicago Sun-Times.
	   The newspaper reported Wednesday that agent David Falk said
Jordan ``definitely wants to come back.
	   ``But only in a situation where he feels he has a chance to win
another championship. So he wants to see what happens with Scottie
Pippen, who else will be on the team and who the coach will be.
	   ``Personally, without being too much of a wide-eyed dreamer, I
still believe there are some scenarios where Phil Jackson can come
back despite the fact he has said he won't come back,'' Falk told
the newspaper.
	   Calls to Falk's office Wednesday were referred to his public
relations department, where a woman refused to comment on Falk's
remarks.
	   Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, said the former coach ``has
been enjoying his time away from basketball and will continue to do
so for the indefinite future.''
	   Falk told the Sun-Times that if Jordan would let him get
involved, he believes he could work out an arrangement with Bulls
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf in which Jordan and Jackson could return.
	   ``But right now, Michael wants me to stay out of it,'' Falk
said. ``He wants things to unfold naturally. He wants to see what
the Bulls do on their own and what his 14 years of service really
means to them.''
	   Jackson left the six-time North American National Basketball
Association champions in June, and Jordan has long said he will
play only for Jackson.
	   Pippen said in August that he doesn't expect to return to the
Bulls after the NBA lockout ends and he doesn't think Jordan will
either.
	   The Bulls have hired Tim Floyd as their coach-in-waiting, giving
him the title of director of basketball operations until the
lockout ends and Jordan decides whether to stay or retire.
	   Reinsdorf also said he would try one last time to coax Jackson
to return, but Musburger has said that will not happen.

Security Council moves closer to suspending Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council to vote on resolution at 530 p.m. EDT;
comments from China, Iraq ambassador saying resolution unfair, Iraq
sees no reason to rescind its decision &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council prepared Wednesday to
punish Iraq for halting U.N. weapons inspections by suspending
periodic reviews of the trade sanctions which have paralyzed Iraq's
economy for eight years.
	   A formal meeting to adopt the resolution was scheduled for 2130
GMT. Though highly symbolic, the move would essentially leave Iraq
with no means to have the 8-year-old measures lifted.
	   The resolution marks the toughest move yet by the Security
Council to punish Baghdad for its Aug. 5 decision to terminate
cooperation with inspectors _ a decision thatn has paralyzed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As a concession to permanent council members Russia, France and
China, the U.S.-British sponsored draft allows for a comprehensive
look at sanctions once Iraq resumes cooperation. Such a review
could lead to the council acknowledging some progress in the United
Nations' effort to disarm Iraq.
	   The final draft also incorporates demands by France that the
U.N. chief report to the council as soon as possible on the status
of Iraq's overall disarmament. That report would set the stage for
a comprehensive review, which Secretary-General Kofi Annan himself
has proposed.
	   Iraq's ambassador Nizar Hamdoon welcomed such intervention by
the U.N. chief, saying ``the more the secretary-general is
prominent, the more Iraq gets interested in this whole matter,'' of
a comprehensive review. Such a review, he said, would focus on the
real issue of disarmament ``which would end up with the lifting of
sanctions on Iraq.''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq rescinded cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Annan said he had urged Iraq to resume cooperation during a
meeting with Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan at the recent
Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa.
	   ``I did tell them that it was essential that they rescind the
decision and come back into compliance,'' he said. ``For quite a
while they've been anxious to see light at the end of the tunnel
and the only way that will happen and quickly is enhanced
cooperation.
	   ``Because without that they would be making it difficult for the
council to talk of lifting sanctions,'' he said.

IRS places dlrs 6.3 million lien on Tyson's Connecticut mansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FARMINGTON, Connecticut (AP) _ As if Mike Tyson didn't have
enough problems, he now faces a dlrs 6.3 million tax lien on his
61-room mansion.
	   The Internal Revenue Service placed the lien on the Farmington
estate last month, a week before Tyson signed a dlrs 33 million
agreement with Showtime. The contract requires him to pay off the
lien.
	   But Tyson's payments from Showtime may depend on the outcome of
a Sept. 19 hearing before boxing regulators in Nevada, where he is
trying to get his license back. He lost it last year and was fined
dlrs 3 million for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a title
fight.
	   Under the Showtime contract, the 32-year-old Tyson must pay off
several debts, including taxes on his 1996 income as soon as
possible, the Hartford Courant reported Wednesday. Tyson also owes
the town of Farmington nearly dlrs 25,000 in property taxes.
	   IRS public affairs Officer Barbara Shuckra told the newspaper
the taxes had not been paid. She did not immediately return a call
seeking additional comment. Tyson lawyer John Branca also did not
return a call seeking comment.
	   The mansion has been for sale for more than a year with a dlrs
22 million price tag. Tyson's former agent Rory Holloway bought the
estate for the former heavyweight champ for dlrs 2.7 million in
1996.
	   The town estimates the house _ which has 24 full bathrooms, an
indoor swimming pool, a racquetball court, a basketball court and a
shooting range _ is worth only about dlrs 4.3 million.
	   In addition to trying to get his boxing license back, Tyson
faces an Oct. 2 hearing in Maryland on charges he attacked two men
after a fender-bender involving a car driven by his wife.
	   The outcome of that case could affect his probation in Indiana,
where he spent three years in prison for rape.

Sixty-one nations interested in ski championships at Vail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAIL, Colorado (AP) _ Sixty-one nations have expressed interest
in competing at the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships, Vail
officials said Wednesday.
	   ``I have to say we were somewhat surprised at the number of
responses to the team invitation,'' said John Garnsey, president of
the Vail Valley Foundation.
	   Garnsey said they predicted athletes from about 50 nations would
sign up for the championships, scheduled Jan. 30-Feb. 14 at Vail
and Beaver Creek. Team entries are due by Jan. 12.
	   During the 1997 championships at Sestriere, Italy, athletes from
a record 56 nations participated. Forty-two nations took part when
the championships were held at Vail in 1989.
	   One reason for the increase is the disintegration of several
countries, Garnsey said.
	   For example, teams from the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and
Czechoslovakia competed in 1989. A decade later, those three
nations have been replaced by 16.
	   In addition, Garnsey said there has been an increase in the
number of non-traditional ski countries applying for official
status with the International Ski Federation.
	   The federation officially recognizes 93 nations.

Webb looking for three-peat and return to the spotlight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KENT, Washington (AP) - With Annika Sorenstam and rookie Se Ri
Pak battling for top top honors on the LPGA money list, third-year
pro Karrie Webb finds herself in an unusual position _ out of the
spotlight.
	   After splashing on the scene as a rookie in 1996, winning four
tournaments and the money title, the 23-year-old Australian came
back with three victories last year and finished second to
Sorenstam on the money list.
	   Although she has two victories this year and is fifth on the
money list, the strong play of Sorenstam, of Sweden, and the
emergence of Korean Pak has stolen much of Webb's thunder.
	   ``I'm finding now that Annika and Se Ri have taken attention
away from me, which is fine,'' she said. ``I'm not that far off
from where I was last year. Most of my statistics are the same.
Fifth on the money list is not a bad year. I realize that I'm not
going to play like I did last year all the time.''
	   Chances are good that attention may again focus on Webb this
week at the dlrs 600,000 Safeco Classic where she will be looking
for her third straight victory.
	   Webb trailed Patty Sheehan by five strokes going into last
year's final round, then shot a 67 to edge Sorenstam by a stroke.
In 1996, she beat Sheehan by two strokes. She's hoping her success
here will get her back in the win column for the first time since
her victory in April's City of Hope Myrtle Beach Classic.
	   ``It's always good to come back to a place with good memories,''
Webb said. ``I'm working on a few things right now. Hopefully
they'll click in and the good memories will carry me through.''
	   Pak, who has won four tournaments, including two majors this
year, will be seeing the 6,241-yard (5,705-meter) Meridian Valley
Country Club course for the first time. Pak is coming off a 10th
place finish last week at the Safeway LPGA Golf Championship.
	   That is not the case with veteran Sheehan, who, like Webb, has
many fond memories here.
	   The 41-year-old Hall of Famer is the only three-time winner of
the 17-year-old event. Sheehan won the inaugural Safeco back in
1982 and added victories in 1990 and 1995.
	   Sheehan is 63rd on the money list this year with only two top-10
finishes but is always in the running here. She led after three
rounds last year before shooting a final-round 75 to finish third,
five shots off Webb's pace. Sheehan led after three rounds in 1996
but finished second to Webb.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, last week's winner, will be looking for
her third victory of the year this week but has never had a top-10
finish at Safeco and missed the cut last year.
	   Tour veteran Rosie Jones will be looking for her first Safeco
victory. Jones has always played well here and finished second in
four straight tournaments from 1991-1994.
	   The Safeco winner will take home dlrs 90,000.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council voted unanimously
Wednesday to adopt a resolution that punishes Iraq for halting U.N.
weapons inspections while giving Baghdad a way out of the impasse.
	   The council voted 15-0 to suspend periodic reviews of the trade
sanctions which have paralyzed Iraq's economy for eight years _
essentially leaving Baghdad with no way to have the measures

Palestinians rule out changes in U.S.-authored withdrawal plan
</HEADLINE>

and Ross; upgrades attribution on Arafat-Albright telephone talk &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ After a meeting with U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross, Palestinians said Wednesday night they would reject
any changes in an American peace initiative that they had already
accepted.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat did not appear before reporters
following the three-hour session with Ross, but senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat had told the American envoy the
Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the American
initiative.''
	   Leaving the meeting, Ross did not answer directly when asked
whether the Clinton administration was committed to all points of
the U.S. plan, first presented in January, which set terms for an
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   But Erekat said later the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the
importance of settling remaining differences, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   Ross called the talks ``productive'' and expressed hopes he
could help narrow differences between the two sides and get the
peace process moving again after a 17-month impasse.
	   ``It's crucial for everybody concerned that we change the
climate in this region, to change the atmomosphere in a way that
trust is restored,'' he said.
	   A Palestinian official who attended the meeting, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday's discussion was a general
one, and that no substantive issues had been raised pending Ross'
meeting with the Israeli side.
	   The American envoy was scheduled to meet Thursday with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Wednesday canceled a trip
to the former Soviet republic of Georgia Wednesday because he had
the flu.
	   His doctor ordered him to rest for a day or two, and an
announcement from the prime minister's office said his schedule
Thursday would depend on his health. Israel TV said late Wednesday
that the meeting would go on.
	   Ross' mission may be extended if progress is being made toward a
deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, a U.S. official
said earlier Wednesday.
	   The envoy will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement appears
close, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that Israel and the
Palestinians still differ on key issues, such as the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation.
	   Ross could leave some issues for Netanyahu and Arafat to work
out in advance of a possible summit in New York later this month
when the two leaders, as well as U.S. President Bill Clinton,
attend the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli newspapers said.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross would focus on the biggest stumbling
block _ negotiating a new agreement on security issues which Israel
has made a precondition for a troop withdrawal.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   In a meeting Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Palestinian security officials
told CIA representatives they were not willing to renegotiate the
whole agreement, but would consider suggested changes.
	   Both sides have in principle agreed to an Israeli pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank, but the Palestinians have rejected an
Israeli stipulation that 3 percent of the area be turned into a
nature reserve with building restrictions for the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians originally accepted the
nature reserve idea but then backed down.

Once again, Davenport in U.S. Open semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after Williams-Sanchez-Vicario night match &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Back in the U.S. Open semifinals for a second
straight year, Lindsay Davenport seems poised and primed for her
run at a first Grand Slam championship.
	   ``I've played well,'' she said after beating Amanda Coetzer 6-0,
6-4 in the quarterfinals Wednesday. ``I haven't lost a set. I'm
pretty focused on what I want to do. My goal is to get to the
finals and win it.''
	   Davenport, ranked No. 3 and seeded No. 2 at the Open, ignored an
achy elbow and blustery winds to breeze through the first set
against the South African in just 18 minutes. But then she had to
struggle a bit in the second after being forced off the court a
couple of times because of passing showers.
	   ``It was tough stopping and starting, then stopping and starting
again,'' she said. ``It's hard mentally more than anything.''
	   The elbow didn't need the extra work.
	   ``I think if anything, it's pretty much made me concentrate on
just making first serves, not going for it too much, stuff that I
need to do,'' she said.
	   Coetzer turned stubborn at the end, fighting off four match
points before Davenport finally converted the fifth one.
	   ``It was tough, especially in these conditions,'' Davenport
said. ``You never know what's going to happen. I really stayed
positive. When I got back to deuce, I tried to give myself another
opportunity to win the match. ... All of a sudden, she kind of
stopped missing for a while. I hung in there. I was finally able to
close it out.''
	   Now she wants to close out the tournament.
	   A year ago, Davenport washed out in the semifinals against
Martina Hingis.
	   ``I was extremely nervous,'' she said. ``I didn't play great. I
played OK. In the semifinals, you have to play great. Obviously,
the other player on the other side of the net has won just as many
matches and is still there. You have to be concentrated and focused
and play good tennis. That's what I'm going to try and do.''
	   She is in the best shape of her career, playing on her favorite
surface and riding the wave of three hardcourt tournament victories
during the summer. She won 14 straight matches before losing in the
semifinals of a pre-Open warmup tournament at New Haven,
Connecticut.
	   ``I feel I've done everything I can up to this point to try and
win this tournament,'' she said. ``I'm going to give it my best
shot. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. If it happens,
that's great.''
	   She is trying to remain low key about her chances.
	   ``I don't lie awake at night and just see myself winning a Grand
Slam,'' she said. ``I hate to put so much pressure on one match.
This is my chance to get to the finals of the Open. I had a shot
last year. Maybe I'll have another shot next year. You never know
when it's your time.''

Bayern Munich, off to dream start, rips Rostock 6-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich crushed Hansa Rostock 6-1 Wednesday
and enjoyed its most one-sided romp in more than a year while
maintaining an unblemished record in the Bundesliga.
	   Munich, off to a dream start with nine points in three outings,
took a two-point lead over second-place Hamburger SV during a week
when all other title aspirants stumbled to losses or draws.
	   Munich had last beaten a side that badly at the end of the
1996-97 season, a 5-0 rout against FC Duesseldorf. Altogether,
players launched 21 shots at the Rostock goal.
	   ``At the end we played ourselves into a frenzy. It was a
wonderful evening,'' said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   Munich opened the scoring by blitzing Rostock with a hat trick
early in the second half, kicked off by German international Stefan
Effenberg's 50th-minute penalty.
	   Three minutes later Mario Basler's cross ended in a Thomas
Helmer header. Bixente Lizarazu, a member of France's World Cup
champion, followed in the 56th by driving in a flat shot from 14
meters (14 yards) for his first Bundesliga goal.
	   But Munich, moving the ball with a stylishness and imagination
missing in recent years, delighted a crowd of 53,000 at Munich's
Olympiastadium by refusing to let up on Rostock.
	   Alexander Zickler connected in the 72nd minute against a side
that barely missed a UEFA Cup berth last season, fellow striker
Carsten Janker struck a minute later, and Zickler again in the
85th.
	   Abder Ramdane scored a 65th minute consolation goal for Rostock
against Munich, which appears to be in top form for its Champions
League opener in eight days.
	   Munich's fast start was aided when Hamburg downed Bayer
Leverkusen 2-1, Dortmund struggled to a 0-0 draw against promoted
FC Nuremberg, and Hertha Berlin blanked Schalke 2-0.
	   FC Kaiserslautern, the defending champions, also ended up on the
wrong end of a 4-0 rout with Stuttgart Tuesday. In other matches
that day, it was: Duisburg-1860 Munich 1-1, Wolfsburg-Freiburg 1-1,
Bochum 2, Bremen 0 and Moenchengladbach-Frankfurt 1-1.
	   Bayer Leverkusen was beaten for the first time this season as
German national team libero Jens Novotny was sent packing in the
24th minute after a foul.
	   Ghana's Anthony Yeboah shot from the spot flew past the net, but
teammate Martin Groth scored twice against the undermanned
Leverkusen, the last a gamewinner with three minutes left.
	   Erik Meier, inserted nine minutes earlier, had knotted the match
in the 85th.
	   Norway's Kjetil Rekdal und Rene Tretschok shot Berlin to the
home victory over Schalke.

Manchester United puts focus back on the field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fired in two
goals each as Manchester United put in a vintage performance
Wednesday to beat Charlton 4-1 and return the focus of all its fans
back on the field.
	   Threatened violent protests by angry Manchester United fans
against the record 623 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) take-over bid
by Rupert Murdoch's satellite television company BSkyB failed to
materialize at the Premier League match.
	   The Red Devils, winless in two earlier Premier League matches,
obliterated a Charlton Athletic team which had not conceded a goal
in its first three games.
	   Charlton's Australian goalkeeper Sasa Ilic suffered as
Manchester United stars Yorke, the club's new 12.6 million pound
(dlrs 20 million) signing, and Norwegian Solskjaer stole center
stage.
	   Charlton took a stunning 1-0 lead against the run of play when
Mark Kinsella drove a 25-yard shot through a pack of players, after
Yorke, Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Solskjaer had missed early
chances for United.
	   But Solskjaer, a surprise replacement for regular striker Andy
Cole, fired in the first from outside the area in the 38th minute.
	   Yorke scored on either side of the halftime break and then
Solskjaer put the issue beyond doubt with the clincher in the 62nd
minute.
	   Meanwhile, Liverpool stormed to the top of the Premier League
standings with a 2-0 win over Coventry at Anfield.
	   The Merseysiders, undefeated in four matches, took a 1-0 lead in
the fifth minute through Patrik Berger. Jamie Redknapp increased
the margin in the third minute of the second half when Steve
McManaman and Michael Owen combined to put him into space in front
of goal.
	   Owen could have scored two goals, netting the ball once in each
half, but both were disallowed for off-side infringements.
	   Wimbledon fought back from three goals down to score an upset
4-3 win over West Ham at Upton Park and move into fourth place in
the League.
	   The Dons looked sure-losers at 3-0 down after 26 minutes but
snatched one of the most amazing reversals in Premier League
history when Efan Ekoku grabbed the clincher in the dying minutes.
	   The Hammers had opened up a seemingly unbeatable lead after John
Hartson scored in the sixth minute and England striker and former
Arsenal captain Ian Wright exploited huge gaps in the defense to
score two goals.
	   But Wimbledon fought back to 3-1 at halftime when Marcus Gayle
scored in the 30th minute to register the first of his two goals.
	   Jason Euell reduced the deficit after a mistake in the home
defence and Gayle's second goal leveled the game in the 76th
minute.
	   A Lee Hendrie penalty in the 63rd minute gave Aston Villa a 1-0
win over Newcastle, which was enough to elevate the Claret and
Blues into second place in the league standings.
	   At White Hart Lane, acting manager David Pleat steered Tottenham
to its first win since head coach Christian Gross was sacked last
Saturday.
	   Frenchman David Ginola came to the fore in the absence of the
Spurs two England stars, Sol Campbell and Darren Anderton, scoring
both goals in a 2-1 win over Blackburn.
	   The win gave Spurs its second successive win, reversing the
North London club's first two results when it conceded six goals in
two losses.
	   Defending champions Arsenal registered its third consecutive tie
of the Premier League campaign with a 0-0 result against Chelsea at
Stamford Bridge.
	   Arsenal's Lee Dixon was sent off and the Gunners were lucky to
escape with a tie as Chelsea's foreign legion extended its winless
campaign.
	   Middlesbrough midfielder Paul Gascoigne, controversially axed
from England's squad for the France 98 World Cup, scored his first
goal of the Premier League season just before halftime in Boro's
1-0 win over Leicester.
	   At Pride Park, Dean Sturridge's goal in the 23rd minute fired
Derby to its first win of the season, a 1-0 win over Sheffield
Wednesday.
	   In the Scottish League Cup matches, Hearts grabbed a win over
Ross County in a 3-0 penalty shootout after the scores were level
1-1 at fulltime.

UNITED NATIONS: measures lifted.

<TEXT>
	   But in a concession to France, Russia and China, the
resolution's co-sponsors _ Britain and the United States _ agreed
to conduct a comprehensive review on the overall sanctions regime.
Such a move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress
over seven years of intrusive inspections.
	   In another compromise to France, the final resolution calls on
the U.N. chief to report to the council on the status of Iraq's
disarmament _ a move the United States had opposed.

	   Britain's ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's involvement would be ``quite useful,'' since it would
allow the U.N. chief to give his own expertise on his dealings with
Iraq ``to ensure there is a positive responsive attitude from Iraq
to the requirements of the council.''
	   ``What this means is that the council is expressing to Iraq the
fact that the road is open to Iraq to move forward and to get rid
of sanctions if it responds to Security Council's requirements,''
Greenstock said. ``The mechanisms for that are being adapted to
make it slightly easier for Iraq to respond to those
requirements.''
	   Iraq's ambassador Nizar Hamdoon welcomed such intervention by
the U.N. chief, saying ``the more the secretary-general is
prominent, the more Iraq gets interested in this whole matter,'' of
a comprehensive review.
	   Such a review, he said, would focus on the real issue of
disarmament ``which would end up with the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq.
	   The resolution marks the toughest move yet by the Security
Council to punish Baghdad for its Aug. 5 decision to terminate
cooperation with inspectors, a decision that has stalled searches
of suspected weapons sites.
	   Though highly symbolic, the move would essentially leave Iraq
with no means to have the 8-year-old measures lifted. And it
scuttles a major six-month review of sanctions scheduled for
October, when Russia, France and China were to have made a push for
easing the measures. Those three permanent members generally take a
more sympathetic view towards Baghdad.

UNITED NATIONS: towards Baghdad.

	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq rescinded cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Annan said he had urged Iraq to rescind its decision to stop
cooperation during a meeting with Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan at the recent Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South
Africa.
	   ``I did tell them that it was essential that they rescind the
decision and come back into compliance,'' he said. ``For quite a
while they've been anxious to see light at the end of the tunnel
and the only way that will happen and quickly is enhanced
cooperation. Because without that they would be making it difficult
for the council to talk of lifting sanctions.''

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians left a meeting with U.S.
envoy Dennis Ross on Wednesday night saying they will reject any
changes in an American peace initiative that they had already
accepted.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat did not appear following the
three-hour session with Ross, but senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said Arafat had told the American envoy the
Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the American
initiative.''
	   Leaving the meeting, Ross did not answer directly when asked
whether the United States was committed to all points of the U.S.
plan, first presented in January, which set terms for an Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   But Erekat later said the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the
importance of settling remaining differences, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   Ross called the talks ``productive'' and expressed hopes he
could help narrow differences between the two sides and get the
peace process moving again after a 17-month impasse.
	   ``It's crucial for everybody concerned that we change the
climate in this region, to change the atmomosphere in a way that
trust is restored,'' he said.
	   A Palestinian official who attended the meeting, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday's discussion was a general
one, and that no substantive issues had been raised pending Ross'
meeting with the Israeli side.
	   The American envoy was scheduled to meet Thursday with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Wednesday canceled a trip
to the former Soviet republic of Georgia Wednesday because he had
the flu.
	   His doctor ordered him to rest for a day or two, and an
announcement from the prime minister's office said his schedule
Thursday would depend on his health. Israel TV said late Wednesday
that the meeting would go on.
	   Ross' mission may be extended if progress is being made toward a
deal on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, a U.S. official
said earlier Wednesday.
	   The envoy will stay ``a week or more'' if an agreement appears
close, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   However, U.S. officials cautioned that Israel and the
Palestinians still differ on key issues, such as the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation.

Murdoch buys Manchester United for record price

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sparking fan protest and rage in British tabloids,
leaders of the Manchester United soccer club Wednesday announced a
623.4 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) agreement to sell the storied
franchise to one of Rupert Murdoch's television companies.
	   The deal _ the largest amount ever paid for a sports team _
prompted cries of ''Sold To The Red Devil'' in large, bold
headlines in the tabloid The Mirror on Wednesday, next to a picture
of Murdoch with horns.
	   And fans protested at Manchester United's home game Wednesday
night, hurling abuse at the club's Chief Executive Martin Edwards,
and carrying banners that read, ``The end is nigh, thanks to
Edwards and Sky.'' But the number of protesters were less than
expected.
	   The deal with BSkyB satellite TV company to buy the soccer club,
which boasts fans as far away as South African and Malta, nearly
doubles what billionaire Alfred Lerner paid this week for the
Cleveland Browns football team, the most expensive sports team
transaction in U.S. history.
	   The Manchester United deal prompted concerns among both fans and
government officials that Murdoch, the Australian-born media
magnate, would have a stranglehold on televising Premier League
soccer games.
	   It still must be approved by shareholders and government
regulators.
	   ``Rupert Murdoch might have walked all over the U.S. and the
rest of the world, but he's not going to walk over Manchester
United,'' said Andy Walsh, chairman of the Independent Manchester
United Supporters' Association. ``It is now up to the fans to show
they are not going to stand idly by and let this club be ripped
from our grasp.''
	   But at joint news conferences Wednesday, Mark Booth, BSkyB's
chief executive officer, and Manchester United's Edwards insisted
the sale would do nothing but benefit fans.
	   ``All I say is, before you string me up, give me a chance,''
Edwards said. ``I am not about to do anything that destroys the
health and tradition of this club. If I do, I deserve to be strung
up. But give me a chance first.''
	   ``Our interests are 100 percent aligned with the Manchester
United fans,'' Booth said. ``They want to win the league, so do we.
They want to win the cup, so do we. They want to have the best
players and the best manager, so do we. They want to have Man
United compete at the highest level, so do we.''
	   Booth said other Premier League teams will have the same
entitlement to televised games, and that no Manchester United games
now scheduled to be televised as part of BSkyB's contract with the
Premier League would be changed to pay-per-view.
	   The structure of the club's organization will stay the same, he
said.
	   Edwards, who as part of the deal will become a member of the
BSkyB board, said he resents the suggestion fans are being
slighted, but protests at Manchester United's game Wednesday
against Charlton Athletic signaled him out with accusations of
greed.
	   ``I've been a supporter of Manchester United myself since 1958,
and my father and I have been running this club for the last 33
years,'' he said. ``I believe that what we've done today has
strengthened Manchester United, not weakened it, and we certainly
have not betrayed our supporters. What we've done is secured a safe
future and more prosperous future.''
	   The offer, in cash and shares, values Manchester United shares
at about 240 pence (396 cents) each. BSkyB offered 120 pence (198
cents) plus 0.2537 BSkyB shares for each Manchester United share.
On Friday, before news broke of the negotiations, Manchester United
shares closed at 159 pence (264 cents).
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government reiterated
that the takeover will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The issue is sensitive for Blair. The Murdoch-owned Sun,
Britain's biggest selling daily newspaper, switched support from
the Conservative Party to Labor at national elections last year and
Blair is vulnerable to charges of owing Murdoch a favor.
	   The Sun, under a front-page headline ``It's A Deal,'' and the
other big British daily newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp.,
The Times of London, reported the takeover enthusiastically. And
The Times was still trying to lessen protest in Thursday's paper.
An early edition carried a story under the headline, ''BSkyB asks
United fans for support'' pleading with fans to get behind the
deal.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly elected
Uruguay's foreign minister as president of its 53rd session, which
opened Wednesday with calls for consensus on such issues as
disarmament, terrorism, human rights and reform.
	   Didier Opertti, who replaces Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, urged
the 185 U.N. member states adopt a ``spirit of tolerance,'' as it
sets about its program of work for the next year.
	   The main themes of the assembly's agenda represent the biggest
challenges facing the United Nations today, he said, citing the
Asian financial crisis, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human
rights abuses, drug trafficking and U.N. reform.
	   ``I respectfully appeal to all states represented here to
endeavour to reach a consensus that will enable us to identify
common, universal interests,'' Opertti said.
	   In his farewell speech, Udovenko lamented that the assembly's
52nd session failed to overcome regional interests and reach
consensus on modernizing the world body to make it more efficient
and representative of the globe itself.
	   Among other things, the assembly postponed action on enlarging
the 15-member Security Council, effectively the U.N. board of
directors, and setting time limits for new U.N. programs so they
don't outlive their effectiveness.
	   Although the U.N. chief's proposals for reform were embraced,
``all we can offer was the decision to send a considerable bulk of
them for additional consideration during the 53rd session,''
Udovenko said.
	   The assembly did take action on one major issue this year,
granting the Palestinian observer mission special status _ enabling
it to participate in more assembly matters than was available to
the mission as a regular observer, and allowing the Palestinians to
take part in general debate for the first time.
	   PLO leader Yasser Arafat plans to use his speech to try to gain
support for plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999,
Palestinian officials have said.
	   Following the marathon of speeches, the assembly will get down
to work in its agenda, which this year has two new items: granting
observer status for two inter-governmental organizations _ the
Association of Caribbean States and the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development.
	   Also upcoming is a special meeting Oct. 6 to commemorate 50
years of U.N. peacekeeping operations. Another special meeting Dec.
10 will mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
	   Other special sessions will cover population and development,
sustainable growth for small island states, and the social and
economic impact of globalized, interdependent economies _
precipitated by the Asian financial crisis.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A brother-in-law of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari is under investigation in connection with a
debt-ridden housing project in the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo.
	   The state attorney general's office said Tuesday that at least
80 complaints for fraud have been filed against Luis Yanez de la
Barrera for failing to complete a 600-unit housing project in the
Caribbean resort city of Cancun.
	   State attorney general Miguel de Jesus Peyreffite said that most
of the money Yanez owes was loaned by Banco Union, which was seized
by the government four years ago.
	   The rest is owed to people who bought about 100 of the houses,
which are still unfinished.
	   Peyreffite said he did not know the total amount Yanez owes, but
described it as ``considerable.'' The bank's former principal
owner, Carlos Cabal Peniche, fled Mexico in September 1994 and is a
fugitive.
	   ___
	   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Unsolved murders, drug gang
shootouts, youth gang violence _ those are big-city woes long
familiar to residents of this huge border city. Now police are
warning of another threat: men bearing lemonade.
	   The newspaper El Diario de Juarez reported Wednesday that police
had recorded three cases of auto thieves giving drugged lemonade to
their victims and then making off with pickup trucks.
	   Luis Carlos Tarango, chief of the Chihuahua state police auto
theft section, said the first case occurred Aug. 4 when a man
approached Arturo Veloz Zuniga and offered him money to help
transport some furniture in his 1961-model pickup truck.
	   When they had loaded the furniture, the man offered Veloz a
lemonade and the truck owner rapidly fell asleep on the grass of a
park, awaking the next morning with no sign of his truck.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A city prosecutor has been arrested after
police tape recorded him demanding and accepting a bribe to avoid
reviving a fraud case, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The victim of the extortion attempt wore a microphone as he met
with Salvador Sanchez Flores on Tuesday and gave the man 25,000
pesos _ about dlrs 2,500 _ in bills treated to leave a stain on the
skin, the daily Reforma reported.
	   Sanchez Flores was accused of extortion and could face eight
years in prison.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ More than 14,000 public
secondary-school teachers held a one-day strike on Wednesday to
demand better pay.
	   Teachers union president Melvin Martinez said the teachers might
extend the strike if the government does not meet demands to raise
pay to dlrs 3.18 an hour from dlrs 1.70 over the next four years.
Teachers now earn about dlr 200 a month.
	   The strike affects some 300,000 students at 300 schools.
	   Education Minister Ramon Calix Figueroa said the demand was
under study but he said it was impossible to respond immediately.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Police on Wednesday used tear gas and
water cannons to scatter masked students protesting the upcoming
25th anniversary of the bloody military coup led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
	   There were no reports of arrests during the clashes. Reporters
saw at least two women injured, but apparently not seriously.
	   The students took to the street after a campus ceremony honoring
Salvador Allende, the Marxist president overthrown by Pinochet in
the Sept. 11, 1973 coup, and started smashing window glasses at
government offices located near their downtown campus.
	   Police quickly moved in and the students retreated back to their
campus and used slingshots to pelt police in the street. They also
threw some chairs out a second floor window.
	   Similar protests occurred in recent days at other campuses. The
week of the coup's anniversary has brought tension and violence in
recent years.

Security Council suspends Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council voted unanimously
Wednesday to punish Iraq for halting U.N. weapons inspections in a
resolution that also left Baghdad a way out of the impasse.
	   The council voted 15-0 to suspend periodic reviews of the trade
sanctions which have paralyzed Iraq's economy for eight years _
essentially leaving Baghdad with no way to have the measures
lifted.
	   But in a concession to France, Russia and China, the
resolution's co-sponsors _ Britain and the United States _ agreed
to a comprehensive review on the overall sanctions regime once Iraq
resumes cooperation. Such a move could force the council to
acknowledge Iraq's progress over seven years of intrusive
inspections.
	   In another, last-minute concession to France, the final
resolution calls on the U.N. chief to report to the council on his
views on the status of Iraq's disarmament _ a move the United
States had opposed in an earlier draft because it could have taken
reporting authority away from inspectors, a U.S. official said.
	   Nevertheless, Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United
States was pleased with the outcome of the final draft, which made
the U.N. chief's involvement less specific in nature.
	   ``This is the light at the tunnel that the Iraqi side is always
talking about and it's the only route to the lifting of
sanctions,'' Burleigh said.
	   Britain's ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, also claimed success,
saying Secretary-General Kofi Annan's involvement would be ``quite
useful,'' since it would allow the U.N. chief to use his own
expertise from his prior dealings with Iraq.
	   ``What this means is that the council is expressing to Iraq the
fact that the road is open to Iraq to move forward and to get rid
of sanctions if it responds to Security Council's requirements,''
Greenstock said. ``The mechanisms for that are being adapted to
make it slightly easier for Iraq to respond to those
requirements.''
	   Iraq's ambassador Nizar Hamdoon welcomed such intervention by
the U.N. chief, saying ``the more the secretary-general is
prominent, the more Iraq gets interested in this whole matter,'' of
a comprehensive review.
	   Such a review, he said, would focus on the real issue of
disarmament ``which would end up with the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq.''
	   The resolution marks the toughest move yet by the Security
Council to punish Baghdad for its Aug. 5 decision to terminate
cooperation with inspectors, stalling searches of suspected weapons
sites.
	   The move scuttles a major six-month review of sanctions
scheduled for October, when Russia, France and China were to have
made a push for easing the measures.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq rescinded cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Annan said he had urged Iraq to resume cooperation during a
meeting with Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan at the recent
Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa.
	   ``I did tell them that it was essential that they rescind the
decision and come back into compliance,'' he said. ``For quite a
while they've been anxious to see light at the end of the tunnel
and the only way that will happen and quickly is enhanced
cooperation. Because without that they would be making it difficult
for the council to talk of lifting sanctions.''

Sleep-starved McGwire ready to add to record

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ No day off for baseball's new home run king. A
capacity crowd wouldn't allow it.
	   A day after he hit No. 62 in front of an adoring home crowd in
St. Louis, a sleepless Mark McGwire took his home run show on the
road Wednesday. He didn't get to bed until the early morning hours
and then found he couldn't nod off as history played out in his
mind.
	   When he got to Cinergy Field for a game against the Cincinnati
Reds, he resisted the temptation to sit out and let it sink in.
There were too many fans for that.
	   ``I'm going to have one or two at-bats,'' he said. ``When you've
got 50,000 fans out there, you've got to make some sort of
showing.''
	   The Reds sold out both games of the series and were expecting
their biggest weekday crowds since Sept. 10-11, 1985, when another
of baseball's most revered records was falling _ Pete Rose passed
Ty Cobb as the career hits leader in Cincinnati.
	   Fans showing up to see Big Mac were disappointed that No. 62 had
gone out in St. Louis, but figured it was appropriate that he did
it at home. Besides, every homer from now on is another record.
	   ``When he hits one, it's still history,'' said 15-year-old
Derrick Smith, who brought a fishing net to Section 237 in left
field hoping for a homer. ``I was hoping he would play and I
figured he would because he is a fan person.''
	   ``Hey, we wouldn't be here on a school night if it wasn't for
him,'' said Mark Brown, 42, who made the two-hour drove from
Columbus with his 12-year-old son, Alex. ``I was hoping he would
play because it was sold out. I thought he would, although I hate
to take advantage of his good nature.''
	   McGwire was good-natured Wednesday, still running on adrenalin,
as he answered the same questions all over again and talked about
his responsibility to the fans who want to get a glimpse of the new
home run king.
	   ``I think I'll finish the season without taking days off,'' he
said. ``I feel pretty good and that's the bottom line. I want to
finish strong.
	   ``Just because of what I've done doesn't mean I'll stop. There's
two weeks left in the season. As far as I'm concerned, I've got a
lot of work ahead of me.''
	   Too much had happened in the last 24 hours to take in during one
sitting, anyway.
	   At midnight local time, McGwire was sitting on the back of a
Cardinal red 1962 Corvette taking a victory lap around Busch
Stadium. Around 4:30 a.m., he and his teammates made it to their
hotel in Cincinnati where a few fans awaited.
	   ``That was surprising,'' McGwire said. ``I went upstairs and
tried to sleep.''
	   He couldn't. Not after all that had happened.
	   The rest of his day-after consisted of getting lunch, watching
replays of his homer off Chicago's Steve Trachsel _ ``I've been
trying to watch some highlights just to know what I was doing out
there'' _ and going to the ballpark, where fans were cheering for
another little piece of history.
	   ``I think people want to see McGwire in person,'' Reds manager
Jack McKeon said. ``If he hits one, fine. If he doesn't hit one, so
what? They want to come out and see him.
	   ``I'd love to see Babe Ruth play, even if he didn't hit one,
just so I could say I saw Babe Ruth play. I think it's the same
scenario here.''
	   McGwire didn't take batting practice and became flustered only
one time during a half-hour question-and-answer session with
reporters. The question: If anyone makes a movie about his season,
who would he choose to play him?
	   After pausing for a few seconds to think about it and then
admitting he was embarrassed, McGwire finally responded, ``Robert
Redford. `The Natural.' Why not?''

Ribbeck gets top job, Stielike to be trainer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS player quotes, that several veterans want to rejoin team &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Erich Ribbeck, a veteran 61-year-old
coach, on Wednesday got the job of restoring Germany's soccer glory
when he was named national team chief.
	   In a surprise decision, the German soccer federation named
Ribbeck to take over from Berti Vogts, who resigned Monday.
	   Ulli Stielike, who had seemed to be the front runner earlier in
the day, got the job of national team trainer instead, in effect
acting as Ribbeck's assistant.
	   ``Ribbeck will be clearly No. 1, he is the team chief,'' said
DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach.
	   ``He has great experience and he can start the job
immediately,'' Niersbach said.
	   Vogts also carried the official title of ``team chief.''
	   Ribbeck and Stielike will be responsible for the national team
through the 2000 European Championship.
	   Ribbeck's appointment came as a surprise. His name had not been
mentioned before as a possible candidate. He had not coached a
Bundesliga club since April 1996, when he was fired by Bayer
Leverkusen.
	   Ribbeck has a tough job ahead of him, but several national team
players greeted his selection.
	   ``He's coached successfully in the past. That's why I believe he
is the optimal solution,'' said midfielder Stefan Effenberg.
	   Germany is in a deep slump after its ouster by Croatia in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup this summer in France and the
retirement of a talented, but aging generation that had carried the
national team for a decade.
	   The World Cup failure and two dismal performances in exhibition
matches last week in Malta triggered a growing public outcry and
forced Vogts to step down after eight years in the job.
	   ``Within two days of the resignation of Berti Vogts, which took
us by surprise, we have found a very good solution,'' DFB president
Egidius Braun said.
	   ``Erich Ribbeck and Ulli Stielike can start their job
immediately. I am convinced that they will achieve the goal of
qualifying for the finals of the European Championship,'' Braun
said.
	   Ribbeck said he will start immediately. ``I will talk with all
the players that have retired,'' he said.
	   This could mean that Ribbeck may try to persuade some of the
players to come back.
	   At least three veterans, Dortmund players Andreas Moeller,
Thomas Haessler and Stefan Reuter said they would be open to
rejoining under the new coach.
	   ``Let's wait and see what happens,'' said Moeller. ``But he is a
good choice of the DFB.''
	   Nearly an entire 11 quit the national team after the World Cup,
including Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Klinsman, Juergen Kohler and
others.
	   Vogts had tried to rejuvenate the team with new, young players
but his new-look team managed only a slim 2-1 win over soccer
weakling Malta and drew 1-1 with Romania.
	   Ribbeck had already worked for the DFB and was assistant coach
when Germany won the European title in 1980 and finished as
runner-up in the 1982 World Cup in Spain.
	   He won the UEFA Cup with Bayer Leverkusen in 1988, and also
coached other top Bundesliga clubs, such as Bayern Munich,
Kaiserslautern, Borussia Dortmund, and Eintracht Frankfurt.
	   The appointment ended a hectic 48 hours, during which several
candidates had turned down the job for various reasons.
	   Paul Breitner, a member of Germany's 1974 World Cup champion,
reports he was offered and accepted the job Tuesday evening. But
just hours before the Ribbeck announement Wednesday, the offer was
taken back.
	   Jupp Heynckes turned down the job on Tuesday. Heynckes, who was
sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite leading the Spanish
club to the Champions Cup title, said he was too worried about his
wife's health to take on a new responsibility.
	   Three other Bundesliga coaches have said they want to stay with
their clubs _ Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich, Christoph Daum of
Bayer Leverkusen and Otto Rehhagel of champion Kaiserslautern.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, who led Germany to its third and last World
Cup title in 1990, on Wednesday again ruled himself out and
suggested former Dutch star Johan Cruyff would the ideal man for
the post.
	   But DFB officials had indicated that the post was unlikely to go
to a foreigner.

Sanchez Vicario by any other name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Say good-bye to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Now, it
is Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
	   Many Spanish women routinely add the maiden name of their mother
to their last name as a matter of tradition and respect. That's
what Sanchez- Vicario did after winning the 1989 French Open, to
give her mother full credit.
	   Now, she has requested a further change in Spain. In case she is
married and has children, she would want them to be known as
Sanchez-Vicario _ with a hyphen between the two names _ in case
they add their mother's name to their family name. The WTA Tour
said it had accepted the change.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; COLLEGE FIRST: &LR;  Three more woman players are calling it quits
after the U.S. Open.
	   Annie Miller of Midland, Michigan, decided to leave the WTA Tour
to continue her studies at Michigan. The 21-year-old Miller turned
pro in 1995 and moved up to No. 45, once beating Lindsay Davenport
in a tournament but never winning a singles or doubles title on the
main WTA circuit.
	   Also leaving the WTA Tour are Ginger (Helgeson) Nielsen of
Alpine, California, and Patricia Hy-Boulais of Canada. Hy-Boulais
has been on the circuit since 1985 and has been a member of both
the Hong Kong and Canadian Fed Cup teams. She became a Canadian
citizen in 1991.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; NO COMPUTER NERD: &LR;  Help comes in small packages. When the chair
umpires have a problem with their electronic scorepads on court,
14-year-old Christo Wilson comes skateboarding to their rescue.
	   Wilson, in an oversized IBM shirt, will be called to court when
the umpires report difficulties and are unable to keep the
statistics electronically.
	   He says that the referees were a bit reluctant at first to
accept the advice of a 14-year year who looks more like a ballboy
than a computer helper. But gradually, they got used to the idea.
	   Things have improved since the start of the tournament, although
the weather is causing problems now with the electrical
connections.
	   ``Before I was going out 4-5 times a day,'' Wilson said. ``Now
most of the errors we have are with the power that spontaneously
changes from one day to another.''
	   Wilson now has to give up his day job and go back to school. But
he will return for the weekend.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; MARTINA KNOWS: &LR;  While other players possessed only a passing
interest in the Mark McGwire feat, Martina Hingis was right on top
of things.
	   McGwire's 62nd home run happened shortly after her victory over
Monica Seles Tuesday night, and Hingis was already aware of details
concerning it.
	   ``I think if you see other athletes doing well, it's just very
motivating. That somebody is also doing great,'' Hingis said. ``I
mean it's a great record and there are still so many games to go.
So he can even put the record higher.''
	   Hingis said people were following the homers in the locker room
during rain delays earlier in the day.
	   ``Everyone was watching the game when he and (Sammy) Sosa were
playing,'' she said. ``When he scored his 61st (Monday night),
everyone was like, `Don't change the channel.' Nobody wanted to
watch tennis.'''

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The leaders of Canada and
Switzerland joined in a poignant memorial Wednesday for the victims
of Swissair Flight 111, while lawyers filed a dlrs 50 million
lawsuit over the crash, blaming technical defects on the aircraft.
	   The names of the 229 victims were read out one by one during the
outdoor memorial service at one of the coastal towns near were the
jetliner crashed on Sept. 2.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, U.S. Ambassador Gorden Giffin and many relatives of the
victims attended.
	   The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of
former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, whose son, Joseph, was among
the crash victims.
	   The suit claims there were wiring problems on the MD-11 aircraft
that should have been corrected. Named as defendants were Swissair;
its partner, Delta Airlines; McDonnell Douglas, which manufactured
the aircraft, and Boeing Co., which now owns McDonnell Douglas.
	   Many other suits are likely to follow as lawyers try to hold the
airlines and aerospace companies liable for an as-yet-unexplained
crash that happened 16 minutes after the pilots reported smoke in
the cockpit. The trouble started about an hour into a New
York-to-Geneva flight.
	   The litigation contrasted sharply with the mood in Indian
Harbor, Nova Scotia, where the largest of a series of memorial
services was held at an elementary school sports field.
	   The service included hymns, wreath-laying, an artillery salute,
and prayers for the victims' families and the search crews still
trying to locate bodies.
	   Rachelle Freake, a 9th grader from one of nearby towns, wrote a
poem for the service, dedicated to the grieving families.
	   ``I am helpless,'' she wrote. ``The only hope for me is to let
you know care.''
	   The Rev. Richard Walsh, whose Anglican parish includes the
fishing village of Peggy's Cove where search operations are based,
told mourners clutching carnations and teddy bears that the victims
had become part of the community.
	   ``We will never forget them, we will always remember,'' Walsh
said.
	   Five miles (8 kilometers) offshore from Peggy's Cove, navy ships
were trying to pinpoint signals from the plane's cockpit-voice
recorder so divers could recover it.
	   A U.S. Navy ship, the Grapple, arrived from Philadelphia to join
the recovery operation, equipped with huge cranes strong enough to
lift the plane's fuselage from the seabed. Three pieces of the
fuselage already had been located by sonar, and the Canadian navy
said two more large chunks of wreckage were detected Wednesday.

Security Council suspends Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST, RAISE context. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council voted unanimously
Wednesday to punish Iraq for halting U.N. weapons inspections by
suspending periodic sanctions reviews, essentially leaving Baghdad
with no way to have the crippling measures lifted.
	   The resolution, adopted 15-0, marked the toughest action yet by
the council to respond to the most recent impasse over inspections.
Previously, the council had called Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze
cooperation with inspectors ``totally unacceptable.''
	   In an attempt to give Iraq a way out, the council agreed to
conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions once Iraq rescinds its
Aug. 5 decision. Such a move could force the council to acknowledge
Iraq's progress over seven years of intrusive inspections.
	   The council invited Secretary-General Kofi Annan to give his
views about how such a comprehensive review should be carried out _
a concession to France which had pressed for the U.N. chief's
involvement in reporting Iraq's progress.
	   The United States had previously objected to France's demands.
Nevertheless, Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United
States was pleased with the outcome of the final resolution, which
left the U.N. chief's role more vague than in previous drafts.
	   ``It was a very clear and direct message to the Iraqi leadership
that the council expects them to come back into cooperation,'' with
inspectors, Burleigh said.
	   He called the comprehensive sanctions review ``the light at the
(end of the) tunnel that the Iraqi side is always talking about.''
	   Britain's ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, also claimed success,
saying Annan's involvement would be ``quite useful.''
	   ``What this means is that the council is expressing to Iraq the
fact that the road is open to Iraq to move forward and to get rid
of sanctions if it responds to Security Council's requirements,''
Greenstock said. ``The mechanisms for that are being adapted to
make it slightly easier for Iraq to respond to those
requirements.''
	   The resolution marks the toughest move yet by the Security
Council to punish Baghdad for its Aug. 5 decision to terminate
cooperation with inspectors. The decision has stalled searches of
suspected weapons sites since Iraqi escorts must accompany
inspectors.
	   Though highly symbolic, the move to suspend sanctions reviews
scuttles a major six-month review scheduled for October. Russia,
France and China _ which generally take a more sympathetic view
toward Iraq _ were to have made a push for easing the measures.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq rescinded cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Iraq's ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said any resolution that
condemned Iraq was unfair because Baghdad had good reasons for
ending cooperation.
	   Nevertheless, he welcomed intervention by the U.N. chief, saying
``the more the secretary-general is prominent, the more Iraq gets
interested in this whole matter,'' of a comprehensive review.
	   Such a review, he said, would focus on the real issue of
disarmament ``which would end up with the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq.

Britain not threatening Caribbean's offshore banks, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA BURNS-PIPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ Britain's overseas
territories need not fear for their lucrative offshore banking
industry, a British minister said Wednesday.
	   Overseas Territories Minister Baroness Symons told government
officials in the British Virgin Islands that probes into the
territories' tax incentives prompted by European concerns are not
meant to weaken the financial industry.
	   ``I am aware that there are some in the overseas territories who
believe that they hide some sort of darker purpose, that her
majesty's government and perhaps even the international community
has some sort of hidden agenda,'' Symons said. ``Let me assure you
categorically that we do not.''
	   Symons is on a four-day tour of the Caribbean that also includes
Antigua, the Turks and Caicos Islands. On Wednesday, she met with
Virgin Island politicians, inspected the territory's new jail,
attended a women's rights conference and signed an economic
development agreement.
	   The G-7 trade group and the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development have asked Britain to review the tax incentives in
the remnants of its former empire because they believe the perks
may clash with proposed European trade agreements.
	   On Monday, representatives from Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the
British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla and Montserrat
met with British foreign office officials to defend their offshore
banking business.
	   The British territories of Gibraltar and the Falklands also
participated.
	   Symons said British regulators were committed to ``orderly,
profitable conduct within generally accepted standards'' and called
Monday's meeting ``an important element'' in evaluation of the
industry.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Soldiers, doctors and rescue workers
struggled Wednesday to reach scores of southern Mexican towns
swamped by floods, and heavy rains pelted some areas for the
seventh straight day.
	   At least 32 people have been reported killed and dozens more
were missing in flooding across the country. The Pacific coastal
zones of the southern state of Chiapas have been the most
devastated.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' Marco Antonio Santiso told Associated Press Television in
Huixtla, a town 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Tapachula on the
Pacific coast.
	   State officials said the death toll could rise. More dead and
injured may be found as rescue workers, many of whom are blocked by
raging rivers and downed bridges, push into the most affected
areas.
	   ``The fact that 25 townships are cut off prevents us from
finding out what has happened to villagers there. They're
completely isolated,'' Roberto Munoz Lievano, Chiapas state
interior secretary, said.
	   Municipal authorities in Tapachula monitored a radio request for
help on an official frequency from the coastal town of Acapetagua
saying that entire neighborhoods there had been swallowed by
rivers.
	   ``We're going under. We're drowning,'' the radio operator said.
The signal was lost before they could establish his identity.
	   Parts of Tapachula, a city of 250,000 people 10 miles (16
kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, received 18 inches (45
centimeters) of rain in the last three days _ about half of
Portland's average rain for a year.
	   Lines were a block long outside grocery stores as residents
waited to buy food.
	   In Huixtla, some residents huddled in their homes, ignoring
calls by police to evacuate even as the swollen Huixtla River tore
away and swallowed huge pieces of the riverbank and the brick walls
of homes. Torrential downpours lashed the area.
	   Government pilots at the Tapachula airport said the rain made it
impossible for airplanes or helicopters to fly Wednesday.
	   Rising waters also washed away many roads and bridges, leaving
people stranded on rooftops and in river islands.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo late Tuesday ordered 1,100 troops and
two large jets loaded with doctors, medical equipment and
specialized personnel to Chiapas. Although rescue officials were
able to reach parts of the disaster zone in Chiapas on Wednesday,
other areas remained inaccessible.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast. He said at least 25,000 people in more
than 50 towns and villages were driven from their homes by rising
rivers and creeks.
	   State officials said 25 people had drowned by Tuesday night in
Chiapas and nearly 50 more were missing. Another seven people died
in flash flooding in other parts of Mexico, which is being battered
by a tropical depression in the Pacific and newly-formed Tropical
Storm Frances in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the threat of overflowing
dams forced workers to cut away road repairs so that new waters
could escape. Flooding also was reported in the central state of
Michoacan.
	   Guatemalan authorities evacuated 2,000 people from areas near
the Mexican border after rivers there overflowed their banks.
	   Mexico's Red Cross appealed for international donations of aid
for the stricken Chiapas coast.
	   ``We are very afraid that the death toll will increase. People
are dying because their houses suddenly were swept up,'' said
Gilberto de los Santos, mayor of the coastal town of Pijijiapan,
where 18 people have drowned.
	   ``There is no way to bury the corpses. ... The river keeps
rising and the rain still keeps coming.''

Peace is the greatest gift Ireland can give, says McAleese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The greatest gift Ireland could give
to the new millennium and the people who died in the terrorist
bombing at Omagh would be the achievement of total peace, Irish
President Mary McAleese said Wednesday.
	   At a function during a visit to Australia, McAleese said the
achievement of peace was something that had defeated many
generations of Irish people but was now achievable.
	   McAleese said the Omagh bombing in August, which killed 29
people and injured more than 300, was a very big test of the
commitment to the Good Friday Agreement on peace talks between
Northern Ireland's warring factions.
	   ``We are now very close to achieving the golden circle, the
circle that will bring upon Ireland in the next millennium, a
golden age the likes of which our people have never experienced
before,'' McAleese said.
	   ``We will have a peace that speaks to the world of a people who
have turned away from a culture of conflict and who have determined
in each individual heart that they will build a culture of
consensus.
	   ``That is what we promise _ no less _ to the millennium.''
	   She said that after the bombing people of all beliefs in Ireland
realized that they were going to make space for each other.
	   ``We are all people who have said `yes' to peace, `yes' to
partnership, `yes' to trying to work together.
	   ``That was our gift to those who died so tragically and those
whose lives remain to be rebuilt in the wake of Omagh. We will give
them that gift and it will be a gift that we will work to sustain
for every generation so that there will never ever again be an
Omagh,'' McAleese said.

Study finds diet drug risk to heart is small

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The risk of serious heart valve problems among
people who took the diet drugs Redux and phen-fen appears to be
small, especially if they used them for only a few months.
	   Redux and the chemically similar ``fen'' half of phen-fen were
pulled from U.S. drugstores a year ago under pressure from the Food
and Drug Administration because of concern that the medicines cause
leaky valves. Other countries followed suit.
	   Three studies on the subject were published in Thursday's issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine. Together, they suggest that
while subtle heart valve damage may be fairly common, especially
among longtime users, it rarely is serious enough to cause symptoms
during the first few years after going off the pills.
	   In one of the studies, doctors looked at data on nearly 10,000
people in Britain who took Redux or the drugs phentermine or
fenfluramine, the components of phen-fen. They were treated by
general practitioners between 1988 and 1996, well before the scare
over the drugs.
	   During this time, doctors had no reason to suspect that the
drugs harmed the heart, so they did not routinely screen their
patients for heart valve damage. Only cases that were bad enough to
cause symptoms typically came to their attention.
	   During an average of four years of follow-up, 11 new cases of
heart valve damage were detected in those who took either Redux or
fenfluramine. No cases were diagnosed in a comparison group of
overweight people who did not take the diet drugs.
	   The researchers calculated that there were seven cases of heart
valve damage among every 10,000 people who took Redux or
fenfluramine for less than four months and 35 cases among those who
took them longer.

Salvadoran former paramilitary members protest to demand

compensation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Hundreds of former paramilitary
guards blocked roads and bridges Wednesday to pressure El
Salvador's government into paying them compensation for their
service during the 1979-1992 civil war.
	   The guards, civilians who helped the military fight leftist
guerrillas, are demanding dlrs 2,000 each. They claim they number
30,000 and are grouped in a newly-formed Association of Farm
Producers.
	   Several hundred of them sat down on roads and parked old
vehicles crosswise to block roads and bridges leading into the
capital of San Salvador, creating a huge traffic jam.
	   Some roads were blocked more than four hours. Armed national
police patrolled the highways but there was no violence.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol is refusing to pay the money or
negotiate a settlement, claiming his government owes them nothing
under a U.N.-supervised peace agreement that ended the 13-year
conflict in 1992.
	   Many regular government soldiers were given small tracts of land
when they were demobilized, but not the paramilitary guards, who
usually were given old rifles by the army to patrol their villages.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Wednesday, surrendering a
chunk of Tuesday's mammoth gains, as Merrill Lynch and Procter and
Gamble provided new reminders of the country's exposure to the
economic turmoil abroad. A day after posting a record 380-point
gain, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 155.76 points _ or 2
percent _ to 7,865.02, slipping back below this year's starting
point of 7,908.25. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Share prices fell in Europe, with London's main
stock index closing down off 0.6 percent. Shares fell 1.2 percent
in Frankfurt, Germany, and dropped 1.1 percent in Paris. Stocks
also finished lower after a strong start in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In
Hong Kong, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index had jumped 12
percent in the last three days, the index initially rose Wednesday
but ended with a decline of 3.5 percent. Traders attributed selling
to profit-taking. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airbus Industrie sold dlrs 4 billion
worth of new jets Wednesday _ giving the European planemaker a
sizable victory over the Boeing Co. in their latest air show order
duel. The new firm orders at Airbus brought it dlrs 6.7 billion in
sales, based on list prices, compared to about dlrs 5.2 billion for
Boeing, after three days of Farnborough International 98. Both
planemakers also got more potential new business as customers from
the United States, Latin America and Europe took out options to buy
additional jets. Boeing and Airbus each said they anticipated no
more big deals to be announced by the end of the weeklong show that
is the industry's top event of the year. (BRITAIN-AIR SHOW)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's battered ruble rebounded against the U.S.
dollar today amid an apparent shortage of the local currency. The
dollar for next-day delivery was trading between 15 and 16 rubles
at the central Moscow interbank exchange, compared with 20 to 25
rubles at the start of the session and Tuesday's Central Bank rate
of 20.8. While some Moscow traders did not rule out that the
ruble's gains could be caused by a Central Bank intervention, most
said that commercial banks apparently were selling dollars to
obtain rubles for client transactions. Ruble supplies at Russian
banks have dropped recently when most rushed to invest in dollars
or other foreign currencies, spooked by the ruble's fall in the
aftermath of the treasury market collapse in August.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The average unemployment rate in the 15
European Union nations fell in July to 10.1 percent, down from 10.7
percent in the same 1997 month, the EU statistics agency reported
Wednesday. Unemployment in the 11 nations that will adopt a single
currency in January also fell to 11.1 percent, from 11.2 percent in
June and 11.7 percent in July, 1997 Eurostat said. The lowest
levels of unemployment were 2.3 percent in Luxembourg, 3.9 percent
in the Netherlands, 4.5 percent in Austria and 4.6 percent in
Denmark, said Eurostat. Spain continued to suffer from the highest
jobless rate: 18.6 percent, said Eurostat. (EU-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ International Business Machines Corp. has built
the world's smallest hard disk drive, an advance that could greatly
increase the storage power of digital cameras, hand-held computers
and other small electronics devices. IBM's announcement Wednesday
that it was throwing its support behind the new storage device
could help lure more consumers to digital cameras, industry
analysts said. Digital cameras cost more than conventional ones but
can produce images that can be retouched in a computer and sent
across the Internet. Digital cameras equipped with IBM's
340-megabyte drive, which is about the size of a large coin, could
store more than 300 photos _ about five times the capacity of
cameras using ``flash'' memory chips, the popular technology for
storing digital images. (US-IBM-SMALL HARD DRIVE)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch chemical giant Akzo Nobel
said Wednesday it has delayed construction of a paint factory in
Russia because of the political and economic crisis there. The
company doesn't know when construction of the new factory, which
was supposed to start later this year just outside of Moscow, will
begin. Akzo's annual sales in Russia, which include paint and
pharmaceutical products, amounts to about 250 million guilders
(dlrs 128 million), or about 1 percent of the company's total
sales. (NETHERLANDS-RUSSIA-AKZO NOBEL)

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Michael Jackson will build a dlrs
700 million theme park in a Rio de Janeiro suburb, Brazilian media
said Wednesday.
	   The bucolic Rio district of Vargem Grande was chosen over sites
in four other Brazilian cities and in the capitals of Argentina,
Chile and Mexico City, the Rio newspaper O Globo said.
	   The park reportedly will cover nearly 250 acres (100 hectares)
and generate 12,000 direct and indirect jobs.
	   A team representing the singer is expected in Rio next week to
make a final decision on the site, O Globo said.
	   Theme parks are a growth industry in Brazil. Media have reported
that Walt Disney plans to invest dlrs 3.4 billion in a park in Rio
das Ostras, a coastal resort city 100 miles (170 kms) northeast of
Rio.
	    &UR; ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rocker Tommy Lee, convicted of spousal abuse
for kicking wife Pamela Anderson Lee, has been released from jail
early for good behavior after serving less than four months of a
six-month sentence.
	   ``He didn't get in any trouble,'' said his attorney, Charles
English.
	   The Motley Crue drummer, who was released Saturday, will be on
probation for three years. He must also donate dlrs 5,000 to a
shelter for battered women, avoid drugs and alcohol, stay at least
100 yards (meters) away from his wife, attend anger management
classes and undergo random drug tests.
	   In addition, he must perform 200 hours of community service.
	   ``He's got a long ways to go, but he's done with jail,'' English
said.
	   His wife filed for divorce after reporting the attack. The
couple married in 1995.
	    &UR; ___
	   FARMINGTON, Connecticut (AP) _ Behind in his taxes, Mike Tyson
has been hit with a dlrs 6.3 million lien on his mansion.
	   U.S. tax authorities placed the lien on the 61-room estate in
August, a week before the former heavyweight champ signed a dlrs 33
million fight agreement with a cable TV network.
	   Tyson's career hinges on a Sept. 19 hearing before Nevada boxing
regulators, who will decide whether to reinstate his license.
	   Tyson, 32, was banned from the ring last year and fined dlrs 3
million for biting Evander Holyfield's ear in a title fight.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sigourney Weaver has been burned out of her new
apartment.
	   Crews had been working frantically to finish work on the
apartment by Labor Day, but a spark from an old refrigerator
touched off a fire that severely damaged the place, the New York
Post reported Wednesday.
	   Work to shore up the apartment won't begin for several months,
so the ``Alien'' star and her husband, Jim Simpson, can't move in
for another year.
	    &UR; ___
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The empty seat revealed what the security
check, the short bus ride and the trip down the airplane aisle had
not: the toddler was missing!
	   An Israeli couple had forgotten their two-and-a-half-year-old
girl during a shopping spree last week at Ben Gurion International
Airport's duty free stores, Nachman Klieman, a spokesman for
Israel's El Al airlines, said Wednesday.
	   Only once the couple had boarded the plane, along with four
other children, did they realize they were one kid short.
	   The parents alerted a flight attendant who messaged a
description of the girl to the terminal. An El Al ground hostess
found the girl within 10 minutes, safe and asleep in her stroller,
in the same spot where her older brother, had left her to browse
through a shoe store.
	   The family was reunited in time to leave on schedule for its
vacation in Paris.
	    &UR; ___
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Chris Balfe and Gillian Spiers put aside
their auto racing rivalry on Wednesday and got married at Monza
Royal Villa, a few hundred yards (meters) from the autodrome where
they will be supporting rival sides on Sunday.
	   Balfe, an Englishman and a fan of Ferrari and its German driver
Michael Schumacher, wore a necktie with the symbol of the Italian
team _ a prancing stallion.
	   Spiers, his Scottish bride, did not wear any sign of her support
for David Coulthard, the Scotsman who drives with McLaren-Mercedes.
	   ``We argued following the Belgian GP collision between
Schumacher and Coulthard,'' Balfe said. ``She sided with Coulthard
of course.''
	   Schumacher, who was leading the race at the time, was forced to
withdraw after ramming into Coulthard's car during a rainstorm.
	   After the ceremony in the ancient villa, the couple left for a
brief honeymoon along the shores of Como lake.
	   They will be back to Monza on Sunday when Schumacher, Coulthard
and other F-1 drivers battle in the Italian Grand Prix.
	    &UR; ___
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A man stole a rocket-launching vehicle from
a military repair shop in northern Norway and careened through
hedges and flowerbeds in a residential neighborhood early Wednesday
before being arrested.
	   The 8-meter-long (25-foot-long) armored vehicle, called a
Multiple Launch Rocket System, is capable of firing a dozen
rockets, but was not armed when it was stolen, the news agency NTB
reported.
	   The man swiped the vehicle from the repair shop at the Setermoen
base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the Arctic Circle,
and took it on a joyride for several hours. Police scrambled to try
to find vehicles to use in a roadblock, fearing that the heavy
vehicle could crush an ordinary police cruiser.
	   The man eventually abandoned the rocket-launcher and was
surrounded by police. He was not identified, but police said he was
not a member of the armed forces.

Panama extradites one of Salvador's most-wanted men on drug
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR (AP) _ Panama has extradited one of El Salvador's
most-wanted men, an accused drug dealer who was convicted in
absentia of ordering the murder of an entire family in a mistaken
drug hit.
	   Miguel Angel Pozo Aparicio, who was arrested Friday in Panama,
arrived in El Salvador on Monday night under heavy guard of a
special police team. He insisted he was innocent.
	   Salvadoran authorities accuse Pozo Aparicio of being one of
Central America's biggest drug smugglers and say he has connections
to Colombian drug cartels.
	   Last year, he was convicted of ordering the 1996 murder of seven
members of a family near San Salvador and sentenced to El
Salvador's maximum penalty _ 30 years in prison.
	   The massacre, in which family members ranging in age from 2 to
70 were strangled and suffocated, apparently was a mistake. The
family was renting the house of a former Pozo Aparicio associate
and had the same last name, so the killer apparently assumed they
were related. They weren't.
	   Pozo Aparicio, a 46-year-old pilot, has been charged with drug
smuggling at least twice but has never been convicted. Salvadoran
authorities nonetheless maintain he is the country's most
successful smuggler.
	   He apparently left El Salvador last year, although he insists he
never fled and simply didn't know about the charges against him _
or the conviction.
	   He maintained his innocence when he arrived at San Salvador's
airport and accused police of paying a witness to testify falsely
against him.
	   ``The police are putting on a show,'' he said. ``With the
investigations that need to be done, it will fall on top of them.''

Honduras begins extradition against officer accused of rights
</HEADLINE>
violations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras began extradition
proceedings Wednesday against a military officer accused of
torturing leftists during the country's civil war.
	   Capt. Billy Joya has been living in Sevilla, Spain, for three
years. A judge in Honduras ordered the arrest of Joya and nine
other officers in 1995 for their participation in Battalion 316, a
military counter-intelligence wing that operated from 1979 to 1989.
	   According to a government report, Battalion 316 operated as a
death squad, causing at least 184 leftists to disappear.
	   Joya is charged with illegal arrest, torture and the attempted
murder of six college students in Tegucigalpa in 1982.
	   Honduran authorities said the extradition proceedings could take
two to three months. Joya hasn't been arrested in Spain, but
Spanish police are monitoring his movements at his luxury
apartment, where he lives with his wife and four daughters.
	   Joya owns a private security agency on Honduras' north coast and
teaches at a high school in Sevilla.

White House soap opera gives way to crisis for a popular president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Congress &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The delivery of Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress transforms the Monica Lewinsky saga from an embarrassing
soap opera to a grave and wrenching threat to the Clinton
presidency. With little public clamor, President Bill Clinton's
second term in office is suddenly in deepening doubt.
	   America's political landscape has been rocked by an ominous
earthquake.
	   Few thought the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky could
result in impeachment but now the only certainty is uncertainty _
as an impeachment process looms in Congress, no one can know the
outcome. A Republican-led Congress whose leaders have denounced
Clinton as immoral and unfit for office will be called upon to lay
aside politics and lead deliberations that will decide the
president's fate. It is a solemn duty with almost no precedents.
	   Clinton partisans say the best outcome for Clinton would
probably be a rebuke or reprimand from Congress. Some have hinted
he may have to resign. With the ground quaking beneath him, Clinton
abandoned any reluctance to apologize and declared he had let
everyone down ``but I'm trying to make it right.'' He said he was
determined to ``redeem the trust'' of the public.
	   Now it is up to the House of Representatives to determine
whether the Starr investigation has produced evidence warranting
Clinton's impeachment. If Clinton survives the immediate reaction
to Starr's report, it likely will be a long, drawn out process with
televised hearings next year by the House Judiciary Committee and a
parade of witnesses. In this forum, Clinton supporters would have a
voice, a sharp contrast to the grand jury which operated only with
prosecutors and no defense attorneys.
	   For most Americans, the eight-month Lewinsky investigation has
seemed more like a library of sordid tabloid tales rather than an
epic constitutional struggle. A seemingly endless series of legal
battles between the White House and the Office of the Independent
Counsel has obscured the grave stakes.
	   ``I don't think the public thought it would come to this,'' said
Norm Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise
Institute. Clinton's job approval ratings remained high even after
he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
acknowledged he lied about it.
	   ``Rarely have we had a clearer signal from a large majority of
Americans, consistently over an extended period of time, that, `We
believe he's done it, we don't care he's done it, get off of it,''
Ornstein said. ``There was not an expectation we might come to
this.''
	   In America's 222-year history, presidents have faced impeachment
and removal from office only twice before. Andrew Johnson was
impeached by the House for conspiring against Congress and the
Constitution but was acquitted by the Senate by a single vote in
1868. The House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Richard Nixon
in the Watergate scandal but he resigned before a vote by the full
House or trial by the Senate.
	   Starr's office says its report contains ``substantial and
credible information that may constitute grounds for impeachment.''
Clinton attorney David Kendall said he did not know what was in the
report but that, ``We do know this, there is no basis for
impeachment.''
	   ``The word `impeachment' is a very frightening, scary word,''
said Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess, a veteran of the
Nixon administration. ``It's not even clearly enough defined in
peoples' mind'' as a means of indictment rather than removal.
	   Now, with Congress about to consider Starr's report, ``We're
trapped in a process,'' Hess said. ``The irony of the thing is that
there are very few people in the United States, except deep Clinton
haters, who want to remove the president from office for sexual
perjury.
	   ``And yet we are on an escalator and we are not sure how to get
off the escalator,'' he said. ``We're going to have rules, we're
going to have hearings, we're going to treat this in a very serious
way. Let's hope that Congress rises to this occasion.''

	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The sodden,
overgrown field tucked away behind the dirt-poor homes is crowded
with kids, many barefoot, all jostling for position, all intent on
the baseball game.
	   Never mind the old man on the horse-drawn cart plodding through
what the mind says is right field. Or the naked boys, splashing
each other in a neck-deep pool of mud along the imaginary third
base line.
	   With little more than tennis balls and sticks, the freewheeling
ball game _ several, actually _ plays out in San Pedro's wistfully
named Barrio Lindo _ Beautiful Neighborhood.
	   ``Sammy Sosa began this way,'' says Robert Blanco, a 19-year-old
Texas Rangers prospect who hopes to ride his 86 mph (138 kph)
slider to the professional leagues in the United States.
	   Sosa did. The skinny boy who once supported his widowed mother
by shining shoes in San Pedro's central plaza is proof to Blanco
and hundreds of other dreamers of what a poor kid in this poor town
can make of himself.
	   As Sosa races Mark McGwire for the single-season home run
record, he's become a national hero in the Dominican Republic.
McGwire set a new record Tuesday when he hit homer No. 62. Sosa had
58 home runs as of Tuesday.
	   Every at-bat, every home run, every opposing pitcher is
scrutinized on radio and TV, at betting parlors, cafes, restaurants
and lottery stands throughout this Caribbean nation.
	   When they can, sidewalk vendors and office workers rush home to
catch Cubs games on WGN-TV. Colorful headlines and page-size photos
chronicle every step of Sosa's chase, dwarfing even news of Fidel
Castro during the Cuban leader's recent visit to this Caribbean
nation.
	   In this baseball-mad country, where the offseason is known as
``the dead season'' and Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal is
sports minister, Dominicans can't get enough of the man they call
Sammy.
	   ``Another Conspiracy Against Sosa!'' blared a banner headline in
Listin Diario newspaper, when it was suggested that Dominican
pitcher Jose Lima, a friend of Sosa's, grooved two pitches for Sosa
homers 50 and 51.
	   At Santo Domingo's Hoy newspaper, sales have jumped as Sosa
became the first Latin American player to hit 50 home runs, sports
editor Franklyn Mirabal said as he flipped through the day's six
pages of Sosa news.
	   ``We are very proud of his performance,'' Mirabal said. ``When a
guy like him makes it, it's very important for our country. Whether
he breaks the record or not, we're preparing a big welcome for
him.''
	   Without prompting, Dominicans boastfully recount Sosa's rise
from poverty:
	   Sosa's father, Juan, died when Sammy was just five. The fifth of
seven children, Sosa took to the streets to shine shoes and wash
cars to help support the family. Their mother, Mireya, delivered
food to workers at San Pedro's textile factories.
	   Sosa's first love was boxing, but his mother didn't like the
hits he took.
	   ``He told me, `It's nothing,''' Mireya recalled. ``I told him,
`My son, for a mother it's a lot.'''
	   Sosa eventually dropped the ring for baseball, devoting every
spare moment _ when he wasn't working at a shoe factory _ to
practice. The determined teen quit school.
	   ``He told me, `Mami, I can't study and play at the same time,'''
his mother said. ``He insisted. He said, `I have to make it, Mami.
I have to make it.' And I never doubted him.''
	   He made it with the Rangers in 1989, hitting his first home run
off Boston's Roger Clemens. Traded to the White Sox, then to the
Cubs, he struggled in 1991 and '92.
	   Sosa had 33 home runs and 36 stolen bases the next season, and
in 1995 he made the All-Star team. In 1996, he hit 40 homers with
100 RBIs before his right hand was broken by a pitch in August.
	   With Sosa's power at the plate came money _ a lot of it for a
kid from San Pedro. He earned dlrs 10.25 million in 1996-97 and now
has a four-year, dlrs 42.5 million contract.
	   For Mother's Day last year, Sosa bought his mother a modest,
simply furnished home in San Pedro. Pictures, portraits and
clippings of Sosa and one of fellow player Roberto Clemente adorn
the walls.
	   A rooster crows outside, nearly drowned out by the TV, tuned to
_ what else? _ a sports channel.
	   With each home run that cracks across the screen, Sosa blows his
mother a kiss.
	   ``It's like I'm being hugged,'' she said, smiling and crossing
her arms. ``He's very sweet.''
	   San Pedro residents are proud that Sosa _ who lives in Santo
Domingo in the offseason _ has invested in his hometown. He built a
shopping mall, the ``30-30 Plaza,'' named after his first 30-homer,
30-steal season, that was inaugurated by President Leonel
Fernandez.
	   His sister, Raquel, runs a beauty salon at the mall, which also
boasts the ``Sammy Club Hit Bar'' discotheque and a fountain _ with
a three-foot statue of Sosa _ dedicated to San Pedro's bootblacks.
	   Through September at least, Sosa's exploits will be the talk of
the town, from the tree-shaded central plaza to the manicured
grounds of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball academy.
	   ``These guys watch Sammy every day,'' said Cesar Geronimo,
center fielder for Cincinnati's 1970s Big Red Machine and the
academy's assistant general manager. ``Our players want to do what
he did. It's more than a dream. It's a passion.''

Cricket debuts at Games and it's same old story
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With cricket making its debut at
the Commonwealth Games, fans will probably hear the Malaysian
expression, ``Hujan berhenti permainan'' _ which means ``rain stops
play'' _ many times in the next two weeks.
	   Cricketers are forever scurrying from the field whenever rain,
or even dark skies, hang over the field. They'll be getting a lot
of unwanted exercise here.
	   Two of Wednesday's group games on the opening day of
Commonwealth Games action were abandoned when showers left huge
puddles on the field.
	   It meant that Pakistan, one of the favorites, had to share a
point with Scotland, one of the outsiders.
	   The Pakistanis, fielding five of its test players but no big
names, hit 201 for five off the maximum 50 overs, and the heavy
showers ended the game with the Scots struggling at 31 for three.
But Pakistan, seemingly well on the way to victory, only gained a
share of the two points because the game had to be abandoned.
	   The same happened in the Antigua-India game at the TNB ground
and the worrying trend for organizers is for showers to arrive
around mid-afternoon of each day.
	   Antigua, fielding test stars Richie Richardson and Curtly
Ambrose, totaled 164 for nine and then had India rocking at 30 for
two with star batsman Sachin Tendulkar already out for 15.
	   When the rain started, the two teams had to salvage a point
each.
	   It was a sad start to cricket's first appearance in a major
multi-sports championship although star-studded Australia,
including brothers Steve and Mark Waugh, bowled Canada out for 60
to win by nine wickets and world champion Sri Lanka beat Malaysia
by seven wickets after restricting the host nation to 109 all out.
	   The two-week Games, with the two biggest sports, athletics and
swimming, not starting until after Friday's opening ceremony, is
staging some preliminary rounds early.
	   Some 5,000 athletes from 70 nations are competing in the games,
compared to 3,200 at the last games in Victoria, Canada, in 1994.
	   The number of sports has been increased from 10 to 16 with
rugby, men's and women's field hockey, squash, tenpin bowling and
women's netball joining cricket as newcomers.
	   But the track action has been weakened by the absence of many
big stars, such as Olympic and world champion and 1000-meter record
holder Donovan Bailey of Canada, his Namibian rival Frankie
Fredericks and maybe even Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who also isn't
certain to run.

Pakistan beats Kenya 5-4, Australia ousts India 5-2

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Former world champion Pakistan
scraped past Kenya 5-4 and Australia thrashed India 5-2 Wednesday
in the opening matches of men's field hockey tournament at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   England drew with Canada 1-1 in the third match of the Games
where field hockey and five other team events are being held for
the first time ever.
	   In the opening match, penalty specialist Imran Yousuf scored
four of Pakistan's goals, including three penalty strokes. Yet, the
match's outcome remained in suspense until the last seconds: Kenya,
down 5-4, took a penalty stroke just as the final horn blew but
failed to equalize.
	   All 11 Kenyan players, including the goalkeeper, ringed the
Pakistani circle for the corner and most slumped to the ground as a
determined Pakistani defense smothered the ball. A groan went up
among the 50-odd Kenyan supporters at the hockey stadium of the
newly built giant National Sports Complex outside Kuala Lumpur.
	   Similar agony was in store for the larger contingent of Indian
supporters at the next match against favorite Australia, which
finished fourth at the last World Cup.
	   The former multiple Olympic champion India also hasn't won a big
international event since taking the gold at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics and hopes to mend some of its tarnished image at the
Commonwealths. But a patchy defense and a coordinated Australian
attack led to India's downfall.
	   Coach M.K. Kaushik conceded that India's defense lacked solidity
but said the Australian defense also was not great, which was
demonstrated in the second half when India came back from 0-3 to
2-3. Australia, however, quickly scored two more goals to win 5-2.
	   The victory stage was set by veteran Stephen Davies who scored
the first two goals in the second and the 18th minutes.
	   Pakistan, a four-time world champion, opened its campaign in the
19th minute when Yousuf slammed in a penalty stroke, the outcome of
a foul on a Pakistani forward by Kenyan goalkeeper Jotham Omany.
	   Kenya's Raymond Ondong then scored the first of his two penalty
corner goals to equalize in the 26th minute. Yousuf converted a
second penalty stroke to make it 2-1 in the 31st minute after
center forward Khalid Mohammed was brought down by the Kenyan
goalkeeper.
	   Pakistan scored its lone field goal six minutes into the second
half as right winger Atif Bashir's defense-splitting pass enabled
Mohammed to shoot home.
	   Kenya pulled another goal back as Ondong's rasping penalty
corner shot in the 41st. Yousuf returned to goal-scoring action in
the 42nd minute as his scoop went into the roof of the cage and two
minutes later he converted another penalty stroke to give Pakistan
a 5-2 lead.
	   Far from being overawed, Kenya fought back. Nicholas Induli
scored on a rebound from a goal post in the 52nd minute. Four
minutes from the end Joel Senge reduced the deficit to 5-4 with a
set piece penalty corner conversion.

Researchers report success in method to select baby's sex

	   FAIRFAX, Virginia (AP) _ A breakthrough in fertility research
might give parents the luxury of deciding even before conception
whether to paint the baby's room pink or powder blue.
	   The Genetics and IVF Institute has found a way to segregate
sperm cells that produce boys and those that produce girls before
being used to fertilize an egg through artificial insemination,
said Dr. Edward Fugger of the institute.
	   The researchers claims were met with skepticism by some
scientists, who said the data from the Fairfax institute was not
conclusive. Others questioned the ethics of being able to select
the sex of a child.
	   ``More and more, we're beginning to construe our children as
products to be planned rather than as mysteries to be held in awe
and wonder,'' said the Rev. Philip Keane, a medical ethics
specialist at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore.
	   The institute's research is published in the September edition
of the journal Human Reproduction.
	   The technique involves identifying and separating sperm cells
that carry the Y chromosome, which produces males, from those that
carry the female-producing X chromosome. The Y-chromosome sperm
cells contain about 2.8 percent less genetic material.
	   The institute reported that 29 women who wanted to have girls
became pregnant. So far, nine of those women have given birth to 11
healthy baby girls, including two sets of twins, the institute
said. The oldest girl is 2 1-2 years old.
	   Seven of the women had miscarriages and one of the women still
pregnant is carrying a boy, said Fugger, the lead researcher.
	   Results of a study of couples wanting boys was not as
successful, Fugger said. Exact results will be released later.
	   Researchers were able to sift sperm to produce samples in which
85 percent of the cells had an X chromosome. If they targeted
Y-bearing sperm, the result was a sperm sample in which 65 percent
of the cells contained a Y chromosome, The New York Times reported
Wednesday.
	   Monique Collins, 33, who had had two boys, participated in the
institute's trial as a way to ensure that her third child was a
girl. She has no qualms about what she did, even though the use of
the technique for non-medical reasons has spawned debate on
religious and medical ethics grounds.
	   ``That's what technology is here for today, so we can make these
choices,'' said Mrs. Collins, whose daughter, Jessica, just turned
2. ``It just goes to show how much she's loved, that mommy and
daddy went to a lot of effort to have her.''
	   Dr. Jamie Grifo, director of reproductive endocrinology at New
York University Medical School, is apprehensive about the way the
institute is using the sperm-sorting method.
	   Grifo has been using an entirely different technique to
determine the gender of an embryo since 1992 and said NYU applies
the technology only to prevent gender-based diseases such as
hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which afflict only
males.
	   ``They're doing very important research but it's a matter of
what they're using it for that worries me,'' Grifo said. ``I don't
think we should be doing sex selection.''
	   Fugger was unapologetic about giving families the option of
choosing their child's gender.
	   ``It tends to balance sex ratios in families,'' Fugger said.
``There shouldn't be an ethical issue with skewing ratios or
anything like that.''
	   Keane said using technology to choose the gender of a child
without a medical reason is immoral in the eyes of the Roman
Catholic Church.
	   The study came under attack for scientific reasons as well.
	   Dr. Robert Stillman, medical director of Shady Grove Fertility
Centers, in Washington, D.C., said the institute's research sample
is too small to declare success.
	   ``It's really a series of anecdotes,'' said Stillman, a board
member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``A
bigger study might put this in the wastebasket where many other
attempts at sex selection have gone.''

Russia waits as Yeltsin ponders naming new candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia waited in suspense Thursday for Boris
Yeltsin's next move in a political contest of wills with the
parliament over a new prime minister to lead the country out of
economic collapse.
	   Yeltsin has taken more than two days to name a new candidate for
the post, and he is believed to be considering alternatives to his
top choice, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Among possible alternates are Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Yuri
Maslyukov _ a Communist whose nomination would likely sail through
the leftist-dominated parliament.
	   The political stalemate is exacerbating Russia's economic
collapse, which was reflected Wednesday by rising prices and a
spread of emergency measures, such as price controls, in some
regions of the country.
	   Surprisingly, however, the country's tattered currency, the
ruble, bounced back. Rubles, which were selling at about 20 to the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street sales to as strong as 10 to
the dollar, although rates varied widely. The official rate was
15.77 rubles to the dollar.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange their dollar savings.
	   The lack of rubles sent the currency's value up _ and added a
new dimension to people's worries.
	   ``I've been trying in the last few days to buy more,'' said
25-year-old Dmitry, a police officer who wouldn't give his last
name. ``But I can't change my money at a bank because there aren't
any rubles.''
	   Meanwhile, some stores in Moscow were restocking shelves and
people seemed less worried about food shortages.
	   ``I'm buying but I haven't been in panic. We see people
hoarding, but we don't do it. There's no reason for it, you can't
buy for your entire life,'' said Tatyana Shishkova, 57, a retired
teacher.
	   Yeltsin spent the day at his country house outside Moscow,
meeting with top aides.
	   There was speculation in the Duma, the lower chamber of
parliament, that Yeltsin was considering nominating Maslyukov _ a
Communist Party member and former head of the Soviet planning
ministry, Gosplan. He is a favorite of the Communists, parliament's
largest faction.
	   However Luzhkov, whose name is also prominently mentioned as a
candidate, met with Chernomyrdin on Wednesday and predicted
afterward that the acting prime minister would be nominated a third
time, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The Duma has twice rejected Chernomyrdin. If it rejects
Yeltsin's nominee a third time, the president would be forced by
law to dissolve parliament and call new elections.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned that the Duma would
begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. A vote to start impeachment
proceedings blocks Yeltsin from dissolving the Duma, although it
was not clear if the opposition has enough votes to get such a
motion passed.

Rafter breezes by Bjorkman into U.S. Open semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED after Williams-Sanchez Vicario match,
scheduled to start around 2345 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter was faster than the wind, and far
too quick for Jonas Bjorkman, as he breezed into the semifinals of
the U.S. Open.
	   The third-seeded Rafter had 44 winners and only 14 unforced
errors, and lost his serve just once in a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 victory
Wednesday over No. 12 Bjorkman, who played in long sleeves on a
chilly afternoon made even colder by a 24-mph (30-kph) wind.
	   Rafter, the defending champion, will face the winner of
Wednesday night's match between top-seeded Pete Sampras and No. 9
Karol Kucera in the semifinals.
	   The wind turned service tosses into adventures. On one toss, the
ball was blown so far away from Rafter that he didn't even attempt
to catch it _ instead, letting it bounce and roll toward a ballboy.
	   But Rafter said the conditions were no worse than those in Mount
Isa, the Australian town where he grew up playing tennis.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Rafter used his exceptional speed to control the match. He ran
down the Swede's passing shots and darted to the net for winning
volleys.
	   Also overcoming the wind was women's No. 2 Lindsay Davenport,
whose power was too much for No. 13 Amanda Coetzer in a 6-0, 6-4
victory. Davenport will play the winner of Wednesday night's match
between Venus Williams and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
semifinals.
	   Davenport was consistent, if not spectacular, getting 94 percent
of her first serves in during the first set. She never lost her
serve in the match, despite struggling with the wind.
	   ``It's tough. When you're with the wind, you can't hit the ball
too far or it flies long. On the other side, you have to hit the
ball hard,'' Davenport said. ``You never know what's going to
happen out there in the wind.''
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.
	   ``The wind and the delays probably helped me a little bit. I was
definitely struggling with the way she was hitting the ball,''
Coetzer, of South Africa, said. ``Often the wind is a little bit of
an equalizer. And the rain delays gave me a little bit of an
opportunity to slow things down, have a chance to speak to my
coach.''
	   Coetzer, who at 5-foot-2 (1.58 meters) is more than a foot 12
(30 centimeters) shorter than her 6-2 1-2 (1.89-meter) opponent,
said she was intimidated by the power and depth of Davenport's
shots.
	   ``It's tennis. There's no requirements to play, no age
requirements, no height requirement, no weight requirement. Tennis
is tennis,'' Davenport said. ``I can't help it that I'm a lot
taller than her and I hit the ball harder.''

New exodus of Kosovo refugees flee Serb tanks, shells
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with U.S. aid details, other new material &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Refugee officials say as many as
25,000 civilians, driven from their homes in southwestern Kosovo,
are desperately trying to escape a pincer strike by Serb troops and
tanks that is blasting their villages.
	   The latest victims of the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the
Serbian province fled on tractors and wagons heaped with their
belongings, clogging a dirt road Wednesday in a column 12
kilometers (seven miles) long, according to Western observers who
visited the area.
	   ``UNHCR fears slaughter may occur if a shell hits the column of
people,'' the Geneva-based United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees warned late Wednesday.
	   One official said the situation threatens to create as many as
25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where dozens of villages already have
been charred and emptied in the face of shelling or clashes between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in the Yugoslav Federation. Its population is 90
percent ethnic Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed
struggle for independence after decades of repression by Serbian
authorities.
	   Fernando del Mundo described a chaotic exodus that apparently
began Tuesday from villages in an area about 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, a UNHCR spokesman, who heard
shelling and saw billows of smoke in the area Wednesday. ``The
shelling is closing in like a pincer.''
	   Tens of thousands of others remain dangerously close to the
shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the number of
Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't provided
for the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests
and facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The United Nations estimated this week that 600 to 700 civilians
have been killed in six months of fighting between Serb-led forces
and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics targeting ethnic
Albanian villages, the Serbs also accuse the militants of
massacring Serb civilians.
	   Western officials have held out the threat of military
intervention for months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
doesn't halt the offensive. But such plans have been stymied by the
failure to reach an international consensus and by the difficulties
of mounting an effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
Wednesday that the alliance would need about 50,000 troops to
monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire in Kosovo.
	   U.S. President Clinton released dlrs 20 million in aid for
Kosovo refugees Wednesday. The White House said the money, added to
an earlier U.S. contribution of dlrs 11 million, will go to U.N.
and private agencies providing food and shelter for refugees.
	   But a U.S. State Department official said no amount of aid will
help unless the Serbian government allows secure access to the
area.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ No day off for baseball's new home run king. A
capacity crowd wouldn't allow it.
	   A day after he hit No. 62 in front of an adoring home crowd in
St. Louis, a sleepless Mark McGwire took his home run show on the
road Wednesday. He didn't get to bed until the early morning hours
and then found he couldn't nod off as history played out in his
mind.
	   When he got to Cinergy Field for a game against the Cincinnati
Reds, he resisted the temptation to sit out and let it sink in.
There were too many fans for that.
	   ``I'm going to have one or two at-bats,'' he said. ``When you've
got 50,000 fans out there, you've got to make some sort of
showing.''
	   True to his word, McGwire batted twice _ he grounded out and
flew out _ before leaving the game. He tossed a ball and both
batting gloves to fans behind the Cardinals dugout before heading
for the clubhouse.
	   When he came to the plate for the first time, he backed away
three times and waved as the crowd gave him a standing ovation that
lasted for more than a minute.
	   The Reds sold out both games of the series and were expecting
their biggest weekday crowds since Sept. 10-11, 1985, when another
of baseball's most revered records was falling _ Pete Rose passed
Ty Cobb as the career hits leader in Cincinnati.
	   Fans showing up to see Big Mac were disappointed that No. 62 had
gone out in St. Louis, but figured it was appropriate that he did
it at home. Besides, every homer from now on is another record.
	   ``When he hits one, it's still history,'' said 15-year-old
Derrick Smith, who brought a fishing net to Section 237 in left
field hoping for a homer. ``I was hoping he would play and I
figured he would because he is a fan person.''
	   ``Hey, we wouldn't be here on a school night if it wasn't for
him,'' said Mark Brown, 42, who made the two-hour drove from
Columbus with his 12-year-old son, Alex. ``I was hoping he would
play because it was sold out. I thought he would, although I hate
to take advantage of his good nature.''
	   McGwire was good-natured Wednesday, still running on adrenalin,
as he answered the same questions all over again and talked about
his responsibility to the fans who want to get a glimpse of the new
home run king.
	   ``I think I'll finish the season without taking days off,'' he
said. ``I feel pretty good and that's the bottom line. I want to
finish strong.
	   ``Just because of what I've done doesn't mean I'll stop. There's
two weeks left in the season. As far as I'm concerned, I've got a
lot of work ahead of me.''

Ofahengaue in side to play Fiji
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby union coach Rod
Macqueen has elevated backrower Willie Ofahengaue into the starting
side for next week's opening World Cup qualifying match against
Fiji in Sydney.
	   Ofahengaue comes in for Toutai Kefu after Macqueen felt
Ofahengaue would be better suited to starting against the
unpredictable Fijians.
	   ``We just thought that against Fiji it was a good opportunity
for him to start the game and for Kefu to come on later,'' Macqueen
said Thursday.
	   Ofahengaue and Kefu have been interchanged in the second half
for much of this season with the same likely to apply in reverse
against Fiji.
	   As expected winger Joe Roff will fill the fullback's role in the
absence of injured Matt Burke with Jason Little replacing Ben Tune
on one wing and Damian Smith covering Roff's wing.
	   Utility Mitch Hardy has moved on to the bench.
	   Reserves Chris Whitaker, Kefu and Owen Finegan will be released
to play club finals in Sydney and Brisbane.
	   Australia plays three matches in eight days to attempt to
qualify for the World Cup starting with Fiji on Sept. 18. They then
play a mid-week game against Tonga in Canberra and finish by
playing Western Samoa in Brisbane.
	   The Australian team: Joe Roff, Damian Smith, Daniel Herbert, Tim
Horan, Jason Little; Steve Larkham, George Gregan; Willie
Ofahengaue, David Wilson, Matt Cockbain; Tom Bowman, John Eales
(captain); Dan Crowley, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris
Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Mitch Hardy, Toutai Kefu, Owen Finegan,
Glenn Panoho, Jeremy Paul. (djp)

	   ANATA, West Bank (AP) _ Only a few peach and fig saplings still
stand near the broken cinder blocks and twisted metal rods that
once formed the Shawamre family home in this Palestinian village
just east of Jerusalem.
	   The one-story home overlooking the stony Judean desert hills has
been destroyed by the Israeli army twice in one month. But the
family, their Palestinian neighbors and Israeli peace activists are
rebuilding for the third time, turning the house into a symbol of
resistance to Israeli house demolitions.
	   Israel says it simply enforces the law and levels homes built
without licenses _ 115 so far this year in the West Bank and 14 in
east Jerusalem. The Palestinians say Israel uses building permits
as a form of population control and rarely grants licenses in areas
it eventually wants to annex.
	   The demolitions, condemned by the United States, have
contributed to an atmosphere of deep distrust that have made
progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks increasingly difficult.
	   On Saturday, Palestinian homeowner Salim Shawamre supervised the
third attempt to rebuild his 850-square-foot (80 sq. meter) house
while Israeli soldiers watched from a nearby hill.
	   About 25 Israeli volunteers, including psychiatrists and
teachers wearing peace shirts and baseball caps, passed rubble from
hand to hand to clear it from among the tender tree trunks.
Shawamre's wife Arabiyeh, wearing a long green dress and her hair
covered by a headscarf, handed out sweet raspberry-flavored juice.
	   Shawamre, an architectural engineer, said watching his home be
torn down twice has hurt him deeply. ``When they destroy, for that
moment, everything is destroyed, your house, your dreams,'' he
said, his voice rough from yelling instructions.
	   He said the decision to rebuild a third time did not come
easily, considering the pain and money involved.
	   However, he decided in the end it was important to fight back.
``When you don't have another place to go, you have to hold on to
the place that is yours with all your might. As much as you can. So
we've decided to build again,'' said Shawamre, 43.
	   In the first demolition, on July 9, Israeli soldiers needed
seven hours to level the home because Anata residents and Israeli
supporters threw stones in an attempt to block them. Troops fired
tear gas and rubber bullets and several Palestinians were injured.
	   A few days later, the Israeli Committee Against Home Demolitions
asked Shawamre whether he wanted to rebuild. He said yes, and 200
Israeli and Palestinian volunteers completed the job in three days.
``We danced on the roof when we finished,'' Shawamre said.
	   But in the early morning of Aug. 3, under the surveillance of
hundreds of soldiers, the house was torn down again, this time in
15 minutes.
	   The demolitions sent Mrs. Shawamre, 33, into a severe depression
and she went to Jordan for treatment.
	   ``They destroyed our house and threw us into the street,'' said
Mrs. Shawamre who has since returned home. ``They took even our
tents that we would sit in so we had nothing over our heads.''
	   The Shawamres and their four children, ages 7 to 16, found
refuge with a neighbor in the meantime, living in one room.
	   Most Palestinians whose homes are targeted for destruction try
to stop or delay the bulldozers by appealing to Israeli courts,
usually to no avail. Only a few have rebuilt their homes.
	   One of the Israeli volunteers, Yoav Hess, said his group was
morally justified in fighting an unfair law. ``We are doing
something that is against the law, but it is the right thing to
do,'' he said.
	   Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the
army destroyed the house after an Israeli court, ruling on an
appeal by the Shawamres, upheld the demolition order.
	   ``The law has to be implemented,'' Lerner said. ``They have no
permit to build. We reserve the right to demolish it at any time.''

Perkins to carry Australian flag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Triple world record holder Kieren
Perkins has been selected to carry Australia's flag at Friday's
opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games.
	   Perkins, 25, said he was surprised and honored to be chosen.
	   The 1992 and 1996 Olympic 1500-meter swimming champion said it
would be the first opening ceremony at either the Olympics or
Commonwealth Games that he had been able to attend.
	   ``I haven't been part of an opening ceremony before,'' Perkins
said Thursday. ``I was looking forward very much to marching
tomorrow and this makes it all the more special.''
	   Perkins set world records for the 800-meters and 1500-meters at
the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada, and the 400-meters
shortly after at the Rome world championships. He has been below
his best since the 1996 Olympics and compatriot Grant Hackett won
the world title earlier this year.
	   The decision to let him carry the flag comes a day after Perkins
admitted it was time to get more out of his swimming career than
just medals.
	   ``I'm at the point now where I'm enjoying it, I've got a goal,
which is to pick up a third gold in the 1500-meters in 2000,''
Perkins said. ``Above and beyond that I just want to enjoy
myself.''

May thinks match-fixing may be more widespread
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian test off-spinner Tim
May said Thursday it might be ``naive'' to think match-fixing in
cricket had not spread beyond Pakistan.
	   May also said Australia's forthcoming tour of Pakistan should go
ahead despite a Pakistan inquiry finding that former captain Salim
Malik and two other senior players were involved in widespread
match-fixing.
	   A report out of Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday said a Pakistani
inquiry found Malik, Wasim Akram and Ijaz Ahmed responsible for
match-fixing and recommended they be banned.
	   It also claimed match-fixing and betting was widespread and
called for a full inquiry.
	   ``I think people would be pretty naive if they just thought that
Pakistan were the only side that were involved in this,'' May,
president of the Australian Cricketers' Association, told a
television current affairs program.
	   ``Certainly, there have been reports that have come out of India
and I think some former Indian players have alluded to the fact
that perhaps it does occur in other sides.
	   ``I know that there was a report in an Indian paper that, from a
person who allegedly should know about these things, who said that
Australia and England were the only sides that basically couldn't
be bought.''
	   May and leg-spinner Shane Warne allege Malik offered them US
dlrs 250,000 in bribes to bowl badly on the last day of the first
test in Karachi in 1994, where Pakistan's last pair snatched an
unexpected victory.
	   Later on the tour, Mark Waugh alleged Malik tried to bribe him
to bat poorly in a one-dayer. Waugh made a century but Pakistan
triumphed easily.
	   The allegations were rejected by an internal Pakistan inquiry in
1995.
	   May said Wednesday's report was a relief, but added: ``We've got
the game of cricket at the top of our interest and it's sad to
think that the extent of match-fixing or whatever is present in the
game.
	   ``Time is always the best test of truth and four years down the
track, I think plenty of people will be sitting around and saying
`hey they didn't concoct that'.''
	   ``From 1994 onwards, there's always been some sort of rumors,
always a press article coming in every two months or so that has
alluded to match-fixing. It was never going to go away and things
don't go away until they are properly addressed.''
	   The Australian cricket team is scheduled to leave Sydney on
Sept. 22 for a three-test tour of Pakistan. May said he saw no
reason for it not going ahead.
	   ``I don't think it affects that one way or another,'' he said.
	   ``I imagine the Pakistan Cricket Board, they'll select a side
they want to have out on the field. We'll just basically put the
Pakistan internal inquiry aside and just play cricket against
them.'' (djp)

Giant globe proves it's a big world after all

<TEXT>
	   YARMOUTH, Maine (AP) _ This is not the ordinary globe kids spin
round and round in elementary school classrooms.
	   In fact, it wouldn't even fit in a classroom.
	   This globe is 42 feet (12.8 meters) in diameter, consisting of a
surface of 792 pieces, some as large as 4 feet by 3 feet (120
centimeters by 90 centimeters), that are attached to a frame of
6,120 pieces of tubular aircraft aluminum. It weighs 5,600 pounds
(2,540 kilograms).
	   DeLorme mapping company says the globe that dominates the lobby
at its headquarters is the biggest in the world.
	   ``It's fun to look at those little globes. But you look at this
one and say, `Wow!''' said Jeff Clark, a map technician responsible
for each of the plastic panels that cover the DeLorme creation.
	   Dubbed ``Eartha,'' the globe was the brainchild of David
DeLorme, founder of the map and software company. And it's meant to
showcase the technology that goes into maps and mapping software.
	   All 200 workers were involved in Eartha's creation, from months
of work establishing a computer database for the project, to the
task of printing and laminating the surface on plastic panels, to
the tedious job of snapping the pieces into place like a jigsaw
puzzle.
	   ``No one's ever really built a globe this big before, so we sort
of wrote the book as we went along,'' Clark said.
	   A physics professor from prestigious Bowdoin College helped
workers figure out how much weight the structure could support. A
West Bath company was enlisted to help build the aluminum frame and
support arm.
	   The computer database used to bring Eartha's surface alive with
colorful detail showing topography, vegetation and ocean depth took
more than a year to create. Sometimes, computers ran 24 hours a
day.
	   DeLorme said there were no price limitations on the globe, and
he doesn't care to know how much it cost to make it.
	   ``I don't know and I don't want to know,'' DeLorme said. Had he
known how much the globe would cost, DeLorme said, he probably
never would have undertaken the task of building it.
	   While DeLorme bills Eartha as the largest globe, it has yet to
earn that distinction from the Guinness Book of Records.
	   The current record is held by Orfeo Bartolucci's ``Globe of
Peace,'' a revolving sphere in Italy that is 33 feet (10 meters) in
diameter, said Vanessa Law, a spokeswoman for Guinness Publishing
in London.
	   DeLorme is working with Guinness officials and plans to submit
paperwork before the May deadline for the next book published in
2000, said Mary Jo Whitworth, a company spokeswoman.
	   One option is to establish two categories, with the largest
globe going to DeLorme and the heaviest globe going to Globe of
Peace, which weighs in at a whopping 30 tons, Whitworth said.
	   No decision has been made, and Guinness will review DeLorme's
paperwork when it is submitted, Law said.
	   As for DeLorme's globe, it's hard to miss. It is plainly visible
inside the company's three-story glass atrium from Interstate 95,
where commuters sometimes crane their necks to see it.
	   Eartha is one one-millionth the size of the real thing, which
works out to one Eartha inch (2.5 cms) equaling nearly 16 Earth
miles (25 kms).
	   Eartha tilts at 23.5 degrees just as the Earth does. And it
revolves on a specially designed cantilever arm and rotates on an
axis, with one combined revolution and rotation each minute at
maximum speed.
	   The globe was completed July 23 when David DeLorme put the last
piece into place with help from Gov. Angus King. Hundreds of
workers and guests cheered the milestone.
	   Recognizing the significance of the event, DeLorme employees
dressed up for the occasion instead of wearing the T-shirts,
flip-flops and shorts that are acceptable attire on most days.
	   Even DeLorme wore a coat and tie.
	   ``I heard someone say they didn't recognize half the people here
because they were dressed up,'' he quipped.
	   But he was serious about his creation.
	   DeLorme said it is a symbol of how far the company has come
since he started making maps at his kitchen table, and a symbol for
the new millennium as the world continues to get smaller.
	   DeLorme plans to release several Eartha-related products,
including a paper atlas, and a CD-ROM of the world featuring a
three-dimensional view of the Earth.
	   Most of all, DeLorme hopes Eartha will be an inspiration _ as it
was for a 3-year-old who visited recently with her parents.
	   ``She took five steps, and with a fresh insight only a child of
that age can have, she spread out her arms wide and let out a
scream of joy that resounded throughout this place,'' he said.

Grueling graduation exercise for recruits to elite rescue unit

<TEXT>
	   NES ZIYYONA, Israel (AP) _ As the sun set over a rubble-strewn
hilltop Wednesday, Israeli soldiers training for an elite rescue
unit still had more than a full day's work ahead.
	   Having raked through piles of rubble with hydrolic lifts,
cranes, jackhammers and their bare hands since 7 a.m., the soldiers
were to keep searching for ``victims'' _ orange dummies _ until
noon the next day.
	   The grueling 30-hour workday at an army base south of Tel Aviv
was a final exercise for 100 soldiers, reservists and
officers-in-training before their graduation from the Home Front
Command's rescue school.
	   The unit specializes in searching for victims trapped under
collapsed buildings, using specially trained dogs, sensitive
seismic equipment and old-fashioned muscle.
	   While the Israeli unit gained acclaim for last month's rescue in
Nairobi, Kenya after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy, its main
mission is to cope with the aftermath of any strike against Israel.
	   It's not a theoretical threat. During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq
fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. Only last month, Katyusha rockets
slammed into northern Israeli towns after a top Lebanese guerrilla
leader was killed in an Israeli ambush.
	   Other threats are posed by Iran's successful test of a missile
that could strike the Jewish state, and lingering suspicions of
nuclear and chemical weapons development by Iraq.
	   ``We have to take under consideration that if a war were to be
fought in the Middle East ... we'd have to lend protection to the
civilian population,'' said army spokesman Maj. Simon Rothwell.
	   In Wednesday's exercise _ which simulated a conventional missile
attack _ a team first made sure there was no atomic, biological or
chemical threat. Then rescue teams searched for victims among the
debris.
	   ``If conventional missiles were to fall on Israel, this is the
type of damage we would have,'' Rothwell said. ``Basically, this is
total destruction here.''
	   Later, team members were to clamber into protective suits and
keep working after an announcement that a chemical cloud was
approaching.
	   At 2 a.m., the soldiers were to resume their work at another
site north of Tel Aviv _ with the only opportunity for sleep during
the one-hour bus ride.

Yale's Mount Everest project may yield answers about headaches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIGITTE GREENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Yale University scientists who
monitored Mount Everest climbers say they have new clues to what
causes a rather ordinary affliction _ the high-altitude headache.
	   The evidence indicates that people don't get headaches at high
altitudes because of less oxygen in the brain, as the researchers
previously believed, but rather because of overwhelming blood flow
to the brain.
	   ``We know categorically that in high-altitude headaches, the
mechanism is different than what we thought all along,'' said Dr.
Richard Satava, professor of surgery.
	   Many people suffer headaches on the upper floors of tall
buildings, while driving through mountains or riding in airplanes.
	   The research could help lead to treatments for the common
headache and the more severe migraine headache, and also help
doctors better understand normal fetal development, some experts
say.
	   The treatment commonly available for high-altitude headaches is
a diuretic and respiratory stimulant called Diamox. But it is not
effective in all cases.
	   Many mountain climbers can adjust to the altitude gradually as
they climb. Some wear masks attached to oxygen canisters, but those
don't always provide enough oxygen. Others simply can't adapt.
	   On Everest, a lack of oxygen, or hypoxia as it is known, is
often accompanied by intense headaches that can impair
decision-making, cause sluggishness and disorientation, and hinder
coordination. Some people can die suddenly from cerebral edema _
swelling of the brain.
	   ``I've known a lot of people who have these bad headaches,''
said Ed Viesturs, star of the IMAX movie ``Everest'' who has
reached the peak of Everest, 29,028 feet (8,847 meters) above sea
level, five times. ``There are many who, their vision starts to
blur, speech gets slurred. ... They lose their balance. They're not
rational.''
	   In those situations, climbers have to be carried down to where a
helicopter can land and take them away, Viesturs said.
	   ``They don't have a sense of what the lack of oxygen can really
do to you almost until it's too late,'' he said. ``Maybe if they
discover what the actual mechanism of the headache is, we could
save some people's lives.''
	   The researchers, who hope to publish their research in a
peer-reviewed journal this fall, believe high-altitude headaches
may be the body's way of warning climbers to descend before the
brain suffers terrible consequences.
	   In the study conducted last spring, doctors at Everest Base
Camp, 17,500 feet (5,334 meters) above sea level, examined 38
climbers from various international expeditions, as well as native
Sherpas who accompany the climbers.
	   Using a portable ultrasound device, the researchers measured the
rate of blood flow in the carotid artery to the head and compared
that with the rate in the brachial artery that feeds blood to the
forearm.
	   The data showed a fourfold increase in the flow of blood to the
head, according to Dr. Ronald C. Merrell, chairman of Yale's
Department of Surgery.
	   The climbers adapted to the low oxygen flow in a variety of
ways.
	   Some breathed harder, gasping for air at the higher altitudes.
The bodies of others automatically increased the number of blood
cells in the bloodstream. And others _ those who had headaches _
experienced a marked increase in blood flow to the brain. Some
climbers experienced a combination of the three conditions.
	   Principal researcher Dr. Christian Macedonia said the increased
blood flow to the brain was a way to compensate for the low levels
of oxygen on Everest.
	   ``We each have our own little scheme for adapting to the
environment,'' said Macedonia, an Army major who practices at the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.
	   Some who get headaches suffer mini-strokes in the brain. Other
climbers experience lapses in short-term memory while on the
mountain or long periods of forgetfulness after being on the
mountain.
	   Similar research has been conducted on animals. Earlier this
year, faculty at the University of Buffalo studied sheep that were
placed in a pressurized chamber. Cerebral blood pressure forced
apart cells and allowed fluids to accumulate in and around brain
tissues, causing swelling of the brain.
	   UB neurologist Dr. Daniel Rifkin said the findings of the Yale
study, the first in such an inhospitable environment, did not
surprise him.
	   ``It's almost like brain congestion,'' Rifkin said. ``We don't
really know the ramifications of long-term exposure to low oxygen
levels. We need to find ways to protect those tissues.''
	   Dr. Keith Campbell, editor of the journal Headache and former
president of the American Association for the Study of Headache,
said the Yale findings make sense. But because this was the first
time carotid blood flow was measured in people in such conditions,
he said he would like to see further research.
	   ``The lack of oxygen would have to change some mechanism in the
brain,'' he said. ``It throbs. You know there's more blood going
through your head because of the pounding sensation.''
	   Campbell said the findings may shed light on methods to treat
some form of migraine headaches.
	   Macedonia, who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology and
teaches at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., said the
research also may answer questions about fetal development in the
womb. He noted that babies who have a weak placental connection to
the mother often are born with well-developed heads but withered
bodies.
	   ``The fetus has to do all sorts of things to extract oxygen from
the mother through the placenta. When the placenta becomes sick,
the fetus still has to get oxygen to the brain, and the brain will
overcompensate at the expense of the rest of the body,'' he said.
``The environment in utero is a lot like being on Mount Everest.''
	   Once the child is born and has full access to oxygen, the body
often develops normally over time, he said, but the long-term
effects are unknown.

Development threatens last nesting sites of Turkey's sea turtles

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Every summer night, newborn sea turtles
break through their protective shells and scurry through soft sand
to start their lives in the marine world.
	   But as Turkey's tourism industry takes over the country's
Mediterranean beaches, fewer and fewer hatchlings are successfully
making those first steps.
	   ``We no longer have many places for the nests and even if they
nest, with the mass tourism activities, the hatchlings now have few
chances of surviving,'' said Filiz Demirayak of the Society for the
Protection of Nature in Turkey.
	   Despite years of campaigning to protect the endangered Chelonia
mydas (green turtles) and the threatened Caretta caretta
(loggerhead turtles), yet another nesting beach is under threat.
	   Developers plan to build a yachting marina on Kumkoy, one of
only four remaining nesting sites for Mediterranean green turtles,
35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the popular resort of Antalya.
	   Environmentalists say the marina would disrupt the life cycles
of the sea turtles, which roam the oceans for 30 years but always
return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs.
	   Kumkoy, five kilometers (three miles) of sand dotted with
fishermen's huts, is the only construction-free section of the
Belek seafront. Twenty-six hotels have been built along the beach,
forcing most of the turtles to Kumkoy.
	   Although the turtles reach 150 kilograms (300 pounds) when
grown, the newly hatched are small enough to fit in a palm. They
make their first trip to the sea at night to avoid the burning sun.
	   The nature society sees the proposed marina as a series of
obstacles to the turtles' journey: The noise could scare mother
turtles away; the lights could disorient the hatchlings, which use
the moonlight to navigate; the yachts could kill the turtles
outright when the creatures come to the surface to breathe.
	   AS-KA, the Turkish construction company that plans to build the
300-yacht marina, contends the turtles would actually be safer with
the development. The company intends to remove the fishermen's huts
and build a barrier to block lights from reaching the beach, said
Yavuz Dersan, the company's lawyer.
	   There is one barrier to the marina's construction: The Ministry
of Culture's classification of the beach as a natural protected
site, a measure primarily aimed at protecting the turtles. AS-KA
has taken the ministry to court to have the beach declassified _ a
green light for construction.
	   The Tourism Ministry, which sought the bids for the marina,
refused to comment on the pending case. It said the project was not
situated on a turtle-nesting area.
	   Construction is on hold until a settlement is reached. That
could take years.
	   The controversy has increased awareness of the turtles' needs.
In the nearby village of Cirali, locals now see turtles as an asset
rather than a nuisance. They join tourists to watch the hatchlings'
scramble to the sea.
	   ``I waited until 4:30 in the morning to see them,'' said
Muhammet Arican, a 17-year-old waiter. ``I worry about the
animals.''
	   ``Before, sea turtles were just an ordinary animal. Now they
have become Caretta carettas, because people know they will attract
tourists,'' said Tuncay Cesur, the nature society's local
assistant.

Jet forced to make emergency landing at Toronto airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A Royal Airlines Boeing 727 en route to Halifax
had to make an emergency landing Wednesday, shortly after taking
off from Toronto's Pearson International Airport.
	   The jet, which had 168 people on board, was forced to land
around 4 p.m. when one of its three engines failed.
	   Emergency crews were standing by, but the plane landed safely
and no one was hurt, airport officials said.
	   Witnesses on the ground said there was a large bang, and they
saw blue and orange flames shooting out of the tail engine. The
plane dumped most of its fuel about 55 kilometres (34 miles) from
the airport.
	   Passengers were rerouted on other flights.
	   Terry Zaharia, duty manager with the Greater Toronto Air
Authority, said emergency landings due to technical difficulties
occur on a daily or weekly basis at the airport.
	   Last week, another Royal Airlines plane en route from Toronto to
Glasgow, Scotland, made an unscheduled landing in Newfoundland
after the pilot smelled oil fumes in the cockpit.
	   Royal is a Montreal-based charter company.

Study gives hints for finding schizophrenia susceptibility genes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have gotten new hints about where to
look for genes that affect a person's susceptibility to
schizophrenia.
	   Genes lie along 24 strings called chromosomes, and the new work
suggests susceptibility genes may lie in particular regions of
chomosomes 8 and 13.
	   Researchers have gotten such leads before for a number of
chromosome locations. But they haven't been able to isolate the
genes themselves, a goal that could help expose the roots of
schizophrenia and lead to better medications.
	   Ann Pulver of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, along with
colleagues there and elsewhere, studied more than 105 families with
evidence of inherited susceptibility to schizophrenia.
	   Their new statistical evidence, in the September issue of the
journal Nature Genetics, is stronger for a susceptibility gene on
chromosome 13 than chromosome 8. Previously, there had been some
weak evidence for a gene at the chromosome 13 site, and much more
support for one in the chromosome 8 region, Pulver said.
	   ``I'm confident there will be something on 8 and 13 associated
with susceptibility to schizophrenia in some families,'' Pulver
said in a telephone interview.
	   Dr. Kenneth S. Kendler, a gene-hunter at the Medical College of
Virginia, said previous findings make him think chromosome 8 is the
better bet.

	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ California is the first state to
declare that diesel engines spew chemicals that cause cancer and
other diseases.
	   The California Air Resources Board, capping years of
controversy, on Aug. 27 ordered the 40 chemicals found in diesel
fumes, including benzene and dioxin, to be listed as toxic air
pollutants.
	   ``This issue is as simple as cigarette smoking and cancer _ the
issue is diesel and lung damage,'' said Bonnie Holmes-Gen of the
Sierra Club, which supports the ruling.
	   The decision by California's powerful anti-pollution board
forces local and state regulators to come up with a plan to limit
human exposure to the cancer-causing chemicals.
	   Decisions of the 11-member panel often serve as a bellwether for
stricter standards at the federal level, where regulators also are
drafting standards for diesel emissions.
	    &UR; ___
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A protein found in snake venom has been shown to
dramatically inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells in mice,
according to a report presented at a meeting of the American
Chemical Society.
	   Dr. Francis Markland, a professor of biochemistry at the
University of Southern California, and other researchers implanted
mice with venom protein from southern copperheads two weeks after
injecting them with human breast cancer cells.
	   In untreated mice, sizable tumor masses emerged and spread to
the lungs within 10 to 12 weeks. But mice that received the protein
showed a 60 percent to 70 percent reduction in the growth rate of
tumors.
	   Even more significant, according to Markland, he and other
researchers found a 90 percent reduction in the spread of the tumor
to other parts of the body.
	   Markland said his results are at least two years away from
testing in humans. Other researchers were similarly cautious.
	   ``I would not be overly enthusiastic at this point,'' said Dr.
Benedict Lucchesi, a professor of pharmacology at the University of
Michigan. ``The results are interesting at best. There is always
the danger of creating false hope.''

Japan's central bank eases monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to RECAP: UPDATES with prime minister's
comment &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hoping to pump some life into Japan's faltering
economy, the central bank eased the country's already loose
monetary policy by cutting a key lending rate.
	   The move, announced Wednesday, was aimed at boosting the flow of
funds to capital-starved Japanese companies and stopping the
economy from nosediving into a destructive deflationary spiral.
	   The Bank of Japan lowered the target for the overnight call
money rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending
without collateral _ to around 0.25 percent from around 0.5
percent.
	   The target is the lowest in Japan ever, though in the
fluctuations of actual trading the rate has gone lower than that.
The bank does not set the rate, but only sets a target.
	   Wednesday's move, announced after the markets closed,
essentially makes it cheaper for banks to obtain funds and could
reduce corporate borrowing costs at a time Japan is battling its
worst recession since World War II.
	   ``We expect it to generate good results,'' Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi told reporters Thursday morning at his official residence.
	   The announcement immediately drove down the yen. In late New
York trading, the dollar was worth 137.00 yen, up from 132.10 yen
late Tuesday. After the interest rate announcement, the dollar rose
above 138 yen.
	   The rate cut, however, also illustrated the limited options
Japan faces in using monetary policy to buoy the economy. Three
years of record-low interest rates have done little to help
Japanese finances.
	   ``It's an act of desperation ... BOJ easing without structural
reform will have very little effect,'' Cameron Umetsu, senior
strategist in charge of money and foreign exchange at Warburg
Dillon Read in Tokyo, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   ``Japan again resorted to traditional measures when progress on
key restructuring was needed,'' he said.
	   The decision _ the first easing of policy since 1995 _ does not
affect the official discount rate, which is at a record low of 0.5
percent. The discount rate is the central bank's charge on loans to
banks.
	   The measure comes as Japan is struggling with recession at home
and financial crisis in Asia. Consumption is stagnant and officials
fear a deflationary spiral unless the economy is somehow
jump-started.
	   ``The biggest goal for the easing is to provide even more funds
to the markets and help reduce pressures on corporate fund
raising,'' said Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami.
	   Hayami said he believes that if banks have ample funds, the
so-called ``credit crunch'' _ or tightened lending by financial
institutions _ will disappear as another positive effect of the new
policy.
	   The easing is expected to at least temporarily reduce pressure
on the rickety banking sector and avert system-wide instability.
	   But in the absence of more aggressive fiscal policy and deep
structural reform of the banking system and the economy, it's
unlikely to pull Japan out of its recession, critics said.
	   While the cut in overnight call rates will help banks' funding,
it won't immediately provide any boost to the economy, said Susumu
Kato, senior economist at Barclays Capital Japan.
	   ``It's not something that will directly affect the economy,'' he
told Dow Jones.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A skinny boy, Isam Ilwi strains to pull a
water cart on rickety wheels along the narrow lane. At 12, Isam is
earning his living in a pottery workshop.
	   Rasha, 8, sits atop a mountain of garbage, her hands and feet
scratched from broken glass as she seeks out plastic yogurt
containers for recycling. Hanan Mukhtar, at 10 a nanny and maid,
works in more rarefied surroundings. She watches over Seif _ who is
half her age _ clumsily riding his bike at the posh Gezira Club.
	   ``Work is hard, but there's no choice. We need the money,''
Hanan says. The most difficult part is living away from home, she
confesses, her eyes filling with tears.
	   This is the childhood lived by two million Egyptian youngsters,
many of whom do far dirtier or more dangerous work.
	   Human rights groups regularly condemn such practices and demand
an outright ban on child labor. And Western countries _ where
incomes are larger and families smaller _ impose sanctions on
companies to try stop the hiring of children.
	   But social and economic realities beg for a more sympathetic
understanding of child labor in poor countries like Egypt, where
children have always been part of the work force.
	   Experts say that banning child labor and imposing sanctions on
factories could have even more heartbreaking results _ throwing
children into mean streets or taking away the meager earnings that
feed them and their families.
	   ``Who are you punishing when you impose sanctions on child
labor?'' asks Adel Azer, a U.N. consultant. ``We don't want to make
life more difficult for these people.''
	   That's a view shared by many, including officials at the
Ministry of Social Affairs who admit that despite a law that bans
children under 15 from working, they are helpless to stop it.
	   ``Poor families have no choice and are forced to send their
children to work.... No one has any control over this,'' said Anwar
el-Sherif, deputy minister of social affairs.
	   The picture is repeated throughout the Middle East, from poor
countries like Yemen to oil-rich ones like Saudi Arabia. Poverty
and political turmoil force children into the most menial jobs or
into begging on the streets.
	   In Iran, young girls with tiny fingers work in carpet workshops,
often family enterprises. In the Gulf states of Oman, the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar, camel jockeys as young as 5 take part in
weekend camel races.
	   But Egypt, with six million of its 63 million people living
below the poverty line, is where the problem of child labor stands
out most starkly.
	   ---
	   Sabah Abdelwahab, 30, crouches on the floor holding her head in
one hand as she explains why she sent her son Osama to work five
years ago _ at age 8 _ after her husband left her to marry another
woman.
	   ``What can we do? He's a help. His father doesn't give us
anything. Who's going to help?'' she asks, smiling nervously.
	   Osama says he gets dizzy spells since he was hit by a car last
year. Still he works for 15 pounds (dlrs 4.50) a week at an auto
repair shop, from 9 a.m. to 10 at night, to help feed his two
younger sisters and smaller brother.
	   His mother brings in about 20 pounds (dlrs 5.80) a week baking
bread for the neighbors. A big mud oven for the baking takes up
most of one of the family's two rooms. A tiny kerosene burner is
used for cooking.
	   They pay five pounds (dlrs 1.4) a month for their lodging, which
is infested with flies and littered with garbage. The whole family
sleeps in one big bed.
	   Osama's dream is to go to school, but he sees no point in
dreaming. ``There's no money,'' he says.
	   What keeps him going is his day off on Friday _ when he plays
soccer with neighborhood children _ and the hope that his brothers
and sisters may go to school.
	   ``I feel responsible for the family. They are still young and
have to be taken care of,'' he says, rubbing his hands stained with
black motor grease.
	   ---
	   Isam Ilwi _ the potter's helper _ wants an education, too.
	   But his academic history offers little hope: his father sent him
to work in Cairo after he failed in school three years in a row. He
lives with his young uncle in a small room near the pottery
workshop.
	   He says he misses his family in Fayoum, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) from Cairo. He complains his work is too hard, the load is
too heavy and his body aches.
	   He would have liked to become a school teacher and has a simply
answer when asked why he would choose teaching.
	   ``A comfortable life,'' he says.
	   ---
	   Hanan Mukhtar, the maid and nanny to Seif, seems luckier than
some of the other young workers. She wears a clean blue shirt, long
skirt and gold earrings.
	   But her small, severe face looks sad.

	   Cleaning the bathroom and helping out with the laundry when
little Seif is asleep is tiring. But it's being away from her
family who live in a nearby village is what makes her unhappy.
	   Her 70-pound (dlrs 20.5) monthly salary goes mostly to the
family.
	   ---
	   Rasha, the garbage picker, is cheerful _ perhaps because she
gets to live with her family.
	   Although she finds work boring, she has time for play. Her
parents, four brothers and four sisters live in the stinking
Manshiet Nasser neighborhood on Cairo's outskirts.
	   All work at sifting through garbage _ crushed cans, splintered
plastic, newspapers and spoiled food _ and selling the paper and
plastic for a few cents.
	   To a visitor who notices the scratches, scabs and scars on her
arms and legs, Rasha says simply, ``We get hurt.''
	   And has she seen a doctor?
	   ``They heal on their own.''
	   ---
	   Egyptian government says it is limited in what it can do to
improve the miserable lives of these children. It needs a richer
economy and far more money would be needed for welfare and schools.
	   As it is, the government hands out 100 pounds a month (about
dlrs 30) to help destitute families and encourage them to keep
their children in school. Basics like bread, sugar and medicines
are subsidized, a practice condemned by Western countries as
counter to a free-market economy.
	   The government tries, at least, to strictly enforce laws against
children working in hazardous conditions _ for example in jobs
using heavy machinery or in leather tanning, where strong chemicals
are used. It encourages setting up vocational training centers
where children can both learn a craft and get an education.
	   Thomas Kring of the International Labor Organization has helped
set up evening classes in poor neighborhoods where children as
young as 12 get vocational training. ``You have to accommodate, at
least for now,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, children like Isam, Osama, Rasha and Hanan are
carrying the burden of their country's poverty on their small
shoulders.
	   And boys and girls in ragged clothes zigzag daily through
Cairo's chaotic and crowded streets trying to sell newspapers,
tissues, flowers and fruits _ or simply begging.

	   Here's a look at child labor in Middle East countries other than
Egypt:
	   ___
	   SUDAN _ Thousands of children suffer serious abuse, including
enslavement, and are pressed into military forces to fight in a
bloody civil war that raged since 1983 between southern rebels and
the government.
	   Also, children as young as 11 or 12 work in factories, sometimes
under hazardous conditions.
	   ___
	   YEMEN _ Economic crisis after the 1991 Gulf War _ when almost a
million men lost jobs in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because Yemen
sided with Iraq _ has forced more than 230,000 children under age
15 to work. Some 89 percent work on farms; the rest are apprentice
weavers, carpenters and welders.
	   According to the U.N. Children's Fund, children earn up to dlrs
30 a month and work as much as 17 hours a day. They are 6 percent
of the labor force.
	   ___
	   PALESTINIAN AREAS _ Poverty caused by Israeli closures has taken
as many as 55,000 children between the ages of 12 and 16 out of
school and into the labor force.
	   ___
	   GULF _ In the Gulf states of Oman, the United Arab Emirates and
Qatar, camel jockeys as young as 5 take part in weekend races.
Children _ who are strapped on the camel with a belt so they don't
fall _ are prized as jockeys for their weight. Trainers prefer
children under 15 kilograms (33 pounds).
	   In Oman, all jockeys are Omani Bedouin who inherit the job _
considered a source of pride _ from their fathers. Jockeys in Qatar
are from Sudan. In the Emirates, Indian and Pakistani children are
hired for the August-April season.
	   ___
	   IRAN _ Despite laws against child labor, young rural girls
continue the tradition of carpet-weaving. Their small fingers are
ideal for intricate weaving, but cheap labor is believed to be the
main reason for hiring them. Sitting up for eight hours a day puts
great strain on their small bodies, and many suffer spinal problems
later. Many also suffer from eye problems due to bad lighting in
the workplace.
	   ___
	   THROUGHOUT MIDEAST _ Child peddlers and beggars work the streets
in many Mideast countries. The peddlers sell fruits and vegetables,
cigarettes, tissues, tiny cups of Arab coffee and many other items.

Southern Command chief: US military aid strictly anti-drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The top U.S. military commander for
Latin America said Wednesday the United States has no combat
advisers in Colombia and its role is strictly to assist in fighting
drugs.
	   ``The role of our military forces who work with and assist their
counterparts in Colombia is limited to the counter-narcotics
threat,'' Gen. Charles Wilhelm said. He said he did not expect the
U.S. policy to change.
	   The general said 150-200 American military personnel in Colombia
on any given day provide army and police units with instruction,
support and military equipment but are not involved in
counterinsurgency efforts
	   Leftist rebels have handed Colombia's tattered military a string
of recent defeats _ including overrunning a major anti-narcotics
base on Aug. 3 _ and U.S. policy-makers are increasingly worried
about Colombia's ability to contain them.
	   Wilhelm, who heads the U.S. Southern Command, was on a three-day
visit to the country he has called the hemisphere's main security
threat. He held talks with newly installed President Andres
Pastrana, Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda and the military high
command.
	   It was his third visit to Colombia this year.
	   Wilhelm said he discussed with military officials how best to
use the millions of dollars worth of aid being provided by the
Pentagon, which includes machine guns and training in
light-infantry tactics. The aid is earmarked primarily for units
involved in counter-narcotics activities.
	   Colombia is the world's leading exporter of cocaine and rebels
are increasingly relying on revenues from the drug trade to fund
their insurgency.
	   Most U.S. aid goes to Colombia's police, but critics say it is
impossible to combat drugs without helping those fighting the
guerrillas, and that involves the army.
	   In an interview Tuesday, national police chief Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano said the rebels who defend cocaine processing labs in
southern Colombia are so well-armed and trained that raiding them
``is a highly surgical military operation'' requiring 50 men.
	   ``You can't say its a police operation, its a Vietnam-type
action,'' Serrano told The Associated Press.

Security Council suspends Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATES with Clinton, Russian reax &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has taken its first
major step to punish Iraq for paralyzing U.N. weapons inspections,
suspending periodic reviews of the 8-year-old sanctions that have
strangled Iraq's economy.
	   A resolution suspending the reviews was adopted 15-0 Wednesday,
leaving Baghdad with no avenue to have sanctions lifted.
	   In its strongest response yet to the impasse, the council
condemned Iraq's decision to freeze cooperation with inspectors as
``a totally unacceptable contravention'' of U.N. resolutions.
	   But it also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
	   The council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
sanctions after Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move
could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress of ridding
itself of weapons of mass destruction while generating pressure for
a lifting of sanctions.
	   The council also invited Secretary-General Kofi Annan to give
his views about how such a comprehensive review should be carried
out _ a concession to France which had sought the U.N. chief's
involvement in reporting Iraq's progress.
	   Annan has pressed for an end to the sanctions. France, along
with Russia and China, generally takes a more sympathetic view
toward Iraq.
	   The other permanent council members _ Britain and the United
States _ which take a harder line, nevertheless claimed success
with the resolution. Both have been accused by a former arms
inspector, Scott Ritter, of backing off their stated goal of
disarming Iraq in favor of a less confrontational, softer approach.
	   Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador, said the resolution
told Iraq that the road to sanctions relief was open if it responds
to Security Council requirements.
	   ``The mechanisms for that are being adapted to make it slightly
easier for Iraq to respond to those requirements,'' he said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton applauded the vote, saying ``The
Security Council has made crystal clear that the burden remains on
Iraq to declare and destroy all its nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.''
	   The resolution suspends a major, 6-month review scheduled for
October, and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with inspectors.
	   Years of the regular reviews, however, have never resulted in
any easing of the measures, so Wednesday's action was largely
symbolic.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, which were imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons. The inspections cannot take place
unless Iraqi escorts accompany inspectors.
	   Iraq's ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said any resolution that
condemned Iraq was unfair because Baghdad had good reasons for
ending cooperation.
	   Nevertheless, he welcomed intervention by the U.N. chief, saying
``the more the secretary-general is prominent, the more Iraq gets
interested in this whole matter,'' of a comprehensive review.
	   Such a review, he said, would focus on the real issue of
disarmament which would end with the lifting of sanctions on Iraq.

Flooding leaves at least 32 dead in Mexico

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican troops, doctors and rescue
workers were struggling to reach scores of southern towns swamped
by floods, and heavy rains pelted some areas for the seventh
straight day.
	   At least 32 people have been reported killed and dozens more
were missing in flooding across the country. The Pacific coastal
zones of the southern state of Chiapas have been the most
devastated.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo flew to Tapachula, 10 miles (16
kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, on Wednesday night to help
coordinate rescue and relief efforts. He made no public statements
before entering the military compound where he was staying.
	   Tapachula, a city of 250,000 people, was itself a mess. In the
last three days, it has received 18 inches (45 centimeters) of
rain. Lines were a block long outside grocery stores as residents
waited to buy food.
	   Other towns were also hard hit.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' Marco Antonio Santiso told Associated Press Television. He
lives in Huixtla, a town 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Tapachula
on the Pacific coast.
	   State officials said the death toll could rise. More dead and
injured may be found as rescue workers, many of whom are blocked by
raging rivers and downed bridges, push into the most affected
areas, they said.
	   ``The fact that 25 townships are cut off prevents us from
finding out what has happened to villagers there. They're
completely isolated,'' Roberto Munoz Lievano, Chiapas state
interior secretary, said.
	   In Huixtla, some residents huddled in their homes, ignoring
calls by police to evacuate even as the swollen Huixtla River tore
away and swallowed huge pieces of riverbank and the brick walls of
homes. Torrential downpours lashed the area.
	   Zedillo late Tuesday ordered 1,100 troops and two large jets
loaded with doctors, medical equipment and specialized personnel to
Chiapas.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast. He said at least 25,000 people in more
than 50 towns and villages were driven from their homes by rising
rivers and creeks.
	   State officials said 25 people had drowned by Tuesday night in
Chiapas and nearly 50 more were missing. Another seven people died
in flash flooding in other parts of Mexico, which is being battered
by a tropical storm in the Pacific and a tropical depression in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the threat of overflowing
dams forced workers to cut away road repairs so that new waters
could escape.
	   Guatemalan authorities evacuated 2,000 people from areas near
the Mexican border after rivers there overflowed their banks.
	   ``People are dying because their houses suddenly were swept
up,'' said Gilberto de los Santos, mayor of the coastal town of
Pijijiapan, where 18 people have drowned.
	   ``There is no way to bury the corpses ... the river keeps rising
and the rain still keeps coming,'' he said.

Williams defeats Sanchez-Vicario to advance to semi-finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Williams defeating Sanchez-Vicario; will be
UPDATED with quotes and again after Sampras-Kucera match. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams needed a set to adjust to the
wind and cold, then turned up the heat with an awesome display of
power tennis to reach the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
	   The fifth-seeded Williams, undermined by repeated errors in the
first set, overpowered No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario the rest of
the match in a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory Wednesday night.
	   Williams, a finalist at the U.S. Open last year, will face No. 2
Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. Davenport's power was too much
for No. 13 Amanda Coetzer in a 6-0, 6-4 victory earlier Wednesday.
	   In the men's quarterfinals, defending champion Patrick Rafter
had 44 winners and only 14 unforced errors in a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5
victory over No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman.
	   Rafter, seeded third, will face the winner of Wednesday night's
match between top-seeded Pete Sampras and No. 9 Karol Kucera in the
semifinals.
	   Williams began the match wearing a bright-yellow hooded
sweatshirt, but still seemed bothered by the chilly evening. She
was trailing 3-2 and had already lost her serve twice when she
stripped to a light-blue tank top.
	   Williams seemed to lunge for shots the rest of the set, battling
the swirling wind as much as her opponent.
	   But then she decided to become more careful with her shots, and
began to turn the match around.
	   ``It was windy. I wasn't hitting my big serves. I just had to
spin them in,'' she said. ``In the first set I was missing a lot, I
wasn't patient. I stayed away from my game plan. I just had to stop
missing. I just had to make up my mind that I wasn't going to miss
any more.''
	   After 18 unforced errors in the first set, Williams had just 17
the rest of the match. And, as she regained control, she was able
to turn up the power.
	   Rafter was far too quick for Bjorkman _ who played in long
sleeves on a chilly afternoon made even colder by a 24-mph (39 kph)
wind. Rafter used his exceptional speed to control the match,
running down the Swede's passing shots and darting to the net for
winning volleys.
	   The wind turned service tosses into adventures. On one toss, the
ball was blown so far away from Rafter that he didn't even attempt
to catch it _ instead, letting it bounce and roll toward a ballboy.
	   But Rafter said the conditions were no worse than those in Mount
Isa, the Australian town where he grew up playing tennis.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Davenport was consistent, if not spectacular, getting 94 percent
of her first serves in during the first set. She never lost her
serve in the match, despite struggling with the wind.
	   ``It's tough. When you're with the wind, you can't hit the ball
too far or it flies long. On the other side, you have to hit the
ball hard,'' Davenport said. ``You never know what's going to
happen out there in the wind.''
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.
	   ``The wind and the delays probably helped me a little bit. I was
definitely struggling with the way she was hitting the ball,''
Coetzer, of South Africa, said. ``Often the wind is a little bit of
an equalizer. And the rain delays gave me a little bit of an
opportunity to slow things down, have a chance to speak to my
coach.''
	   Coetzer, who at 5-foot-2 (1.58 meters) is more than a foot (30
centimeters) shorter than her 6-2 1-2 (1.89-meter) opponent, said
she was intimidated by the power and depth of Davenport's shots.
	   ``It's tennis. There's no requirements to play, no age
requirements, no height requirement, no weight requirement. Tennis
is tennis,'' Davenport said. ``I can't help it that I'm a lot
taller than her and I hit the ball harder.''

Once again, Davenport in U.S. Open semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with semifinal opponent &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Back in the U.S. Open semifinals for a second
straight year, Lindsay Davenport seems poised and primed for her
run at a first Grand Slam championship.
	   ``I've played well,'' she said after beating Amanda Coetzer 6-0,
6-4 in the quarterfinals Wednesday. ``I haven't lost a set. I'm
pretty focused on what I want to do. My goal is to get to the
finals and win it.''
	   In Friday's semis, Davenport will face fifth-seed Venus
Williams, who advanced with a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory Wednesday night
over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
	   Davenport, ranked No. 3 and seeded No. 2 at the Open, ignored an
achy elbow and blustery winds to breeze through the first set
against Coetzer in just 18 minutes. But then she had to struggle a
bit in the second after being forced off the court a couple of
times because of passing showers.
	   ``It was tough stopping and starting, then stopping and starting
again,'' she said. ``It's hard mentally more than anything.''
	   The elbow didn't need the extra work.
	   ``I think if anything, it's pretty much made me concentrate on
just making first serves, not going for it too much, stuff that I
need to do,'' she said.
	   Coetzer turned stubborn at the end, fighting off four match
points before Davenport finally converted the fifth one.
	   ``It was tough, especially in these conditions,'' Davenport
said. ``You never know what's going to happen. I really stayed
positive. When I got back to deuce, I tried to give myself another
opportunity to win the match. ... All of a sudden, she kind of
stopped missing for a while. I hung in there. I was finally able to
close it out.''
	   Now she wants to close out the tournament.
	   A year ago, Davenport washed out in the semifinals against
Martina Hingis.
	   ``I was extremely nervous,'' she said. ``I didn't play great. I
played OK. In the semifinals, you have to play great. Obviously,
the other player on the other side of the net has won just as many
matches and is still there. You have to be concentrated and focused
and play good tennis. That's what I'm going to try and do.''
	   She is in the best shape of her career, playing on her favorite
surface and riding the wave of three hardcourt tournament victories
during the summer. She won 14 straight matches before losing in the
semifinals of a pre-Open warmup tournament at New Haven,
Connecticut.
	   ``I feel I've done everything I can up to this point to try and
win this tournament,'' she said. ``I'm going to give it my best
shot. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. If it happens,
that's great.''
	   She is trying to remain low key about her chances.
	   ``I don't lie awake at night and just see myself winning a Grand
Slam,'' she said. ``I hate to put so much pressure on one match.
This is my chance to get to the finals of the Open. I had a shot
last year. Maybe I'll have another shot next year. You never know
when it's your time.''

Bruins, Bourque agree on two-year contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede and ADDS more details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The Boston Bruins and defenseman Ray Bourque have
agreed on a new contract extending his career by another season,
the team announced Wednesday.
	   Terms of the contract were not released, but it changes the
amount Bourque and the team had previously agreed he would be paid
this year and adds a second year.
	   ``Quite obviously, I am totally pleased with the fact that we
were able to reach this agreement which will hopefully keep Ray in
a Bruins uniform for the rest of his career,'' Bruins president and
general manager Harry Sinden said.
	   Bourque, 38, is the longest-tenured active player in North
American pro sports as he enters his 20th season with Boston in
1998-99. The new contract runs through the 1999-2000 season.
	   Bourque is a five-time winner of the Norris Trophy, the award
given annually to the league's outstanding defenseman. This is
second only to Hall of Famers Bobby Orr, who won eight, and Doug
Harvey, who won seven.
	   Bourque holds team records with 1,036 assists and 1,411 points.
He needs eight goals, 54 assists and 62 points to match Paul
Coffey's NHL career records for a defenseman.

Senators re-sign coach

<TEXT>
	   KANATA, Ontario (AP) _ The Ottawa Senators have re-signed head
coach Jacques Martin to a multi-year deal, the team announced
Wednesday.
	   Terms of the deal were not released.
	   Martin, named the Senators' coach Jan. 24, 1996, has led Ottawa
to the playoffs the last two seasons. He has a 75-93-34 record with
Ottawa, including a 34-33-15 mark last season that set club records
for points (83), wins (34), home wins (18) and points on the road
(40).
	   The Senators upset the top-seeded New Jersey Devils in the first
round of last season's Eastern Conference playoffs in six games.
Ottawa lost to the Washington Capitals in the conference semifinals
in five games.

It's official: Redskins are for sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASHBURN, Virginia (AP) _ The Cleveland Browns deal is done. Next
on the block: the Washington Redskins.
	   One day after the U.S. National Football League accepted a
record dlrs 530 million offer for the Cleveland Browns, the estate
of the late Jack Kent Cooke formally opened the bidding Wednesday
for the sale of one of the major franchises in U.S. professional
sports.
	   The announcement came in a brief press release from investment
banking firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which the estate's
trustees retained to coordinate the sale.
	   The release gave few details, although a legal source close to
the process said he expected the team, along with the new Jack Kent
Cooke Stadium, to be sold shortly after the end of the NFL season.
	   If the sale is expedited, it would not be good news for Cooke's
son and Redskins president John Kent Cooke, who wants to buy the
team but lacks the personal wealth to do so. The will of the elder
Cooke, who died in April 1997, left his son just dlrs 10 million
and directed that the bulk of his estate, estimated at more than
dlrs 800 million, be sold to fund a foundation that would provide
scholarships for exceptional and underprivileged children.
	   By law, the trustees have six years before they have to sell the
team, but Cooke's will dictated that the sale take place without
considerable delay. All of Cooke's other assets, such as New York's
landmark Chrysler Building, have already been sold.
	   Even before Wednesday's announcement, there was already a bid on
the table. New York entrepreneur Andrew Penson has offered drs 450
million for the team and the stadium, although his offer would not
assume the stadium's dlrs 161 million debt.
	   ``Mr. Penson has made a very serious offer,'' Maryland real
estate developer Nathan Landow, who is acting as Penson's local
liaison, said Wednesday. ``We're anxiously awaiting some word from
the trustees as to what the next step will be.''
	   By waiting for the completion of the Browns sale _ which didn't
include a stadium _ the trustees can expect to get considerably
more than Penson's initial offer. Also, some losers in the
Cleveland process may now consider making a run at the Redskins.
	   John Kent Cooke, who is seeking investment partners, had no
comment Wednesday, but in the past has acknowledged that the
process will be ``as complicated as it will be expensive.''
	   Any sale must be approved by a majority of the seven trustees.
Cooke is president of the trustees, but he cannot vote because of
his interest in buying the team.

Smiley exits bidding for Marlins; Dombrowski to stay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF SHAIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Florida Marlins president Don Smiley said Wednesday
he has ended his quest to buy the World Series champions, saying he
couldn't match a rival's promise to keep the team in South Florida
through at least 2010.
	   ``I've never wanted to move the team out of South Florida,''
Smiley said during a news conference. ``But I could not make that
assurance. It wasn't feasible to make on my group's behalf.''
	   The move clears the way for Boca Raton commodities trader John
Henry to negotiate exclusively with founding owner H. Wayne
Huizenga for the 6-year-old franchise.
	   Huizenga, who put the team up for sale in June 1997, announced
last November he had reached agreement to sell to a group headed by
Smiley.
	   However, Smiley couldn't raise enough money to meet Huizenga's
dlrs 169 million asking price.
	   Henry, a 48-year-old futures manager, last month offered dlrs
150 million in cash for the club and has been negotiating with
Huizenga representatives for the past two weeks.
	   According to Huizenga, Smiley was the one who suggested the
Marlins purge their payroll of nearly all its high-priced talent in
an attempt to entice investors.
	   The Marlins' dismantling has soured the public on Huizenga,
lionized not long ago for bringing baseball and hockey to South
Florida. Huizenga was booed lustily at the Marlins' home opener. He
hasn't returned to the ballpark since.

Heavyweight puts on show for public at CNN Center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Evander Holyfield, hoping to boost ticket sales
for his Sept. 19 heavyweight title fight in front of the home folks
at the Georgia Dome, sparred six rounds before a Wednesday
lunch-time crowd of about 1,000 at the CNN Center atrium.
	   With only 10 days before his fight with Vaughn Bean, Holyfield,
the WBA and IBF heavyweight champion, is hoping to raise enough
interest to sell out the Dome, set up for a capacity crowd of
40,000.
	   Ticket prices range from dlrs 25 to dlrs 500.
	   ``We've already got 18,000 (tickets sold), so we can't fail,''
Holyfield said moments after sparring three rounds each with Gary
Bell and Cedric Fields in the makeshift ring placed in the middle
of the food court at the downtown office-hotel complex.
	   ``The people will come out. Until the bell rings, we're still
hopeful of a sellout,'' he said.

Protester shot as police launch new crackdown, smash shrine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police fired gunshots point-blank
into a crowd of protesters Thursday, seriously wounding one man in
the fourth straight day of violent unrest against strongman Hun
Sen.
	   Several hundred people had gathered on streets outside the U.S.
Embassy and the residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, a new focal point of unrest since a protest camp was
destroyed Tuesday.
	   Squads of about 40 club-wielding riot police soon arrived, first
smashing apart a makeshift shrine erected where two Buddhist monks
were shot by police in the same neighborhood Wednesday.
	   The demonstrators, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers and students,
started rebuilding the shrine as soon as the police cleared out,
lighting the broken candles and smashed incense sticks.
	   The police returned in greater numbers about 20 minutes later.
The crowd scattered before them toward the embassy as the shrine
was kicked and clubbed to ruins again. The protesters hurled a few
rocks.
	   About five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two of
them firing straight into the crowd. A protester was struck in the
neck and rushed, still breathing, a block away and loaded into an
embassy car.
	   Reports that one monk died in far heavier violence Wednesday
cannot be confirmed, but Cambodians believe several were killed,
escalating the anger against Hun Sen following disputed national
elections July 26.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student. ``We're very angry at the soldiers. We want an
end to dictatorship and corruption.''
	   The protesters scattered before the gunfire and regrouped on
adjacent streets. A car window was smashed by thrown rocks, but the
number of protesters and level of violence were initially lower
than on Wednesday, when thousands of rock-throwers battled police
using clubs, shock batons, guns and water cannon.
	   A contingent of 150 club-swinging police eventually charged down
the street as the clashes intensified.
	   Weeks of relatively peaceful protest calling for Hun Sen's
ouster amid opposition allegations of massive election fraud turned
violent when the Cambodian leader cracked down Monday after
grenades were thrown at his Phnom Penh home.
	   Hun Sen blamed Ranariddh's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, and
ordered his arrest. Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N.
offices in the luxury Cambodiana hotel, though the arrest order has
officially been withdrawn.
	   Tuesday, riot police brutally assaulted a protest camp dubbed
Democracy Square in a park opposite the National Assembly, beating
old women and children with clubs and rifle butts and tearing down
tents that had housed some 1,000 people during a 16-day vigil.
	   Street battles with motorcyclists and other protesters followed
as the destruction of the camp failed to quell opposition to Hun
Sen.
	   Thousands of people gathered again Wednesday near the U.S.
Embassy, urging the United States to help end Hun Sen's 13 years in
power.
	   They were joined by Buddhist monks, who were savaged with clubs,
gunfire and water cannon as they prayed. Monks were expected to
stage marches Thursday but appeared to be staying in their pagodas.

Olympic champion hopes to be on skis before Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ U.S. Olympic ski champion Picabo Street,
rebounding from torn knee ligaments and a broken leg, said
Wednesday she was looking to be back on skis in November but
wouldn't be racing for another year.
	   ``I'm coming out of a hole,'' she said before speaking during
the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association Congress. ``I'll ski for the
winter, then decide what's next.''
	   Two days of meetings and visits with Olympic and ski officials
in Utah were a much-needed pick-me-up, Street said. ``I was pretty
bummed for a while and, really, I think I experienced depression
for the first time in my life. What a funk!''
	   Street, a two-time World Cup downhill champion and the 1996
World Championships downhill gold medalist, won the Olympic super-G
title by one-hundredth of a second, the closest margin in Olympic
ski annals. A month later, she tore the anterior cruciate ligament
in her right knee and broke her left leg when she crashed during
the downhill in the World Cup finals at Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   She appeared Tuesday in an ``Olympic Forum'' in Salt Lake City,
a session designed to gather support from Utahns for the upcoming
winter Olympics.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian postal worker Cathy
Wangeman has swapped her pushbike for a pair of running shoes to
deliver fan mail to Australian athletes at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Wangeman, of Melbourne, is one of five Australia Post workers
selected for a personal mail delivery service in Malaysia.
	   Over the next two weeks, they will hand about 10,000 letters,
postcodes and parcels daily to Australia's 420 athletes and
officials.
	   ``It's all very exciting so there's no-one that stands out who I
want to run up and say a special hello to,'' said Wangeman, who
will deliver the mail from bags decorated with the team colors,
green and gold.
	   Australia pioneered the mail system for its athletes at the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta.
	   ___
	   World squash men's doubles champions Chris Walker and Mark
Cairns have a lot in common.
	   They are both 31-year-old bachelors from Britain and are ranked
11th and 12th in the world, respectively. And both are already
planning for the next Commonwealth Games in 2002 in Manchester,
Britain.
	   ``We will not retire until somebody kick us out from being the
best pair in the world before the next games,'' Cairns said after a
training session Wednesday at the National Squash Complex.
	   Walker and Cairns have remained the top doubles pair since
winning the World Championship in Hong Kong in December, beating
Australians Dan Jenson and Craig Rowland.
	   ___
	   Some 5,350 police officers and other security officials will be
on duty at the games.
	   A number of them were sent to the Atlanta Olympics two years ago
to study the security. Those games were marred by the Centennial
Olympic Park bombing, which killed one, injured more than 100 and
remains unsolved.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, items barred from the stadiums include
umbrellas, crash helmets and canned drinks and food. Metal
detectors have been set up in hotels and other sites and a pass
system for media and athletes is in place.
	   ___
	   After an absence of 20 years, the tiny Caribbean island group of
Turks and Caicos has sent a team to the Commonwealth Games.
	   Team manager John Messon said there has been a resurgence of
interest in sport in the island chain.
	   ``We are here to improve our personal best and also to expose
the team to international competition,'' the Jamaican-born Messon
told the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
	   The team includes runners David Lighbourne and Thyroid Smith,
long jumper Urard Missick and shooter Peter Quelch.
	   ___
	   Cyclists will have to stay up late if bad weather fouls up track
events at the Cheras Velodrome.
	   ``Races will be stopped if heavy rain were to make the tracks
slippery. And they will be resumed when the tracks become dry
although it may be late,'' said Haji Abu Samah Wahab, president of
the Malaysian Cycling Federation.
	   The technical committee had also decided that an event must be
completed on the day it was scheduled.
	   The Commonwealth Games is packed with events this year. Some
5,000 athletes from 70 nations are competing, compared to 3,200 at
the last games in Victoria, Canada, in 1994.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Back in the U.S. Open semifinals for a second
straight year, Lindsay Davenport seems poised and primed for her
run at a first Grand Slam championship.
	   ``I've played well,'' she said after beating Amanda Coetzer 6-0,
6-4 in the quarterfinals Wednesday. ``I haven't lost a set. I'm
pretty focused on what I want to do. My goal is to get to the
finals and win it.''
	   In Friday's semis, Davenport will face fifth-seed Venus
Williams, who advanced with a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory Wednesday night
over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
	   Davenport, ranked No. 3 and seeded No. 2 at the Open, ignored an
achy elbow and blustery winds to breeze through the first set
against Coetzer in just 18 minutes. But then she had to struggle a
bit in the second after being forced off the court a couple of
times because of passing showers.
	   ``It was tough stopping and starting, then stopping and starting
again,'' she said. ``It's hard mentally more than anything.''
	   The elbow didn't need the extra work.
	   ``I think if anything, it's pretty much made me concentrate on
just making first serves, not going for it too much, stuff that I
need to do,'' she said.
	   Coetzer turned stubborn at the end, fighting off four match
points before Davenport finally converted the fifth one.
	   ``It was tough, especially in these conditions,'' Davenport
said. ``You never know what's going to happen. I really stayed
positive. When I got back to deuce, I tried to give myself another
opportunity to win the match. ... All of a sudden, she kind of
stopped missing for a while. I hung in there. I was finally able to
close it out.''
	   Now she wants to close out the tournament.
	   A year ago, Davenport washed out in the semifinals against
Martina Hingis.
	   ``I was extremely nervous,'' she said. ``I didn't play great. I
played OK. In the semifinals, you have to play great. Obviously,
the other player on the other side of the net has won just as many
matches and is still there. You have to be concentrated and focused
and play good tennis. That's what I'm going to try and do.''
	   She is in the best shape of her career, playing on her favorite
surface and riding the wave of three hardcourt tournament victories
during the summer. She won 14 straight matches before losing in the
semifinals of a pre-Open warmup tournament at New Haven,
Connecticut.
	   ``I feel I've done everything I can up to this point to try and
win this tournament,'' she said. ``I'm going to give it my best
shot. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. If it happens,
that's great.''
	   She is trying to remain low key about her chances.
	   ``I don't lie awake at night and just see myself winning a Grand
Slam,'' she said. ``I hate to put so much pressure on one match.
This is my chance to get to the finals of the Open. I had a shot
last year. Maybe I'll have another shot next year. You never know
when it's your time.''

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ No day off for baseball's new home run king. A
capacity crowd wouldn't allow it.
	   A day after he hit No. 62 in front of an adoring home crowd in
St. Louis, a sleepless Mark McGwire took his home run show on the
road Wednesday. He didn't get to bed until the early morning hours
and then found he couldn't nod off as history played out in his
mind.
	   When he got to Cinergy Field for a game against the Cincinnati
Reds, he resisted the temptation to sit out and let it sink in.
There were too many fans for that.
	   ``I'm going to have one or two at-bats,'' he said. ``When you've
got 50,000 fans out there, you've got to make some sort of
showing.''
	   True to his word, McGwire batted twice _ he grounded out and
flew out _ before leaving the game. He tossed a ball and both
batting gloves to fans behind the Cardinals dugout before heading
for the clubhouse.
	   When he came to the plate for the first time, he backed away
three times and waved as the crowd gave him a standing ovation that
lasted for more than a minute.
	   The Reds sold out both games of the series and were expecting
their biggest weekday crowds since Sept. 10-11, 1985, when another
of baseball's most revered records was falling _ Pete Rose passed
Ty Cobb as the career hits leader in Cincinnati.
	   Fans showing up to see Big Mac were disappointed that No. 62 had
gone out in St. Louis, but figured it was appropriate that he did
it at home. Besides, every homer from now on is another record.
	   ``When he hits one, it's still history,'' said 15-year-old
Derrick Smith, who brought a fishing net to Section 237 in left
field hoping for a homer. ``I was hoping he would play and I
figured he would because he is a fan person.''
	   ``Hey, we wouldn't be here on a school night if it wasn't for
him,'' said Mark Brown, 42, who made the two-hour drove from
Columbus with his 12-year-old son, Alex. ``I was hoping he would
play because it was sold out. I thought he would, although I hate
to take advantage of his good nature.''
	   McGwire was good-natured Wednesday, still running on adrenalin,
as he answered the same questions all over again and talked about
his responsibility to the fans who want to get a glimpse of the new
home run king.
	   ``I think I'll finish the season without taking days off,'' he
said. ``I feel pretty good and that's the bottom line. I want to
finish strong.
	   ``Just because of what I've done doesn't mean I'll stop. There's
two weeks left in the season. As far as I'm concerned, I've got a
lot of work ahead of me.''

Dollar remains higher in Tokyo, Japanese stock prices bounce back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained higher against the yen
Thursday morning in Tokyo but off its overnight level in New York
after Japan's central bank eased monetary policy. Japanese stock
prices bounced back moderately.
	   The dollar bought 135.34 yen in midday trading, up 1.94 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 137
yen overnight.
	   The dollar's sharp retreat from its New York level came on the
heels of speculation that U.S. Federal Reserve may soon cut
interest rates. Lower interest rates erode returns for investors
and make the country's currency less attractive.
	   Late Wednesday, the Bank of Japan decided it will push overnight
call money rates _ the rates banks charge each other to borrow
money overnight without collateral _ lower to around 0.25 percent
from the previous 0.5 percent, a measure taken to prevent Japan's
economy from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   The dollar, however, retreated from its late-New York level
because of a belief that the interest rate gap between Japan and
the United States may soon be narrowed with a possible rate cut in
the United States, traders said.
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated on Friday that the
financial turmoil in Asia and Russia may pose more of a threat to
the U.S. economy than inflation. Traders interpreted the statement
as an expression of willingness to cut interest rates.
	   Meanwhile, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the international bureau
at Japan's Finance Ministry, said Thursday that Japan is ready to
intervene in foreign exchange markets to support the yen if it
falls too low.
	   On the stock market, traders attributed gains to the central
bank decision to lower rates, although many said the announcement
alone would not be enough to spark a sustained rally
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 73.83 points, or 0.50
percent, to 14,829.37 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the index had lost 157.95 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.30 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,121.31. The
TOPIX lost 15 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   Following the Bank of Japan's decision to guide unsecured call
money rates lower, the yield on the Japanese benchmark bond fell to
a record low of less than 1 percent.
	   The yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond
dropped to 0.880 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.005 percent,
driving its price up to 113.97 yen from 113.04 yen.
	   The previous record-low yield was 0.995 percent on Sept. 1.

Disease spreads as China's floods persist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Massive floods along the Yangtze River have
caused snail fever and other diseases to spread, increasing the
risk of epidemics, the official newspaper China Daily reported
Thursday.
	   The floods have caused a severe setback in efforts to eradicate
snail fever, also known as schistosomiasis, from wide areas of
southern and central China, with 513 cases reported in Jingzhou, a
county in Hubei province, the report said.
	   Exposure to flood waters has aided the spread of the
debilitating disease, which is caused by water-borne parasites
endemic to central China. Victims suffer from liver, urinary, lung
and nervous system disorders.
	   The report said many snail fever control stations had been
destroyed by the floods and that Jingzhou urgently required
medicine and relief funds.
	   In other areas along the Yangtze, many flood victims are
suffering from colds and from skin infections due to exposure to
contaminated water, the report said.
	   It said that although outbreaks of cholera and other infectious
diseases had been controlled, careful hygiene was necessary to
prevent epidemics.
	   Deadly typhoid fever already has broken out in the flooded
northeast.
	   The heavy flooding in the northeast and in the Yangtze basin
this summer has killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left
millions homeless, according to government statistics.
	   Along the Yangtze, China's longest river, the floods are the
worst since 1954, when 30,000 people died, about 90 percent of them
from contagious diseases after floodwaters receded.

Two large South Korean banks agree to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two large and relatively healthy banks
have agreed to merge to create the second largest commercial bank
in South Korea, bank officials said Thursday.
	   Kookmin Bank and Korea Long-Term Credit Bank, two of the
nation's top seven banks, plan to sign a memorandum of
understanding Friday to merge effective Jan. 4, bank officials
said.
	   It will be the third merger of Korean commercial banks this
year. Hanil Bank and Commercial Bank of Korea announced plans to
merge in July and Hana Bank and Boram Bank did the same earlier
this week, both effective Jan. 4.
	   Kookmin and Long-Term Credit Bank recorded a combined net profit
of 57.7 billion won (dlrs 41.2 million) for the first six months
this year. The combined bank will have assets of 84.6 trillion won
(dlrs 60.4 billion).
	   Analysts said the latest merger will spur more reorganization of
South Korea's inefficient, bad-debt-ridden banking sector.
	   ``There are three major ways to improve banks' finances: foreign
investment, capital increase and merger. For now, merger seems to
be the most feasible way,'' said Suh Young-ho, an analyst at Daewoo
Securities Co.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, banks were left with mounds of bad loans, triggering a sudden
loss of international confidence that led to the financial crisis.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund
from the International Monetary Fund in December. In return, the
nation is required to reform its bloated industrial and financial
sectors.
	   The government had previously shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks and five small commercial banks. But critics said that was
not enough.
	   To boost voluntary mergers to create more efficient, stronger
banks, the government has promised to help by writing off bad loans
and offering tax benefits.

Legislature expels convicted legislator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The legislature voted nearly unanimously to
expel a convicted lawmaker who has been imprisoned for attempting
forgery in a land deal, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Chim Pui-chung, an eight-year veteran of Hong Kong's legislature
and representative of the financial services sector, was ousted
late Wednesday by 45 of his former fellow legislators. He became
the first lawmaker to be ousted by his own colleagues.
	   Chim was sentenced last month to three years in jail on the
charge stemming from a 350 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 44.8
million) land deal in 1992. An appeal has been submitted.
	   Chim, famous for his outspoken and high-spending ways, was
absent from the meeting Wednesday to protest prison officials'
decision to keep his handcuffs on until he was in the legislative
chambers.
	   ``It would be a public scandal if this council were to allow Mr.
Chim to continue in his public office,'' independent lawmaker
Margaret Ng said during the debate.
	   The only dissenter, Raymond Ho, said he abstained because legal
opinion was divided over whether Chim's conviction was final until
his appeal was heard, the South China Morning Post reported.
	   Chim, who rides around Hong Kong in a gold Rolls Royce, was
re-elected in May in balloting by only about 300 people _ members
of the financial services industry.
	   A new election must be held to fill his post.
	   Chim tried unsuccessfully Tuesday to seek a court order to block
the debate the oust him until his court appeal is heard.
	   Chim's case could tarnish the reputation of the majority of
legislators, who were not chosen by popular vote, at a time when
there are increasing calls for broadening democracy in Hong Kong.
	   Only 20 members of the legislature were chosen by direct vote in
May 24 elections. The number is to increase slowly in the next 10
years.
	   Thirty members, including Chim, were chosen by elections within
specified professions, and the final 10 by an 800-member election
committee. Those 40 seats are dominated by pro-Beijing elites.

UPDATED after Sampras-Kucera match.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Williams, Sanchez-Vicario quotes; RECASTS; will be
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Once she adjusted to the wind and cold, Venus
Williams was able to play her game. And there are few players in
women's tennis who can handle that kind of power.
	   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario certainly wasn't able to Wednesday night
at the U.S. Open.
	   As spectators huddled beneath blankets, Williams used an awesome
display of power tennis to reach the semifinals. Undermined by
repeated errors in the first set, the fifth-seeded Williams
overpowered No. 4 Sanchez-Vicario the rest of the match in a 2-6,
6-1, 6-1 victory.
	   ``In the first set I was missing a lot, I wasn't patient. I
stayed away from my game plan,'' Williams said. ``I just had to
stop missing. I just had to make up my mind that I wasn't going to
miss any more.''
	   Williams, a finalist at the U.S. Open last year, will face No. 2
Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. Davenport's power was too much
for No. 13 Amanda Coetzer in a 6-0, 6-4 victory earlier Wednesday.
	   In the men's quarterfinals, defending champion Patrick Rafter
had 44 winners and only 14 unforced errors in a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5
victory over No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman.
	   Rafter, seeded third, will face the winner of Wednesday night's
match between top-seeded Pete Sampras and No. 9 Karol Kucera in the
semifinals.
	   Williams began the match wearing a bright-yellow hooded
sweatshirt, but still seemed bothered by the chilly evening. She
was trailing 3-2 and had already lost her serve twice when she
stripped to a light-blue tank top.
	   Williams seemed to lunge for shots the rest of the set, battling
the swirling wind as much as her opponent.
	   But then she decided to become more careful with her shots, and
began to turn the match around.
	   ``It was windy. I wasn't hitting my big serves. I just had to
spin them in,'' she said.
	   After 18 unforced errors and three double faults in the first
set, Williams had just 17 unforced errors and two double faults the
rest of the match. And, as she regained control of her shots, she
was able to turn up the power.
	   The game of the match came late in the second set. On the 22nd
point of the game, Williams finally converted her sixth set point
to even the match.
	   Williams broke Sanchez-Vicario's serve in the first game of the
third set, and again in the fifth on a shot the Spaniard thought
was going out and watched as it hit the line. Williams closed out
the match with yet another break, wrapping up the victory with a
backhand down the line.
	   ``She started playing much more aggressive. She started
attacking,'' Sanchez-Vicario said. ``I mean, she's a player that
hits the ball really hard.''
	   Rafter was far too quick for Bjorkman _ who played in long
sleeves on a chilly afternoon made even colder by a 24-mph (39-kph)
wind. Rafter used his exceptional speed to control the match,
running down Bjorkman's passing shots and darting to the net for
winning volleys.
	   The wind turned service tosses into adventures. On one toss, the
ball was blown so far away from Rafter that he didn't even attempt
to catch it _ instead, letting it bounce and roll toward a ballboy.
	   But Rafter said the conditions were no worse than those in Mount
Isa, the Australian town where he grew up playing tennis.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Davenport was consistent, if not spectacular, getting 94 percent
of her first serves in during the first set. She never lost her
serve in the match, despite struggling with the wind.
	   ``It's tough. When you're with the wind, you can't hit the ball
too far or it flies long. On the other side, you have to hit the
ball hard,'' Davenport said. ``You never know what's going to
happen out there in the wind.''
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.
	   ``The wind and the delays probably helped me a little bit. I was
definitely struggling with the way she was hitting the ball,''
Coetzer said. ``Often the wind is a little bit of an equalizer. And
the rain delays gave me a little bit of an opportunity to slow
things down, have a chance to speak to my coach.''

Legislators reject call for halt to government market intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Legislators have rejected a call for the
government to stop intervening in Hong Kong's stock and futures
markets, news reports said Thursday.
	   Although the government has already implemented some measures
and proposed others aimed at stabilizing the markets, further
intervention could not be ruled out, legislators argued at a weekly
meeting late Wednesday.
	   The Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest political party, had
pressed for the government to halt its intervention in order to
protect the integrity of Hong Kong's free market and restore
investor confidence and market stability.
	   But Rebecca Lai, acting financial services secretary, told
legislators the government could not halt the intervention because
speculators were waiting in the wings, news reports said.
	   Many legislators agreed, saying halting intervention would not
stabilize the markets or restore investor confidence.
	   ``While we do not believe the long term solution is to keep
throwing money in these markets, we can see that need in extreme
circumstances,'' legislator Ronald Arculli of the business-oriented
Liberal Party said.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of the territory's
U.S. dlrs 96.5 billion foreign exchange reserves in two weeks of
buying stocks and futures last month.
	   The buying was aimed at driving out speculators, whom the
government accused of manipulating currency, stock and futures
markets.
	   Since then, new measures have been introduced to clamp down on
speculators and also reduce the need for government intervention.

Protester shot as police launch new crackdown; shrine smashed

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new clashes, ASEAN urging calm; ADDS byline.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police fired gunshots point-blank
into a crowd of protesters Thursday, seriously wounding one man in
the fourth straight day of violent unrest against strongman Hun
Sen.
	   Several hundred people had gathered on streets outside the U.S.
Embassy and the residence of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, a new focal point of unrest since a protest camp was
destroyed Tuesday.
	   Squads of about 40 club-wielding riot police soon arrived, first
smashing apart a makeshift shrine erected where two Buddhist monks
were shot by police Wednesday.
	   The demonstrators, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers and students,
started rebuilding the shrine as soon as the police left,
relighting the broken candles and smashed incense sticks.
	   The police returned in greater numbers 20 minutes later. The
crowd scattered toward the embassy as the shrine was kicked and
clubbed to ruins again. The protesters hurled a few rocks.
	   About five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two of
them firing straight into the crowd. A protester was struck in the
neck and rushed, still breathing, a block away and loaded into an
embassy car.
	   Hospital officials said he was still alive.
	   Reports that one monk died in heavier violence Wednesday cannot
be confirmed, but Cambodians believe several were killed,
escalating anger against Hun Sen following disputed national
elections July 26.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts,
and resolve their problems through dialogue and consultations in
order to prevent further deterioration of the situation.''
	   ASEAN urged all sides to accept the results of the elections, in
which Hun Sen won a slight parliamentary majority but lacks the
two-thirds needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges
massive electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   ASEAN, which postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh in a bloody coup last year, noted that the
international community had endorsed the vote as sufficiently free
and fair.
	   The verdict was disputed on Phnom Penh's streets.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student. ``We're very angry at the soldiers. We want an
end to dictatorship and corruption.''
	   After Thursday's shooting, the protesters regrouped on adjacent
streets. A car window was smashed by thrown rocks, but the number
of protesters and level of violence were lower than Wednesday.
	   A contingent of 150 club-swinging police eventually charged down
the street as the clashes intensified. They pushed the
demonstrators out of the area onto a main boulevard and kept them
moving.
	   Shops were closed, and nervous police scanned the balconies,
fearful of rocks being thrown. They pushed people back into their
doorways and ordered them off the balconies.
	   Four truckloads of soldiers then started regular laps through
the area, trying to keep protesters from regrouping.
	   Weeks of relatively peaceful protest turned violent when Hun Sen
cracked down Monday after grenades were thrown at his house.
	   Hun Sen blamed Ranariddh's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, and
ordered his arrest. Sam Rainsy has denied involvement and sought
refuge in the local U.N. offices, staying there except for two
meetings with Ranariddh.
	   Outraged by the violence against the monks, Ranariddh declared
Wednesday that Hun Sen was inciting revolution and called for a
massive, peaceful rally Sunday. The Interior Ministry quickly
denied permission.
	   Tuesday, riot police brutally assaulted a protest camp dubbed
Democracy Square in a park opposite the National Assembly, smashing
old women and children with clubs and rifle butts and tearing down
tents that had housed some 1,000 people during a 16-day vigil.
	   Thousands of protesters gathered Wednesday near the U.S.
Embassy, including Buddhist monks, who were savaged with clubs,
gunfire and water cannon. Monks were expected to stage marches
Thursday but appeared to be staying in their pagodas.
	   The Cambodians believe the United States will somehow rescue
them from Hun Sen, who has dominated the country for 13 years.
	   A copy of a letter written to President Clinton by three U.S.
congressmen saying ``there will never be stability or force in
Cambodia as long as he remains in power'' was circulating among the
crowd.

Yankees clinch AL East title

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The New York Yankees clinched their second AL East
title in three season, beating the Boston Red Sox 7-5 Wednesday
night as Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill both hit a pair of solo
homers.
	   The Yankees, who have led by 10 games or more since June 24,
improved to 102-41 and moved 20 1/2 games ahead of second-place
Boston. The Red Sox lost for the sixth time in seven games.
	   Ramiro Mendoza (9-2) was the winner and Mariano Rivera got three
outs for his 35th save. Tim Wakefield (15-8) allowed five runs and
five hits in four innings.
 &UR; Rangers 8, Royals 0
	   In Arlington, Texas, Aaron Sele (18-10) won his fifth straight
start and Lee Stevens hit a three-run homer as Texas won its third
straight. The Rangers, 8-3 against Kansas City this year, had 14
hits, including a season-high seven doubles.
	   Sele allowed five hits in seven innings, walked one and struck
out seven, five of them looking.
	   Pat Rapp (11-12) lasted just 2 1-3 innings, his shortest outing
since April 25.
 &UR; Orioles 6, Athletics 2
	   In Oakland, California, Roberto Alomar hit a three-run homer and
Brady Anderson hit a solo shot as Baltimore won its second straight
following a 3-7 stretch.
	   Juan Guzman (10-14) allowed both runs and six hits in five
innings, and Jimmy Key, Alan Mills and Jesse Orosco followed and
combined on one-hit relief.
	   A's starter Jimmy Haynes (10-8) gave up all six runs _ four
earned _ and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Mariners 5, Devil Rays 2
	   In Seattle, Paul Abbott (1-0) won his first start in five years
and Ryan Radmanovich hit his first major league home run.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. went 1-for-4 and remained at 50 home runs. Alex
Rodriguez was 2-for-4 and stole his 41st base but remained one
homer shy of becoming the third 40-40 player in major league
history.
	   Abbott (1-0), who had a ligament in his elbow replaced last
season, allowed two runs and six hits in 5 2-3 innings. Mike Timlin
got three outs for his 14th save.
	   Rolando Arrojo (13-12) gave up five runs and 10 hits in six
innings.
 &UR; Tigers 8, White Sox 6
	   In Chicago, Luis Gonzalez hit a two-run triple in a five-run
second inning, stopping Chicago's four-game winning streak.
	   Joe Siddall drove in three runs with a pair of RBI singles and a
run-scoring sacrifice as the Tigers won for only the second time in

Cambodian refugee deaths cause cholera scare among Thai villagers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A cholera scare has erupted among Thai
villagers living near the Cambodian border because of the deaths of
several refugees from Cambodia, local papers reported Thursday.
	   Villagers told the Bangkok Post newspaper that workers from a
charitable foundation which transports bodies to local temples for
burial told them the Cambodians had died of cholera in a provincial
hospital.
	   The temple's Buddhist monks had protested against the burials to
no avail, they said.
	   The villagers said dogs had been digging up the graves,
prompting fears that the disease will spread.
	   According to the villagers in Non Sai Thong in Sisaket province,
430 kilometers (267 miles) northeast of Bangkok, the workers said
hospital officials told them to keep quiet about the cause of
death.
	   Thousands of refugees who fled fighting in Cambodia last year
are still living in camps along the Thai border.

Williams, Sampras advance to semi-finals

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Sampras defeating Kucera; ADDS Williams quotes;
will be UPDATED with Sampras quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC;

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams needed a set to adjust to the
wind and cold before turning on her power game. Pete Sampras needed
no such warmup period, hitting his first serve of the match at 134
mph (214 kph).
	   As spectators huddled beneath blankets, Williams and Sampras
overpowered quarterfinal opponents on a chilly Wednesday night in
the U.S. Open.
	   Undermined by repeated errors in the first set, the fifth-seeded
Williams overwhelmed No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario during the rest
of her 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory to set up a semifinal match against
No. 2 Lindsay Davenport.
	   The top-seeded Sampras had 13 aces in a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory
over No. 9 Karol Kucera, who had eliminated Andre Agassi a day
earlier. Sampras will play defending champion Patrick Rafter in the
semifinals.
	   Once Williams adjusted to the wind and cold, she was able to
play her game. And there are few players in women's tennis who can
handle that kind of power.
	   Sanchez-Vicario certainly wasn't able to Wednesday night.
	   ``In the first set I was missing a lot, I wasn't patient. I
stayed away from my game plan,'' said Williams, a U.S. Open
finalist last year. ``I just had to stop missing. I just had to
make up my mind that I wasn't going to miss anymore.''
	   Williams began the match wearing a bright yellow hooded
sweatshirt, but still seemed bothered by the chilly evening. She
was trailing 3-2 and had already lost her serve twice when she
stripped to a light-blue tank top.
	   Williams seemed to lunge for shots the rest of the set, battling
the swirling wind as much as her opponent.
	   But then she decided to become more careful with her shots, and
began to turn the match around.
	   ``It was windy. I wasn't hitting my big serves. I just had to
spin them in,'' Williams said. ``The errors had to stop or else I
was just going to be heading home. There was just no other
alternative, no other option available.''
	   After 18 unforced errors and three double faults in the first
set, Williams had just 17 unforced errors and two double faults the
rest of the match. And, as she regained control of her shots, she
was able to turn up the power.
	   The game of the match came late in the second set. On the 22nd
point of the game, Williams finally converted her sixth set point
to even the match.
	   Williams broke Sanchez-Vicario's serve in the first game of the
third set, and again in the fifth on a shot the Spaniard thought
was going out and watched as it hit the line. Williams closed out
the match with yet another break, wrapping up the victory with a
backhand down the line.
	   ``She started playing much more aggressive. She started
attacking,'' Sanchez-Vicario said. ``I mean, she's a player that
hits the ball really hard.''
	   The third-seeded Rafter had 44 winners and only 14 unforced
errors in a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 victory over No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman.
	   Rafter was far too quick for Bjorkman, who played in long
sleeves on a chilly afternoon made even colder by a 24 mph (38 kph)
wind. Rafter used his exceptional speed to control the match,
running down Bjorkman's passing shots and darting to the net for
winning volleys.
	   The wind turned service tosses into adventures. On one toss, the
ball was blown so far away from Rafter that he didn't even attempt
to catch it _ instead, letting it bounce and roll toward a ballboy.
	   Rafter said the conditions were no worse than those in Mount
Isa, the Australian town where he grew up playing tennis.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Davenport's power was too much for No. 13 Amanda Coetzer in a
6-0, 6-4 quarterfinal victory.
	   Davenport was consistent, if not spectacular, getting 94 percent
of her first serves in during the first set. She never lost her
serve in the match, despite struggling with the wind.
	   ``It's tough. When you're with the wind, you can't hit the ball
too far or it flies long. On the other side, you have to hit the
ball hard,'' Davenport said. ``You never know what's going to
happen out there in the wind.''
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.
	   ``The wind and the delays probably helped me a little bit. I was
definitely struggling with the way she was hitting the ball,''
Coetzer said. ``Often the wind is a little bit of an equalizer. And
the rain delays gave me a little bit of an opportunity to slow
things down, have a chance to speak to my coach.''
