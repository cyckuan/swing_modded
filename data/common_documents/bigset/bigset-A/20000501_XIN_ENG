<HEADLINE> Liaoning Takes First Win After Car Crashing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Fushan, last year's
runner-up, recovered soon from a car accident which wounded three
of their starters to clinch their first win of the season after
eight rounds competition at the Chinese first division soccer
league on Sunday, holding off Shenzhen Ping'an 2-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
Li Rao's smart pushing shot gave the victory-thirsty Liaoning a
1-0 lead in the vanishing minutes of the first half. But Shenzhen
rallied at 1-all with only seven minutes into the second half as
Wen Guanghui scored in front of the goal mouth.The Liaoning side
had no winning record since the season started in early March and
was suffered a worse setback when their ace defender Qu Leheng is
in the hospital being paralysis, and starting strikers Zhang
Yuning and Wang Gang were badly injured in a car accident last
Wednesday night. The three teammates were siting in the same car
which turned off the road and crashed against a tree after they
had dinner in a restaurant.But striker Li Jinyu would not accept
another evened game as he headed the winning goal in the last
minute before the end of the second half.Jilin Aodong also snapped
a seven-game winless plague by beating visitors Beijing Guo'an 2-1
on Sunday. Sichuan Quanxing joined in the leading pack with a 2-1
over Shenyang Haishi. Defending Champion Shandong Luneng scored 3-
0 whitewash over Tianjin Taida. There are five teams tied with 15
points after eight rounds in the 14-team home-and-away-league.
Shanghai Shenhua, lost 2-1 on Sundaly, saw their five-game winning
streak was snapped by three-time champion Dalian Shide. The two
sides were the only teams to win the pro league title beside
Shandong. In other games play on Sunday, Chongqing Longxin
defeated Qingdao Hainiu 1-0. Sichuan Quanxing beat Shenyang Haishi
2-1 after leading the first half 2-0 and Yunnan Hongta took their
fifth win by downing Xiamen Xiaxin 1-0.

<HEADLINE> Most Nigerians Satisfied With Obasanjo's Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Most of Nigerians are satisfied
with the performance of President Olusegun Obasanjo's government,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, named as "Attitudes Toward Democracy and Markets in
Nigeria", was conducted in Nigeria between January and February by
the U.S.-based International Foundation for Election Systems and
Management Systems International.
</P>
<P>
It showed that nearly 87 percent of Nigerians had high
expectations that their standard of living would improve in a
year, while 71 percent expected the government to fulfill its
promises within four years.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that a very high percentage of
Nigerians rejected non-democratic alternatives and a proposition
that "the army should come in to govern the country", noting that
Nigerians' quest for democracy was unmatched in comparison to
survey results in other countries of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"An overwhelming 80.9 percent think democracy is preferable to
any other form of government", it stated, adding "75.3 percent
believe in freedom of expression, while 79.2 percent reject the
use of violence for political ends".
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of Nigerians expressed satisfaction with
the government's workings of democracy, it added.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's civil government came into power last May after the
long-term military rule of the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jewish Suspect Confesses to Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Hamid Tefilin, one of the 13 Iranian
Jews arrested on espionage charges, confessed on Monday night to
having spied for Israel, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am guilty. I accept the charges against me. I spied for
Israel," Tefilin said in an interview with the television after the
second session of the closed-door trial on the Iranian accused of
spying for Iran's arch foes, the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The report said that four of the 13 Jews appeared at the court
hearing held Monday in Shiraz, the southern Fars province, where
they were arrested along with eight Iranian Muslims in March and
April last year.
</P>
<P>
Tefilin is the main suspect of the group of Jews. Earlier
reports said that four of the suspects had already confessed to
their crimes at the first court hearing.
</P>
<P>
Head of the provincial justice department Ali Amiri assured the
families of the Jewish defendants that they would face a fair and
just trial.
</P>
<P>
He said the trial would be held once a week in Shiraz, the
center of Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the closed-door trial was held on April 13
and was adjourned upon the request of a defense lawyer. The second
hearing was put off until after the Jewish holiday of Passover.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries expressed grave concern over the trial and
demanded release of the Iranian Jews after the U.S. and Israel
denied any links between their intelligence services and the
accused.
</P>
<P>
Tehran, however, rejected any "foreign interference" in the
trial.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Start to Mark Holocaust Memorial Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The public commemoration of
Holocaust Memorial Day began Monday night in the Warsaw Ghetto
Square at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
among other officials and representatives, attended the hour-long
ceremony officially opening Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes
Remembrance Day and spoke on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Yad Vashem Directorate Chairman Avner Shlev kindled the memorial
flame. Some survivors recalled the horrible memories of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
As part of the commemoration observances, from sundown on Monday
till sunrise on Tuesday, businesses and "entertainment halls" are
closed down by law.
</P>
<P>
Sirens will sound throughout the country at 10 a.m. Tuesday
morning, traffic will come to a halt and people will stand for two
minutes in silent tribute to the memory of the Jews that perished
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A series of ceremonies will be held on Tuesday to mark the day.
</P>
<P>
The Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem was established
in 1953 to commemorate the 6 million Jews killed at concentration
camps in Europe during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Jew State has since been holding annual commemoration
ceremonies to remind people not to forget one of the darkest pages
in their history of suffering.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Compensation for U.S.-Led Military Strikes in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday urged the 2000
Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to condemn the acts of
aggression by the United States and Britain in December 1998 and
compensate it for the damage it suffered.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the Review Conference, which
is held here from April 24 to May 19, Iraq's Ambassador to the
United Nations Saeed Hasan said, "In addition to being an
illegitimate use of force against an independent state without the
authorization of the Security Council, the aggression gave a fatal
blow to the IAEA's (International Atomic Energy Agency) monitoring
regime in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Hasan charged that monitoring instruments as well as the sites
themselves had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is in full compliance with all its obligations under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA's safeguards regime," the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan strongly condemned Israel for being the only Middle East
nation not a party to the NPT.
</P>
<P>
"The international community and its organizations have the
legal responsibility to force Israel to join the NPT and place its
nuclear facilities under the IAEA's safeguard regime," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Review Conference to adopt recommendations to
implement fully a Middle East resolution by the 1995 conference so
as to send a clear message to Israel to accede to the treaty
without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The United Sates and Britain launched four-day military
strikes against Iraq in December 1998 under the pretext that Iraq
had not cooperated fully with the U.N. arms inspectors.

situated in the Amazons," said President of the Patriotic Front (

The FP leader said it was possible that American military

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to File WTO Complaints Against Brazil, Five Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced
Monday that it may file World Trade Organization (WTO) complaints
against Brazil and five other nations to gain access to a wide
range of markets, from autos to pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was targeted for two alleged violations, one involving
textile products and the other one covering the administration's
belief the country needs to increase patent protection for U.S.
products.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration said the five other nations targeted
in the annual trade review were Romania, for discriminatory
pricing on clothing, poultry and distilled spirits; India, for
rules regarding autos; the Philippines, for local content
requirements on autos and motorcycles; Argentina, for patent
protections; and Denmark, for the enforcement of its patent and
copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
"These cases underscore our determination to take vigorous
action against foreign government practices that conflict with
international obligations," U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said in a statement announcing the administration's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky stopped short of launching WTO complaints in several
higher profile disputes, including one with the European Union
over subsidies for Airbus Industries.
</P>
<P>
But she said stepped-up enforcement action may be warranted in
the near future against the EU over the Airbus consortium, as well
as Japan over its glass market and public works sector, South
Korea over pharmaceuticals and autos, and Mexico over its import
price scheme.
</P>
<P>
The annual report was certain to enrage major U.S. trading
partners, already up in arms over the Clinton administration's
crackdown on cheap steel imports. Last month, the United States
threatened to file WTO complaints against Mexico and South Africa
for alleged discrimination against U.S. telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
Before filing full-blown complaints against Brazil, the
Philippines and Romania, U.S. officials said they would hold 60
days of consultations at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new enforcement actions, Barshefsky Monday
placed 16 trading partners on the "Priority Watch List," which
could lead to retaliation in future. They are: Argentina, the
Dominican Republic, the EU, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, India,
Israel, Italy, South Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Poland, Russia, Turkey
and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also singled out 39 trading partners for the "Watch
List." For the first time, this list includes Kazakhstan, Latvia
and Lithuania.

QUITO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of workers, teachers,
peasants, Indians, students and other Ecuadorian citizens grouped
in social organizations returned Monday, International Labor Day,
to the streets of the diverse cities of the country in order to
reject dollarization and the increase of prices of basic products.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators want, besides a salary increase, amnesty for
civilians and military personnel who participated in the coup riot
of last January and reject U.S. presence at Manta air base on
Ecuador's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
Protests are being held in Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca, among
other cities.
</P>
<P>
Heads of social and syndicate organizations said the marches
are peaceful, but stressed anything can happen when the people are
dying of hunger.

<HEADLINE> Four U.N. Envoys Initiate GA Special Session on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Four U.N. Envoys Monday
called on the United Nations General Assembly (GA) to convene a
special session next year to address the issue of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was made by Bernd Niehaus of Costa Rica,
Vladimir Galuska of the Czech Republic, Volodymyr Yel'schenko of
Ukraine and Tichaona Joseph Jokonya of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. secretary-general, the envoys
recommended the AIDS issue be added to the agenda of the current
General Assembly to enable it to adopt a resolution calling for a
special session some time in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum, they said HIV had infected 50 million people
since the start of he epidemic, 33.6 million of whom were still
alive.
</P>
<P>
The four envoys said that the situation of HIV-AIDS had over
the past few years been worsening.
</P>
<P>
"Because the epidemic strikes people in their most productive
years, those aged between 15 and 49, HIV/AIDS will have greater
social and economic impact than other diseases in the most
affected areas," they noted.
</P>
<P>
It was high time for the United Nations to elaborate a
comprehensive agenda for action against the epidemic and to
convene a special session of the General Assembly to review the
problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects, and to propose new
strategies to strengthen international cooperation, they added.

<HEADLINE> Solana Says EU Unwilling to Back U.S. Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solana indicated that the best way for the United States to go
ahead was to seek Russia's approval for a new missile defense.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see it done in such a manner that the
relationship is not disturbed in such a way that we have a major
crisis with Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that existing arms control measures have worked well,
Solana said that "it is very difficult to explain to Europeans
there is a risk," but adding "potentially there may be a threat."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is to decide whether the United
States should deploy a national missile defense (NMD) system
against missile threat from "rogue" states. The project was
opposed by Russia and even U.S. allies in Europe like France.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is currently trying to persuade
Russia to agree to amend the Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
signed by Moscow and Washington in 1972, which bans the deployment
of the NMD system.
</P>
<P>
Solana told reporters the Europeans would like to see an
agreement with Moscow as well as a debate on the merits of the
missile defense program before President Clinton goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov reiterated during his
visit to Washington last week that his country continues
opposition to NMD and changes to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
Solana said Russian President Vladimir Putin told him in Moscow
on April 9 that he had not agreed to negotiate changes in the
treaty and did not intend to "in the near future."

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi on Monday called for "redoubled efforts" to ensure a
return to normality in the areas of southern and central
Mozambique hit by catastrophic flooding in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of workers attending a May Day rally in
the capital Maputo, Mocumbi said that the death toll from the
floods stood at around 700, with a further 100 people missing.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 hectares of crops had been lost, and 90 percent
of the country's irrigation equipment had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
On the rescue operations, Mocumbi said that 50,000 people had
been airlifted to safety, and 7,000 tons of emergency cargo had
been flown into areas cut off by the floods.
</P>
<P>
In addition, food and other relief aid had been provided for
500,000 or so displaced people living temporarily in 101
accommodation centers.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi explained that President Joaquim Chissano could not be
present at this year's May Day rally, since he has flown to Europe
where he will address a donors' conference in Rome later this
week, seeking 450 million U. S. dollars for post-flood
reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Pledges Commitment to DRC Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would keep its
commitment to a resolution of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) conflict, President Thabo Mbeki said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa should keep being involved with the DRC problem,
Mbeki said at a meeting with business people in Mabopane, north of
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
A unit of the South African National Defence Force was on
stand-by to join other United Nations troops as part of the
implementation of the peace agreement signed by the parties
concerned, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
If the problem in the DRC was not addressed, it would not go
away, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki returned from Algiers on Monday morning following a
meeting with African leaders on the war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
From the meeting it was clear that part of the reason why the
situation in that country remained, was because certain decisions
had not been carried out, Mbeki said, adding that "all these
things agreed to had not been done."
</P>
<P>
All had agreed that the war in the DRC must end, that the
Congolese people should have their own leaders and that they
should agree about a constitutional government, democratic
constitution and an election date, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decisions taken by the African leaders on Sunday would
result in something being done to end the war, the withdrawal of
all foreign troops from the DRC and the Congolese people deciding
what to do about their country, Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Medical Group Calls for Flu Vaccination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The low rate of vaccine uptake by South Africans was attributed
to the fact that cold weather had not yet struck and that the
influenza season had not properly started, Medinfo spokesman
Stephen Toovey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It was also untrue that the vaccine would prove ineffective if
not taken by the end of April, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is never too late to vaccinate. While it is imperative that
high risk individuals such as diabetics, asthmatics, heart
sufferers, the elderly and the immuno-compromised be immunized,
the vaccine makes good sense for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Research showed that exposure to inactivated influenza viruses
could slow the rate at which the human immunodeficiency virus
replicated in AIDS patients, Toovey said.
</P>
<P>
"Although further research work is awaited on this topic, we do
know that people living with HIV should definitely be protected
against influenza by vaccination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two types of influenza virus A have been detected in South
Africa while another strain, influenza B, is expected to arrive
later in the season.
</P>
<P>
Strains of influenza circulating in the southern hemisphere
this year include Sydney and New Caledonia (both are influenza A
strains), and Yamanashi (an influenza B strain).

A spokesman of the Congress of South African Trade Unions told

<HEADLINE> Wage Increase Welcomed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian public, on general, welcomed
the government's raise of the country's minimum monthly wage from
3,500 naira (35 U.S. dollars) to 7,500 naira (75 dollars) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the increase, which Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo announced at the Tafawa Balewa square in Lagos to mark
the International Labor Day, the president of the Nigerian Guild
of Editors Remi Oyo said the increase would no doubt encourage the
workers to improve their productivity.
</P>
<P>
She said, without a working class that is cared for, the
economy will continue to suffer, stressing we need to get Niagara
back on course.
</P>
<P>
She added: "I also hope that transporters and market men will
not raise fares and prices respectively that might cancel out the
good gesture.''
</P>
<P>
Paul Ejime, resident chief correspondent of the Pan African
News Agency in Lagos, said that the increase was a good beginning
for Nigerian workers who had for long borne "the brunt of
mismanagement that had characterized governance since
independence''.
</P>
<P>
"It is also an astute master stroke for president Obasanjo to
show up at the May Day celebration to, at least, defuse the
tension of fear of 'us and them' that had marked the relationship
between the government and the governed in the past''.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Israel's Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday condemned Israeli government's approval of publishing new
settlement expansion tender in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint conference with visiting Australian Prime
Minister John Howard in the Palestinian self-rule city of Gaza,
Arafat said the tender for settlements expansion was negative and
destructive to the Israeli-Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
It was the first public reaction from Arafat to last Thursday's
decision of Israel's Construction and Housing Ministry to issue a
tender for building 174 new housing units in Ma'aleh Adumim, a
mammoth Jewish settlement near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The news, which emerged only on Sunday's Hebrew newspapers,
angered the Palestinian negotiators in Israel's Red Sea resort of
Eilat, where they were beginning to hold a further round of talks
with their Israeli counterparts to reach a framework agreement on
final-status issues by May.
</P>
<P>
The final-status issues include the return of Palestinian
refugees, the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, borders,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
The settlement expansion crisis reportedly postponed the
beginning of the Eilat talks for more than five hours and
undermined the confidence of the Palestinians in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Arafat, the Palestinian delegation had submitted a
protest letter on the subject, which Israeli negotiators agreed to
review after their return to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat reiterated the Palestinians' rights to declare
an independent state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip this
September. "It needs to be made clear that a Palestinian state is a
natural right of the Palestinian people," he said at the news
conference with Howard.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was in response to remarks by chief Israeli negotiator
Oded Eran earlier in the day that a Palestinian state will be the
outcome of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, Arafat briefed Howard, who arrived
in the region last Saturday on a four-day visit, about progress in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he saw a "very strong personal commitment" by
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whom Howard met in
Jerusalem on Sunday, to seize the peace opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He also promised on Sunday to encourage and support the peace
initiatives of "the principal players" at a diplomatic level.
</P>
<P>
The Australian leader is scheduled to meet with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman and attend Israel's Holocaust Memorial Day
ceremonies at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as honored guest
later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy before
leaving Israel on Tuesday.

for 1.5 million people in Turkey in a decade. It said the share of
personal income spent on tourism will rise to 10.1 percent and
private investment in tourism will reach 13.2 billion dollars by
2010.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Travel Agencies' Association Chairman Basaran Ulusoy

these figures had increased to 9.7 million and 7.1 billion dollars
by 1998.
</P>

international oil companies have reached an agreement on a 25-year
project to study Iranian gas reserves, Director of the British oil
company Lasmo on business for Iran Keyhan Karbasi said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Karbasi said that
identifying gas reserves, estimating the volume of the reserves,
amount of domestic consumption and feasibility of gas exports
constitute the major dimensions of the study.
</P>
<P>
The companies participating in the project include Lasmo,
British Petroleum, Shell, Gaz de France, British Gas, BHP
Australia, Petronas of Malaysia, Agip of Italy and Elf of France,
he said.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari said
on Sunday that his country expects to earn 4.4 billion dollars from
non-oil exports in the current Iranian calendar year, which started
on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Orumieh, the capital of West Azarbaijan province,
Shariatmadari said his ministry has eased the regulations
concerning the export of goods, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He put the figure last Iranian year at 3.22 billion dollars with
a 10.3 percent increase from the previous year. But he added that
the figure only included the exports which were conducted through
deposit of drafts for repatriation of hard currency earned from
exports.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank of Iran Mohsen Nourbakhsh said
earlier this month that the country earned 3.5 billion dollars from
non-oil exports during the past Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> No Candidate Passes Second Round Voting for Turkish Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- None of the presidential candidates
won 367 votes, or a two-third majority in the 550-seat parliament,
to be elected the next Turkish president in the second round of
ballot in the parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the presiding judge of the Constitutional
Court who is the single candidate of the five parties represented
in the legislature, scored the highest number of votes with 314, up
from 281 in the first round last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the ballot that started at 15:05 local time (1205 GMT),
three candidates, Oguz Aygun from Democratic Left Party (DSP), Agah
Guner from the Motherland Party (ANAP) and Ahmet Iyimaya from the
True Path Party (DYP), withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
The other seven contenders, therefore, were competing in this
round of ballot during which a total of 532 deputies cast their
votes with five invalid.
</P>
<P>
The parliament Speaker Yildirim Akbulut was seen rising in this
election, ranking second with 88 votes. Considered the strongest
challenger for Sezer, Akbulut ranked only fourth with 56 votes in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
The other five candidates won votes ranging from 2 to 66, far
behind the two leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
According to the election procedures, if no candidate wins two-
thirds of the votes in the first two rounds, the parliament will
hold the third round of voting on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Sezer and Akbulut will be the two strongest
contenders in this key round during which 276 votes will be
sufficient. The advantage of Sezer increased progressively with the
election going ahead, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut said on Monday that he will persist in the race till the
final moment, adding that neither positioning a consensus candidate
nor imposing pressure on deputies is "democratic," obviously
referring to the unanimous backing Sezer received from leaders of
the legislative parties.
</P>
<P>
Sezer is the joint candidate of the three ruling parties and the
two main oppositions. The five parties' leaders expect to have
Sezer elected by the end of the first three rounds without having
to stage a fourth and final round.
</P>
<P>
In case of failure, two candidates who win the highest votes in
the third round attend the last round. If agreement can not be
reached, the parliament will be dissolved immediatly for new
general elections in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Grand National Assembly (parliament) chooses the president
over a maximum of four rounds of voting that must end before
incumbent President Suleyman Demirel's tenure expires on May 16.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repatriates 7,700 Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran has repatriated 7,700 Afghan
refugees in the past 20 days, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of a tripartite accord reached by Iran, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
ruling Taliban government in Afghanistan, 7,700 Afghan refugees
have been repatriated, said Hassanali Ebrahimi, director general
for foreign nationals at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said 7,400 Afghans were voluntarily repatriated through the
UNHCR while 300 others left Iran on their own. Under the tripartite
accord whose details were not disclosed, about 3,000 Afghan
refugees will be voluntarily repatriated every week through the
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian government will put into practice measures
to prevent the repatriated Afghan refugees from re-entering into
the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged international organizations to allocate "a fair
assistance" to Iran to help cope with the refuge problems, taking
into account the presence of over 2 million foreign refugees in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2 million refugees, nearly 1.5 million are Afghans,
most of whom poured into Iran following the 1979 Islamic
revolution. Iran has always complained about the lack of
international help in hosting the refugees.

<HEADLINE> 6 Injured in Mortar Explosions in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were wounded in a
mortar attack Monday evening near an Iranian military headquarters
in northern Tehran, the state television reported.
</P>
<P>
The television said that a number of mortars hit at least five
spots in a sports complex in the Ararat Street around 20:15 hours
local times (1545 GMT) and one of the injured is in critical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The security forces rushed to the explosion spots, about 500
meters south of the headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) and the security forces.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iran's main military opposition Mujaheddin
Khalq Organization (MKO) has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Monday's attack came several weeks after four people were
wounded on March 13 in mortar attacks launched by the MKO at IRGC
headquarters in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
On February 5, the MKO fired seven mortar shells to an area
close to Iranian government buildings including the presidential
office, killing one person and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has become more active in stage infiltration
and sabotage operations inside Iran, making use of the rift and
intensified power struggle between conservatives loyal to the
Islamic Revolution and reformist allied with President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it smashed a three-member MKO group on Saturday in the
border province of Ilam. Two MKO members and a police officer were
killed after the MKO members exploded their hideout.
</P>
<P>
A famous political-military group which fought against the late
shah's regime in the 1970s, the MKO was outlawed in 1981 and forced
to flee to Iraq after splitting with the ruling clergy, brought to
power by the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Accused as a terrorist group by Tehran, the MKO carried out a
series of cross-border attacks and assassinations of senior Iranian
officials in recent years. In retaliation, Iran air-raided MKO
bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Gore Reaffirms One-China Policy And Support For PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President and Democrat
presidential candidate Al Gore has reaffirmed that the United
States should continue its "one-China" policy and grant China
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR).
</P>
<P>
Gore, in a foreign policy speech delivered to the International
Press Institute in Boston Sunday, also stressed that China and
Russia should not be viewed as enemies but as "vital partners."
</P>
<P>
"During the cold war, we worked to contain these two powers and
limit their reach. Our task in the 21st century is not making them
weak, but instead to encourage forces of reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a policy toward China "that is focused on results,
not rhetoric," Gore emphasize that "it is wrong to isolate and
demonize China, to build a wall when we need to build a bridge."
</P>
<P>
While expressing his concern over tensions that are now
building between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, Gore stressed
the need "to maintain our commitment to the 'one-China' policy."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the two sides across the Taiwan Straits "to
intensify their dialogue and to resolve their problems by peaceful
means."
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply concerned that those in the Congress who are
pushing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act are blind to its
consequences: a sharp deterioration in the security of the region,
" Gore said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Clinton administration "is honoring its
obligation to make defensive weapons available to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been firmly against arms sales to
Taiwan and called on the United States to stop selling all kinds
of weapons to the island, which is part of China, as a way of
reducing tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from labor unions, the underlying buttress
for the Democratic Party, Gore voiced his strongest yet backup for
normalizing trade ties with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support permanent normal trade relations with China,
and I will continue to press the Congress to support it this year.
I support China's membership in the World Trade Organization, to
make China abide by the same rules of international trade that we
follow today," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Democrat presidential hopeful also
characterized his future foreign policy as "forward engagement,"
which means pinpointing major security issues from a new
perspective of "the global age" and trying to solve relevant
problems before they grow into crises.
</P>
<P>
"In the global age, we must be prepared to engage in regional
conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important
to our national security is at stake," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that America cannot be the world's policeman, but it
should reject "the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere,
because we cannot help everywhere."
</P>
<P>
The vice president also said that America has a vital interest
in promoting its own economic prosperity throughout the world. "We
need to promote the stable flow of investment around the world,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Boost Disaster Preparedness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A small but crucial cost item
in the 450 million U.S. dollar appeal for Mozambique this week is
15 million U.S. dollars for measures to reduce the southern
African country's vulnerability to floods, droughts and tropical
cyclones.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Monday, the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) said that a disaster reduction strategy in the
package for presentation to the International Reconstruction
Conference, slated for May 3-4 in Rome, includes the improvement
of meteorological forecast capabilities combined with more
effective monitoring of water levels and currents in the main
rivers.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to create an integrated flood warning system that
includes not only early warning mechanisms but also contingency
disaster plans, improved local communication and education for
populations living in high-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
"Regional cooperation is another crucial element in disaster
prevention and mitigation because several of the major rivers in
Southern Africa flow into Mozambique from neighboring countries,"
said Emmanuel Dierckx de Casterle, UNDP resident representative in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Environmental impact studies will analyze land use in disaster
prone communities. Some 80 percent of the flood-affected families
this year depend on agriculture and fishing for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, water and farmlands have been contaminated by
the floods. Studies will therefore identify new residential areas
for the affected population.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP and the World Food Program have already initiated a
support program for the Mozambican National Institute for Disaster
Management.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's Emergency Response Division (ERD) assists
governments in assessing vulnerability to crises and natural
disasters, and in establishing early-warning systems and
contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
The ERD also helps governments to integrate disaster
preparedness, mitigation and prevention into national development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is highly vulnerable to natural disasters caused by
extreme weather patterns. Floods and droughts hit the country
throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but no disaster in memory was as
destructive and abrupt as the flooding in February and March of
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The reconstruction challenge facing Mozambique in the
aftermath of this year's flooding is the biggest since the end of
the civil war," Casterle said.
</P>
<P>
Although many disaster victims have now returned to their
hometowns, more than half a million people need to be resettled.
The objective is to resettle them in safe areas, provide temporary
shelter and facilitate the building of permanent housing.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Hails Sudan Announcement on Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday voiced his welcome to an April 29 announcement by the
Sudanese Government which declares a humanitarian cease-fire
throughout the African country until July 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said he "
also acknowledges the Government's decision on April 19 to suspend
air bombings in Southern Sudan to protect civilian lives and
facilitate the continuing delivery of humanitarian assistance to
hundreds of thousands of civilians, mostly women and children, by
road, air and river.
</P>
<P>
"He trusts that the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army
(SPLM/A) will also extend the humanitarian cease-fire and thus
contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for
humanitarian operations in the Sudan," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General counts on the continued support of all
parties for the unhindered and safe provision by United Nations
humanitarian agencies and Nongovernmental Organizations of relief
to all those in need of humanitarian aid throughout the country,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
A Sudanese Foreign Ministry statement announced last Saturday
that it had extended a three-month cease-fire in fighting with
rebels in south Sudan for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Emanating from its keenness to realize peace and deliver
humanitarian assistance to those in need, the government announced
a provisional cease-fire for another three months until July 15,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent government cease-fire in a 17-year-long war
with SPLA, which seeks autonomy for the main Christian, animist
south Sudan from the Moslem north, ended on April 15.

<HEADLINE> Ministry: 400,000 Russians Take Part in May Day Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Interior Ministry said
Monday that 412,800 people took part in various May Day events in
84 of the 89 regions across the country, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 police and 4,376 Interior Ministry troops had been
on duty nationwide, but there were no reports of any violence, the
ministry press center said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mikhail Shmakov, leader of the Independent Trade
Unions Federation, claimed that 2.5 million people took part in
rallies and processions organized by trade unions, which were
mainly raising economic rather than political demands.
</P>
<P>
The unions called for a new labor code that "would be agreed
with the trade unions and not the one that has been submitted by
the government," Shmakov said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, thousands of people, braving a sudden drop of
temperature, attended marches staged by leftist organizations and
trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Police, Protester Clash at London May Day Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Masked demonstrators at an anti-
capitalist protest in London Monday attacked a city fast food
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
At least nine policemen were hurt, including one was hit by a
flying brick and two others injured as a crowd smashed every
window in the McDonald's burger bar in Whitehall.
</P>
<P>
A neighboring souvenir shop also came under attack. So far, 28
people have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Riot police have sealed off Parliament Square where thousands
of protesters had gathered to "reclaim urban spaces" by planting
seeds.
</P>
<P>
The day -- the end of four days of protest in the capital --
had started peacefully with an almost carnival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
There was a massive police presence around Whitehall but little
sign of trouble early in the day.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators dug up clumps of turf and planted seeds as part
of their guerrilla gardening campaign -- to return parts of urban
London to nature.
</P>
<P>
Protesters climbed trees and beat drums, spilling on to the
roads and forcing police to close the square where a statue of
Winston Churchill was defaced with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters had dressed in colorful costumes. But a
smaller, more sinister number were wearing balaclava helmets and
masks.
</P>
<P>
Holiday leave for the capital's police officers was canceled to
avoid a repeat of last year's demonstration in the city's
financial center.
</P>
<P>
That protest by about 10,000 people started peacefully but
descended into chaos and injuries for both officers and
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were also arrested at a similar anti-capitalist
rally in Manchester.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Calls for Peaceful Settlement of Zimbabwean Land Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said on Monday that the land crisis in Zimbabwe could only
be brought to an end by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
If the land question in Zimbabwe was not addressed in a
peaceful, systematic way involving all Zimbabweans, the problem
would not go away, Mbeki said at a meeting with business people in
Mabopane, north of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said he doubted whether condemning his Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe would solve that country's land
redistribution problem.
</P>
<P>
Condemning Mugabe would not solve a problem in Zimbabwe caused
by colonization, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his meeting with Mugabe and other presidents of the
region in Zimbabwean resort of Victoria Falls on April 21 focused
on how to address the problem in Zimbabwe to the benefit of black
and white Zimbabweans instead of seeking solidarity with Mugabe,
as press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said they had agreed that there should be an end to the
violence in Zimbabwe and that a way should be found to ensure that
land occupation by the war veterans should be brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
They had also agreed that the implementation of an agreement
between Zimbabwe and donors including Britain, the World Bank and
the European Union on how to handle the land redistribution should
be ensured, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens in Zimbabwe, we must ensure that the process
takes into account countries in the rest of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain said it would not honor its promise to fund Zimbabwe's
resettlement program until the Zimbabwean government ordered the
veterans of independence war to withdraw from white-owned
commercial farms they had been occupying since February.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Leader Urges Removal of Investment Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on
Monday called for removal of obstacles to investment to create
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on the International Labor Day, Museveni
said that 81,000 jobs have been created by new enterprises since
1991, but "these changes have not been fast enough to keep pace
with the increasing demands for employment".
</P>
<P>
Museveni said "the obstacles to investments in the country
include bureaucratic delays, high bank interest rates, unfair or
delayed court decisions on disputes and a strong imports lobby in
government departments."
</P>
<P>
He said the government and the whole system in the country are
not investor-friendly, but either hostile, indifferent or
inconsiderate to investors.
</P>
<P>
The president called on all Ugandans to understand and
appreciate the connection between investment, economic growth and
employment creation.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also stressed the importance of regional integration
to create a large market, saying, "the integration will make the
region a more attractive investment destination."

<HEADLINE> S. African Business Leaders to Help Solve Zimbabwe Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of South African
business leaders left for Zimbabwe on Monday to seek solutions to
the land crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three-day mission, led by the South African Chamber of
Commerce (SACOB), will include meetings with Zimbabwean government
officials and will appeal for the rule of law, according to South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"As businessmen committed to Africa, we will be trying,
hopefully together with Zimbabwean business, to make some form of
proposals to the government in Zimbabwe as to what potential
solutions could be," SACOB president Kevin Wakeford was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wakeford said the delegation would also convey a very clear
message on the issues of the rule of law and property rights,
which are non-negotiable principles.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that there is a land reform need, but it should not
threaten the property rights," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean war veterans have invaded more than 1,000
white-owned farms in the country, resulting in violence which has
claimed the lives of two white farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to the SACOB, whose mission to Zimbabwe is backed by
the South African government, the Zimbabwean economic crisis and
political tensions are increasingly damaging confidence in the
South African economy.
</P>
<P>
"In South Africa, the rand is badly hurt, the bond market is
hurt, the business mood is dampened," Wakeford said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan will extend emergency food
aid worth 4.8 million U.S. dollars through the United Nations
World Food Program (WFP) to assist drought-hit people in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The government of Japan decided to make the donation in
recognition that without prompt international assistance, a large
scale famine may follow, the Japanese Embassy in Ethiopia said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the shortage of rainfall in the past three years, the
impact of drought has been spreading in the Horn of Africa with
over 8 million people affected in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Japan's donation, the United States, France, Britain,
Spain, Israel and China, among others, have either donated relief
food or money to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> China's Chief Delegate Stresses Multipolarity at IPU Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tomur Dawamat, head of the Chinese
delegation to the the 103rd conference of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) in Amman, stressed on Monday that multipolarity must be
established as new international political and economic orders are
taking shape in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech during the first day of general debate,
Tomur Dawamat said the world has been moving toward multipolarity
after the end of the Cold War, and it is the common aspiration of
all peoples in the world to safeguard peace, seek stability and
promote development.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat said the establishment of a fair and equitable new
international order should cater to the need of world peace and
development, and must be based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, the U.N. Charter, and other universally recognized
norms governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
The road to multipolarity is long and torturous, but the general
trend is irreversible as multipolarity serves world peace and
stability better than unipolarity, said Tomur Dawamat, who is also
vice chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is unimaginable that a world with nearly 200
countries and 6 billion people should be dominated by a single
country or a small group of countries, nor is it possible to ask
all countries to follow the same social system or economic model.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China, a staunch force for regional and world
peace and stability, commits itself to the common development of
all countries, and China adheres to a peaceful and independent
foreign policy and firmly stands against military alliances and
blocs, arms race and military expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a detente in general in international
relations since the end of the Cold War, but the world is far from
tranquil as there is also a growing trend towards forming military
alliances, arms race, the use of force or threat of using force.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts triggered by ethnic, religious and territorial
problems crop up from time to time, he added.
</P>
<P>
China believes that disputes between states should be solved by
just and rational resolutions through peaceful negotiations and
consultations on an equal footing instead of resorting to force or
threatening to use force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so, he said, can world peace and stability be
maintained and common development and prosperity of all countries
be facilitated.
</P>
<P>
He briefed participants on the achievements of China and the
determination of the Chinese people and government to safeguard
national unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said the ultimate realization of reunification of China is
the common aspiration and strong determination of the Chinese
people, including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He said China will stick to the guideline of "peaceful
reunification, One country, Two systems" on the Taiwan issue,
adding that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China's territory, and "Taiwan independence" in
whatever form is absolutely impermissible,
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat arrived in Amman on Saturday evening to attend the
103th IPU conference, which is attended by 138 delegations and some
1,400 parliamentarians and representatives of international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
IPU, founded in 1889 and now with 144 members, is the largest
international legislative organization, and its biannual sessions
serve as an important forum to exchange views on global affairs
among parliamentarians from different countries and territories.

and was convinced there was no need to alter or replace Security
Council Resolution 1244, which created a U.N. mission in Kosovo,
but implementation must be improved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) was seriously short of administrators -- less than half
the full level by some estimates -- and police and that much more
effort was needed to free prisoners and account for missing people.
</P>
<P>
"We found a serious constraint with regard to staffing, both
civilian police and administration. I believe we have to address
this point when we are back in New York," he said.

Bangladesh was elected by the General Assembly last year to
join the Security Council this year as one of 10 non-permanent

He said that refugee returns had to be another priority,
together with the missing and detainees, if ethnic reconciliation
was to be achieved and democracy established in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
"While we encourage returns, we have to be able to receive
them properly," he said. "The question of security, accommodation
and livelihood are issues that must be addressed at the same time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Spending by the U.S. government
and the private sector on construction projects rose by 1.4
percent in March, the third straight monthly increase this year,
the Commerce Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The construction spending, which was driven by a burst of
activity in big government projects, increased to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 765.2 billion U.S. dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
In January, construction spending rose nearly 2 percent and in
February it went up by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under control.
Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many economists
believe the Fed will raise interest rates on May 16 and again in
June.
</P>
<P>
Even with an upswing in interest rates, robust construction and
housing activity helped fuel the economy's strong growth last year.
Monday's report suggested that higher interest rates still haven't
significantly dampened activity in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Spending on big government projects posted the biggest gain in
March, rising 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
178.4 billion dollars. Increased spending on highways and streets,
schools and housing more than offset decreased spending on
hospitals, industrial buildings and military facilities.
</P>
<P>
The construction report showed that spending on all
nonresidential, or commercial building, grew 1.4 percent to a rate
of 201.2 billion dollars. Spending on industrial buildings,
offices and hotels and motels all rose.
</P>
<P>
Spending on all residential projects also went up 1.4 percent
to a rate of 344.1 billion dollars as spending on single-family
homes declined, while spending on apartment buildings and condos
rose.
</P>
<P>
All private construction projects, which includes residential
and commercial activity, saw spending grow by 0.9 percent in March
to a rate of 568.8 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Winner Named Honorary Chinese Villager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Nobel Prize winner and
environmental expert Jose Lutzenberger on Sunday became an "
honorary villager" of Fanggan Village, a tiny spot at the foot of
Taishan Mountain in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of the village, Lutzenberger praised on the
villagers' achievements in the realm of environmental protection,
saying that their awareness of the issue will help to beautify the
village.
</P>
<P>
Fanggan, dubbed a "paradise on earth," is well-known for its 20-
year efforts in turning barren and balding mountains into
breathtaking landscape.
</P>
<P>
To date, the village's 3,500 mu (233 hectares) of land is
covered with over three million trees and dotted with eight
reservoirs, attracting some 200 species of birds.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the village joined the competition for the title of
"top 500 global environmental protection projects" sponsored by
the United Nations Environment Program.
</P>
<P>
Lutzenberger is the founder of Brazil's environmental
protection movement and Brazil's former minister of environment.
He was awarded a Nobel special prize for his outstanding
contribution to rainforest preservation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has highlighted the importance of
environmental protection. A major clean-up project focusing on the
Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers, and the Taihu, Dianchi and Chaohu
lakes, is underway and so far has been successful.
</P>
<P>
Measures also have been taken to reduce pollution along the
middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Manila Forms Group to Deal With Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said Monday
that it has formed a task force to ensure unified and coordinated
efforts in securing the safe release of 21 people kidnapped on
April 23 from an island in Malaysia and now being held hostage in
Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Presidential National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said
Cabinet Cluster E, which handles political affairs and national
security concerns, has designated Secretary Orlando Mercado of the
Department of National Defense as the task force's overall head.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre told reporters in the Presidential Palace that the
group will closely coordinate with the negotiating team headed by
Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Mercado on his part said Misuari remains the "captain ball" of
efforts to ensure the hostages' safe release from the Abu Sayyaf
group.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating group under Mercado will include a public
information team to provide reports on the Sulu kidnapping
situation to the public, Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
A special security task force, Aguirre said, will also be on
standby to "undertake any kind of security operations in support
of the negotiations" being conducted by Misuari.
</P>
<P>
The hostages held by the armed group in Sulu Province in the
southern Philippines include several foreigners and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado said the military continues to scour Basilan
Province for signs of 27 other civilians taken hostage by the
extremist group Abu Sayyaf on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The safety and welfare of the hostages remain the government's
paramount concern and that is why the Armed Forces of the
Philippines(AFP) have been proceeding with caution in conducting
their rescue operations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the military gained control of the Abu Sayyaf camp
in Hill 898, Sumisip town, at noon Monday as part of the rescue
operations for the hostages, which started on April 22.
</P>
<P>
"The AFP continue to scour the camp carefully and during rescue
operations," Mercado said, adding that the AFP had 10 troops
killed in action and 56 wounded because of shrapnel wounds from
booby traps and landmines.
</P>
<P>
Recovered from the Abu Sayyaf lair, Mercado said, were several
firearms, ammunition, and 100 sacks of rice.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Vows to Effect Democratic Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Myanmar military
government said it is firmly resolved to effect a democratic
transition, but it pointed out, however, that undue foreign
interference will only stifle both political and socioeconomic
development of the country, thus unnecessarily delaying further
political change.
</P>
<P>
An official Information Sheet Monday quoted a recent news
release of the Myanmar Embassy in London as saying the democratic
transition can only be effected by a government capable of not
only achieving peace with all its nationalities but also defending
the sovereignty and integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed drastically since 1947 and a repeat of that
history of significant foreign interference is simply no longer
possible," it stated.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Kayin National Union (KNU), the largest anti-
government ethnic armed group that is still operating on the
Myanmar-Thai border and has not made peace yet with the government,
the Information Sheet said the government has continuously offered
the group terms of peace similar to those already achieved with 17
other decades-old armed groups in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet accused the KNU of having chosen to fight
the first constitutionally elected government half a century ago,
saying the group's military campaign has been on a downhill course
over the years.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Conference on Somalia Overshadowed by Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 Somali representatives
from various clans and political groups Monday left for Djibouti
to attend a peace conference to be opened on Tuesday despite that
the fighting in North Mogadishu could worsen to a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
While many Somalis are excited about the opening of the
conference in Djibouti, many others have been fleeing their houses
in fear of the fighting between rival sides within the Eli-Omar
and Rer-Matan subclans of the Abgal community in Karan district of
North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which changed from its random retaliatory attacks
against each other to a real and serious armed confrontation on
Sunday, has already caused havoc in the business and ordinary life
in Karan and Yaqshid districts.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting intensified in the early hours of Monday, the
rival militiamen of Eli-Omar and Rer-Matan clans started using
mortar shells and the anti-tank guns of B-10 against each other's
positions in order to dislodge the rival side.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this stage;
however, stray rounds of B-10 guns have claimed the lives of more
than five people including a woman and a four-year old girl.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdullahi Yussuf Elvis, Deputy Director of the
International Committee of the Red Cross - run Kaysaney Hospital,
22 victims of the war have reached their hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were hit by bullets while the rest suffered
shrapnel wounds from B-10 and rocket-propelled grenades, Elvis
said, adding that none of the war patients has so far died of
their wounds although the wounded are still flowing into the
hospital wards.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Al-Hayat private hospital in South Mogadishu
has registered the death of one young lady while treating several
others, but only one man now remains in the hospital for further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to local FM radio station of Mogadishu, Horn-Afrique
has also reported the death of eight people in Sunday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
As the damage of fighting increased dramatically on Monday,
well-known traditional leaders such as Sheikh Ali Dhereh and Haji
Ali Daud tried to make a cease-fire by organizing a demonstration
attended by hundreds of children and women.
</P>
<P>
The children and women took to the streets where the rival
militiamen had been in defensive positions, forcing them to stop
the shooting. "No more civil war, no more bloodshed" were among
the words used to ease the tension of the combat militiamen.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that a cease-fire is brokered between
the two sides. But a lasting solution seems to be beyond the reach
of the elders in Mogadishu since the conflict roots back to
problems in the countryside where the two sides quarrel over the
ownership of lands.

YICHANG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A dozen new scenic spots in the

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Workers in Bangladesh to Get Jobs After Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Monday said workers of state-run factories who went on
voluntary retirement or lost jobs in the privatization process
would be re-employed after being trained under a government scheme.
</P>
<P>
"We have undertaken initiatives for the re-employment of these
workers in new units after imparting training," the prime minister
told an International Labor Day discussion attended by government
officials and workers' representatives.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to set up new units in the premises
of the privatized factories, to ensure maximum utilization of
industrial plots and reduce pressure on agricultural lands,she
added.
</P>
<P>
Hasina further said the government has set up 29 workers'
welfare centers including seven new ones for tea garden workers
and four industrial institutions across the country to oversee the
workers' welfare and increase their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
So far 1,200 government officials, owners and workers have
undergone training in these institutions and 1,800 workers have
been provided with skill development training at the welfare
centers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the private sector units, Hasina said that in many
cases, the workers have been subjected to exploitation and at
times the private owners even misappropriate the provident fund of
the employees, causing labor unrest and other problems.
</P>
<P>
She said the government is planning to enact a new law to
prevent misappropriation of provident fund money of the factory
workers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said her government has already approved the
National Wage Commission recommendations for increased wages,
adding that she has asked the concerned authorities to implement
the new wage structure as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Calls Banking System Solid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured the
public Monday that the country's banking system remains one of the
most solid in Asia, with the closure of Urban Bank strictly being
an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
This assurance was made by Director General Felipe Medalla of
the National Economic and Development Authority, Secretary Jose
Pardo of the Department of Finance and Governor Rafael
Buenaventura of the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The three officials told reporters in the Presidential Palace
that the central bank and the Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) are ready to address all cash requirements of
private banks through the establishment of a "liquidity pool."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered the managers last
Friday to ensure the stability of the banking system following
Urban Bank's closure and the subsequent heavy withdrawals
experienced by two other commercial banks, the International
Exchange Bank (I-Bank) and the Philippine Bank of Communications (
PBCom).
</P>
<P>
The capability of the central bank and the BAP to set up a
liquidity pool to meet all cash requirements, Buenaventura said,
attests to the stability and solidity of the country's banking
system.
</P>
<P>
Under this setup, banks line up their securities and other
assets so that they can readily be converted into cash through the
liquidity pool when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also pointed out that the cases of I-Bank and
PBCom,which remain solvent, are entirely different from Urban Bank,
which declared a bank holiday last Thursday since it could not
immediately meet its heavy withdrawal demands.
</P>
<P>
I-Bank and PBCom, according to Buenaventura, were victims of
false rumors concerning their financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Medalla stressed that the country's banking system
"is solid and their assets are more than enough to pay for all the
liabilities."
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Pardo assured I-Bank and PBCom clients that
checks issued by these banks are being honored.
</P>
<P>
"If you should run into problems like this, please refer it to
the BAP, the central bank or even the finance department and we'll
be pleased to help you," Pardo said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Makes Efforts to Transform Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has been making efforts
to transform its workforce so as to prepare for new competition
and tap new opportunities in the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
"The School of Lifelong Learning is our strategy to help
workers achieve higher skills and lifelong employability,"
Singapore Minister for Manpower Lee Boon Yang said on the
transformation of his country's 1.9 million-strong workforce while
delivering a speech at the May Day rally held Monday by the
National Trades Union of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The School of Lifelong Learning is Singapore's key national
initiative and system aimed at enabling individuals to access
quality education and training on an ongoing basis and at
encouraging enterprises to invest in human capital development.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Manpower and its partners from the public,
private and people sectors recently launched the Singapore
Learning campaign to foster the practice of lifelong learning for
lifelong employability and the campaign will culminate in a
Singapore Learning Festival in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged workers and employers to put the lifelong learning on
top of their agenda and priority and make lifelong learning their
new mind-set and their way of life so as to derive maximum
benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The need for individuals and businesses to upgrade and change
is becoming more urgent. We must re-invent ourselves and make
great efforts to initiate and implement innovative solutions to
meet the challenges of the New Economy," the minister emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Lee said workers in the brick and mortar companies, especially
the small and medium-sized enterprises, must also upgrade their
skills and capabilities to help their companies innovate and grow
in the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
BERI, a world rating institute, has since 1980 rated Singapore'
s workforce as the world's Number One, taking into account its
legal framework, relative productivity, worker attitude and
technical skills.
</P>
<P>
However, it lags behind Japan and Switzerland in the sub-index
on worker attitude and in terms of technical skills, its ranking
is the eighth, after Japan, Switzerland, the United States, the
Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Denmark.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The 49th Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA) Annual Conference, which is participated by
some 1,300 delegates from 46 countries and regions, opened here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "The Future is Now," the PATA conference is
considered the premier meeting-place for travel and tourism
leaders. Delegates are expected to discuss such topics as
technology, environment and partnership between the public and
private in the tourism industry in the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said the
conference theme was especially appropriate, with the delegates
demonstrating determination and willingness to accept
responsibility regarding the development and shaping of global
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"The significance of tourism to economies around the world is
enormous," said Tung. "And there is every indication that travel
and tourism will play an increasingly important role in economic
development in the new century."
</P>
<P>
In the case of Hong Kong, the tourism industry contributes
between 4 to 5 percent of the GDP, and more than 10.5 million
visitors to Hong Kong last year helped boost receipts from the
tourism industry to some 53 billion HK dollars (6.8 billion U.S.
dollars), he noted.
</P>
<P>
J. Daniel Burruss, chairman of the PATA, said business
opportunities and solutions that people wouldn't have dreamed of
even a year ago emerge nearly every day at present.
</P>
<P>
"Our industry keeps racing ahead so quickly," said Burruss. "
New technology, e-commerce, space travel -- all of these are
taking shape around us."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that participants will gain new ideas and
new friendship that propel the tourism business far into the
future.
</P>
<P>

Pacific Asia travel and tourism. Its members include nearly 100
government, state and city tourism bodies, and more than 200

<HEADLINE> HK Vows to Become Asia's Green Model for Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said on Monday that
the government is aimed at making Hong Kong a green model for
environmental improvement and a model of economic and social
freedom as well.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps central to all our efforts to develop Hong Kong are
programs to improve our environment," Tung said at the opening
ceremony of the 49th Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Annual
Conference, which is being held here from May 1 to 3.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of utmost importance. Without clean air and
clean water we cannot fully achieve our goal of being a world city,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
In his third policy address last October, Tung set some
ambitious targets for reducing air pollution by 2005, when Hong
Kong's air quality will compare favorably with that of other major
cities such as New York and London.
</P>
<P>
"We are making massive investments in water pollution control --
to help make the waterfront and harbor a central part of our
leisure and recreational attractions -- not just a fine view from
a ferry or the Peak," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And we aim to make Hong Kong even greener. Already 40 percent
of Hong Kong is designated as country parks and we want to develop
linkages between our urban parks and country landscapes to ensure
that a strong and vibrant natural heritage enhances the vigor of
our city life," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 delegates from 46 countries and regions are
attending the conference, with most of them representing
government tourism bodies, airlines and travel industry firms.

<HEADLINE> Barak Again Holds up Plan to Transfer Arab Villages: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is unlikely to submit his plan of handing over three villages on
the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Palestinians for cabinet approval
this week.
</P>
<P>
The plan, in which Abu Dis, Azariya, and Swahara would be handed
over to full Palestinian control in the next few weeks as a
confidence building measure for the two sides to reach a final-
status framework agreement, was originally expected to be discussed
in Wednesday's cabinet meeting, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon, one of
Barak's closest confidants, confirmed in a interview with Israeli
Army Radio on Sunday the government plan to transfer these
Jerusalem neighborhoods, which currently under Israeli security and
Palestinian civilian control.
</P>
<P>
Ramon's remarks drew immediate fierce verbal attacks from
Israel's rightist parties, with two of Barak's ruling coalition
partners, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party, even
threatening to quit the government or to support no-confidence
motions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time since the beginning of this year that
Barak or his confidants suggested the handover, only to withdraw
the plan later due to pressure from the right-wing politicians.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio on Monday cited the failed meeting between Barak
and the ultraorthodox religious Shas party mentor Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef late Sunday night as the main reason for the last-minute
attitude change this time.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was made possible after Barak caved in to Shas'
financial demands on its ailing education network, which is
desperately in need for cash to survive.
</P>
<P>
Barak hoped his gesture to transfer some 10 million shekels
(about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in advance to save the school
system would ensure the Shas spiritual leader's support for the
handover of the Arab villages and other issues on the Israeli-
Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
An endorsement of Yosef, who has dominant policy-making power in
the Shas party, would guarantee the support of the four Shas
ministers in the cabinet and its pivotal 17 members in the 120-seat
Knesset (Parliament) for future government peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's strategy appeared unsuccessful again. Akiva
Eldar, a columnist for Israel's Ha'aretz daily, wrote in Monday's
edition that Yosef is not about to "give up his guns" so easily at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
"If he agrees in advance to support the peace agreements, what
pistol will have to aim at Barak the next time the coffers of his
institutions empty out?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
As the effort to ensure Shas' support failed, Barak had no other
choices but to withdraw his plan in order not to anger Yisrael
Ba'aliya and National Religious Party pointlessly.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly wanted to use these villages as part of "
advance payments" to the Palestinians before the further withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is due to happen by June.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation teams from both sides have been holding talks in
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat since Sunday, discussing the final
redeployment and all other interim and final-status issues.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua)-- Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat
Aziz Monday said the overriding objective of the country's reform
agenda is to revitalize the economy for macro-economic
stabilization and poverty reduction on sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day National Workshop on Poverty Reduction
Strategy here, Shaukat stated, "we want to maximize exportable
surpluses, make our exports internationally competitive and
thereby generate substantial employment opportunities and this we
believe is the only viable and sustainable strategy for macro-
economic stabilization that will lead to alleviating the level of
poverty."
</P>
<P>
Shaukat said that Poverty reduction strategy recognized that
the development of the country was synonymous with the development
of the people.
</P>
<P>
In poverty reduction strategy, sustained growth is critical to
mobilizing the resources. And without growth, "we would embark
upon a road that leads to the redistribution of poverty," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Export, Import Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The value of Indonesia's export in
March increased by 3.67 percent to 4.94 billion U.S.dollars from
the previous month when it stood at 4.765 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import value also significantly rose to 2.245
billion dollars or 6.22 percent higher than the 2.114 billion
dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"Export value in March which almost touched 5 billion U.S.
dollars is the biggest in recent years. The rise was backed by an
increase in oil and gas export and non-oil and gas export as well,
" Chairman of the National Bureau of Statistics Sugito Suwito told
reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"For the first three months of the year 2000, total export
value reached 14.099 billion U.S. dollars or increased by 38.7
percent compared with the same period last year when it was only
10.165 billion U.S. dollars. The export growth in the course of
the first three months of the year 2000 is 3.8 percent higher than
the last three months of 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suwito said, for the first three months of the
current year, import value also went up by 17.49 percent to 6.529
billion dollars compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of the import value is supported by a rise of
import of oil and gas commodities which reached 565.1 million U.S.
dollars or 80.93 percent higher than the same period last year.
Meanwhile import of non-oil and gas commodities also increased by
8.37 percent or reached 406.8 million U.S. dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase in imports was dominated by capital goods
instead of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sign of our (economic) recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suwito further said that if the political situation in the
country had been stable, the value of export and import would have
been much higher.

MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Eight members of the former rebel

arrested in the town of Milange in central Mozambique for inciting

<HEADLINE> Feathered Dinosaurs on Show in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Eight pieces of rare feathered
dinosaur fossils, the Class I national treasures of China, will be
on display at Hong Kong Science Museum from May 2 to June 11,
revealing the evolutionary relationship between dinosaurs and
birds.
</P>
<P>
Being shown for the first time in Asia, all the eight pieces
genuine fossils are the types of feathered dinosaurs found in
China's Liaoning Province and of more than 100 million years old.
</P>
<P>
The pieces to be shown are Sinosauropteryx, the first feathered
dinosaur found in the world; Liaoxiornis, the smallest prehistoric
bird ever known; Caudipteryx, the first dinosaur that possessed
primitive feathers; Confuciusornis, the first bird that possessed
a beak; and Huaxiasaurus, Dromaeosaurus, Protarchaeopteryx and
Changchengornis.
</P>
<P>
There has been a controversy for 130 years as to whether birds
originated from dinosaurs since T. Huxley, a British scholar
proposed in 1870 that blood relationship existed between birds and
theropod dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
These exquisitely preserved fossils of dinosaurs reveal
different stages in the evolution of the shoulders and forelimbs
of theropod dinosaurs and provide crucial evidence for how
grasping arms were transformed into flying wings.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sure to Retaliate If Attacked: U.S. DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense, William
Cohen warned that Israel will not stand still if attacked by its
neighbors, and "this may lead to a serious confrontation in
Lebanon and other countries."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arab daily "Alhayat", published
Monday, Cohen said he believes that the "Syrians are fully aware
that the Israelis will respond to any attacks against them."
</P>
<P>
Cohen quoted the Israeli prime minister, whom he has recently
met with, as saying the "opportunity window between Damascus and
Tel
Aviv is very narrow, and is about to be closed, although it is
still
open."
</P>
<P>
He added that he "was not optimistic about the possible
resumption of talks between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the situation in Iraq, Cohen stressed on the
necessity of the continued sanctions on Iraq, saying that "since
they proved to
be positive and fruitful, Saddam Hussein (Iraqi President) is no
longer
a real threat to his neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He said the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq depends on
its full compliance with the U.N. resolutions, opening the doors
for
the international inspectors, and releasing the prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. minister advised the Gulf states to acquire the "
potentials of the early warning systems and it is up to them to
take a decision in this respect."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it is the right of every Gulf state to "
choose what is suitable for its needs in the context of the kind of
its relations "with Iran and Iraq," affirming that "every country
will adopt a track that serves its interests and security needs."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Gulf states hope for better
relations with Tehran, provided it stops seeking the acquisition
of the potentials threatening these countries."
</P>
<P>
Cohen termed as "positive development" the Iranian moves to
stop the trafficking of the Iraqi oil, expressing his country's
wish to have better ties with Iran, urging Tehran to give up its
efforts aimed at hindering the Middle East peace process, refrain
from backing terrorism and attempting to possess weapons of mass
destruction."

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Meet With Arafat in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard is scheduled to travel to Gaza on Monday to hold talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat mainly on Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, Israeli foreign ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who arrived here last Saturday on a four-day visit, met
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday, who briefed him on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Australian foreign minister said he sees special
opportunities for peace at this time.
</P>
<P>
"Australia can, at a diplomatic level, encourage and support the
initiatives of the principal players", he said, adding that this is
what he intends to do during his talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the Palestinians must have territorial congruity
in order to separate them with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to criticism that his intended transfer
of three villages east of Jerusalem to the Palestinian control
might weaken Israel's control of united Jerusalem as its capital,
Barak said one should not confuse the villages Azariya and Abu-Dis
as being part of Jerusalem towards which all Jews pray.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office revealed on Sunday that the government planned to
hand over Abu Dis, Azariya and Swahara to full Palestinian control
in the next few weeks, as a good-will gesture to the Palestinians
in advance of the final Israeli troops withdrawal from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which is due to take place by June.
</P>
<P>
The move, however, has sparked severe criticism from the
rightists.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that no one is talking about transferring to the
Palestinians any territory that they do not already control, but
the transfer of 3 percent of the 39.2 percent already under
Palestinian rule from area B to area A. The good-will gesture,
however, has been turned down by the Palestinian side on fears that
the gesture would sacrifice a larger territorial compromise in the
final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Howard received an honorary doctorate from
Bar-Ilan University in recognition of his friendship toward the
Jewish people. He also held talks with other Israeli officials
during the visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reaffirmed
Monday its commitment to pursuing the peace process with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) amid reports that the group has
indefinitely suspended formal peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
at the same time reminded the MILF that the government has a sworn
duty to ensure public safety, and thus, will not tolerate any
criminal or terrorist act by some of wayward MILF members.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the peace talks. But we will not allow some MILF
members to continue with their illegal acts and recruitment of new
members while the peace process is ongoing," Mercado said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The MILF pulled out from the scheduled resumption of peace
talks on May 16 after the fighting broke out last week in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Government troops are locked in battle for the third day on
Monday against 1,000 MILF rebels occupying a vital highway in
Matanog, Maguindanao province in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Mercado accused the MILF of starting the fighting, saying the
military had to act because of the MILF's occupation of the
strategic highway linking several provinces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF signed a ceasefire agreement in
1997 as prelude to the opening of formal peace talks to find a
lasting solution to the Mindanao conflict.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has set a deadline to sign
a peace agreement with the MILF by June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF has asked the president to reconsider his
decision, saying there should be no imposition of deadline to find
a lasting solution to the long-drawn Mindanao problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- As a further step of investigation
into an alleged human rights abuse in East Timor, four Indonesian
Military (TNI) and police officer were questioned on Monday by
prosecutors of the Attorney General's Office (AGO).
</P>
<P>
They are Brig. Gen. (police) Timbul Silaen, former East Timor
police chief; Maj. Gen. Adam Damiri, former Udayana Military
Commander overseeing East Timor; Brig. Gen. Tono Suratman and Col.
Noer Muis, the last two chiefs of the Wiradharma District Military
Command in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The fours were questioned at the AGO as witnesses in the case
of a human rights abuse in the breakaway province of East Timor in
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The four officers are grilled over their possible involvement
in human rights abuse in East Timor. But they are questioned as
witnesses. I don't know who is the suspect in this case, or who
will be the suspect," said Mohammad Assegaf, a lawyer who
accompanying the officers in the course of the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement of Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman that the trial will begin by mid-May or late May, Assegaf
said, adding that such a trial will still face trouble as the
country has yet had a human rights bill.
</P>
<P>
In late January, the National Commission on Human Rights (
Komnas HAM) recommended as many as 33 people, including former TNI
chief Gen. Wiranto, were allegedly involved in what it said as a
crime against humanity in East Timor and urged the AGO to make
further probe.

<HEADLINE> Israel Keeps Bombing Syrian Airfield Mock-ups in Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel Air Force (IAF) has been
bombing life-size mock-ups of Syrian airports in training in the
past few years, an IAF official publication revealed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two airfield models were constructed at an IAF training
ground deep in the Negev Desert in south Israel, with true-to-life
runaways, approach routes, useless A-4 Skyhawks fighter jets as
targets, and underground hangars, according to Israel's Air Force
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which hit the newsstands on Monday, also leaked
that all the airport infrastructures were copied from the spy
satellite photos in order to create a life-like battle atmosphere
and better simulate the difficulty the fighter pilots may face in a
real war field.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the airport mock-ups had been in existence
for years, with nearly all fighter pilots in the air force
undergoing training there several times.
</P>
<P>
This report made military strategists here wonder why the IAF
publicized the bombing training on "Syrian airports", even in
virtual reality, at such a time while the talks between Israel and
Syria are in deep stalemate since January and while Israel plans to
withdraw its army from south Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
The mystery was redoubled as the report mentioned other airfield
models in IAF training, which were also reproduced from photos of
airports in other Middle East countries, but their identities have
been kept classified.
</P>
<P>
According to at least one version of the speculation, Israeli
army officers are showing their strength and determination to
retaliate Syria in case that Syria's ally in Lebanon foot-drags the
Israeli troops withdrawal from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
In March, Israeli cabinet approved the pullout from the buffer
zone, which Israel created in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to
prevent guerrilla attacks against its north, due to great pressure
from home and abroad against its continuing occupation of Lebanon
territories.
</P>
<P>
However, IAF officers believed that Syria is afraid that the
redeployment will remove the most powerful bargaining chip from its
hand in the talks with Israel to regain control of its Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau which Israel has been occupying since
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The difference over the Golan had kept the Israeli-Syrian talks
in deadlock since January after two fruitless rounds of talks in
the United States earlier.
</P>
<P>
When the last effort to revive the talks, a summit meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad in Geneva in March, failed to accomplish its mission, there
were even panic reports in Israeli media that Syria was brewing a
major attack operation against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an IAF officer, the Air Force Magazine reported on
Monday that the training on Syrian airfield models is following the
IAF traditional strategy to achieve air superiority by attacking
the enemy's runaways.
</P>
<P>
This is a priority target in today's battle plans, the magazine
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's First Spaceman to Go Up Next Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's first spaceman is
scheduled to fly into outer space within the United States' shuttle
Columbia by mid 2001, Israel's Air Force Magazine revealed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Colonel Ilan Ramon was chose by American's National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a crew on the 107th
flight of the shuttle, which is due to take off next April or May,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, a former accomplished fighter pilot in Israel Air Force
who has been in training for space mission at Johnson Space Center
in Texas since 1998, once was expected to be lifted off in that
year for commemorating Israel's 50th Independence Day. However, he
had to wait for more time for ending his training.
</P>
<P>
The major task of his first mission is performing experiments,
including a project master-planned by 35 Israeli eight-grade pupils
from the Kiryat Motzhkin's Ort school.
</P>
<P>
The project, code-named "a chemical garden", is aimed to observe
the growth of seeds in space and solve a yet unanswered question -
why sprouts grow upwards on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the magazine, Ramon said: "This is the first step in
involving more of the Israeli establishment in the space program
and it exposes the youth to an exciting field."

<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said Monday
that it is targeting Asia and Europe as job-friendly markets for
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) while it continues to pursue
efforts to create enough employment opportunities at home.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department of Labor and
Employment said these markets have great potential for providing
good benefits for workers.
</P>
<P>
"This year, markets in Europe an Asia offer good potential for
our overseas workers," Laguesma said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that this remains a temporary measure while the
government is putting in place programs to generate enough job
opportunities in the country to encourage OFWs to return home and
stay here.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to look for opportunities for our OFWs, we would
focus on better-paying, skilled jobs for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has hailed OFWs as the
country's modern-day heroes, citing their contributions to
economic growth through their billions of dollars in remittances
annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Estrada administration intensified its efforts to
monitor conditions, and conclude several labor and manpower
agreements with countries hosting OFWs.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the welfare of OFWs is one of the three pillars of
the Estrada administration's foreign policy alongside promoting
economic diplomacy and enhancing national security.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 government soldiers were
killed and 236 others injured in fierce fighting with the Tamil
rebels in northern Jaffna Peninsula of Sri Lanka on Sunday, a
defense spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman M. Indunil said during daytime on Sunday fierce
fighting erupted in northern Pallai town in north of Elephant Pass,
ahead of the main defense line now being constructed after the
vacation of Elephant Pass base.
</P>
<P>
The troops manning positions in Ittavil in northern of Pallai
town, were engaged by the rebels from north and south at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
The troops were forced to withdraw from Vempotukerni with a
large number of casualties. Similarly the troops deployed in
Palopullai and Pallai also withdrew after receiving heavy
casualties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indunil added that the troops are now deployed in their
delaying positions in area north of Pallai town ahead of the main
defense line.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Pallai to the rebels puts added pressure on the
government troops, which are batting to hold Jaffna Peninsula
after losing strategic Elephant Pass, the gateway to the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Pallai lies about 45 kilometers south of Jaffna, the main city
on the northern Jaffna peninsula which recaptured by government
troops in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
homeland in the north and east of the country, are trying to
recapture the northern Jaffna Peninsula -- their former stronghold,
after they captured the key Elephant pass army base last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibari Opposition Leader Joins Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary general of
Zanzibar's main opposition Civic United Front (CUF) Seif Shariff
Hamad Sunday collected nomination forms to aspire for the
presidency on the spice islands in the forthcoming general
elections scheduled for next October.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanzanian newspapers report on Monday, shortly
after collecting the forms at the CUF branch at Mtoni, Zanzibar at
a function which was also attended by senior CUF officials, Hamad
told reporters that his decision was influenced by mass support he
received from fellow Zanzibaris.
</P>
<P>
"CUF supporters have appealed all along for me to join the
presidential race. Therefore, I'm just fulfilling the wishes of
the people," he was quoted as saying, adding that his chances in
the polls are high.
</P>
<P>
Hamad becomes the first Zanzibari to announce formally his
intention to run for the Isles top position. No one has come
forward to join the presidential race from within the ranks of
ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Secretary General is expected to return the
nomination forms on Wednesday, the deadline for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Hamad, who was Zanzibar Chief Minister from 1984 to 1988,
stressed that he is ready to form a government of national unity
to enhance solidarity in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The CUF claims President Salmin Amour's ruling CCM party rigged
October 1995 elections in the Zanzibar region in the Indian Ocean
off mainland Tanzania, in which Hamad lost by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though it joined with Tanganyika to form the nation of Tanzania
in 1964, Zanzibar is a semiautonomous state with its own
government and parliament.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Urges for Mutual Respect Within Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate President Chuba
Okadigbo Sunday underscored the need for mutual respect among the
three arms of government to avert political crisis, which may
jeopardize the country's nascent democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Monday quoted
Okadigbo as saying that the on-going moves to reconcile the
executive with the legislature would fail unless the relationship
between them was based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The only way out of the on-going standoff between the two
government arms was for each of them to operate within its limit,
he said after another closed-door meeting with President Olusegun
Obasanjo at the weekend in the country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the tension generated in the senate over reported
moves to impeach him, Okadigbo said "I will remain in charge in
spite of any future attempt."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Electricity Consumers to Pay More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Electricity consumers in Kenya will
pay an extra 717 million shillings (9.7 million U.S. dollars) for
April to the Kenya Power and Lighting Company and fuel
adjustment costs, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The huge payment is attributed to the drop in the Kenya
shilling, rising fuel cost and increased reliance on thermal
sources of energy in the face of prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
"We have to step up the volume of fuel power generation when
the three main hydro electric power dams experienced low water
level leading to power rating last September," said James
Macharia, communications officer of the Kenya Power and Lighting
Company.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Masinga, Kamburu and Turkwell reservoirs are the
main sources of water for hydro-power generation in the country,
adding that they were hit by excess capacity following below
normal rains last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in thermal production from 88.3 million kwh in
1999 August to 145.6 million kwh in March this year forced the
utility providers to slap a fuel cost adjustment for electricity
generation, Macharia explained.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for payment increase, he said, is the drop in
the value of the shilling from 67 shillings to the dollar in 1999
August to 75 shillings to the dollar in March this year, which
led to an increase in foreign exchange adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The two charges combined will cost electricity consumers 7.9
million dollars in one month alone if the level of 388 million
kwh supplied in March was met, he said.
</P>
<P>
Macharia said the electricity suppliers is optimistic that dam
levels will return to normal with the long rains so that the
reliance on thermal power generation, the cause to high fuel
adjustment cost, is minimized.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Ten East African countries have
adopted a plan to monitor crime and enhance information exchange
with the International Police Organization (Interpol), the East
African weekly reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, worked out at a meeting in Kenya's capital Nairobi
last week, will be implemented by the respective countries with
aid from the newly- established Interpol sub-regional bureau in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Seychelles, Djibouti and Sudan attended the
meeting last week and agreed that intelligence information from
the respective countries will be exchanged through the Interpol
bureau to create harmony and cooperation in security matters.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kimundi, head of the Interpol East African sub-regional
bureau, said that no country can win the war against crime
singlehanded, which means they have to use a common front to
eradicate crime in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi meeting came on the heels of an international small
arms conference held here last month to discuss ways and means of
curbing the proliferation of small arms in East Africa and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
According to Interpol officials, plans are underway to install
a new Interpol telecommunications system which will improve access
to the general secretariat database in Lyons, France, and
information interchange between states.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Interpol has three sub-regional bureaux in
Africa, one in Nairobi for East Africa, one in Zimbabwe's capital
Harare for southern Africa and one in Abidjan, the capital of Cote
d'Ivoire, for west Africa.

<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has approved the formation of Roll Back Malaria clubs in
post-primary and post- secondary schools nationwide, reported The
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Presidency sources as saying that
Obasanjo has enjoined Education Minister Tunde Adeniran in concert
with the commissioners of education in the 36 states and Abuja to
work out strategies for floating the clubs.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at reducing the malaria scourge by half in
the next 10 years, as targeted by last week's Roll Back Malaria
summit held in Nigeria' s capital Abuja to create awareness at the
grassroots, the Presidency sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony of the Roll Back Malaria summit,
Obasanjo praised the students of the Federal Government Girls
College, Abuja for the formation of the first ever Roll Back
Malaria Club in the country, saying the initiative was worthy of
emulation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will amend its Electoral Act
to include representatives of political parties and other interest
groups, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bwalya, Electoral Commission (EC) chairman, was quoted as
saying in an interview in Lusaka that it will also introduce
continuous voter registration in readiness for next year's
presidential and general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Commission would soon present a budget to the government
for the forthcoming elections as preliminary preparations gain
ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
All that is required now is to amend the Electoral Act in the
next session of the parliament, the chairman said, adding that the
parliament is likely to resume its sittings in July or August.
</P>
<P>
"We want registration of voters to be a continuous process. It
is only a question of logistics and availability of money," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission wanted to ensure there were sufficient
materials in place so that the registration exercise went on
without hiccups once it commenced.
</P>
<P>
A structure of handling elections was already in place, Bwalya
said, explaining that a new dimension added to the process was
allowing school head teachers, district police chiefs and
principals of colleges to be returning officers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the concept of free and fair elections has
always been provided for under the Electoral Act.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Benefit from EU-SADC Mining Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is to benefit from the new
European Union (EU)-Southern African Development Community (SADC)
technical assistance agreement for the region's small-scale mining
operations to improve productivity, an EU spokesperson has said.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance program, which comes in the wake of
the anticipated release next month of 35 million euros (about 32
million U.S. dollars) by the EU for onward lending to the Zambian
small-scale mining sector, would run for at least three years, the
spokesperson was quoted by Monday's Times of Zambia newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In response to a press query, the spokesperson said the new
agreement would allow the region's small-scale mining operations
get exposed to new technology in the mining of gemstones and other
precious stones.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesperson, a significant development in the
new agreement was that technical assistance to operators in the
SADC small- scale mining sector would continue alongside the
dissemination of information on the development of the regional
mining sector.
</P>
<P>
The same technical assistance would also be extended to the
African Developers and Prospectors' Association and the African
Dimension Stone Association.
</P>
<P>
The project, whose agreement was reached ahead of the
forthcoming EU/ SADC mining sector forum scheduled for Lusaka
later this year, would be associated with the Center for the

<HEADLINE> Lakers Hit First Bump In NBA Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The mighty Los Angeles Lakers
Sunday hit their first bump on the road on many observers expect
to be a stroll to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal lost his shooting touch. Kobe Bryant was
slowed by foul trouble. Suddenly, the mighty Los Angeles Lakers
were not invincible.
</P>
<P>
After being manhandled for two games in Los Angeles, the Kings,
spurred on by a noisy sellout home crowd, went on a stunning 14-0
fourth-quarter tear to pull off a 99-91 win.
</P>
<P>
In the final period, Predrag Stojakovic and Tony Delk came off
the Kings bench and teamed with Chris Webber to rally Sacramento
to victory.
</P>
<P>
Stojakovic scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth and Delk
had nine of his 11, while grabbing four offensive rebounds. Webber
finished with 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists for the
Kings, who stay alive in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had 21 points and 17 rebounds, but went 8-for-22 from
the field and 5-for-14 from the foul line. Bryant, who picked up
his fourth foul early in the third period, had 16 of his 35 points
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer in reality and the reality is that we just beat
a good team and they're going to be mad when they come in Tuesday,
" said Webber, "so we just better be ready to play."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers won the first two games by comfortable margins in
Los Angeles. Game 4 in the best-of-five series is Tuesday night at
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
The Kings still face a harrowing task as they try to upset the
best team in the NBA this season. Only 12 teams have rallied to
win a series after trailing 2-0, and none since the Houston
Rockets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is familiar for the Lakers. In each of the
previous three seasons, Los Angeles has won the first two games of
its first-round series, then lost Game 3 and wrapped up the series
in four games.

<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- After the withdrawal of two candidates, nine will compete for
the new Turkish president in the second round of voting to be held
on Monday in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if the opposition parties do not fulfil their
promises to cast vote for the single candidate Ahmet Sezer offered
by the five parties, Sezer will await to be elected in the third
round with the votes of the ruling coalition deputies on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The chances of Sezer to be elected for president in Monday's
voting are very dim because the other inferior candidates are
seeking grounds to unite, calling that "the important thing is to
produce a president from within the parliament."
</P>
<P>
Among the nine candidates who attend the competition in the
second round, Sezer is the only one from outside the parliament and
the rest eight contenders are from within the legislative.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank declared that Turkey has been one of the
fastest growing countries in the world with its average annual
economic growth rate of 4.3 percent during the past 33 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Adopt Navigation System in Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. company Lockheed Maritime
Overseas will undertake construction of the Turkish Straits Vessel
Traffic Management and Information System, reported Turkish Daily
News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company won the 20.4 million U.S. dollar contract in a bid
process conducted by the Turkish Maritime Undersecretariat.
</P>
<P>
The contract entails the building of an operation center with
eight towers, each 15 meters tall in Bosphorus Strait. An
additional five towers are to be built in the Dardanelles Strait.
</P>
<P>
Turkey lies between Asia and Europe, being surrounded by three
seas of the Mediterranean, the Aegean and the Black. The two
continents are separated by straits, consisting from southwest to
northeast, of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the
Bosphorus.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Ramazan Mirzaoglu told the cabinet that an
average of 50,000 ships a year navigate the 325 kilometer waterway
between the Aegean and Black seas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, some 2,500 unregulated passenger and
various services ships traverse the channels each day carrying over
1 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
As ship dimensions continue to grow and even outgrow the
unchanging geography of the waterway, the risk of accidents
increases, which is why such navigation and information system is
so important, the minister explained.
</P>
<P>
The system will utilize radar, meteorological and oceanographic
systems as well as satellite information systems and day and night
cameras. Ships which previously operated as if they were the only
vessels on the water will now be made aware of each others'
presence, thus reducing the risk of near-misses, collisions and
groundings.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 some 82 million metric tons of hazardous material were
transported through the Bosphorus and some 95 million tons through
the Dardanelles, said the minister. The majority of this cargo was
crude oil, but other chemical products and liquefied petroleum gas
were also carried.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Conducts Nationwide Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government kicked off
Monday a one-month national census of population and housing in a
bid to set up a nationwide data base for the country to achieve
appropriate socio-economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Africa, administrator of the National Statistics Office (
NSO), said his office will field about 44,500 census-takers (
enumerators), 9,700 team supervisors, and 1,100 census area
supervisors to collect data on the 15.3 million households all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
Africa said in a statement that the census was designed to pose
as little inconvenience as possible for the households.
</P>
<P>
According to Africa, the census will consist of a 20- to 30-
minute interview with one member of the household -- the head, or
spouse, or the other responsible person who can answer on behalf
of the head.
</P>
<P>
The enumerators will ask basic information about the family --
the number of people residing within the household, their
educational background, civil status, ethnicity, professions,
livelihood activity, and other demographic data.
</P>
<P>
Africa said the NSO, which conducts national census every 10
years, will make Census 2000 to be the most complete, accurate and
comprehensive count of all Filipinos in the country's history
since 1903, when the first ever census was taken.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Project to Upgrade Saline Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese cooperative project
has been signed here under which Japanese Agro-scientists will
cooperate with their Chinese counterparts to improve the quality
of saline soil in north China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Japan will provide about 120 million Japanese yen's worth of
apparatuses, devices and materials needed for the project, and
Japanese experts in the field will also be sent to work in the
project while some Chinese participators will receive related
training in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the project is focused on spreading a special
fertilizer developed by a Japanese expert who has made numerous
field trips to Shanxi since 1996. The fertilizer, after having
been experimented with for two consecutive years, proved to be
effective in improving the saline soil and greatly raising its
grain yields.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is a province with large areas of saline soil, which
could add up to 300,000 hectares in total.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Economic Ministers' Retreat Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A retreat meeting of economic
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) Retreat, the first of its
kind held in Myanmar, will focus on "East Asia Economic
Cooperation" declared by an informal ASEAN summit in Manila last
November in review of lessons to be drawn from the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the AEM retreat, Lt. Gen.
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, warned that although most of the Asian
countries hit by the crisis are now at varying levels of economic
recovery, there remain many economic challenges and uncertainties
facing ASEAN and there are social concerns all requiring long-term
sustainable solutions.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of Myanmar's ASEAN Steering
Committee, emphasized the importance of implementing the Hanoi
Plan of Action and the Bold Measures adopted at the ASEAN Summit
held in Hanoi in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
He noted the growing awareness in recent years among ASEAN and
East Asian countries, particularly China, Japan and South Korea,
that they share a common destiny.
</P>
<P>
He added that the adoption of the Joint Statement on East Asia
Cooperation at the Third ASEAN Informal Summit in Manila last
November bears testimony to the commitment by ASEAN and these
countries to enhance interaction and develop closer linkages.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Myanmar's appreciation for the support and
cooperation extended by all three dialogue partners during the
recent economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Myanmar's outlook towards ASEAN, he said the future
of Myanmar and Southeast Asia cannot be separated and that an
ASEAN without Myanmar will not be an ASEAN in its true sense.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Myanmar's commitment that his country will never
become an obstacle or hindrance to ASEAN and will instead be of
great asset to the regional grouping with the emergence of the
full economic potentials of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The AEM retreat will be followed by a meeting with their
counterparts from three East Asia dialogue partners -- China,
Japan and South Korea -- on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the AEM plus 3 meeting, agenda items on information
technology, trade and investment and electronic commerce, Mekong
Basin development, human resources development, agriculture,
industry and tourism will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka's Tamil Rebels Overrun Northern Pallai Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels have
claimed they took Pallai town in the north of the country and
established control over a large area in the Thenmarachchi sector
of Jaffna Peninsula, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels Sunday overran the massive military base at Pallai,
about 15 km north of Elephant Pass, and also took control of the
town's surrounding villages, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Pallai by the rebels puts added pressure on the
government troops, which are battling to hold Jaffna Peninsula
after losing the strategic Elephant Pass, the gateway to the
Peninsula, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate official reaction but military sources
here privately admitted that government troops had faced severe
attacks at Pallai and may have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Pallai lies about 45 km south of Jaffna, the main city on the
northern Jaffna peninsula which was recaptured by government
troops in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the government was seeking urgent arms
supplies to check the rebels' latest advance.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga Friday said the rebels had
rejected all peace overtures, leaving her no option but to try and
defeat them in battlefields.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
homeland in the north and east of the country, are trying to
recapture their former stronghold of Jaffna Peninsula after they
captured the key Elephant Pass army base last weekend.

<HEADLINE> 37 Legionnaires' Cases Confirmed in Australia's State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Another 8 cases were confirmed as
legionnaires' in Australia's Victorian state Monday, bringing to
37 the number of confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
According to health officials, a further 32 people were
suspected to have the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The death toll remained at two.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has been blamed on water cooling towers at
Melbourne's new aquarium, visited by almost all those suffering
the disease in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's worst-ever outbreak of the disease at Wollongong
in New South Wales in 1987, there were 44 cases and a total of 10
people died.
</P>
<P>
The latest outbreak threw the residents of the state's capital
city Melbourne into panic. Staff have refused to work at the
Melbourne Aquarium while a full investigation takes place.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union,
who have been putting finishing touches, such as ramps at the
tourist attraction, walked off the job on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
An official from the union's health and safety unit insisted
all it's members who were employed over the exposure period be
given full medical monitoring. No work would be done at the
aquarium until medical results and a formal investigation into the
area were completed, he was quoted by Australian Associated Press
as saying.

<HEADLINE> IT Production Urged in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand professor has
warned that New Zealand is falling behind the global push in
information technology.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with New Zealand Infotech Weekly, which came
out Monday, Auckland University's professor of information systems
Michael Myers said New Zealanders "know how to use information
technology but have few clues on producing it."
</P>
<P>
"We're very good at using technology but when it comes to
producing technology we're not doing well at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Compared to Singapore, Israel, and Finland, which have
developed significant IT production and export industries with the
help of government intervention, Myers said, "New Zealand's export
of IT is tiny.
</P>
<P>
"If we, as a country, want to maintain our standard of living,
it seems to me essential that we move into the hi-tech area," he
added.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand must do its best to fully exploit technology
production to boost the economy, Myers stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Information technology is ideal for a country like New Zealand,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
The Auckland University's professor urged the New Zealand
government to actively encourage more research and development in
Information technology.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympic torch will get a
full South Pacific welcome when it arrives in Oceania this month
after arriving on a flight from Greece to Guam, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
Torch relay organisers said on Monday in Sydney that the torch,
which is to be lit in Olympia on May 10, will arrive in Guam on
May 22. It will then visit 11 South Pacific countries and regions
and travel 17,000 kilometers around Oceania before flying into
Uluru, the monolithic Ayers Rock, on June 8.
</P>
<P>
On the way, the torch will be carried by 30 different canoes,
including full-scale war canoes, through regions where a total of
929 different languages are spoken. It will ride on Nauru's famous
"phosphate train", arrive by helicopter at the foot of Papua New
Guinea's infamous Kokoda Trail, and compete for attention with
traditional fireknife dancers in Samoa.
</P>
<P>
It will twice cross the International Dateline, meaning that it
will enjoy May 29 twice -- first in Vanuatu and then in Samoa. The
torch will also visit the two newest Olympic nations, Palau and
the Federated States of Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
Its last stop before Australia will be New Zealand, where it
will be skied down from Queenstown's Coronet Peak. The torch will
then go on a 100-day tour of Australia before its entry into the
Sydney Olympic stadium during the opening ceremony on September 15.

<P>
YINCHUAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in northwest China and the state government of
Utah in the United States have reached consensus to jointly set up
West China E-commerce Portal (Ningxia).
</P>
<P>
Ningxia and Utah share very similar geographic, natural
conditions with lots of desertification areas. Nevertheless,
Ningxia's economy is less-developed in China whereas Utah's
economy has grown at annual rate of over 8 percent in the past
decade thanks to the rapid growth of IT industry, bio-engineering
and medical apparatuses and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote its development, Ningxia decided to set
up e-commerce postal to develop IT technology and Web economy in
cooperation with the corporations based in Utah like Compaq and
Oracle.
</P>
<P>
An autonomous government official in Ningxia said such
cooperative efforts will enable industrial enterprises in Ningxia
to be more open to the world through webs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are currently nearly 300 computer firms in
Ningxia and they can be conducive for the operation of e-commerce
portal, the official said that the construction of the portal is
expected to start early next month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Banks Face Tough Challenges By Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The state and private Thai banks are
now confronted with tough challenges as former compeers became
foreign-controlled competitors and more fellows are falling into
the hands of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, four of the 13 Thai commercial banks have been sold
to foreign buyers -- Nakornthon Bank to Britain's Standard
Chartered Bank, Radanasin Bank to United Overseas Bank of
Singapore, Bank of Asia to ABN-AMRO Bank of Holland, and Thai Danu
Bank to Development Bank of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
And that is not the end of the story. Recently, The London-
based Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) has agreed
with the central bank of Thailand in principle to buy 75 percent
of stake in the Thai-owned Bangkok Metropolitan Bank (BMB). Siam
City Bank, another Thai bank, is on the auction block, waiting for
the foreign buyer.
</P>
<P>
The government has reiterated that some of the Thai banks have
to be sold off as it is impossible to revive the banking system
with local capital and manpower.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai central bank governor Chatu Mongol said the
government preferred to retain as many Thai banks as possible, but
the Thai banks' survival depended on whether they can adjust to
compete against foreign banks and "mixed-blood" competitors.
</P>
<P>
With the government's bank-selling policy determined, the
remaining 7 Thai commercial banks now have to compete with not
only 21 branches of foreign banks in Thailand, but also the "mixed
blood" banks -- the foreign-controlled former nationalized or
private Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
In the view of many Thai banking analysts, those "mixed-blood"
banks have considerable edges over their Thai counterparts.
</P>
<P>
As former Thai-owned banks, the "mixed-blood" banks have
established branches across the country, and will be improved
largely in management and technology by their foreign masters,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A more flexible rate adjustment system and the smaller amount
of bad loans also give the "mixed-blood" competitors a good
position.
</P>
<P>
As the situation is getting worse, the Thai banks have decided
to carry out strategies for their own survival.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior executive of the Bangkok Bank, the
flagship of Thai banks, the Thai banks are now trying hard to
improve their technology, manpower and management to meet the
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Recently, many Thai banks have enhanced service in stores and
supermarkets, offering special service in holidays, promoting
young employees, focusing on non-interest income and taking
measures to prevent the bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that while the reality is hard for the Thai
banks, it can also stimulate them to greater efforts to improve
themselves, thus benefiting the whole banking reform process of
Thailand.

Labor Day Monday with rallies and demonstrations islandwide amidst
tight security precautions.
</P>
<P>
May Day celebrations are traditionally a show of strength by
various political parties in the country. There are usually
marches and processions through the streets, and public meetings
are held under the banners of different political parties.
</P>
<P>
At least 19 rallies and seven demonstrations are planned for

<HEADLINE> Tiger Found Above 3,000 Meters in Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali wildlife researchers have
successfully caught a tiger in their cameras at an elevation of 3,
000 meters in central Bhutan's ThrumsingLa National Park, The
Kathmandu Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first photographic evidence supporting the
presence of a Royal Bengal Tiger at such an high altitude," the
English daily quoted Dr. Yonzon, a wildlife expert in Kathmandu,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tiger was photographed on April 11, according to a press
release issued by Dr. Yonzon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the expedition team led by Dr. Yonzon also found
evidences of the endangered big cat's movements above the 4,000
meter elevation.
</P>
<P>
"Tigers' pugmarks at 4,110 meters suggest that tigers use
expansively high altitude pass to move into adjoining valleys,
said Dr. Yonzon.
</P>
<P>
Yonzon's team has been conducting a wildlife survey in the
ThrumsingLa Park since September 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Yonzon, Bhutan's all nine protected areas
contain tiger populations which are connected by wildlife
corridors.
</P>
<P>
Tigers are considered as flagship species, whose existence will
meet habitat requirements of many other species.
</P>
<P>
Only about 6,000 Royal Bengal Tigers are surviving in the parks
and reserves of the South Asian region where they are endemic.
Between 200-250 adult tigers are residing in and around Nepal's
four Terai parks or reserves adjoining to India.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's semiconductor exports
soared 17.4 percent to 5.43 billion U.S. dollars in the first
quarter, compared with the same period last year, the Commerce,
Industry and Energy Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be easy for the nation to meet this year's export
target of 23.5 billion dollars if the current brisk overseas
performance of semiconductor continues, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 5.43 billion dollars, 2.48 billion dollars of
products went to Asia, 1.6 billion dollars to the United States,
560 million dollars to Japan and 760 million dollars to European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import of semiconductor reached 4.71 billion
dollars in the first three months, a 23 percent increase over last
year's 3.84 billion dollars, due to the rise of the domestic
demand for computers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor export rose as average prices for DRAM chips
dropped by 35 percent to 7.1 dollars a piece from 10.1 dollars,
and the output doubled from 160 million units to 320 million in
the first quarter, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted the surplus to be 500 million dollars in
the second quarter of this year with 5.65 billion dollars of
export and 5.15 billion dollars of import based on the stable DRAM
prices and increasing demand.

<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The amount of tax levied on interest
of savings accounts has been on rise in the past months and is
expected to reach approximately 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion U.S.
dollars) this year, according to the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
While the imposition of the tax has not led to an overall fall
in the sum of savings deposits, it has exerted a positive impact
on stimulating consumption, an official with the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Such an effect will be conducive to stimulating domestic demand
and maintaining the rapid growth of national economy, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
China started to levy a 20-percent tax on interest of savings
accounts on November 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> 6 Killed in Violence in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed and
50 others injured when security personnel opened fire to disperse
warring groups in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clash also resulted in at least four houses in the
predominantly Christian Mardika district being set alight.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post Monday quoted witnesses as saying that the
conflicting groups used homemade weapons and bombs.
</P>
<P>
The six were reportedly shot by troops in an attempt to scatter
the crowds. The wounded, mostly suffering from gunshot wounds,
were taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Tension gripped the town following the shootings, but Pattimura
Military Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela said Sunday night that
the situation in the area was under control.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to quickly restore order, the usual 10 p.m. curfew was
put forward by an hour.
</P>
<P>
"The 9 p.m. curfew will remain until further developments. I
have issued a shoot-on-sight order to anyone who instigates riots.
It is very obvious that certain parties don't want peace to return
in Ambon, I urge people to stay calm," Tamaela was quoted by the
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the second clash within less than a week to rock the
provincial capital of Ambon, about 2,500 kilometers northeast of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
At least three people were killed when mobs threw homemade
bombs at a speedboat off Benteng Gudang Arang in Ambon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest bout of violence took place in the same area where
15 months of communal conflict across the Maluku islands started
in January last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people were killed in the prolonged violence,
which also left thousands of homes and buildings destroyed and
hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to other islands and
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have subsided in recent months but tension remains in
some regions, particularly North Maluku province.

<HEADLINE> Outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- There was an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease in Victoria, southeastern Australia,
according to Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 cases were confirmed as legionnaires' and two of
them have died. As many as 56 others were suspected of having
contracted the disease in the recent outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A Victorian Department of Human Services spokesman said the
latest outbreak was attributed to the air-conditioning system at
Melbourne Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest ever in Victoria's history. The previous
largest outbreak led to 17 confirmed cases from an air-
conditioning system in the Melbourne suburb of Thomastown in 1998.
The largest ever outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Australia
was in 1987 in the New South Wales city of Wollongong, where there
were 44 cases and 10 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said on his European tour he would
see a doctor to ensure he had escaped the disease when he visited
the aquarium for a Liberal party function two weeks ago. "I feel
okay - I've got a bit of a cold, but that's got nothing to do with
legionnaires' disease, I don't think," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
West Australian party executive member Neil Patrucco, who
attended the same function, is one of the confirmed cases.

<HEADLINE> Denmark's Ruling Party Endorses Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's ruling Social
Democratic Party voted in favor of the country's participation in
the European Union's common currency Sunday, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
At an extraordinary party congress held in Odense, the second
largest city in the country, 486 of the 501 Social Democrats voted
for participation by Denmark in the Economic and Monetary Union (
EMU).
</P>
<P>
However, whether Denmark will join the euro zone will also
hinge upon a referendum to be held on September 28.
</P>
<P>
The common currency has been used in 11 EU countries since
January, 1999 for a better integrated European economy and trade.
Like Britain and Sweden, Denmark, a member of the European Union,
refused in its initial phase, to join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told the congress that if
Denmark rejects the euro, then the money speculators on the
world's markets will "throw themselves at us" and pose "the
greatest threat against our welfare system." Thus, he continued, "
Our best insurance against this is adopting the common currency."
</P>
<P>
He said the strong international money markets will shield a "
vulnerable" Denmark against sudden crises, adding that an entry to
the euro zone also means more jobs.
</P>
<P>
A poll published last week showed 46 percent of voters were in
favor of Denmark adopting the single European currency, 44 percent
were against.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hopes Objective Report on Kosovo to Be Submitted to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic said Sunday that he hoped a visiting U.N.
delegation would submit an objective report on the serious
situation in Kosovo to the U.N. Security Council as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav News Agency Tanjug said Jovanovic made the remarks
during his meeting with Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations,
Sergei Lavrov, a member of the U.N delegation that visited Kosovo
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Lavrov said he felt the situation in Kosovo is
very serious. He described the plight of non-ethnic Albanian
residents there as exceptionally serious. They do not enjoy
fundamental human rights and freedom, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic attributed the serious situation to the violation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 by the U.N. mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) and the international peacekeeping force (KFOR),
which he said were supporting the separatists of the Kosovar
ethnic Albanians and terrorists in violation of Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his country would never accept any violation of U.N.
Resolution 1244 issued in June 1999 that ended NATO's air strikes
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation, consisting of representatives of eight
Security Council members, visited Kosovo Saturday and Sunday to
assess the U.N. mission to rebuild the local government and
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Four GMs Vie for Title in JAPFA Chess Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Four Grand Masters (GMs) will fight
hard to
finish first in the JAPFA Classic International Tournament 2000 in
Bali, Indonesia, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash of the titans will feature lone woman player GM Judit
Polgar of Hungary, GM Anatoly Karpov and GM Alexander Khalifman
both of Russia and GM Gilberto Milos Jr. of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
All four players are getting closer to winning the
championships as they share the top position with 5.5 match points
(MPs) each after eight rounds on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Monday, Polgar failed to maintain
her top position after she drew with GM Yasser Seirawan of the
United States in the 23th move on Sunday by Caro Kann defense.
</P>
<P>
Karpov, the FIDE world champion from 1975 to 1985 and from 1993
to 1999, faced a tough challenge from International Master Zaw Win
Lay of Myanmar on Sunday before both players agreed to tie in the
72th move using the Queen Gambit opening.
</P>
<P>
Karpov earned one point to trail Polgar in first place on
Saturday after he defeated GM Jaan Ehlvest of Estonia in the 87th
move by Queen Indian defense in a do-or-die match that lasted for
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
Ehlvest failed to enhance his performance on Sunday and bowed
out to Milos in the 36th move by Sicilia defense.
</P>
<P>
Timman was late to bounce back and gave up to Khalifman after
26 moves on Sunday. They used French defense.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian top players GM Utut Adianto and GM Ruben Gunawan
also drew in the 28th move on Sunday by Queen Gambit declined
opening.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a day off for the players.
</P>
<P>
Polgar said after the match that she intended to try her very
best to win her final game against Milos on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I said earlier that I wish to finish in the top three. After
all, it's a very tough tournament. I don't know whether I can beat
Milos, but I'll rest tomorrow (Monday) and we'll see the result on
Tuesday. I will play the black pieces, and it's not going to be
easy," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milos remained noncommital over his chances of winning over
Polgar, given the results of their five previous meets where
Polgar won three out of five and Milos won only once. They drew
once.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure (that I can beat her). I have the chance to win
and so does Judit. But I'm very happy with my performance in this
tournament," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped he could finish in the top three in the 16th
category event held at the Grand Bali Beach hotel in Denpasar,
capital of Bali.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Turns into Trade Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government has recently approved the establishment
of the Shanghai Diamond Exchange in Pudong. The Exchange, located
in China's highest building Jinmao Tower, is expected to go into
operation this year.
</P>
<P>
Pudong, on the eastern bank of Shanghai's Huangpu River, has
already set up a securities exchange, property rights, futures and
real estate markets with nationwide influence.
</P>
<P>
China began developing Pudong on April 18, 1990 in a drive to
reinvigorate Shanghai as an international trade and financial
center.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Securities Exchange has 22 million shareholders.
By the end of last year, 525 stocks were listed with a total
market value of 1,458 billion yuan (about 175.7 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last May, Shanghai metals, commodities, and oil and cereals
exchanges merged into the Shanghai Futures Exchange. With more
than 200 members, it is now one of the three major futures
exchange in China, dealing with copper, aluminum and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Transactions at the exchange have been stable, brisk.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Personnel Market has attracted hundreds of
thousands of talented professionals. Earlier this year, the market
opened a Center for people willing to go to take part in the
campaign of developing impoverished areas in west China. Thousands
have already registered.
</P>
<P>
As China continues to carry out housing reforms, local
residents are now allowed to sell their houses at the Shanghai
Real Estate Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, tens of thousands of foreigners have
purchased apartments in Shanghai. Economists are paying close
attention to information released by the Center, as it is an
important barometer for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
All of the above-mentioned marketing places are located in the
Lujiazui Financial and Trade Center in the heart of Pudong.
Lujiazui, with nearly 100 financial institutions in China and
overseas is dubbed "China's Wall Street."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Resolution of Hostage Crisis Proves Tough By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government now is
beset by two hostage crises, one involving foreigners, and the
other all Filipinos. But the resolution of the hostage crises,
either by force or by talks, has proved very difficult.
</P>
<P>
Until now, no one could predict when the two groups of hostages
could be rescued or freed, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The first hostage crisis started on March 20, when the Muslim
extremist group Abu Sayyaf took away more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan as a human shield after attacking a government
army post. Later the rebels held 29 of them as hostages and freed
the rest. Most of the hostages are school children and their
teachers.
</P>
<P>
The second crisis began on April 23. A group of Abu Sayyaf
members abducted 21 tourists and staff members from a diving
resort in Sipadan, Malaysia and moved to Jolo Island in the
southern Philippine Province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The hostages include two French, three Germans, two South
Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese, two Filipinos and several
Malaysian resort workers and wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippine government has made all-out efforts to
rescue the two groups of hostages, the resolution of the crises
seems not easy.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the Abu Sayyaf group claimed to have beheaded two
male hostages as Manila and Washington rejected its demand for the
release of two Abu Sayyaf members and three terrorists jailed in
the United States, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
The claim prompted the Philippine government to use force to
rescue the hostages. During the past week, government troops used
military helicopters and planes to attack the Abu Sayyaf camps.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the government army overran the mountain
stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf group and killed dozens of rebels,
but found no trace of hostages.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the troops prepared to put tear gas into the tunnels
where the rebels and hostages may stay. But the troops are unsure
if the rebels and hostages are inside the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
According to a claim by Abu Sayyaf members over the radio, the
rebels and 27 hostages have already fled together into the jungles.
</P>
<P>
An army general said Monday morning that their "main concern
now is to get the hostages alive."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that since the rebels have secret tunnels in the
area and can escape when they are attacked, it is very difficult
for government troops to rescue the hostages in the mountain area,
where the rebels have planted many landmines.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Abu Sayyaf is the most violent rebel group in the
Philippines. They could kill hostages if they fail to escape in
the fighting, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which means "Father of the Executioner" in
Arabic, is fighting for an Islamic state in the Southern
Philippines, though it has no more than 500 members.
</P>
<P>
As for the second hostage crisis, negotiations between the
government and the rebels have not started yet despite their
initial contacts.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Abu Sayyaf group threatened to behead some of
the 21 hostages they abducted in Malaysia, because they did not
want to talk with a government negotiator -- Nur Misuari, governor
of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and leader of the
former anti-government Moro National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Abu Sayyaf said that his group wanted to
talk with the ambassadors of the countries to which their captives
belong.
</P>
<P>
"Misuari is trying to divide and rule us. Because of this we
decided tonight (Friday) to rejected Misuari as the government
negotiator," the spokesman said. "Instead we demand the
ambassadors of the respective countries of these captives to
negotiate with us, and if they do not want, we will behead some of
the foreigners to teach them a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"We will execute the foreign captives and we will embarrass the
Philippine government," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine government said it will not replace the
negotiator and will resolve the hostage crisis in Sulu by peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces chief of staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila asking about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said he assured them that the government will exert
all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as
possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim note that government soldiers have sealed off the area
to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Commander Defects to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An eminent opposition commander in
Afghanistan has recently defected to the ruling Taliban militia
along with some 3,000 supporters, news reports reaching here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commander Abdullah Jan, who controlled the Daulat Shahi
district in the eastern Afghan province of Laghaman, told a news
conference Sunday that he decided not to fight against Taliban
troops after realizing the "futility" of lasting civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jan, an ally of chief opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood,
addressed the press conference in Kabul along with the Taliban's
Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel and Defense Minister
Mawlawi Obaidllah.
</P>
<P>
Daulat Shahi is a strategically crucial district, located at
the access to Masood's stronghold of Panjsher valley northeast of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Jan, who joined the ruling militia a week ago, said some 3,000
armed troops under his command also joined the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would not fight against Masood and voiced
the hope there would be no need for any fighting in Afghanistan,
which has been ravaged by civil war for two decades.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have more than 80 percent of the Afghan
territory under their control, are fighting opposition troops
loyal to Masood in the northern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Province Cuts Back on Timber Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in northeast
China has substantially cut back its timber production to
implement the nation's forest protection project.
</P>
<P>
The biggest timber producer in the nation -- Longjiang Forestry
Industrial Corporation -- has reduced its production by 20 percent
to 5.28 million cubic meters, compared with 6.78 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The corporation boasts about 40 percent of the nation's forest
reserve, and contributes about one tenth of the nation's timber
output annually.
</P>
<P>
With the launching of the forest protection drive nationwide in
1998, China issued bans or adopted a quota system in forest areas
spanning more than 70 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
About 6.6 million hectares of forest in Heilongjiang are
protected areas, accounting for 73 percent of its total forest
area.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to see its forest reserve exceed 800
million cubic meters by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions, War of Massive Slaughter: Iraqi Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly
Saadoun Hamadi on Monday blamed the decade-old sanctions by the
United Nations on his country as a war of massive slaughter which
has claimed lives of over 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in his speech at the 103rd conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), a six-day biannual event
inaugurated in Amman on Sunday to discuss world peace and stability
as well as dialogue between different cultures and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said the U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraqi troops
invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990, had been more barbarous than
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, he said, the sanctions had claimed lives of
1.3 million Iraqi citizens, most of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sanctions, he said, the mortality rates
increased by seven and four times for Iraqi children below and
above the age of five respectively, and many children either
suffered from malnutrition or had to drop out of school due to
deteriorating living standards and rising unemployment rates in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Basic infrastructure in important economic sectors of Iraq were
also severely damaged by the crippling sanctions, hence an
obstacles to the development of his country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi claimed that Iraq has implemented U.N. resolutions on
Iraq and had fully cooperated with a U.N. special committee on
weapons inspections in his country, but the U.N. and had failed to
carry out its commitments to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can be lifted only after U.N. weapons experts
certify that Iraq has dismantled all its weapons of mass
destruction. The U.N. Security Council has adopted a new resolution
on restarting weapons inspection in exchange for phased removal of
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the resolution, accusing it of
backpedalling on a promised full lifting of sanctions upon Iraqi
compliance.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi speaker also blamed the U.N. inaction to the no-fly
zones imposed in the north and south of Iraq by U.S. and British
forces since 1991, under the excuse of preventing Iraqi government
prosecution of Kurds and Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The daily patrols by U.S. and British fighter planes in the air
exclusion zones, which Baghdad never recognizes for lack of U.N.
authorization, are daily aggression against Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to world countries for endorsing the establishment
of a new international order based on balance, justice, respect for
human rights and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now has 144 members, is the largest
international parliamentary organization.
</P>
<P>
Its biannual conference serves as an important venue for
parliamentarians of countries under different political systems to
discuss global issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses U.S. Charges of Supporting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday dismissed the U.S.
charges that it supports terrorism, saying the accusations were a
way of diverting public attention from the behavior of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that by
accusing Iran of terrorism, the United States is in fact trying to
divert international attention from Israel, which Iran terms as the
main supporter of terrorism in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency, Asefi said that
Iran "has always been a victim of terrorism," adding that the U.S.
accusations showed its "dishonesty toward this odious phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department released a report Friday listing Iran
as the main supporter of terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although there were signs of political change in Iran in 1999,
the actions of certain state institutions in support of terrorist
groups made Iran the most active state sponsor of terrorism, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God,
which is leading a guerrilla war to end Israel's 22-year-old
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Tehran and Washington were severed in 1980
after Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held
52 Americans hostage.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Center of Anti-American Terrorism Shifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department issued
an annual report on anti-American terrorism, saying the focus of
terrorism has shifted from the Middle East to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"1999 saw a shift from the Middle East to South Asia as a focus
of terrorism against the United States," a State Department
official said upon the release of the 107-page annual report,
entitled "Patterns of Global Terrorism - 1999," which was sent to
Congress last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The State Department's report also said that the anti-American
terrorism trends have shifted from well organized, localized
groups supported by state sponsors to "loosely organized
international networks of terrorists."
</P>
<P>
The report said the eastward shift of anti-American terrorist
centers to South Asia occurred after most Middle East governments
strengthened their counter-terrorist response.
</P>
<P>
"In South Asia, the major terrorist threat comes from
Afghanistan, which continues to be the primary safe haven for
terrorists," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United States picked up Afghanistan as the "major terrorist
threat" because the State Department said it "continues to harbor
Osama bin Laden and a host of other terrorists loosely linked to
bin Laden, who directly threaten the United States and others in
the international community."
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, the Taliban government said in a statement that bin
Laden is a guest and Afghan tradition forbids handing him over to
an enemy. The statement also condemned terrorism as against Islam.
</P>
<P>
The State Department report also said Pakistan sends mixed
messages on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Despite significant and material cooperation in some areas --
particularly arrests and extraditions -- the Pakistani government
also has tolerated terrorists living and moving freely within its
territory," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan denied the charges, saying the so-called terrorist
link was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is irrevocably opposed to terrorism in all its forms.
Pakistan has always cooperated with the international community,
including the United States, to combat terrorism," a Pakistani
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed U.S. demands that the Islamabad government
use its key influence with the Taliban government in Afghanistan
to get bin Laden extradited, saying Washington must deal directly
with the Taliban over the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan ... cannot be expected to interfere in the internal
affairs of Afghanistan," he read a Pakistani statement.

UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Five powers on Monday
afternoon presented their 23-point statement to the current Review
Conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), saying
that they remain "unequivocally committed to fulfilling all of our
obligations under the Treaty."
</P>
<P>
Hubert de la Fortelle, French ambassador on disarmament,
presented the statement to the Conference on behalf of China,
France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We remain unequivocally committed to fulfilling all of our
obligations under the Treaty," said the statement, which described
the Treaty as "the cornerstone of the international nuclear
nonproliferation regime and the essential foundation for nuclear
disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the decision on indefinite extension of the Treaty
adopted in 1995 by its member States," the statement said. "We
reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the review process of the
Treaty and to the principles and objectives for nuclear
nonproliferation and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated the need for universal adherence to the NPT and
call upon all States that have not yet done so to accede to the
Treaty at an early date," the statement said. "The nuclear
explosion carried out by India and Pakistan in May 1998 were a
cause of deep international concern."
</P>
<P>
"We stress that compliance with the NPT by all member States
is essential to further the comprehensive goals of the Treaty," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate our unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals
of a complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty and
complete disarmament under strict and effective international
control," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, "The contribution of the five
nuclear-weapon States to systematic and progressive efforts to
reduce nuclear weapons globally has been and will be highlighted
by each of us nationally."
</P>
<P>
"Emphasizing the essential importance of cooperation,
demonstrating and advancing mutual trust among ourselves, and
promoting greater international security and stability, we declare
that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at any State," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Ratification of STAT II by the Russian Federation is an
important step in the efforts to reduce strategic offensive
weapons and is welcome," the statement said. "Completion of START
II by the United States remains a priority."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the conclusion of START III as soon as
possible while preserving and strengthening the ABM (the Anti-
ballistic Missile) Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability
and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive
weapons," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the creation of two new nuclear-weapon free zones
since 1995 as a significant contribution to the enhancement of
regional and international peace and security: Southeast Asia and
Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We stress the importance of international cooperation in
order to maintain the highest practicable levels of nuclear safety,
" the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Protecting Bio-diversity of Lake Tanganyika </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Monday called for protecting
bio- diversity of Lake Tanganyika, which Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo border.
</P>
<P>
National coordinator of the Environment Council of Zambia,
James Phiri, called on the four countries to come up with measures
to protect the bio- diversity of the lake.
</P>
<P>
He told the Lake Tanganyika bio-diversity strategic action plan
workshop held here Monday that threats have been identified in
much larger magnitudes as no real intervention has been taken to
address the causes.
</P>
<P>
Phiri said unsustained utilization of resources due to
increased population and natural industrial and related pollution,
directly affects the water quality and the bio-diversity of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rich bio-diversity of the lake warrants truly
global interventions not only from U.N. Global Funding Mechanism
but also other multilateral and bilateral sources.
</P>
<P>
Phiri urged the participants to come up with pragmatic ways to
help tackle the threats to the lake and its uniquely rich
bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program has donated 10 million U.S.
dollars to the bio-diversity project of the lake.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Defends Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa defended on Monday the ongoing economic reforms in the
country, saying they are inevitable to absorb shocks from the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the May Day rally in the central town of Dodoma, the
 president said poor countries are fighting with big nations in an
 environment which has no boundaries of capital, trade, production
and markets, a situation which has enabled the latter to control
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and other poor countries must brace up and learn the
game's tricks and procedures so that they could as well play it
and "win goals," the president said in his candid 38-page speech.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa emphasized that his government would continue the
economic reforms so that the economy could grow by at least six
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"We should stop hating foreign companies taking over our firms
and instead work with them to increase production and safeguard
employment," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has made substantial progress in implementing economic
reforms. During the last four years, inflation came down to less
than 7 percent from over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The structural reform agenda includes the restructuring and
privatization of utilities and other parastatal monopolies and the
implementation of regulatory frameworks.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Seeks to Return to Cuba with Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Craig, the attorney for Gonzalez, said in a court
filing document that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) was correct in determining in January that Elian
belonged with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Juan Miguel has determined that Elian's best interests lie in
being with his father, raised in a stable home environment in the
town where his father, stepmother, little brother, grandparents
and first cousins were born, grew up and now live," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Atlanta ruled last
month that Elian should stay in the United States until the court
rules on the asylum filed by the Miami relatives on behalf of the
boy.
</P>
<P>
"This father seeks to raise his family where he wants and how
he wants. This right is no less important to people from Cuba than
it is to Americans," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
Juan Miguel arrived early last month to claim the custody of
Elian, who had been taken care of by his relatives in Miami after
the boy was rescued on November 25 when his mother were drowned in
the Atlantic after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
The Miami relatives have refused to hand over the boy to his
father. But the boy was snatched away from their home in Miami in
an operation by the federal agents and then returned to the father
a week ago. The Gonzalez family now stays in Wye Plantation,
Maryland waiting for a court hearing on whether Elian should stay
in the U.S. or not.
</P>
<P>
Craig also attacked Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who
refused to turn over Elian to his father and filed the political
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
"Lazaro has used this nation's legal system in an attempt to
destroy Juan Miguel's family. He now threatens to rob Elian of a
childhood at his home with his father, his family and his friends.
Nothing in law or humanity should compel such a result," Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
The Miami relatives also arrived in Washington after Elian was
removed from them. Their request to see the boy was rejected by
Juan Miguel.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Monday
despite a recommendation for breaking up Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
77.87 at 10,811.78.The index fell 154.19 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 97.42 at 3,958.08 in the third
consecutive session and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 15.82
at 1,468.25.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied as investors moved into the market for bargain-
hunting, defying the U.S. Justice Department's recommendation made
last Friday for splitting Microsoft into two companies. Microsoft
rose in the first session after the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The company has suffered heavy losses since U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled on April 4 that Microsoft had
repeatedly violated the antitrust law.Investors believed today a
possible breakup of Microsoft had already taken its toll on the
company's stocks.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also encouraged by a report from the U.S.
National Association of Purchasing Management. The report said
America's industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in
April but prices for raw materials did not rise as fast as in the
earlier months, easing fears in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Other tech companies including dot.coms were also higher. Among
them were Red Hat, VA Linux and About.com.
</P>
<P>
General Electric led the Dow's advance.

margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,959 up, 1,055 down
and 432 unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 943.85 million shares from 970.34
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Hiroshima, Nagasaki Call for Nuclear Weapons-Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1(Xinhua) -- The Mayors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki of Japan on Monday urged the United Nations to help bring
about a nuclear weapons-free world.
</P>
<P>
Itcho Ito, Mayor of Nagasaki, delivered the appeal on behalf of
the two cities to the U.N. Deputy Secretary-General for
Disarmament Affairs, Jayantha Dhanapala, and Addallah Baali,
Chairman of the current U.N. conference on nuclear
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
Ito and Hiroshi Morimoto, the deputy Hiroshima mayor, are here
in New York to attend the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which
is held at the Headquarters of the United Nations from April 24 to
May 19.
</P>
<P>
The two mayors said in their appeal that the nuclear non-
proliferation regime was facing a collapse following the nuclear
tests in 1998 by South Asia.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the current 2000 Review Conference
on NPT would produce concrete results on nuclear arms reduction.
</P>
<P>
Ito is expected to address the conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the world's only nuclear-bombed
cities.
</P>
<P>
Opened for signature in 1968, the Treaty entered into force in
1970. By January 2000, a total of 187 parties have joined the
Treaty, including the five nuclear weapons states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Asked to Give Donation to War Reparation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said the
companies should consider paying into the fund regardless of
whether they had German subsidiaries in Nazi time. .
</P>
<P>
Nazis nationalized some 50 U.S. companies including some major
ones still operating in Europe, Eizenstat said, adding that one of
the aims to set up the fund is to avert the threat of class-action
lawsuits against these companies.
</P>
<P>
The fund will channel corporate donations to victims of natural
disasters, the former slave and forced laborers and other
humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnstone, the chamber's senior vice president for
international affairs, said the project is the result of requests
from a number of member companies.
</P>
<P>
Several large American corporations, including Ford and General
Motors, have acknowledged that their German subsidiaries benefited
from slave labor after operations were taken over by the German
government during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some of the U.S. companies have asked to use the Chamber fund
to supplement the compensation payments from a 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars German fund, according to Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
The German government and companies last year agreed to pay 10
billion German marks to establish a fund to compensate the Nazi
forced laborers and slaves.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said that he hopes the U.S. fund will "facilitate the
settlement of existing suits and avoid the filing of new and
additional suits which would be very time-consuming, very
debilitating."

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects U.S. Accusation on Handling of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday rejected the U.S.
accusation of its position in dealing with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an annual report published by the U.S. State Department
Monday, Washington said that Greek terrorists last year
perpetrated 20 acts of violence against concerns of the U.S.
government and U.S. private companies in Greece and dramatically
increased their attacks against Greek targets, as well as foreign
targets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also complained that the absence of a strong public
leading government position and of initiatives to improve the
capabilities and morale of the police, contributed to the lack of
successes against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Greece Monday described the U.S. accusation of its position
against terrorism as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government believes that direct or indirect
accusations on Greece's policy on the issue of terrorism can not
be accepted, " Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at
a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece remained steadfastly bent on the target
of confronting the phenomenon of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Athens was standing in the front-
line in combating terrorism and was participating actively in all
international efforts, on an equal basis, with the criterion of
domestic law and order and respect for democratic institutions and
rights.

<HEADLINE> Five Powers Remain Committed to NPT  (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Five powers on Monday
afternoon presented their 23-point statement to the current Review
Conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), saying
that they remain "unequivocally committed to fulfilling all of our
obligations under the Treaty."
</P>
<P>
Hubert de la Fortelle, French ambassador on disarmament,
presented the statement to the Conference on behalf of China,
France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We remain unequivocally committed to fulfilling all of our
obligations under the Treaty," said the statement, which described
the Treaty as "the cornerstone of the international nuclear
nonproliferation regime and the essential foundation for nuclear
disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the decision on indefinite extension of the Treaty
adopted in 1995 by its member States," the statement said. "We
reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the review process of the
Treaty and to the principles and objectives for nuclear
nonproliferation and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated the need for universal adherence to the NPT and
call upon all States that have not yet done so to accede to the
Treaty at an early date," the statement said. "The nuclear
explosion carried out by India and Pakistan in May 1998 were a
cause of deep international concern."
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding their nuclear tests, India and Pakistan do
not have the status of nuclear-weapon States in accordance with
NPT," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We stress that compliance with the NPT by all member States
is essential to further the comprehensive goals of the Treaty," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate our unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals
of a complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty and
complete disarmament under strict and effective international
control," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, "The contribution of the five
nuclear-weapon States to systematic and progressive efforts to
reduce nuclear weapons globally has been and will be highlighted
by each of us nationally."
</P>
<P>
"Emphasizing the essential importance of cooperation,
demonstrating and advancing mutual trust among ourselves, and
promoting greater international security and stability, we declare
that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at any State," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Ratification of STAT II by the Russian Federation is an
important step in the efforts to reduce strategic offensive
weapons and is welcome," the statement said. "Completion of START
II by the United States remains a priority."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the conclusion of START III as soon as
possible while preserving and strengthening the ABM (the Anti-
ballistic Missile) Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability
and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive
weapons," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the creation of two new nuclear-weapon free zones
since 1995 as a significant contribution to the enhancement of
regional and international peace and security: Southeast Asia and
Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We stress the importance of international cooperation in
order to maintain the highest practicable levels of nuclear safety,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Conference, which kicked off on April 24, entered its
second week in general debate. It is scheduled to conclude on May
19 before setting the goal for the next five years in implementing
the Treaty.
