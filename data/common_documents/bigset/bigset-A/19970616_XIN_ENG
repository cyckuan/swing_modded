<HEADLINE> AL Denounces U.S. Congress Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) warned today
that a non-abiding U.S. Congress resolution on moving the
U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem will obstruct the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Mohamed
Zakaria voiced his strong astonishment over the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"It will impede Arab, international and American efforts to
salvage the peace process from its present stalemate caused by
Israeli arbitrary measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives voted Tuesday 406-17 calling
on President Bill Clinton to reaffirm that Jerusalem must remain
Israel's "undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The vote, which does not oblige the Clinton administration to
act, came as Egypt struggled to resolve a peacemaking crisis
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority caused by Israel's
construction in March of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it in a move
unrecognized by the international community, including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Zakaria voiced the hope that Clinton would not implement the
said resolution especially as the crisis of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations has reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
"Such resolution would lead to a state of frustration among all
peace advocates," Assistant Secretary General for Palestinian
Affairs Saeed Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
These resolutions certainly place Arab and Islamic countries
before serious challenges, Kamal warned.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, the U.S. Senate and the House passed the
Jerusalem Embassy Act which states as a matter of U.S. policy that
Jerusalem should remain "the undivided capital of Israel" and the
American embassy should be moved there by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
But recognizing the volatility of the issue, it allowed Clinton
to suspend the embassy's move from Tel Aviv for a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as their future
capital, have said that recognizing the annexation of Jerusalem to
Israel and opening an embassy there without recognizing East
Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine is a declaration of war on
the Palestinian people.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Govt Warns Against Public Servants' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government today
warned public servants and all workers that should they fail to report
for duty on Monday it would not support them if their employers took
action against them, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle's Special Adviser, Thom
Thabane, was quoted as saying in Maseru, capital of the land-locked
kingdom, that any planned protest action to stay away from work was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Thabane also stressed that the government was also an employer
and if any of its employees failed to turn up for work on Monday
it would also not support them.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of opposition parties led by the ruling Basutoland
Congress Party (BCP) has called a series of protest action
against Mokhehle's latest political moves, which have reportedly
plunged Lesotho into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle last weekend broke away from the BCP and formed a new
political party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), to
which he immediately transferred governance, a move which stunned
the small kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The coalition rejected Mokhehle's political move and vowed to make
Lesotho ungovernable and parliament unworkable.
</P>
<P>
Monday's planned stayaway call is one of a number of protest
actions called by the opposition. enditem

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns U.S. Congress Decision on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 15 (Xinhua) - Jordan here today condemned the
U.S. Congress' decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital
as "unappropriate."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Congress' move precipitates the peace process and the
Oslo accord which has pulled the entire Israeli issue on the
agenda of final status negotiations," Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali told the press here today.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Jordian Lower House, represented by Speaker
Saad Hayel Srour, said that the move by the U.S. congressmen was
aimed at aborting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, King Hussein of Jordan warned in Geneva on his
European visit that the U.S. House of Representatives' resolution
calling on President Bill Clinton to reaffirm that Jerusalem must
remain Israel's undivided capital "sort of undermined" the
U.S. role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. efforts in May to reactivate the peace negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel came to no avail as its special
envoy Dennis Ross failed to persuade Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has a close military relationship with the U.S. It will
receive the first batch of 16 F-16 jet fighters, part of a
300-million-dollar military assistance pledged by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the U.S. have just concluded their second allied
war games this year, named "Infinite Moonlight 1997," on June 11.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Boycott Mideast Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz announced here today that his country will not participate
in the Middle East economic summit scheduled for November 19 in
Doha, Qatar, which will expectedly be attended by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also called on other Arab countries to boycott the Doha
summit since Lebanon considers such a conference a step forward to
the normalization of ties between the Arabs and Israel and an
equivalent to Arab-Israeli multi-lateral peace talks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his Beirut residence, the
foreign minister recalled the resolutions which were taken
earlier this year in the Arab League summit in Cairo, the summit
of the Islamic Conference Organization in Islamabad and the
meeting of the ICO's Jerusalem committee in Rabat.
</P>
<P>
Those resolutions, Boueiz underlined, "demand all the Arab
states to freeze relations with Israel and to review the ties they
had set up, in light of the stalemate in the peace process and in
light of the negative positions taken by Israel."
</P>
<P>
"We consider it a violation of these resolutions to carry on
any conference or work which could be linked with the
normalization, the multi-lateral negotiations and an enhancement
of relations between the Arab countries and Israel," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
"We will absolutely not participate in the economic conference
in Qatar, and we called on the Arab brothers to show a firm and
clear position through boycotting this conference," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Middle East economic conference, the foreign
minister called for an "Arab economic conference" in order to
draw the Arab economic strategies by which the Arabs will
negotiate with world states on economic issues.

<P>
ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The fight against doping will be lost
unless more countries and sports federations make an effort to
stop the use of performance-enhancing drugs, the International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch said in Bari,
Italy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch added that too many officials ignore the issue.
</P>
<P>
he noted: "There are two different worlds. The one that is
fighting doping and the one that is not fighting doping. Some
sports organizations do a lot, some do very little, and some do
nothing."
</P>
<P>
"That is unacceptable. We can't allow doping in sports."
</P>
<P>
The IOC president spoke at a press conference in the southern
Italian port city of Bari, where he is attending the 13th
Mediterranean Games.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic chief declined to cite specific sports or nations
that are negligent, though he noted that "track and field,
swimming and maybe also cycling are better than many others."

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Denies Iran Hosts PKK Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that there were no rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) on the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Following a 40-minute meeting with his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel, Rafsanjani told reporters that Iran and Turkey
would set up cooperative teams to curb the PKK activities along
the Iranian-Turkish borders.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the PKK
rebels, which has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy in
eastern and southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran and Turkey should strengthen
security cooperation along their border areas.
</P>
<P>
Describing Turkey as a friendly country, the Iranian president
said that the infiltration of the PKK rebels into Iran also
affects the benefits of the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
Iran has criticized Turkey for launching a large-scale
military operation in northern Iraq aimed at wiping out the PKK
rebels there.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops, backed by
artillery and fighters, poured into northern Iraq on May 14 to
attack the PKK rebels, who allegedly constitute the most dangerous
threat to the Turkish security.
</P>
<P>
In response to a Xinhua question earlier today, Turkish
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel denied media reports that
Turkey had begun to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 PKK militants have reportedly been killed in
the latest Turkish military incursion in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> No Pact Deal Expected on Sunday: Dutch Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch presidency of the
European Union said that it was not seeking to strike a deal on
the EMU(Economic and Monetary Union) stability pact at an EU
finance ministers' dinner on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"The presidency does not intend to strike deals tonight over
dinner," a Dutch spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasised that the dinner was only an informal
occasion at which the issue was to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers' informal discussion comes before a
summit of EU leaders on Monday and Tuesday, which was supposed to
agree on a new EU treaty, preparing the 15-nation bloc to face the
challenges in the next century.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting seems set to be dominated by a rift which has
emerged between France and Germany since the new French government
said last week that it needed more time to study the stability
pact, which sets strict rules to keep deficits under control after
the launch of the EMU on January 1, 1999.

ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa told reporters here today that Egypt and Turkey wished to
double their trade volume soon.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark following a 30-minute meeting between
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri, who is here to attend the first summit of eight
Muslim countried -- developing eight, or D-8 -- held earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the two leaders discussed commercial and
economic ties between their two countries, whose trade volume
stands at half a billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Demirel and Ganzouri exchanged views over the
stalled Middle East peace process and the latest developments in
northern Iraq, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
In a Saturday meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, Ganzouri urged Turkey to end its massive military
operation in northern Iraq which was aimed at wiping out the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Mubarak failed to turn out at the first D-8
summit in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in protest over
Turkey's military incursion into northern Iraq which started on
May 14, an Egyptian diplomat told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 group, consisting of Turkey, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt,
Pakistan, Bangledesh, Malaysia and Indonesia, was formed on
October 11, 1996 on the auspices of Erbakan. It is aimed at
expanding economic cooperation among the Muslim countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain Vows to Ease N.Irish Parades Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain is trying to step up
efforts to solve the imminent parades crisis in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland Secretary, announced today that
she would hold talks with pro-British Protestant marching groups
and Irish Catholic objectors.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to do all we can to avoid a
repeat of last year's appalling events, which the people of
Northern Ireland have made absolutely clear they don't want to
see," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last year Northern Ireland suffered its worst street violence
for decades when police imposed a ban on a Protestant march in
Portadown but reversed it after four days of riots and roadblocks
by pro-British "Loyalists".
</P>
<P>
Mowlam's announcement came amid signs of continuing deadlock
about a planned July 6 march from Portadown, ahead of the Orange
Order's mammoth "Twelfth of July" parades which celebrate ancient
victories over the native Irish.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said she would hold meetings with key groups
which she met within days of her appointment after Labor won the
landslide election on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"As of this week, I, along with senior officials, will
undertake an intensive round of discussions with all the relevant
parties. This will continue over the course of the next few
weeks," she said.
</P>
<P>
The tension over parades is adding to community fears sparked
by a renewal of hostilities by the Irish Republican Army and their
Loyalist rivals.

visit to boost bilateral military relations.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the Kuwaiti International Airport by Deputy

Cohen will hold talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart on a number

</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem said Saturday Cohen's visit came within the
framework of bolstering the Kuwaiti-U.S. ties and common
understanding in the defense field.
</P>
<P>
He said Cohen's visit to Kuwait is a continuation of "the
common cooperation march," and it was to "study all developments
at both international and regional levels, in particular what
concerns Kuwait and the Gulf Cooperation Council affairs, the
exchange of expertise in the military field and bolstering
bilateral ties."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Palestine is An Arab Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
here today reiterated his country's position towards the
Palestinian issue, emphasizing that Palestine is an Arab country,
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi News Agency, Saddam said at a cabinet
meeting today that Iraq's position towards the Palestinian issue
was, is still and will be as it is: Palestine is an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
This statement came after the U.S. Congress made a decision to
move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to al-Quds
(Jerusalem).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding
resolution Tuesday recognizing as Israel's "undivided capital" and
earmarking 100 million dollars to move U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president said that Iraq "is ready, in accordance
with its national responsibilities, to discuss with other Arab
countries the matters on the basis of this prospective,
irrespective of the backgrounds and details of the past."
</P>
<P>
The timing and nature of the U.S. Congress' decision prove
that the U.S. does not play a balanced role in the Arab-Israel
conflict "when the matter is related to Israel's calculations and
those of the U.S. itself," Saddam stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi cabinet said that some states have taken al-Quads as
headquarters for their embassies, which it described as "a
challenge to Arab feelings and the rights of the Palestinians,
Arab and Islamic nations."

peace process again rather than to safeguard it," the foreign
minister told a press conference in his Beirut residence.
</P>
<P>
In the non-binding resolution, the U.S. House of
Representatives called on the Clinton administration to recognize
Jerusalem as the "undivided capital" of Israel and to allocate
100 million dollars to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem, the city shrined by both Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
"I think the principle of this resolution totally contradicts
the principles of the peace process...which demands that the
status of the holy city should be negotiated," Boueiz pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
These principles requires that "the things not be preempted by
this kind of position," he said. "Additionally, I believe that
the resolution harms the role of the United States as an
arbitrator and mediator in the peace process" which is supposedly
to be "impartial".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister described a resolution endorsed by the
U.N. general assembly Friday blaming Israel for the shelling of a
U.N. peacekeeping force camp in south Lebanon last year as an
"important victory" for Lebanon and other countries voting in
favor of it.
</P>
<P>
He vowed his government will continue demanding compensation
for all the damages caused by Israel in the 17-day-long "Grapes of
Wrath" operation in south Lebanon in April, 1996, and will study
the means to make the demands met.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. general assembly's resolution called on Israel to pay
1.7 million dollars to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
as part of the multi-national force's 1997-1998 budget, to atone
for the Jewish state's culpability in the shelling of the UNIFIL's
camp at Qana on April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and twenty seven states voted in favor of the
resolution while Israel and the U.S. voted against and Russia
abstained. The paragraph in the draft dealing with the damages
assessment against Israel was put to a separate vote and received
66 votes in favor and 59 abstentions with U.S. and Israel
opposing.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tough Talks Ahead for EU Amsterdam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The colorful Dutch capital of
Amsterdam is the venue for the European Union government leaders
to try to finalize the review of the Maastricht Treaty on June 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in Amsterdam will pave the way for the start of the
process for expanding the 15-nation bloc eastwards, which is set
to be one of the key challenges as it enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, the 158-page draft Treaty, prepared by the EU Dutch
presidency and due to be submitted to EU Heads of State and
Government, seems to have dashed the high hopes expressed earlier
on in the Treaty renegotiating process.
</P>
<P>
The text is the culmination of 15 months of negotiations,
formally dubbed the Inter-governmental Conference, aimed at
streamlining EU decision-making ahead of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
On the most controversial subjects, such as institutional
reforms, the draft Treaty fails to inspire universal support.
</P>
<P>
In the intense bargaining which can be expected at Amsterdam,
some of the proposed reforms may be watered down to allow all the
EU leaders to emerge as political victors.
</P>
<P>
Before being able to adopt them, they will have to strike a
deal on a new economic and social dimension to the pact on
stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
The draft text has a long, new chapter on employment, largely
to allay fears by the new French government that the strict budget
rules set out in the pact will undermine the bloc's efforts to
fight unemployment, which currently affects one in nine EU
citizen.
</P>
<P>
Although almost all EU leaders are fairly optimistic that the
new Treaty would be signed on Tuesday, they are nontheless facing
difficult negotiations on several issues, including these:
</P>
<P>
Institutions. Britain, France and Germany want to enhance their
influence within the Union, but the Dutch draft treaty more or
less puts off any reform to the EU and its institutions until the
next wave of enlargement. Bowing to the pressure of small states.
</P>
<P>
Employment. The EU leaders are expected to finalize the
drafting of a Title on Employment, one of the big innovations of
the new treaty. It will attach the same importance and procedures
to job-creation efforts as the Maastricht treaty gave to the
single-currency deficit and inflation criteria. But the text has
been amended and made more precise to allay german fears of having
to dip into the Community budget to fund job boosting measures.
</P>
<P>
Foreign policy. Six countries - France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Italy and Spain - have called for the incorporation
into the Treaty of the objective of an eventual merger of the
European defense club the Western Union into the EU and the
introduction of a Protocol defining the stages of and strategy for
this merger. Britain, supported by the "neutral" member states, is
opposed to the idea. The Dutch text merely alluded to the draft
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Interior policies. The new text makes it virtually impossible
in the future for qualified majority decisions to be taken to
determine a common immigration policy and the conditions for
crossing the EU's external borders. The measures, which allow
Britain and Ireland to continue border checks, provides little
hope for any change in the reform of the EU's Third Pillar, which
focuses on cooperation on justice and home affairs.

<HEADLINE> Demobilised Boy Soldiers Demonstrate in Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 demobilised boy
soldiers demonstrated at the headquarters of the Children
Assosciated with the War (CAW) Program in Freetown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, aged between 11 and 19, carried banners
with the inscription "We Need More Support Not Closure of the
Program" and "CAW Officials Are Not Giving Us Our Due".
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators threatened to burn down the three-storeyed
building but were restrained by security guards.
</P>
<P>
According to 16-year-old Morie Raogers, head of the
demonstrators#,food and other basic amenities have not been
supplied to them for six weeks now.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to demonstrate when we heard that the program was
going to close", he added.
</P>
<P>
Another demonstrator, Salieu Murray, who became a boy soldier
for the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) at the age of
seven in 1992, said the CAW program "completely rehabitalitated"
him.
</P>
<P>
"Now they want to leave us in the cold and just close down
like that, we need more information", he added.
</P>
<P>
A CAW senior official dismissed the claim of closure as
"baseless".
</P>
<P>
"We've been having problems of funding for the past month and
it has been worsened by the May 25 coup. Everything will be
sorted out soon and the boys will be happy once more", she added.
</P>
<P>
CAW was established four years ago by UNICEF to provide some
social needs including education for former child combatants who
had fought alongside government troops or rebels between 1991 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
According to UN statistics, in 1993 an estimated 2,000
children associated with the military in Sierra Leone were later
demobilised after the country signed the Rights of the Child
Convention in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"1,000 children fought with the RUF and it was extremely
difficult to demobilise them as the rebel organisation was
extremely hostile to our program", a UNICEF official told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Waigel: No Tax Increases in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Under huge pressure from within the
German governing coalition, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today clearly indicated that there will be no tax increases to
finance the German government budget in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Under current circumstances tax increases are difficult to
realize and hardly desirable," said Waigel in the southern German
resort of Bad Woerishofen.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, who has been declining to totally rule out the
possibility of tax increases so far, was also quoted by German
media as saying on Saturday that tax hikes would not be
politically realizable and would also be unfavorable for the
German economy.
</P>
<P>
With these remarks, Waigel has apparently gave in to the strong
opposition from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior
partner in the Bonn ruling coalition, which has categorically
rejected tax increases as measures to finance budget.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently struggling with serious financial plight
against the backdrop of nearly record unemployment and an expected
18 billion German mark (about 10.6 billion U.S. dollar) shortfall
in the tax revenues for 1997.
</P>
<P>
To plug the huge budget hole and to help the country to meet
the strict qualification requirements for the planned single
European currency, Waigel had originally proposed to revalue
upwards the central bank's gold and foreign currency reserves, but
had to retreat from the plan eventually under strong protests from
the central bank and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to tax increases, Waigel said Sunday that the
government would have to consider further cuts in public spendings
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Welcomes Return of Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir said here today that his government welcomed the return
of all opponents from abroad provided they commit themselves to
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir made the remarks during his meeting with Sharif Zein
al-Abdeen Hindi, secretary general of the banned National
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Hindi returned to Sudan last week from Damascus, Syria, after
eight years in exile, in a bid to try to bridge the gap between
the Islamic government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hindi, one of the first government opponents to return to
Sudan, told reporters after the meeting that he discussed with
Al-Bashir "the Shura" (advisory) issue and how to reach a way for
peaceful power exchange in the country as well as the proper way
of introducing democracy to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He added that his initiative is to allow all political forces
to express their views openly on all the national issues.
</P>
<P>
He is going to hold popular rallies over the coming days
in order to "enlarge the circle of dialogue and launch the
initiative of national dialogue among all the walks of life in
Sudan," he said.

<HEADLINE> Religious Group in S. Leone Denounces Coupists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Inter Religious Council
(IRC) in Sierra Leone, an umbrella group of Moslems,
Christians and traditional leaders, today denounced the military
junta of the May 25 coup that toppled the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
An IRC spokesman said that many attempts had proved abortive
since May 27 to discuss the current state of insecurity in the
country, with Major Johnny Koroma, leader of the junta Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC).
</P>
<P>
"As we call on the AFRC to hand over power to the ousted
civilian government of Tejan Kabbah, we are also ready to assist
in facilitating any form of negotiated settlement to end the
present impasse," the IRC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the international community "to continue its
search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict," according to a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, a letter from the IRC was sent to all churches and
mosques in the capital Freetown, criticizing the coup and calling
for the restoration of the ousted civilian government.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the letter received a mixed response
as some Christians and Moslems urged the IRC "to pressurize the
junta into bowing out of office without precondition."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling AFRC warned what it called "some ill
disposed persons to stop intimidating and harassing relatives and
friends of former politicians and religious leaders."
</P>
<P>
In a released broadcast on the state radio, the junta stressed
that "the revolution (referring to the May 25 coup) is not out to
witchhunt anybody. All those engaged in such actions should stop
it immediately."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a local independent FM station reported that
the Roman Catholic Archbishop, Joseph Ganda, had fled to country,
but this was denied on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stable as a Financial Center, Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong should be able to
maintain it's role as the financial center of Asia, according to
an expert familiar with Asia business.
</P>
<P>
Eliot R. Clauss, President of the U.S.-China Chamber of
Commerce (USCCC), said during a recent interview with Xinhua that
Hong Kong should be able to maintain such a role in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Prior to China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, the region's economy was listed as among the most
competitive in the world by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum,
as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clauss, who travels frequently to the Chinese mainland and
Hong Kong, opined the openness and well established financial
system of Hong Kong business environment will continue to attract
numerous foreign investments after July 1.
</P>
<P>
The USCCC was found in New York in 1993 by a group of Chinese
and American entrepreneurs who are enthusiastic to promote
U.S.-China business relationship. The USCCC's Chairman is former
U.S. President George Bush's elder brother, Prescott S. Bush, Jr.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clauss commented that the prime geographic location,
well-established financial systems, open securities policy and a
comprehensive legal system -- all these elements contributed to
Hong Kong's remarkable achievement today.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there is a saying that Shanghai will be a
substitute for Hong Kong as the Asia financial center -- many
westerners acknowledge this supposition. Mr. Clauss said Shanghai
is indeed developing rapidly, particularly it is amazing to see
the development in the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said historically Shanghai was a very important
business center. Following decades of development, it has
developed to have many of the conditions that are required to
transform itself as the Asia financial center. If Shanghai can
provide a stable and friendly legal system for foreign investors
and a highly efficient investment environment, there is a
possibility that Shanghai will surpass Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stable as a Financial Center, Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Mr. Clauss also said that there is still room for
improvement and development of Shanghai. For instance, he noted,
the Shanghai Stock Exchange is only beginning to establish its
system and policy. Comparing it with the New York and Hong Kong
stock exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is like a teenager
who has just started to reach out. An example to illustrate this
procedure would be similar to training a professional athlete, he
said, it requires tremendous amount of training and proper
training strategies, more importantly, it takes time. The result
simply cannot be achieved in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
While it is clearly difficult to predict the long term outcome,
Mr. Clauss said he believes that for the next five to ten years at
least, Hong Kong will retain its status as the financial center of
Asia. Among the reasons for this is simply that western business
is accustomed to and familiar with doing business there.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, if Shanghai continues to develop in ways
attractive to western business, more companies may be attracted to
Shanghai. Given the extensive development of Shanghai and the
surrounding region, and the many industrial companies in the
region, Shanghai is likely to continue to attract western
investment and trade. This will be especially true if the
financial and service sector, including the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, become more open to foreign investment. The more the
financial and service sectors operate consistent with
international standards, the more attractive Shanghai will be to
western business, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clauss commented that generally investors are attracted to
developing markets, especially if the infrastructure and legal
system are well developed. The price of real estate -- for
offices, factories and housing -- the price of labor and the
quality of the labor force, the ease of transportation and
communications, the free flow of information, the openness of the
banking system, the tax rates and the level of government
oversight and regulation, are all factors that western investors
will consider when choosing between Shanghai and Hong Kong as a
place to do business.
</P>
<P>
As most people have an optimistic outlook for Hong Kong, it is
likely to remain an important financial and commercial center,
according to Mr. Clauss. He said he believes that the questions of
whether Hong Kong can sustain its role as an international
financial center after the handover, and whether Shanghai or some
other city ultimately replace Hong Kong as the financial center of
Asia, are questions that can be -- and will be -- answered only by
the marketplace.

PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- France today again denied a report
by a Taiwan newspaper that a French company is selling 2,000
anti-tank missiles to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry said that France
sticks to the 1994 Sino-French Joint Communique, in which Paris
promised not to sell any more armaments to Taiwan from then on.
</P>
<P>
"The policy (of France) is defined by the Franco-Chinese
agreement of 1994," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France denied on Wednesday another report by the same Taiwan
newspaper, the China Times, that the Socialist government of
France was considering selling 60 Mirage 2000-5 combat aircraft to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A former Socialist government of France sold 60 Mirage 2000-5
fighters to Taiwan in 1993, an action which greatly harmed the
Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
When President Jacques Chirac visited China in May, the French
government reaffirmed its commitment not to sell armaments to
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Election Campaign to Kick off in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The 11 Liberian presidential candidates
will kick off their election campaign on Monday, as an internationally
monitered peace process is coming to its final stage.
</P>
<P>
The election on July 19 will lead to the final end of a civil war
that has killed more than 200,000 people and left more others homelss
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The last election that was held in this west African country was in
1985, when Samuel Doe was elected as the president. The civil war
broke out four years later, when Charles Taylor launched his attack on
the government army on the eve of the 1989 Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The coming election will be a culmination of the revised Abuja peace
accord signed by the warring factions in August 1996, which is the
13th peace pact reached by the factions in the seven-year war.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, now as the leader of the National Patriotic Party,
will be one of the key players in the race for presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I am the only strong person to lead this country following seven
years of war," he told reporters at a recent rally.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is campaigning on a ticket of national unity and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Two other major warlords, Alhaji Kromah and George Boley are also
in the race, as the leader of the All Liberia Coalition Party and the
National Democratic Party, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kromah's platform stresses the importance of international and
regional security in exploiting natural resources and promoting
economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Contesting against the former warlords is the Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf, the only woman candidate. She was a former
minister and until recently a senior official at the United
Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Johnson-Sirleaf represents the Unity Party and enjoys the backing
of the True Whig Party, which ruled Liberia for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
Cletus Wotorson, a former minister, runs for the Liberia
Unification Party and the Liberia Action Party.
</P>
<P>
Former chief justice Chea Cheapoo and former Vice-President Harry
Moniba represent the Progressive People's Party and Liberia National
Union, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Observers said they would dwell on respect for the rule of law and
human rights, as well as the need to eliminate corruption in
government.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include Gabriel Baccus Matthews of the United
People's Party, Togba Nah-Tipoteh of the Liberian People's Party and
Boima Fahnbulleh of the Reformation Alliance Party.
</P>
<P>
They have described themselves as "progressives into whose hands
the governance of Liberia must fall at this time".
</P>
<P>
As candidates are druming up their campaigns, preparations for the
election are said to be poor. Voters' education has not begun even in
the capital Monrovia, and polling centers have yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the electoral commission has not got enough money
to do its work, according to its chairman, Henry Andrews.
</P>
<P>
In late May, the Liberian election, originally set for May
30, was shifted to July 19, because the candidates dared not
to go out of Monrovia on their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Victor Malu, the commander of the west African
peace-keeping force in Liberia has assurred them time and again that
security is now guaranteed for the election.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Americans Softening on Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Most Americans have regular
contact with new immigrants and are more accepting of them than a
few years ago, a poll released Sunday indicates.
</P>
<P>
Most of those surveyed said immigration has had little effect
on them or their communities, according to the national survey by
Knight-Ridder Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,314 whites, blacks and Hispanics, all citizens or
residents of the United States since at least 1980, was conducted
for Knight-Ridder by Princeton Survey Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of those polled said recent immigrants have
had a positive impact on the nation, 42 percent said immigrants
harm the nation as a whole, and 10 percent said the effects are
mixed.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows a drop in anti-immigration sentiment from the
pattern of 1993-1995 when 60 percent of Americans told pollsters
that the influx of foreigners was bad for the country and should
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
More than nine of 10 of those in the Knight-Ridder survey said
they regularly have contact with new immigrants, mostly as they
work or shop in places where immigrants work.
</P>
<P>
People who saw problems they traced to new immigrants rarely
cited them in their own neighborhoods. One in three of those
polled thought immigration creates big problems for the country,
but only one in 10 saw such problems in his own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The interviews were conducted from May 2 through May 26. The
margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Report: Father of Father's Day Initiator Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The National Center for
Fathering is recognizing the woman credited with initiating
Father's Day more than 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Kansas-based organization is honoring the late Sonora Smart
Dodd today by inducting her father, a Civil War veteran, into its
Fathering Hall of Fame, The United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Dodd was attending one of the first Mother's Day celebrations
in 1912 when she hit on the idea of Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
Her mother had died in childbirth, leaving her father, William
Jackson Smart, to raise his daughter by himself. Dodd thought a
national Father's Day would be a good way to honor his dedication
and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Mother's Day as an annual
observance in 1915. But despite Dodd's efforts, fathers didn't
get their due until 1972, when Father's Day was officially
sanctioned by President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old National Center for Fathering established
its Hall of Fame last year. Although the group's honor roll
currently exists only on the Internet, organizers hope to build a
physical home eventually.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Peter Spokes says fathers can be nominated to the
Hall of Fame by their children or relatives, or they may be voted
in by the group's Board of Directors. In addition, the
organization is co-sponsoring Father of the Year contests around
the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Start Tough Talks on New Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
started talks today at their two-day summit in Amsterdam to try to
reach an agreement on a new EU treaty that is supposed to prepare
the 15-nation bloc for the next century.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government almost immediately agreed
that an employment chapter should be incorporated into the new
treaty, making job creation a priority on EU's agenda, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
"(It) strikes a fair balance between efficient cooperation and
the realization that principal responsibility for employment rests
with member states," British Prime Minister Tony Blair was quoted
by an aide as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meeting at their twice-yearly meeting, the leaders are expected
to work on a draft treaty prepared by the Netherlands, the current
EU president, and then announce their agreement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the draft treaty, a result of 15 months' tough
negotiations, still has a string of opt-outs and protocols.
</P>
<P>
Despite the eagerness of Britain, France and Germany to enhance
their influence within the union, the draft treaty, bowing to the
pressure of small states, virtually puts off any reform of the EU
and its institutions until the next wave of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign policy issue, the draft merely alludes to a
draft protocol on a future merger between the EU and the Western
Union, the European defense club.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and Spain have
called for the merger program to be included in the Treaty and
wanted a protocol mapping out the strategy and steps of the
merger. But Britain, supported by the "neutral" member states, is
opposed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
The draft also makes it virtually impossible in the future that
the EU members decide on a common immigration policy or a border
issue by qualified majority.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which allows Britain and Ireland to continue border
checks, is seen as a lack of progress in furthering the
cooperation among member states on judicial and home affairs.

<HEADLINE> Maskhadov Launches Operation Against Crime in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
today decided to resume the Shield of Law operation against crime
in Chechnya, according to a report from it capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 men from all the law enforcement structures of
Chechnya were taking part in the operation, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted Chechen Interior Minister Kazbek Makhashev as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken, the minister said, to put an end to
the kidnapping of people, drug addiction, unlawful seizure of
housing facilities, and to enforce law and order in the petroleum
industry of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another operation named Hostages, was also launched
Sunday night. It is being carried out by a 300-man special team,
Makhashev said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Shield of Law operation, six hostages were
released from captivity today in Chechnya. The operation was
conducted by a group of the anti-terrorist center.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Maskhadov promised to "deal surprise and
lightning-fast strikes" in his crackdown on crime in Chechnya,
when the Russian Federation and the breakaway republic discussed
economic cooperation, including the transfer of Azerbaijiani
Caspian Sea of oil through Chechnya.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Advanced Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. of Shanghai, a Sino-foreign venture, today was
given the international certification of QS 9000, and is believed
to be the first hi-tech company in China to get the accreditation
for its high-grade products.
</P>
<P>
QS 9000, which is a quality standard jointly issued by three
US-based big-name automobile manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors, has higher qualification requirements than the
standard ISO 9000.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation is expected to help satisfy overseas
customers with products made in China with Chinese parts, and also
is expected to help the company increase its exports to overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 200 million US dollars, the company, jointly
operated by China, Holland, and Canada, now has two integrated
circuit chip production lines, to produce 17,000 five-inch chips
and 15,000 six-inch chips per month.

<HEADLINE> EU to Decide Soon on Re-Importing East African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is expected to
announce by July 1 whether its 15 member countries will import
fish from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the East African newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed a temporary ban on fish imports from the three
eastern African countries on suspicion that their fish goods
contained the killer salmonella bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the largest market for eastern African fish and the
demand has grown following the scare caused by so-called mad cow
disease, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which share Lake Victoria, the second
largest fresh water lake in the world and rich in popular
Nile perch, have the potential to meet a large part of Europe's
demand for fish.
</P>
<P>
A EU experts team inspected all fish factories, the hygiene
of fishing vessels, as well as the loading, transportation and
refrigeration of fish for export in the region last month.
</P>
<P>
The team also evaluated the capacity of local authorities on
fish to ensure that international standards are met and
maintained, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Countries which fail the test will be given a chance to
improve on the quality of their products and undergo another
inspection, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests made in Spain and Italy last year on samples
of frozen octopus imported from eastern Africa indicated that the
fish were contaminated with salmonella bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The two countries called for a total ban on fish from Kenya
and Uganda in 1996 but were persuaded by other EU members to wait
until a common standard could be worked out for all EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has 35 registered fish processing firms and earned 47
million Shillings (840,000 U.S. Dollars) from fishing industry
last year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania exported 5,385 tons of frozen fish fillet of Nile
perch during the same period, fetching 12.6 million Dollars. The
exports of marine products account for 4.3 percent of the
country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has nine fish processing plants which produce up to
220,000 tons of fresh water fish worth some 110 million Dollars a
year and employs about 60,000 people directly and more than
500,000 indirectly. enditem

<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa has decided
that all existing members of the Urban Council, the Regional
Council and the 18 District Boards will continue to serve on the
Provincial Urban Council, the Provisional Regional Council and the
Provisional District Boards respectively.
</P>
<P>
When announcing this here today, a spokesman of the Chief
Executive Office said the Urban (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the
Regional Council (Amendment) Bill 1997 stated that the Provisional
Urban Council and the Provisional Regional Council would each have
no more than 50 members.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, no more than nine and no more than 11 additional
members can be appointed to the Provisional Urban Council and the
Provisional Regional Council respectively.
</P>
<P>
And the District Boards (Amendment) Bill 1997 stated that the
18 Provisional District Boards would each have no more than 40
members, and, therefore, the additional appointments to each
Provisional District Board vary from three to eight, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Council (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Regional
Council (Amendment) Bill 1997 had their third readings by the
Provisional Legislative Council on June 7. They will be enacted
when the Chief Executive gives his assent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
These persons were drawn from different professions and sectors
of the community, and were selected on their merits, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that, with their expertise and experience,
these people will be able to contribute meaningfully to the work
of the two provisional councils and the Provisional District
Boards," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Expects Five Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy is to grow by
five percent this year despite the lower-than-expected
agricultural output and an upward trend in lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said in
its latest quarterly economic and statistical review today that
agriculture, manufacturing and mining will contribute to the five
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, despite the downward revision in output growth due to
excessive rains that affected crop yields in some areas, is expected
to grow by four percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
''With output from most crops expected to exceed the 1996 levels,
agriculture is estimated to contribute 22 percent to overall GDP,''
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, largely benefiting from agriculture, is expected to
grow by seven percent and contribute 20 percent to GDP, while mining
production which fell 0.2 percent last year due to a fall in metal
prices is expected to grow by eight percent and contribute 6.5
percent to GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank had also predicated its estimates on the
positive impact of reduced bank lending rates from 28-32 percent
range to 25-26 percent, which were expected to provide relief to
companies constrained by the high cost of borrowing.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Plans to Build Dam Over Ganges River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to build a barrage over the Ganges to ensure integrated
development of water resources in the river's basin within
Bangladesh, according to Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak.
</P>
<P>
The dam would help provide safety to 40 million people in
south-west Bangladesh and the Sundarbans, the largest natural
mangrove forest in the world, Razzak told a workshop here today.
</P>
<P>
Under a 30-year Ganges water sharing treaty signed in New Delhi
last December, Bangladesh is assured of getting half of the Ganges
river flow. The treaty paved the way for constructing a barrage
over the common river between Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
Razzak said foreign development partners had already shown
interest in conducting feasibility and detailed engineering
studies for the Ganges barrage.
</P>
<P>
He said both Bangladesh and India had been monitoring the
implementation of the treaty since its signing and that
transparency for it would be created.
</P>
<P>
Razzak said the Joint River Commission has also been
reactivated to deal with unresolved issues of sharing the water of
53 other common rivers between Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
The commission would help find out a solution to the problem of
water sharing of the Teesta and other rivers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Visits Kyrkyzstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BESHKENT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, who arrived here today for a five-day visit, held talks
with his Kyrkyz counterpart Myrzakan Subanov on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two men believed in their talks that bilateral cooperation
in political, economic and military fields is not only in the
interests of the two countries but also conducive to regional and
global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Subanov said that developing relations with China is a top
priority of his country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military confidence building treaty and the
troop reduction agreement signed by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrkyzstan,
Russia and Tajikistan in the past two years have laid a solid
foundation for his country to develop relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Chi said China highly values its relations with Kyrkyzstan and
appreciates Kyrkyzstan's stance on Taiwan, Tibet and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Describing the allegation of so-called "China threat" as
groundless, Chi said that China's defense policy is purely
defensive.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will never seek hegemony, nor will it
join any military blocs or establish any overseas military bases.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese general is on the last leg of his four-nation tour
of the former Soviet republics. He had visited Belarus, Ukraine
and Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Rebels' Ambush in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and five
others wounded early this morning when a band of Philippine
leftist rebels ambushed a group of government soldiers along a
highway in the central Philippines, a senior military officer
said.
</P>
<P>
Col. Marcial Collao, commander of the Philippine Army 203rd
Brigade, said about 30 members of the rebel New People's Army
(NPA) ambushed the soldiers of the Army's 76th Infantry Battalion
riding a jeep on a highway in Camarines Norte province.
</P>
<P>
Among the killed were two soldiers and two civilians riding in
a private vehicle caught in the heavy gunfire, he said. An NPA
member was also killed.
</P>
<P>
Traffic went to a standstill along the national highway due to
the incident, stalling hundreds of vehicles for more than three
hours in both directions.
</P>
<P>
Collao said he had ordered a pursuit operation against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The NPA, the military wing of the leftist National Democratic
Front (NDF), has fought the government forces since its creation
in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF's insurgency reached its peak in the early 1980s, with
the NPA's membership expanding to over 10,000 and its operation
covering the entire country.
</P>
<P>
But the NPA's strength was greatly weakened in the early 1990s
after the government launched an all-out war against it.
</P>
<P>
Due to differences over peace talks with the government, the
NPA has been fragmented in recent years.

thus lifting one burden from the embattled government.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan gathered the

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Continue Wood Imports: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will continue to be
a heavy importer of logs and lumber in the next five to 10 years
as wood consumption is growing at a rate of 2.0 percent annually,
the Forestry Management Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Forestry Management Bureau director Jose
Malvas said the country's current wood consumption is more than
2.0 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 2.4 percent annual population growth, the annual
growth in the consumption of wood would be ranging between 2 to
2.2 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, the Philippines has to import at least 700,000
cubic meters valued at around 3.5 billion pesos (132 million U.S.
dollars) based on the prevailing world market price of about 5,000
pesos (188 dollars) per cubic meter, he said.
</P>
<P>
The planned wood imports this year are about 10 percent higher
than last year, due to the growing demand of the construction and
real estate development industries.
</P>
<P>
Malvas said the Philippines will source a big bulk of its wood
import requirements from Malaysia, with the rest to be obtained
from Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Brazil and Gabon.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan-Russian Trade Shoots Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The two-way trade between Kenya
and Russia will shoot up by 50 percent this year following steady
growth over recent years, a senior Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Rybakov, the head of the Trade Representation of Russia
in Kenya, predicted that more than 70 Russian businessmen are to
meet their eastern African counterparts on exploring mutual trade
and investment opportunities here Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-Russian direct trade reached at least 3.5 million
U.S. dollars last year, 3.1 million of them flowing from Russia to
the eastern African country, he told Xinhua in an exclusive
interview.
</P>
<P>
But according to Kenya's official data, the 1996 trade volume
between the two sides hit 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya's share in its two-way trade with Russia is
quite small, it is getting more and more money from Russia by
exporting tea, flowers and life animals.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been gaining strong foothold on Russian flower
market and become the leading supplier of carnations and roses to
Moscow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's major exports to Kenya include steel products,
medical equipment, cars and solar panels, said Rybakov.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador Boris Maiorski has also expressed
optimism about the Russian-Kenyan trade growth, saying that a
great potential still exists to be tapped to enhance the trade
relations between them.
</P>
<P>
Food stuff, including tea and coffee, account for nearly 30
percent of Russian imports, while Russia exports large quantities
of machinery and chemicals to Kenya, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Maiorski said some constraints, such as the absence
of necessary bank crediting and direct shipping links, as well as
the higher prices of Kenyan tea, coffee and sisal than other
countries, have hampered the mutual trade between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Russia signed two trade agreements with Kenya in 1964 and
1983 respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Has 4,500 Post-doctorate Research Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,500 post-doctorate
research positions are currently offered in China, and in the past
two years, a total of 6,540 scholars have filled the posts to
conduct various projects, according to Zhuang Yi, director of the
Department of Experts with Ministry of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day national meeting which opened here today, Zhuang
said that 4,000-5,000 scholars apply each year for post-doctorate
study, accounting for 40-50 percent of the total graduates per
year. Some 1,400 applicants pass the appraisal every year, and the
number is expected to grow by 15-20 percent annually in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
China formed the post-doctorate study program in July of 1985, with
approval of the State Council, the country's highest governing
body. The central and local governments have invested a total of
300 million yuan to aid the scientific study and living costs of
the students.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that every post-doctorate student undertakes
two to three important projects during their course of study, and
40 percent of the total projects become key state-level works.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in early 1994, China's major state enterprises have
been involved in the training of post-doctorate students. A total
of nine research positions have been set up in key enterprises
such as Baoshan Iron and Steel (Group) Company and Daqing
Oilfield. Zhang revealed that more leading businesses have been
given the official go-ahead to enroll scholars this year.

<HEADLINE> a Great Creation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The concept of "one country, two
systems" is a great creation which has reflected the strategic
boldness of vision of the Chinese leadership represented by Deng
Xiaoping and others. With Hong Kong's return to China just around
the corner, the practice of this principle in Hong Kong will soon
come into reality.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems", as explained by Deng Xiaoping,
means that within the People's Republic of China, the 1.2 billion
people living on the mainland will practice the socialist system,
while Hong Kong and Taiwan can retain their current capitalist
system.
</P>
<P>
The idea of "one country, two systems" was first set forth for
the solution of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
In as early as the 1950s, the Chinese government considered to
solve the Taiwan question by peaceful means. In May 1955, the late
premier Zhou Enlai told a meeting of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) that there were two possible ways
for the Chinese people to settle the Taiwan question: war or
peaceful reunification. And he pointed out that the Chinese
people, if possible, were willing to seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
In April 1956, the late chairman Mao Zedong once again put
forth the ideas that "peacefulness is precious", and that "all
people loving the country belong to one family". Due to factors
like the interference of certain foreign forces, however, these
ideas failed to be put into practice at that time.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the 1970s, a number of significant changes
occurred in both the global and domestic situation. China and the
United States established diplomatic relations. The Communist
Party of China convened the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
Committee, which decided to shift the focus of work of the party
and the state to economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the NPC Standing Committee published
on January 1, 1979 a "letter to the Taiwan compatriots", in which
the principle of peaceful reunification of the motherland was
announced.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the National Day of 1981, Ye Jianying, then
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made a nine-point
declaration, which stated that after the national reunification,
Taiwan could become a special administrative region with a high
degree of autonomy. Taiwan can preserve its army, and its current
social and economic systems, way of life and economic and cultural
ties with foreign countries can remain unchanged. The declaration
contained the essence of the "one country, two systems" idea.
</P>
<P>
In September 1982, at a meeting with visiting British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in Beijing, Deng Xiaoping explicitly
put forth the concept of "one country, two systems", noting that
the concept could be applied in the resolution of the Hong Kong
question.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this concept, the Chinese government started to
formulate its basic principles and policies for Hong Kong. The
concept was first affirmed and reflected in the revised
"Constitution of the People's Republic of China", which was
adopted at the Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC in December 1982.
</P>
<P>
The premise for the concept of "one country, two systems" is
"one country", that is, the resolution of the question of national
sovereignty and reunification. "Two systems" means that within the
People's Republic of China two different social systems,
socialist and capitalist, can coexist.
</P>
<P>
"Two systems" doesn't mean that there will be two political
entities antagonistic and repellent to each other. The socialist
system practiced in the interior areas is the mainstay, and the
two systems can promote each other for common development. This is
unprecedented in both the Chinese and the world history.
</P>
<P>
It was then written into the report on the work of the
government presented by the State Council on May 15, 1984 to the
Second Session of the Sixth NPC for examination and approval. The
session finally endorsed the concept, which helped lay down the
legal foundation for the signing of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, and for the enactment of
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Hence, China's basic policy to resolve the Hong Kong question
through "one country, two systems". It is in the fundamental
interest of China to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability through the practice of "one country, two systems".

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past years, Hong Kong has always played the role of a
"window" for the reform and opening up drive in the interior
areas, and of a bridge linking China to the outside world. With
the further expansion of the opening of the interior areas, this
kind of role will be continuously enhanced instead of
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
How will the concept of "one country, two systems" be put into
practice in Hong Kong?
</P>
<P>
From the political perspective, the HKSAR will carry out the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high
degree of autonomy in accordance with the Basic Law, and the
existing capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong will
remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR enjoys executive power, legislative power,
independent judicial power and power of final adjudication, while
the Central People's Government will only be in charge of HK's
defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
From the economic perspective, the HKSAR will maintain the
capitalist economic and trade systems originally practiced in Hong
Kong, as well as its status as a free port. It can continue with
its free trade policy, and guarantee the free flow of goods,
intangible assets and capital.
</P>
<P>
As a separate customs territory, the HKSAR may, using the name
"Hong Kong, China", participate in relevant international
organizations and trade agreements, including preferential trade
arrangements. It can also maintain its current status as an
international financial center, with all existing monetary and
financial systems preserved.
</P>
<P>
All these special principles and policies the Chinese
government adopted for Hong Kong derived from the "one country,
two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
They not only have paved the way for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and brilliant future, but also will exert significant
influence on Macao's smooth return to China and the final
settlement of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 'one country, two systems" concept and its
practice will also provide new enlightenment for other countries
in the world in solving problems left over by history.

<P>
SHENZHEN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The flourishing city of Sanming
in southeast China's Fujian Province has succeeded in attracting
173 million US dollars of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
At a business fair held today in Shenzhen, one of China's
special economic zones, overseas investors signed contracts to
fund 65 projects in the city, located in northwest Fujian.

France, and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions. The projects are related
to industry, agriculture, energy, transport, real estate and
tourism, according to Mayor of Sanming city.
</P>
<P>
The biggest project is a thermal power plant involving an
investment of 56.7 million US dollars from a Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the local GDP of Sanming, which has a population of
2.58 million, reached 20.074 billion yuan (about 2.42 billion US

<HEADLINE> ROK Involves in Shanghai's Mobile Telecom Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. from
the Republic of Korea (ROK) today signed a contract with Shanghai
Great Wall Mobile Communication Co. Ltd. to jointly develop a new
commercial mobile telecom network in Shanghai, China's economic
and financial center.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to create a new digital mobile telecom
system based on the technical standard called coded division
multi-addresses (CDMA).
</P>
<P>
Telecom experts said that the new system could ensure clear
sound quality similar to that of wired telephones. And compared
with the analogue mobile telecom network of the same capacity, the
CDMA nets require fewer base stations to cover the same area, thus
reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the first-phase of construction will
include one main switch and 67 base stations which can cover all
of Shanghai. Upon completion early next year, the net can provide
service for 60,000 users.

NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market lost 4.58 points to 4025.41
today as against last Friday's close of 4029.99.

The National Index also eased by 1.44 points to 1725.27 from

The BSE Sensitive Index started better at 4043.2 and shot up to
the intra-day high of 4076.56. However, heavy selling pressure
forced the index to fall to 4006.8 before closing at 4025.41.
</P>
<P>
A sharp decline in the shares of ITC held back the continued
surge in the Sensitive Index in spite of further upswings in some
other front-line scrip on the BSE market today in the wake of
panic selling by local operators and profit-taking by financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Financial Reform Faces Strong Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
announced a financial reform package, which has sparked strong
opposition from the affected financial institutions, including the
Bank of Korea (BOK).
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the reform package is to unify the three
existing banking, securities and insurance supervisory bodies into
a single powerful agency, the "Financial Supervisory Board (FSB)."
</P>
<P>
In the reform, the BOK will be left mainly responsible for the
country's monetary and credit control, with its supervisory
authority over the banks going to the FBS.
</P>
<P>
The BOK had argued that it needs to retain some of its bank
supervisory authority to ensure the effectiveness in formulating
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the reform package has also angered the trade
unions because the new supervisory board's replacement of the Bank
Supervision Board (BSB), the Security Supervisory Board (SSB) and
the Insurance Supervisory Board (ISB) is likely to result in major
job losses.
</P>
<P>
BOK's labor union announced today that it will call a strike
and demand Governor Lee Kyong-shik to step down for "selling the
central bank."
</P>
<P>
BOK union said it will join hands with the unions of the three
supervisory boards and will hold a joint press conference Tuesday
to announce their future actions.
</P>
<P>
The SSB and the ISB officials also strongly oppose the creation
of the single supervisory body, charging that the measure has
completely ignored the special nature of the relevant industries.
</P>
<P>
The SSB argues that supervision is just one of its many
functions and that the merger of supervisory powers will just
create confusion and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
The ISS holds a similar position, saying that the insurance
sector, unlike other financial industries, has a greater role in
social welfare than in financial functions.
</P>
<P>
The ball is now in the court of the lawmakers as the government
will submit a legislation on the reform package to the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But observers here predict that with the presidential election
coming up at the end of this year, both the ruling and opposition
parties are most likely to hesitate in passing such a
controversial and unpopular bill.

LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Northern Ireland policemen were
killed early today in the town of Lurgan, 35 kilometers south of
Belfast, and the Irish Republic Army (IRA) has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted police sources as saying that the two police
officers were on foot patrol when they were shot in the heads at
close range at 11:00 GMT. Security forces have sealed off the
ambush area.
</P>
<P>
IRA has been fighting for the end of British rule on Northern
Ireland over the past 28 years and more than 3,000 people died as
a result of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Northern Ireland has been tense since the IRA
resumed military attacks on security forces there after quitting a
ceasefire in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is widely feared that today's murder would cast a shadow on
the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party peace talks on Northern Ireland peace were
resumed on June 3, but the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein was
barred from the meeting because the IRA refused to agree on a
ceasefire with the government.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Business Confident of HK's Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian business circle
is confident of the future of Hong Kong after its return to China
on July 1, 1997, believing view that Hong Kong will continue to be
stable and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm belief that Hong Kong after its return to China
will continue to prosper and progress and will play a greater role
in promoting economic and trade cooperation between Malaysia and
China,"
President of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) Wee Boon Ping said in a recent
exclusive interview with Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
Wee noted that the position of Hong Kong as an international
financial and trade center would not be affected because of
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
rather it would be strengthened because of China's backing.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong would continue to prosper because it is the
wish of the Chinese government and people as well as the wish of
overseas Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Wee added that the ACCCIM, the top leading body of Chinese
businessmen in Malaysia with tens of thousands of members, will
continue to use Hong Kong as its business base for future business
expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a separate exclusive interview with Xinhua here recently,
President of the Sino-Malaysian Chambers of Commerce and Economy
Ngan Ching Wen said, "I am optimistic about the future of Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
With the policies laid down by the Chinese government to be
implemented in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong
Kong will "surely continue to remain prosperous and stable, to
display its economic vigor and to maintain its position as a world
economic center," Ngan said.
</P>
<P>
Yeoh Tiong Lay, another renowned businessman in Malaysia, also
expressed his belief that the future of Hong Kong after its return
to China would be better as it would have closer links with the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his confidence in Hong Kong's future, the executive
chairman of YTL Corporation Berhad (Limited) said in a recent
interview with Xinhua here that Hong Kong would be "more
prosperous" and would have a "better tomorrow" in view of its
closer links with the inland areas and the "one country, two
systems" administrative mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Yeoh said the fact that investors now return to Hong Kong for
investment shows that they are confident of the future of Hong
Kong and the upward trend on the Hong Kong stock market is also an
indicator that the Hong Kong people have confidence in the future
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
He said his corporation would continue to use Hong Kong as a
gateway to expand its business in China.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Apllied in World Youth Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Several new rules are
implemented at the Under-20 World Youth Soccer Championship in
Malaysia to open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
One of the rules, revised by the International Football
Federation (FIFA), means that goalkeepers at the tournament would
feel an unprecedented time pressure when handling the ball.
</P>
<P>
If a goalie stalls with the ball longer than five to six
seconds, an indirect free kick would be awarded to the opposing
side.
</P>
<P>
An indirect free kick will also be awarded if a goalkeeper
handles the ball directly from a throw-in by his own team.
</P>
<P>
Other rule changes include:
</P>
<P>
-- A goalkeeper is not allowed to move forwards before the
penalty kick but he could move sideways along his line.
</P>
<P>
-- Referees must strictly apply the four-step rule for
goalkeepers.
</P>
<P>
-- The ball is in play as soon as it moves from a kick-off or a
free kick.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA statement said the changes were agreed on at a meeting
in Belfast on March 1 and were designed to come into full force on
July 1. They would also take effect in any tournament beginning
before then and continuing beyond it.
</P>
<P>
The world youth tournament, which begins Monday and finishes
July 5, will be the first to apply the revised laws, FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four national sides are divided into six groups to
compete in the tournament.

CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Squash world champion Jansher Khan
said on Monday he would boycott the Pakistan Open in Karachi in
August unless the Pakistani federation attracted more publicity
about squash events played in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jansher said in Cairo, where he is competing in the al-Ahram

the best way to popularise the game in Pakistan, especially among
young people.
</P>
<P>
The world champion said the sport was gaining ground in Egypt
because of the media coverage of teenaged local hero Ahmed Barada,
now ranked fifth in the world and one of the semi-finalists in the
al-Ahram championship.
</P>
<P>
"I am the best in the world. Pakistan must take advantage of
that and until the (Pakistan Squash) Federation takes action in
the direction I will not play in another Pakistan Open," Jansher
added.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not do something now about promoting our success in
squash, Pakistan will lose the leadership of the game," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami today called for expansion of bilateral relations between
Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In separate cables to Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad
Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the 54-year-old
president-elect also urged its neighbor to promote bilateral
friendship.
</P>
<P>
In a message to President Leghari, Khatami expressed his
thanks for his message of felicitation and hoped that profound
religious and cultural ties between the two countries will grow
stronger in the future.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect also said that consolidation of the
relations between Tehran-Islamabad after the victory of the 1979
Iranian Islamic revolution has created a solid ground for
upgrading the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In response to Nawaz Sharif's message, Khatami expressed the
hope that the existing brotherly ties based on deep historical,
religious and cultural commonalities will be continued in the
future.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the official English daily Tehran
Times, in its editorial today on the imminent visit by Sharif to
Tehran, urged the Pakistani premier not to miss the opportunity to
remove misunderstanding between the two countries. But there is no
word on the specific date of his visit.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the commonalities calling for mutual cooperation,
the Afghan crisis has reportedly become the key of contention in
Tehran-Islamabad relations.
</P>
<P>
The daily concluded by saying that Sharif's visit to Tehran
is the best platform for both countries to remove
misunderstandings and reach a consensus on Afghanistan in order
to restore peace to the war-ravaged country.

(CP) Group, has expressed his confidence that Hong Kong will be
even better after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a historic change and
an unprecedented event, he said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
"All people of Chinese origin, including those living outside
China, are most happy to see this change take place."
</P>
<P>
he said he is confident of Hong Kong after its return to China,
adding that the return will also facilitate China's peaceful
unification.
</P>
<P>
He said the late Deng Xiaoping was highly admired for the "one
China, two systems" principle he had initiated.
</P>
<P>
The "one China, two systems" principle and the "no change in 50
years" policy are practical and appropriate for China's present
national conditions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the principle will also have a positive impact
on the people in Taiwan. If Hong Kong continues to develop and
prosper, those in Taiwan will not be able to find excuses for not
returning to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that after June 30, Hong Kong will remain his group's
financial base and the group will study how it can expand its
operation in Hong Kong in the future.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Airport Committee to Complete Work This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and British sides
agreed that the Sino-British Airport Committee is to complete its
work on June 30 after basically fulfilling its two tasks according
to the Memorandum of Understanding on the Construction of the Hong
Kong New airport and Related issues.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zhao Jihua, senior Chinese representative
on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, after the two sides
finished the final meeting before Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
As from July 1, 1997, the unfinished part of the construction
at the Hong Kong new airport will be a matter within the autonomy
of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that all projects can be completed on schedule,
with good quality and within the previously-set budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that experts on the Sino-British Airport
Committee visited the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and key projects
of the airport railway today and discussed matters on the
construction of the new airport after the visit.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the Chinese and British sides under the Airport
Committee have reached agreement on many important matters
concerning the Airport Core Program (ACP) such as the overall
financial plan for the airport, the two supporting financial
agreements, the Airport Authority Bill and the building of the
second runway at the new airport, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the seven key projects charged with
the Hong Kong Government and the Western Harbor Crossing will be
completed and put into operation before the end of this month. We
appreciate the hard work of all departments concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Davies, senior British representative on the JLA, said,
"Today's visit and the meeting exactly two weeks before the
handover, suitably concludes the work of the Airport Committee.
The progress we see today is evidence of the Hong Kong
Government's efforts including the management and the cost
control."
</P>
<P>
"Pushing ahead with the Airport Core Program from July 1 will
naturally be an internal matter of the SAR Government. We are
confident that the SAR Government will continue to do its best and
will be able to help see the ACP through to the successful
completion," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly weaker in range-bound trade in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
The Local unit finished at 75.17 U.S. cents after spending the
session in a narrow 75.08 to 75.18 band, compared with the 75.3
U.S. cents at Last Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
Traders said Australian dollar trading on the day was extremely
quiet.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, market participants continued to mull
over the likelihood of a cut in official short-term interest rates
in the near future after recent economic data showed that economic
growth is not picking up enough to wind back the unemployment
rate, which continues to stand at around 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia, which last cut interest rates on
May 23, is scheduled to hold its next policy making meeting on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
Su-Lin Ong, a fixed interest economist with Hambros Australia
Ltd., said the Australian dollar remains vulnerable to the Reserve
Bank's easing bias and is likely to test the 74.5 U.S. cent level
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 85.84 Japanese yen, down from
86.05 on Friday, and at 1.3072 Deutsche marks, up from 1.3017.

<HEADLINE> US to Continue Three "C" Policy in Kuwait, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 16 -- (Xinhua) -- The United Sates will
continue to implement its three "C" policy in the Gulf with
commitment to Kuwait security and duel containment of Iraq and
Iran, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at Kuwait Bayan Palace here
before leaving for the United Arab Emirates to continue his Gulf
tour, Cohen said that "to summarize the United States policy to
Kuwait into three words: commitment, cooperation and
containment,"
</P>
<P>
He said that "the commitment of the United States to Kuwait's
security is strong and enduring and we demonstrated that in 1991
and we demonstrate it every day."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that "cooperation between the U.S. and Kuwait shows
the depth of our commitment."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. stored equipment in Kuwait and had
been doing regular joint exercises and training of ground, air
and sea forces jointly with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "we are a global power and our ability to protect
our interests and our friends around the world is bolstered by
the active security partnership such as the one we have with
Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. signed a defense pact after the Gulf
War in 1991 stimulating the holding of joint maneuvers and
Kuwaiti purchase of military equipment from Washington.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said no decision were made on the issue of
purchasing new weapons during his stay in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we intends to contain the threat from Iraq
and Iran" and "we will not relax the sanctions until Saddam
Hussein and Iraq comply fully with the UN resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Cohen voiced President Bill Clinton's position on Iran that
"U.S. is hopeful but skeptical" that Iran would "stop its
support to terrorism, acquiring longer range of missiles and
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Iran denied it has given support to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense minister said "this policy of commitment,
cooperation and containment serves our country well today and
will protect our interests in the future."
</P>
<P>
On the purpose of his Gulf tour, Cohen said his tour in
this region is basically to "indicate that we intend to
remain a strong presence in the region, we commit to
Kuwait's security and preserving and protecting our interests
well."
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Sunday, held talks with Kuwaiti
Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahamed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said bilateral discussions were focused on "strong
cooperation" between both countries and how to "train regularly
with the need to stress on inter operability between the
forces and to present maximum efficiency and capability for
our forces."
</P>
<P>
On talks between the Kuwaiti Amir and Cohen, Kuwaiti
Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem, who was also
present at the press conference, said "they touched on
political issues as well as relations between Kuwait and the
United States" and principals on military cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has a military base camp in northern Kuwait
where a full brigade's military equipment exists. There are
now also around 200 U.S. jet-fighters located in Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia to monitor the southern part of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> PNA Blasts U.S. Jerusalem Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A prominent official of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said today a U.S. Congress
resolution recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital
threatens to kill the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Faisal el-Husseini, PNA Minister of Jerusalem Affairs, said
the U.S. decision on moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem is totally unacceptable to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"If this resolution is approved by the Clinton administration,
it would be the end of the peace process," Hussein warned in an
interview given today to Egypt's Voice of Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives voted Tuesday calling on
President Bill Clinton to reaffirm that Jerusalem must remain
Israel's "undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
Hussein urged Clinton to reject the resolution, especially as
the crisis of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations has reached
its peak since Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem three months ago.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government could halt this resolution similar to its
previous stance," he said, adding that such a measure would blow
up the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, the U.S. Senate and the House of
Representatives passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act which states as
a matter of U.S. policy that Jerusalem should remain "the
undivided capital of Israel" and the U.S. embassy should be
moved there by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and has claimed the
city as its undivided capital while the Palestinians also want
Jerusalem as their future capital.

<HEADLINE> Minister on Cooperation Between Inland Areas, HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Railways Han
Zhubin said today that the railway departments of Hong Kong and
the inland areas will expand cooperation in the transportation of
passengers and container cars, as well as the operation of three
express trains.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and the inland areas have maintained sound ties in
railway transportation for a long time, he said. With the
approaching of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, exchanges of
travelers and cargo will increase by leaps and bounds, the
minister said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The daily life of Hong Kong people has been closely connected
with the inland railway departments: three express trains carry
fresh and frozen foodstuffs to Hong Kong every day. The
Guangzhou-Kowloon train is one of the most convenient means of
transportation for Hong Kong residents entering the Chinese
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
There are now seven trains from the inland areas to Hong
Kong. The first Guangzhou-Kowloon train was launched on April 4,
1979. In mid-May of this year, passenger trains opened from
Beijing and Shanghai to Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Guangzhou-Kowloon trains alone had
carried a total ridership of more than 28 million by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Beijing-Kowloon and the Shanghai-Kowloon
railway lines shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the
large inland cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanchang,
and Zhengzhou, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Han revealed that a number of provinces and cities recently
proposed opening tourist trains to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In line with the need and conditions, I think it is possible
to increase some passenger trains at an appropriate time," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Three Countries Receive Certificates for Consular Posts in HK SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China today issued certificates
for heads of the consulates of the United States, Thailand, and
the Republic of Korea in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The certificates were given here by Director of the Department
of Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry of China Zhang Hongxi
to US Ambassador to China James Ralph Sasser, Thai Ambassador to
China Nikhom Tantemsapya and Minister of the ROK Embassy to China
Bong Joo Moon.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Chinese government has reached agreements with 84
countries for reserving their consular posts in the Hong Kong
SAR. Consulate heads of 39 countries have received
the certificates from China's Foreign Ministry including Canada,
Australia and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Through diplomatic channels, most of the 84 countries have
provided the Chinese Foreign Ministry with the names and resumes
of those candidates who are and will continue to be heads of the
consulates of their countries in the Hong Kong SAR after July 1.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of such certificates in accordance with the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations and relevant Chinese laws is
aimed at ensuring those consulate heads in the Hong Kong SAR will
perform their duties smoothly after July 1.
</P>
<P>
The issuing work is still going on and is expected to conclude
before July 1 this year, according to the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Minister on Cooperation Between Inland Areas, HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the three express cargo trains bound for Hong
Kong, Han said that for years the trains played an active role in
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the past 35 years, some 87 million pigs, 5.2 million cattle,
several billion head of poultry, 2 million tons of frozen food,
as well as a large quantity of aquatic products and vegetables had
been transported to Hong Kong and Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and Qiao Shi all
emphasized the importance of the three trains' service, and wrote
inscriptions to mark its 35th anniversary. The Ministry of
Railways also made important arrangements for the service, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after 1997, the three express trains will still
be the most advanced cargo trains in the inland areas, and their
status will be further strengthened in order to offer better
service to Hong Kong and Macao for their needs in fresh and frozen
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The container transport, as another major cooperation program
between the inland areas and Hong Kong, is of great significance
to maintaining the status of Hong Kong as an international
shipping center. Han said that his ministry is willing to work
toward this end.
</P>
<P>
First, the Ministry of Railways will better operate the through
trains to transport containers between the inland areas and Hong
Kong, he said, adding that his ministry had already cooperated
with the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and started
through-train container transport service from Zhengzhou, Wuhan,
and Chengdu to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Inland cities such as Kunming, Guizhou, and Chongqing will also
open through trains to transport containers to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Han said, his ministry will take steps to expand
the cargo transport service from the inland areas to Hong Kong,
and try to gather food supplies and transport them to the region.
</P>
<P>
Han also voiced his confidence in the future cooperation
between the inland areas and Hong Kong, saying a close tie will
surely give impetus to the economic development of both sides.

<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today called on investors from countries of the
newly-launched Developing Eight ("D-8") group to invest in her
country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on her return from Istanbul after

formally launched in Istanbul Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the forum identified six areas of
cooperation during the summit, including trade, industry,
communications, technology, finance and health development.
</P>
<P>
"We expressed our firm determination that the combined role of
the eight Muslim countries would create opportunities for
cooperation among us," she said.

Mohammad, Hasina said Malaysia had expressed the desire to set up
industries in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh and urged the Malaysian entrepreneurs to avail
(themselves) of the opportunity," she said.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran has a total of 1,047 AIDS
victims with 70 to 80 percent of them contracting the deadly
disease through sexual contacts, the Iranian health minister said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Alireza Marandi said at a symposium on AIDS
that the rest of the AIDS victims in Iran have been
afflicted by contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out the possibility of blood derivatives and
biological medicines being contaminated in Iran, he said that
such products are under strict control and are free from any
contamination.
</P>
<P>
The symposium on AIDS discussed such topics as the
government's policies of fighting AIDS, the role of morality and
education in preventing the spread of the killer disease, HIV,
AIDS and tuberculosis, AIDS in women and infants, and treatment
of AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran's Blood Transfusion
Organization (IBTO) has recently decided to offer free
consultation to citizens who might be afraid of having
contracted AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
IBTO Director Jahangir Ahmadi said that the service was
provided to all and was not in exchange for offering blood
at the IBTO headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Party Hosts Symposium to Greet HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Peasants' and Workers'
Democratic Party held a symposium here today to greet the return
of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Fang Rongxin, executive vice-chairman of the party, presided
over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech, Fang said the return of Hong Kong is a
very important event for both China and the world and a mark of
success for Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
It also signals an important step for the reunification of the
motherland, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has
deep-rooted historical ties with Hong Kong. During the democratic
revolution, Hong Kong twice served as a base for the central
committee of the party, and accumulated precious strength for the
party, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has created
more links with the Hong Kong compatriots, and encouraged them to
invest in the inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fang, who will attend the handover ceremony in Hong Kong with
the delegation of the Chinese government, said he believes Hong
Kong will be more prosperous and stable after the return, and will
have an even brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the symposium were Vice-Chairmen of the Party
Song Jinsheng and Jiang Zhenghua and some other party members.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the participants went to Tiananmen Square
and took photos in front of the countdown board that marks Hong
Kong's return.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Brewery Protests Tanzania's Likely Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's biggest brewery has
issued a strong protest over a proposal to double the import duty
on Kenya beer to Tanzania, the East Africa Standard reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Breweries Ltd (KBL) placed full-page advertisements in
Tanzanian newspapers last week condemning the proposal made by
the Confederation of Tanzanian Industries (CTI) to protect local
beer.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the (Tanzanian) Ministry of Finance
will review -- and better still, ignore -- the recommended tax
increase on PTA beers," said KBL Managing Director Michael Karanja
in a strongly worded statement.
</P>
<P>
"This will be in line with the spirit of East African
Cooperation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CTI proposal urged to double the current duty on beer
imported from Kenya to 14 U.S. cents a liter while leaving the
local product unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The CTI also proposed reducing the tariff on beer imported
from outside the Preferential Trade Area in Eastern and Southern
Africa. This would favor imports from South Africa and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Breweries is a public company quoted on the Nairobi
Stock Exchange and owned Tanzania's sole brewery in Dar es Salaam
until it was nationalized in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Breweries Ltd (TBL) now is controlled by South
African Breweries which bought the main shareholding when the
company was recently privatized.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been a big market for Kenyan beer over recent
years. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on ICO to Condemn Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf has called on the Islamic Conference Organization
(ICO) to live up to its responsibility and condemn Turkish
incursion into northern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to ICO Secretary General Hamid al-Gabid
Sunday, the foreign minister said that ignoring this aggression
would encourage Turkey, a member of ICO, to go on violating the
principles of the organization in respecting sovereignty, unity
and independence of other member states.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, about 10,000 Turkish troops, supported by tanks
and air force, crossed into northern Iraq to attack Turkish
anti-government Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, who have
bases in the region. Ankara said its troops will not withdraw
until they achieve their military goals.
</P>
<P>
It is incumbent on the organization to ask Turkey to pull out
its forces from Iraqi territory and to avoid any hostile
attempts in the future that might have negative effect on the
historical relations between the Arab nation and Turkey and on
their common interests, al-Sahhaf added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq reserves the right to appropriate
retaliation for such military acts and to compensations for the
damage they caused to civilians and property.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the Turkish government to reconsider
its policy vis-a-vis the situation in northern Iraq, asking
Ankara not to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs and pay
special attention to the cooperation between the two neibors.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that up to 100 tanks have crossed back into
Turkey since Friday in the Turkish army's partial withdrawal from
northern Iraq, but an Iraqi official in the Ministry of
Information and Culture told Xinhua that up till now, there is no
official confirmation about Turkish withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel Sunday denied
the reports that Turkey has begun to withdraw its troops from
northern Iraq.

MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
continued to dip today due to lack of foreign investors, with the
30-share composite index down 10.75 points from 2,790.86 points
recorded last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In today's trading, the majority of stock price indices
declined, except the banking and financial services which gained
slightly to reach 916.76 points, or up by 7.93 points, on the
average.
</P>
<P>
The commercial and industrial sector averaged 3,062.10 or down
by 17.45 points, while the property sector posted 1,382.12 or down
by 2.71 points. The mining, oil and all shares indices also

of 1,082,831,772.10 pesos (41,329,456.951 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts at the PSE Research Department predicted that the
local bourse will likely experience the wrath of a lull in the
coming days as clearly manifested by the weak trading activity
today.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days of trading, the composite index was not
doing properly as investors were waiting for active issues to
upturn, they said.
</P>
<P>
They have apprehensions that the lull may continue within the
week because foreign investors seemed unconcerned or that they
simply pump their investments somewhere else where stock market
issues are considered to be rosy.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Against U.S. Congress Bill on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Several dozens of Palestinians
held a demonstration before the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem
this morning in protest against the U.S. congressional resolution
recognizing united Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 406-17
to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel,
despite the opposition from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The house also voted to provide 100 million U.S. dollars for
moving the U.S. Embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of a
future Palestinian state, sharply criticized the resolution,
which they say will hurt the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During today's demonstration, Faisal Husseini, senior
Palestinian National Authority official on Jerusalem affairs,
submitted a letter of protest to U.S. Consul in Jerusalem Edward
Abington.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Husseini warned that if the U.S. approves
the resolution, "the whole peace process will be lost."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Council Member Ziad Abu Ziad, who also
participated in today's demonstration, said the resolution is a
"very grave" affair since Jerusalem is one of the central disputed
issues in the final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world, including the U.S., have not
recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem following the
Middle East war in 1967.
</P>
<P>
It has been the position of successive U.S. governments that the
city must never be divided again, but its future must be settled
through negotiations.

Nanchang, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Artisans are putting the final
touches on a big ceramic painting to be given to Hong Kong to
greet its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The 1.97 m. by 0.97 m. work is called "The Return of Bauhinia
to the Peony's Embrace". The bauhinia symbolizes the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region and the peony is supposed to
represent China.
</P>
<P>
The work is a collaborative effort by ten top artists in
Jingdezhen in southern Jiangxi Province, which is known as China's
porcelain capital. Nine of them drew the design on paper, and the
tenth, a 64-year-old well-known Chinese painting and porcelain
master, Zhang Songmao, painted it.
</P>
<P>
Zhang calls this painting a condensation of 50 years'
experience. He has worked more than 12 hours a day for the past 40
days, just to make sure every detail is complete.
</P>
<P>
The work is now ready for the kiln, to fix the color. "When
completed, it will be a masterpiece which represents the artistic
level and craftsmanship of the 'capital of porcelain arts'," says
an expert based here, who adds, "More importantly, it is a token
of our joy over the return of Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pursues Guided Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is pursuing a policy of
guided privatization, Foreign Minister Chief Anthony Ani said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the eighth Gamji lecture in Kaduna, the minister
said the government will not deliberately sell off all its
investment in some companies and public establishments.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to ensure that when some equities are
sold to foreign investors, that part of the foreign capital
coming into the country has some elements of technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Ani added that the government is considering
establishing a public trust to which proceeds from privatization
would be pooled.
</P>
<P>
The trust would be managed by former heads of state and would
be used in developing the nation's health, education and
agriculture sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that a total of 4.3 billion Naira
(about 50 million U.S. dollars) would be distributed to about
8,154 communities nationwide to support the development of
cottage industries under the Family Economic Advancement Program
(FEAP).
</P>
<P>
The FEAP was introduced by the government in this year's
budget as a major measure to boost rural economy.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Tax Threatens Olympic Sponsorships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A disputed state tax on hotel
rooms in the New South Wales is threatening sponsorships for the
2000 OLympic Games in Sydney, Australian Olympic Committee
president John Coates said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Coates said in Sydney that state Premier Bob Carr has
threatened to confiscate hotel rooms for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said the dispute -- in which 17,000 hotel rooms are being
withheld from Olympic use by Sydney hotel owners -- could endanger
up to 400,000 U.S. dollars worth Olympic sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
The 10-percent hotel tax is set to begin on September 1 and is
estimated to be worth about 38 million U.S. dollars a year to the
state government.
</P>
<P>
Coates, who recommended a phasing-in of the tax, said some
sponsors might renege the deals because the Australian Olympic
Committee could not fulfill its promise of accommodation
packages.

<HEADLINE> Big Role for EU Investment Bank in Stability Pact Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank
(EIB), one of the world's largest development agencies, is
expected to play an important role in fighting unemployment in the
European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
The EIB could support several job-creation projects, said a
diplomat at the EU Amsterdam summit meeting which started this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink, who attended the talks
among EU finance ministers on Sunday night, has confirmed that the
use of EIB credits would help the 18 million unemployed in the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
France has been demanding that more attention be paid to
employment issues in the run-up to the launch of the European
Economic and Monetary Union in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
It wants funding for major infrastructure programs such as
Trans-European Networks (TENs) as a way for creating jobs. TENs
include large road, rail and telecommunications links between and
within the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Germany has ruled out the costly Europe-wide job-creation
programs, which, it argues, have in the past merely raised
inflation and interest rates and failed to cut unemployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 Chinese researchers
and technicians involved in the field of forestry gathered here
today to mark the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Forestry Society.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese
leaders sent messages of congratulation to the meeting, which was
held in the Chinese Science and Technology Conference Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Society was founded in 1917 as one of China's earliest
non-governmental learned societies. It now has more than 70,000
members in China.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun, who spoke at today's meeting, said
that the Society's members have contributed a great deal to the
country's economic development and ecological improvement.
</P>
<P>
Forestry will continue to play an important role in China's
development in the next century, the Vice-Premier said, and there
will be a lot of room for the Society to play a role, especially
in promoting science and education. He urged various departments
to strengthen afforestation efforts in order to increase forest
coverage in the country, especially on the upper reaches of major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang also addressed the meeting,
calling on members to serve the reforms and development of
forestry and to make a greater contribution to solving key
problems in forestry.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign representatives, such as those from Japan
and Canada attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Inflation Rate at 21.4 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate dropped
slightly to 21.4 percent in April from 22.4 percent in March this
year, according to the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS).
</P>
<P>
The figure is in contrast with that of 18.5 percent released by
Finance Minister Anthony Ani last week, which suggests a decline of
3.9 percent in the month under review.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper This Day today quoted a top FOS official as
explaining that what the finance minister released was the projected
figure for April sent by FOS to the Finance Ministry some two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The FOS, a government agency that collates, processes and
distributes statistical data for the country, has told the ministry
with a caveat that it should not in any way be taken as the final
figure.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government's efforts to bring down consumer
prices have paid off in recent years. The inflation rate dove
substantially from 72.8 percent in 1995 to 28 percent in 1996. In
the first three months of this year, it dropped to 26 percent,
24.4 percent and 22.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Despite signs of improvements in the country's macroeconomic
situation, observers noted that trend of inflation rate decline may
suffer a setback as consumer prices started to rise in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
A FOS document last week disclosed a price rise of 3.9 percent
in March from the previous month due to the upward movement of
prices of food items throughout the country. And the repeated fuel
scarcity that has slowed down economic activities nationwide add
weigh to the government to curb the already increasing prices.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Anthracite Coking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's vast anthracite reserves
can now be prepared for industrial use, thanks to new technology
developed by several institutes in north China's Shanxi province,
China's largest coal producer.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it allows 80 percent of the raw coal to be
used for coking, largely meeting the world demand for coking coal,
and giving additional value to anthracite.
</P>
<P>
In the past, anthracite could not be coked with ordinary coking
methods and every year large amount of anthracite powder were
wasted and caused heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
But the anthracite can be directly coked in its area of origin,
decreasing the transport volume and making better use of raw
materials for coking in China, one local researcher said.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, this technology has been applied
by a number of counties in Shanxi, which plans to build an
anthracite coking business with a yearly output of one million
tons by the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The technology was jointly developed by the institute of
anthracite coking of Shanxi Normal University, the Changcheng Coal
Mine in Puxian county, and the East China Metallurgy College.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today the newly launched D-8 group will foster
closer economic links among the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian news agency MENA quoted Ganzouri as making the remark
after briefing President Hosni Mubarak on the establishment of the
group at a summit in Istanbul, Turkey, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The eight most populous Muslim countries, namely Egypt, Turkey,
Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia,
signed a declaration launching the Developing-8 (D-8) economic
group.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mubarak, Ganzouri said the main aim
of the D-8 group is to promote economic ties among member states,
which need coordination to boost their production and exports to
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade exchange among the member states, which is
400 billion U.S. dollars annually, does not exceed one percent of
their total trade volume with the other parts of world.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said Egypt's membership in the new group does not
contradict its presence in Arab groupings or within the
Organization of African Unity or affect the Egyptian-U.S. and
Egyptian-EU partnership.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Turkey, Ganzouri delivered a message from
Mubarak to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on the Turkish
incursion into northern Iraq and Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak sent a message to Demirel last week in which he
expressed the Arab world's concern at the month-long Turkish
operation.

<HEADLINE> PLA Troops Groomed to Serve Needs of Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shenzhen, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jianjun, an infantryman of a
unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be stationed
in Hong Kong, never expected that a speech of his would win him
such high regard from some Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, 1996, a group of celebrities from Hong Kong visited
the Eighth Company of the PLA Hong Kong troops where Chen
serves. At the company's club, they invited Chen to sing a
song in Guangdong dialect.
</P>
<P>
After his hearty rendition, Chen said: "It's Mothers' Day
today, so please let me express my heartfelt blessings to those
mothers among our distinguished guests, as well as to our
motherland."
</P>
<P>
As soon as Chen concluded his performance with these eloquent,
touching words, he won loud applause from the guests. One visitor
said:"I never expected to hear such a moving speech from a tough
soldier."
</P>
<P>
Since their debut exposure to the public in January 1996, the
PLA Hong Kong troops' top military qualities and good cultural
levels have created for themselves the image of being a mighty
and civilized force. For this they have won the admiration and
respect of Hong Kong compatriots from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
On a hot summer's day last year, more than 600 people came over
from Hong Kong and watched a military display staged by the PLA
Hong Kong troops.A performance by scout troops was particularly
fascinating and impressive.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the order was given, a group of 26 scouts, gathered
in front of a four-storied 13-meter-high building, began to climb
up the facade of the building -- with their bare hands. They had
neither ladders nor ropes, but used wall corners, windows,
balconies and drain pipes of the building as their support. They
seemed to defy gravity, and in a matter of a few tens of seconds
were looking down from the roof of the building.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Hong Kong troops also displayed their shooting and
fixed-bayonet skills.
</P>
<P>
Li Ka Shing, member of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region said after watching the
performance that a powerful national defense is a reliable
guarantee for the unification, economic development and social
prosperity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was no need to be skeptical about
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong as such a strong force would
be taking up the defense duty in Hong Kong after its return to the
motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is not only the first-rate military qualities of the PLA Hong
Kong troops that impressed many Hong Kong compatriots, but also their
cultural qualities.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andy Wong Kam Din, a teacher at Hong Kong Polytechnic was
one who was once quite doubtful about the cultural qualities of
the PLA troops destined for Hong Kong duty. His day in Shenzhen
made him change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"In the barracks I saw that bedside cupboards of many soldiers
contained various books ranging from world literary classics,
books on science and technology to those on language and law. The
troops are knowledgeable and quite familiar with Hong Kong's
history.They are au fait with current world affairs and some of
them even speak English," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These soldiers are very young, polite and affectionate," said
Ng Tai-yin, a 78-year-old Hong Kong man when asked about his
impression of the PLA Hong Kong troops.
</P>
<P>
Ng was one of more than 1,000 Hong Kong compatriots who
visited the barracks in May 1996 to meet the PLA Hong Kong
troops. During the visit, Ng said everyone was impressed by the
clean and tidy appearance of the barracks as well as its
well-disciplined officers and men. But what impressed Ng most was
their courtesy and good manners.
</P>
<P>
"They saw I was old and tired, so pulled up a chair for me, sat
me down and poured me a cup of tea," Ng recalled.
</P>
<P>
"On July 1, 1997 when the PLA formally enters Hong Kong, I'll
go out and welcome them, even if I will have to walk with a
stick," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the spring of this year, Wong Keising, a 67-year-old
Hong Konger, travelled to Shenzhen. When he toured Shenzhen
reservoir, a major fresh water resource for Hong Kong, he happened
to meet a group of soldiers: the PLA Hong Kong troops. They were
voluntarily planting trees on a hillside to ensure a clean water
source for Hong Kong people. When Wong realized this he was very
moved.
</P>
<P>
"Even before their arrival in Hong Kong, I felt their deep
affection for Hong Kong people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Whether the PLA Hong Kong troops will abide by the laws in Hong
Kong after they arrive is a question concerning many Hong Kong
compatriots. Many Hong Kong journalists have explored this
question, and time and time again their conclusion was " yes."
</P>
<P>
In a room back in the PLA Hong Kong troops' barracks hang many
calligraphic inscriptions written by Hong Kong compatriots. Some
praise the PLA Hong Kong troops as "The Great Wall of the
Motherland and the guards of Hong Kong", others describe them
as a civilized law-abiding model force, while more express their
expectations for the stationing of the PLA troops there, saying
that the force will secure stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The collection reflects the wishes and expectations of all
Hong Kong people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villagers Relocated to Make Way for River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- "We've really left our old home,"
murmured Wang Chuanyi, standing on the bank of the Yellow River
watching the immense flowing waters, a month after he had settled
into his new place.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old farmer had spent most of his life alongside the
second largest river in China, which is known as the cradle of
Chinese civilization, but which is also known for its seasonal
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the provincial government of Shandong in east
China started a program to relocate villages that lay in the path
of waters that would rise as the result of dams being built on the
river. The move kills two birds with one stone, according to local
officials. One thing the dams do is to make the flow of the river
steadier and safer and the other the move does is help remove the
villagers from extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, all farmland was destroyed by floods and we had to
live on government subsidies," said Li Xinfang, a villager. The
frequent floods stymied all efforts to develop local farming and
industries, he noted. And last year's were the worst in nearly 20
years. They inundated more than one million ha. of farmland and
affected over 10 million local people.
</P>
<P>
Under the resettlement plan, some 420,000 people from over 760
villages in Shandong will be involved. More than 280,000 of them,
from over 580 villages, will be resettled, according to Zhao
Kezhi, a provincial official in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
He says that the scheme will cost more than 1.6 billion yuan,
and apart from 310 million yuan from the provincial government,
the bulk will come from local governments and the people who are
intended to benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of funding is still the main obstacle to this program,"
Zhao explained, "but the provincial government is determined to
put it into effect and it is seen as the only solution to the
issue."
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of well-designed villages have been built for
the resettled villagers, and nearly 10,000 people, or eight
percent of the total, have been relocated, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"Now flooding is nothing to us now," said Li Xiu'e, a woman who
has moved to the new Lijinshitang Village which now houses people
from 12 villages.
</P>
<P>
"I have a two-story house," said Li Yancai, from the same
village. "My family lives on the second floor and they've opened a
shop on the first floor," he noted.
</P>
<P>
School-children are among the happiest group of people, because
they no longer have to sit in drab classrooms with worn-out desks
and chairs. Six new schools have been set up in Liangshan County
for children of the resettlement program. The schools have
three-story buildings, good teachers, and standard facilities and
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Libraries Superior to Internet, Research Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Libraries are still a more
accurate source of information than the Internet, thus students
should not confine their research only to the Net, according to a
Bar-Ilan University researcher in Israel.
</P>
<P>
David Schwartz, a researcher of the university's school of
business administration, compared materials on various subjects
found in the world's three major libraries, the U.S. Library of
Congress, the New York Public Library, and the British Royal
Library, to Internet researches he carried out on the same topics.
</P>
<P>
In each case, Schwartz said, the representation of the topics
on the Internet was inferior to that in the three libraries.
</P>
<P>
Many Internet sites are profit-oriented, so one can not always
trust the information provided by vested interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has opened up a treasure of information for
researchers and seekers of knowledge throughout the world, and it
has become common practice to turn to the Internet as a convenient
source of information," he said.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the effectiveness of Internet int is presenting
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
It is a foregone conclusion that the Internet will become the
infrastructure for a global digital library, he continued, "but
this is still years away from happening."

PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union summit, which began today in Amsterdam,
remains under the shadow of French-German dispute over the content
of the Stability Pact. Despite several declarations made by Paris
and Bonn to de-dramatize the situation, the chances of reaching an
agreement at the summit remain small and the summit could be
prolonged after Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
-- As French troops completed their operation to evacuate
foreigners from Brazzaville on Sunday and began withdrawing from
the country, a plane of Gabonese President Omar Bongo fetched 13
delegates of the warring factions of Congo to Libreville for
round-table peace talks today to seek a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France today began a lonely fight at the EU Amsterdam summit
to put a chapter on employment and social construction into the
monetary Stability Pact of future European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The absence of an agreement between France and Germany over the
pact predicts difficult negotiations at the summit, which will
also discuss the reform of EU institutions aimed at the
enlargement of the union to admit central and eastern European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Vows to Crush Opposition Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has vowed to crush the opposition rallies scheduled to be held in
nine towns on Saturday with no permit from the government.
</P>
<P>
The rallies may cause dire consequences, the Daily Nation
newspaper today quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The organizers are only interested in inciting violence and
causing bloodshed, he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy security has been deployed in Kisumu, the third largest
city in Kenya, and some other planned rally venues, he added.
</P>
<P>
All the leaders and supporters of the ruling party Kanu should
use all means to ensure no unlawful meetings to be held, he
urged.
</P>
<P>
FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba and his National Development
Party counterpart Raila Odinga announced the rally plan on June 6
in a bid to put more pressures on the government to conduct
constitutional reforms before the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, if a candidate wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
Now the opposition leaders urged to change the clause,
demanding the future president get more than 50 percent of the
total votes nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with
other parties. This has already been refused by Moi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government banned and then broke up the first two
rallies of opposition parties last month amid turmoils which
injured dozens of people and caused businesses in downtown
Nairobi to come to a complete standstill.

<HEADLINE> China's Fixed Assets Investment Up 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China invested 242.5 billion yuan
in fixed assets during the January-April period, up 15 percent
from the same period of last year, said a report by the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
However, growth rate was 1.3 percentage points lower than that
in the same 1996 period. The investment figure does not include
personal investments in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,
fisheries and water resources, standing at 6.2 billion yuan during
the four-month period, accounted for 2.5 percent of the national
total investment. This rate was 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
China's western region showed strong growth momentum during the
four months. The region saw 32 billion yuan being invested in its
fixed assets, 31.8 percent more than the same period last
year. The growth rate was 17.6 percentage points higher than that
for the eastern areas, where the economy is more developed.
</P>
<P>
The report said that investment in the real estate sector grew
at a relatively low rate. A total of 76.4 billion yuan, an
increase of just 0.3 percent on an annual basis, was invested in
real estate during the January-April period.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Migrant Detention Center Closes in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The entire Whitehead Detention
Center for Vietnamese migrants (VMs) closed down today after
eight-and-a-half years' operation as a result of the continued
fall in the VM population.
</P>
<P>
The main camp was closed on January 3 this year when the number
of VMs and Vietnamese illegal immigrants (VIIs) dropped to 6,300.
</P>
<P>
"With the continued fall in the VM and VII population to about
1,900, there is no need to maintain a camp at Whitehead," Refugee
Coordinator Sally Wong said. "The remaining 260 there have been
transferred to the High Island Camp."
</P>
<P>
High Island Detention Center is the only major VM detention
center left in Hong Kong. It now holds over 1,400 VMs and VIIs
after the closure of Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1989, we have successfully repatriated about 67,000 VMs
and over 1,000 VIIs to Vietnam," Wong said. "Another 143,000
Vietnamese refugees (VRs) have been resettled elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
With the successes in repatriation and the declining VM
population, VM detention centers have been closed down
progressively. The Tai A Chau Detention Center was closed in
September 1996, the main camp of Whitehead Detention Center in
January 1997 and the Kai Tak Vietnamese Migrant Transit Center in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the transfer operation today at Whitehead
has proceeded smoothly," Wong said. "The closing of the whole
Whitehead Detention Center is a landmark achievement in the final
chapter of the whole VM saga."
</P>
<P>
The Whitehead Detention Center, located at Sha Tin, was first
opened in January in 1989 when the VM population in Hong Kong
stood at about 11,000. When the VM population reached its height
of nearly 60,000 in October 1991, the center provided
accommodation for about 25,000.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Takes More Measures to Promote Labuan as IOFC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Acting Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today announced further measures for
offshore banks to spur the growth and development of Labuan as an
International Offshore Financial Center (IOFC).
</P>
<P>
These measures include allowing offshore banks operating in
Labuan to maintain their ringgit (local currency) balances in
interest bearing external accounts to allow offshore banks greater
access to ringgit businesses as well as money market operations in
Labuan, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Labuan International Summit on
Islamic Financial Instruments" in Labuan, Anwar said offshore
banks will be allowed to trade in ringgit instruments in the
secondary market and also to purchase ringgit instruments in the
primary market using foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Labuan is a federal territory off the coast of Sabah, East
Malaysia, with a size of 92 square kilometers and a population of
35,000. The Malaysian Parliament passed a bill on October 1, 1990
to develop Labuan as an IOFC.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, said today that in the
area of insurance, offshore life insurance companies in Labuan
would be allowed to sell investment-linked products to high net
worth Malaysians from a date to be announced later.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the detailed guidelines on the implementation of
these new policies would be announced by the Labuan Offshore
Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) and the central bank later.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who launched Amanah Butler Labuan Ltd, Malaysia's first
offshore money broker in Labuan, also announced a few other
measures for the benefit of Malaysians working in the offshore
financial industry and the public sector in Labuan.
</P>
<P>
Among others, allowances and facilities enjoyed by Malaysian
residents in their jobs in Labuan such as housing provided by
employers or housing allowances, regional allowances and special
Labuan allowances would be exempted from tax to be effective from
the year of assessment 1998.
</P>
<P>
They would also be given a 50 percent reduction in Customs duty
on cars purchased in Labuan and brought to other parts of the
country after the owner had served in Labuan for a minimum period
of time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that to increase the population of Labuan and generate
critical mass and greater economic activities, branches of
universities and institutions of higher learning would be
encouraged to be set up on the island.
</P>
<P>
The number of offshore companies has increased to 1,200 at
present, double the number achieved for the whole of first five
years, he said, adding Labuan had attracted 55 offshore banks in
seven years, most of which are among the top 200 banks in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labuan is making great strides in insurance where
the number of insurance and insurance-related companies is
expected to increase to 30 at the end of this year compared to six
at this time last year, he said.

Committee of the Communist Party of China, said here today that
the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) wishes to strengthen exchanges
and cooperation with the Movement for Democracy of Cape Verde and

</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the efforts of the people of Cape Verde, under
the Movement's leadership, to maintain national stability and
unity and to develop the national economy," Hu said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Ban on Fishing Along Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has reiterated its ban on large-scale fishing along sea shores,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma made the remarks at the weekend
when talking to Director of the Hellas Tanzania Company Joseph
Haritonides at the State House.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said it was the government policy to retain
the shallow water areas along the sea shore for the small
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
He called on the company to continue buying fish from small
fishermen instead of fishing in the said areas using its own ships.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, Hellas Co. possesses fish processing
factory in Mafia, Coast Region, and fishing ship Aimilia V.
</P>
<P>
The company could not secure fishing licence as its ship was
large enough to exceed the legally imposed limits. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundupp:  Verbal Battle over Endangered Animal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The 10th conference of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
in Harare is turning out to be a verbal battle.
</P>
<P>
Participants are arguing heatedly over 75 proposals involving
85 species since it started on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The western countries and wildlife conservation extremists are
opposed to listing of trade bans on any endangered species from CITES
appendix one to appendix two and are campaigning strongly to have
resolutions in favour of the stance they take regarding wildlife
preservation.
</P>
<P>
Some governments of the CITES member nations have submitted
proposals emphasising sustainable use of renewable natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The African elephant became a focal point in the argument at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Three southern African neighbours, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe,
have proposed that the African elephant be downlisted from the CITES
appendix one to appendix two, which would allow for limited and
controlled trade in the elephant and its products.
</P>
<P>
All southern African countries are supporting the proposal. They
said the seven-year trade ban on ivory had stopped culling operations
to maintain sustainable increasing levels of elephant populations.
The three states have a combined elephant population of about 150,000
which is growing with disastrous consequences for the rural people.
</P>
<P>
They also held elephants in much of southern Africa are not an
endangered species and are in fact a danger to the environment and
human life because of their large and increasing number which is now
out of control and threatening the survival of other wild species and
the whole ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
But the western countries and animal rights groups such as the World
Wildlife Fund do not agree and insist the proposal to downlist the
elephant be rejected by the CITES.
</P>
<P>
They said donwlisting the elephant would open floodgates for the
widespread slaughter of both African and Asian elephants to service
an insatiable international illegal trade in ivory.
</P>
<P>
The animal lovers are even prepared to source funding for elephant
conservation programs if African range states destroy their ivory
stockpiles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Verbal Battle Over Endangered Animal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Minke whale is another hot issue at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japan, one of the world's leading fishing nations, is proposing
that international trade in four species of whales be allowed because
of what it says is an abundance of stocks, particularly the minke
whale.
</P>
<P>
The Icelandic government argued that minke whales were in
great number in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The
South-Pacific Economic Power also argued that the number of minke
whales worldwide was conservatively estimated at over one
million, and the abundant species of these whales should never
have been put on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
With thick documents and glossy pictures to buttress its point,
the International Fund for the Welfare of Animals (IFWA) said the
Japanese proposal should be rejected outright, adding it contains
many false and unsupported claims about the minke whale population.
</P>
<P>
CITES adoption of Japan's proposal at this stage, claims the IFWA,
would bring CITES into conflict with the International Whaling
Commission, which is the global authority for regulation of whaling.
</P>
<P>
The IFWA further argued that meat of other protected whale species
is frequently sold in Japan in the guise of minke whale meat.
</P>
<P>
South Africa voiced support for a strictly controlled legal trade
in rhino horn and other products, saying that the proposal would
reduce illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has a white rhino population of between
7,200 and 7,500, is proposing that restrictions preventing
international trade in rhino and other products be lifted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa held the trade ban had not been effective in
providing protection for rhinos. Only those populations that have
been effectively protected and managed have maintained their numbers
or increased.
</P>
<P>
However, the Environmental Investigation Agency has called for
the outright rejection of the proposal by South Africa, saying it
would have negative consequences, including directly threatening
all other species of rhino both in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, the 138 CITES member countries will vote to make final
decisions on the 75 proposals. The people in the world are waiting
for the results.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Wounded by Roadside Bomb in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers have been
wounded in an attack in south Lebanon claimed by the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, Beirut's newspaper Daily Star reported
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis were injured when a remote-controlled roadside
bomb exploded Sunday night as their armored car, accompanied by a
foot patrol, was rolling on the road between Bint Jbeil and Saf
Al-Hawa on the edge of the central sector of the so-called
"security zone".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack was confirmed by Israeli Radio today, saying four
soldiers were injured in the bomb attack and one of them died in
hospital later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Hezbollah guerrillas attacked two Israeli
positions at Qantara and Mashaaroun in the Israeli self-carved
buffer zone with around 40 mortar shells, causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The assaults came a day after an Israeli soldier was seriously
injured during a assault on the Ghazlan post.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said Israeli artillery responded to the attacks
by pounding suspected Hezbollah positions in the valleys opposite
the zone, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes brought to 10 killed and some 45 wounded the
Israeli casualties in south Lebanon so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over the
south Lebanese areas of Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli jet fighters appeared in the clear blue sky over
the capital of Beirut at 8:55 a.m. (05:55 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Lebanese anti-aircraft army units on the hills
around the city refrained from firing at the invaders.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory bombardments
by the Israeli forces and their client Lebanese militia
constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attack.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Hong Kong's Future Guaranteed - Malaysian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's diplomatic envoy in
Hong Kong today expressed his firm belief in China's Hong Kong
policy and the work of the future HK Special Administration Region
Government in guaranteeing HK's long-term stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to China is a most significant
historic event since it (together with the return of Macao to
China) marks the end of colonialism in Asia," said Zakaria,
Commissioner for Malaysia in Hong Kong in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The significance also lays in the fact that the handover will
enable Hong Kong people to become masters of their own society and
to determine their own destiny and future by themselves for the
first time," noted the career diplomat, who has 22 years of
experience behind him.
</P>
<P>
In his office overlooking Victoria Harbor in the showcase
"Malaysia Building" in downtown Hong Kong, Zakaria told Xinhua
that he does not share some apprehensions expressed about the
future of Hong Kong. On the contrary, he is part of the majority
who are fully convinced that Hong Kong will have a bright future
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Zakaria, who came to Hong Kong nine months ago after serving a
three-year diplomatic tenure in London, said he began to follow
closely the Hong Kong issue in London and has been fully convinced
that the Basic Law and the policy of "one country, two systems"
will be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree of autonomy
and to continue the free economic and trade practices and to
retain its entrepreneur spirit", he said.
</P>
<P>
All the economic indicators, especially that of the stock and
property market, illustrate that Hong Kong's economy is still at
its height after so many years of fast growth, adding support to
people's upbeat mood, he observed.
</P>
<P>
He is also convinced that HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
and his colleagues have been doing their best to look at various
problems facing them so as to ensure continuity in policies and an
efficient government after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"All these will enable the long-term stability and prosperity
of Hong Kong. And since Hong Kong is a major international trade,
financial, shipping and tourism center, such stability and
prosperity will contribute not only to the Asian-Pacific region
but the world's development as a whole," said Zakaria, who served
as a diplomat in Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In his view, those who hold pessimistic views and wrote
negative reports about the future of Hong Kong are not familiar
with or even ignorant about the region.
</P>
<P>
With a long history of economic and trade ties, Hong Kong has
become an important source of capital and know-how in the
development of Malaysia's manufacturing sector. In 1996, Malaysia
was Hong Kong's eleventh largest trading partner, with trade
volume increasing by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zakaria believed that since Hong Kong is an important gateway
to China, its return to China will surely help enhance the
bilateral economic and trade ties with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's return to China has aroused great attention
among Malaysians. The Malaysians living in Hong Kong are among the
first of foreign communities to agree to take part in a floats
parade organized by the Hong Kong Committee for Celebration of
Reunification with China on July 2.
</P>
<P>
"The response is so enthusiastic we have to turn down
applications for limited space", he said.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Malaysian diplomat who is an avid reader of
books of Chinese history and literature, said that he is most
happy to be chosen to work in Hong Kong when it is turning a new
leaf in history.

<HEADLINE> Hot Wave Hits China's Icebox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A sudden heat wave hit Harbin,
known as "ice city" in Heilongjiang Province, Saturday and Sunday,
turning it into one of the hottest cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in this northernmost capital city of China during
the two-day period reached 36 degrees c., following a period of
lower than normal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The local people, who are used to fresh breezes in the summer,
began to look for ways to deal with the unexpected turn of the
weather. Trucks were busy spraying water on local highways and
other public places, and cold drinks shops were crowded. Zoo
workers installed water pipes to provide a "water curtain" animals
could walk through to avoid heat-stroke. Veterinarians added
Chinese herbal medicines to feed for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Sales of air conditioners were double the normal rate, and
hundreds of thousands of local people crowded the banks of the
Songhuajiang River each day to enjoy the cool air.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial meteorological department, the hot
wave was caused by a hot-air mass coming from Inner
Mongolia. Temperatures are expected to fall in a few days.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of Tianjin
has seen some progress in environmental protection in recent
years, without sacrificing rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 98 percent of the city's drinking
water is now up to state standards, its "green" coverage is up to
22 percent, and three state-level natural reserves have been set
up.
</P>
<P>
The old industrial base has increased its pollution controls at
construction sites, and some 94 percent of the large and
medium-sized projects have had a pollution assessment done by
local environmental control departments.
</P>
<P>
The city closed 89 small factories with serious pollution
problems last year, while encouraging cleaner production in other
factories.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinsheng, the director of the City Bureau of Environmental
Protection, says that the city government regards pollution
controls as a way to improve living conditions for the city's
residents, and because of the growing environmental awareness, it
has been receiving several hundred complaints and suggestions from
the public each year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Insists on Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite international pressure to
protect endangered animals, Zimbabwe insists on its trade of
elephant products, the local daily the Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will sell ivory without approval from the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), rather
than accept a ''compromise'' that would see the African elephant
downlisted to the CITES appendix II.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Minister of Environment and Tourism Chen
Chimutengwende said in an interview at the weekend that a refusal
to accept the Zimbabwean proposal would not be a solution to the
country's elephant management problem.
</P>
<P>
On the secret ballot, the minister said this should be accepted
without a problem. But he dismissed the possibility of exchanging
''debt for ivory'' as a ''diversionary negotiating tactic'' by those
opposed to the southern African countries' proposal.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia have proposed that the African
elephant be downlisted from the CITES appendix I to appendix II
which would allow for limited and controlled trade in the
elephant and its products.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Economic Success to Stay in Post-handover HK, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The experiment of "one country,
two systems" will work and all the factors contributing to Hong
Kong's economic success will stay intact after the handover,
Douglas Henck, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong (AmCham), told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the transitional year, Henck took the
chairmanship of the chamber, which, grouping some 1,100 American
companies, is the largest American chamber of commerce outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the results of the 1996 AmCham business
confidence survey -- the seventh of its kind -- which indicated
that the American business community are bullish over the
post-handover business climate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
An all-time high of 95 percent of AmCham member companies see
the business environment as either "very favorable" or "favorable"
for the next five years up to 2001, compared with 91 percent in
1995 and 81 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Henck noted, there is also a shift from
"favorable" to "very favorable", reflecting "a very significant
improvement in the confidence".
</P>
<P>
Henck moved here in 1987 to set up a regional office for Aetna
-- a leading American insurance group founded in the middle of the
19th century. Now he is the senior Aetna executive in the region
and is responsible for overseeing the Asia-Pacific operations of
the group.
</P>
<P>
In his eyes, Hong Kong stands out as a world-class business hub
because of, among other factors, the rule of law, low taxes,
government's non-interference policy, fine infrastructure, and
free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of road, airport, telephone and the equipment you
have here, the quality of workers and the education of people, the
central location in Asia," no other cities in Asia can be Hong
Kong's peers, except maybe Singapore, Henck said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether he believes that these factors,
constituting a very favorable business environment, will be
preserved after July 1, Henck replied: "Yes, I do."
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law really provides the underpinning, the foundation,
for all of these things to stay the same, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"When I gave speeches in the United States about Hong Kong, one
of the things I do is spend 20 minutes talking about all of the
factors that would stay the same," Henck said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only by understanding that foundation, then you can
discuss the concerns that people have heard about; it is only by
understanding how many good things are continuing the same, then
you could have an intelligent discussion on anything else," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on some Western media reports intent on predicting a
gloomy picture for Hong Kong, Henck said, "Newspaper reporters are
always looking for stories that sell newspapers. It's true a
headline which is a little frightening can sell more newspapers
than a headline which is good."
</P>
<P>
There are some people in Hong Kong who are "purposefully trying
to scare the rest of the world, that does not help," Henck
stated.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the Special Administrative Region will
be acting autonomously and that the business climate will continue
to be good.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Commander Killed in Attack on Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Muslim rebel commander
was killed early this morning when a group of rebels he led
attacked an Army detachment near Cotabato city in western
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred just on the eve of the fifth round of
initial peace talks scheduled on June 17-18 between the separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the government in a
university in Cotabato, capital of Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry
Division, said the raiders were led by a certain Commander
"Shotgun" Gazali, who was killed during a brief exchange of
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The rebels retreated after learning their leader had been
killed, Detoyato said, adding that no casualty was reported on the
government side.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political
affairs, said the group is carefully studying the latest proposal
of the government peace panel to implement a general ceasefire
agreement in areas where the MILF operates.
</P>
<P>
The proposal seeks to abolish the old interim local truce in
Buldon town in Maguindanao, which the government panel said is
very limited and would be replaced by a broader one.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is expected to announce its position on the matter
during Tuesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the former larger rebel
group of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which had
already signed a peace deal with Manila last September.
</P>
<P>
The government has sought to forge a similar peace accord with
the MILF, which is currently the largest anti-government force in
the country and is considered more radical than the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF began their exploratory peace talks
early this year, but the talks have been on-and-off because of
sporadic fighting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF and the Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf group are the only
two Muslim groups still fighting the government forces. The Abu
Sayyaf has shunned peace talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers to Resume Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Finance Minister
Philippe Maystadt said Sunday that European Union (EU) finance
ministers would meet again on Monday morning to discuss the
stability pact.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of the finance ministers on Sunday night,
Maystadt told reporters he hoped that an agreement could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm, whose country holds the
rotating EU presidency, told a press conference that progress had
been made in finalizing a stability pact designed to curb
government spending in the forthcoming Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) and guarantee a stable European single currency Euro, which
will be introduced on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We made extremely good progress. We will be able to finish a
text on stability pact Monday," he said.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact, agreed on in principle at a Dublin EU
summit last December after tough negotiations, is due to be
formally approved by EU heads of state and government at their
summit meeting Monday in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers are trying to round off a draft European
Council Resolution on growth and employment to supplement the pact.
</P>
<P>
France has been demanding more attention to employment issues
in the run-up to the launch of the EMU and wants funding for
major infrastructure programs such as Trans-European Networks
(TENs) as a way to create jobs. TENs include large road, rail and
telecommunications links between and within member countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany has ruled out costly Europe-wide job-creation
programs.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Set to Be Reelected as Croatian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
looked certain to be reelected to a five-year term in Sunday's
presidential elections, according to preliminary results.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman won 59.09 percent of the votes, while his opponents
Social Democrat candidate Zdravko Tomac and a nine-party coalition
candidate Vlado Gotovac garnered 22.82 percent and 18.09 percent
respectively, the country's election commission announced
mid-night on Sunday after counting more than half of the votes.
</P>
<P>
First elected as president in 1990, Tudjman won the reelection
bid in the country's first direct voting for presidency in
1992. His third winning is widely expected due to his contribution
to achieving independence of Croatia.

SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. is
looking for someone to cooperate with in China to provide its
Corolla automobile with the access to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Koji Hasegawa, Toyota board chairman who is attending the '97
Shanghai International Automobile Industry Fair, says they plan to
introduce the car to China and are negotiating with Chinese
departments. Toyota sold two million units last year.
</P>
<P>
The new Corolla would be the eighth version since the car was
first developed in 1966. It has a 1.6-liter or a 1.3-liter engine.
It is now manufactured in 15 countries, Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
The annual auto show is popular with Chinese auto fans and
is a showcase for international and domestic auto producers. It is
held in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, Chrysler and
Hyundai are all represented at this year's show, which runs from
June 10 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is the world's third largest automobile maker, after the

<HEADLINE> Qatar Begins Preparations for Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has begun preparations to
host a Middle East and north Africa (MENA) economic summit due to
take place in November despite Arab opposition to sitting together
with Israel, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Six committees have been set up to prepare the summit, the
fourth annual event since 1994, Gulf News reported from the Qatari
capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
Qatar expects that around 2,500 participants will attend the
summit. Almost 1,500 hotel rooms have been reserved for the
participants, including 800 officials, 800 businessmen, 300
representatives of regional and international organizations, and
100 economic experts, the newspaper quoted an official from one of
the committees as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani confirmed
Friday that his country will also invite Israel to attend the
summit.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, Israel, Israel's Federation of Chambers of
Commerce confirmed that it has received assurance from Qatar for
being invited to the conference, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has drummed up opposition to the conference because of
deadlock in the Middle East peace talks. Arab League foreign
ministers called in March for a freeze in any normalization of
relations with Israel after it began construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Qatar and Oman established economic ties with
Israel. But plans for expanding such ties have been put on hold
because of strained Arab-Israeli relations.

JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier died today
after suffering serious wounds from a roadside bombing attack
late Sunday by Lebanese guerrilla forces in south Lebanon, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Three other Israeli soldiers were also wounded the same day

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Protests Against Election Irregularities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Nepali
Congress (NC) held a nation-wide protest campaign Sunday against
the alleged irregularities in the recent local elections, during
which the NC suffered a humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that thousands of NC workers took to the
streets in the capital city of Kathmandu Sunday to voice their
displeasure at the results of the local elections which they
believe were rigged on a large scale by the dominant coalition
partner the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
So far, the CPN-UML has bagged around 53 percent of the seats
contested, while the CN only about 30 percent, show the latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
NC party workers from all the three districts of the Kathmandu
Valley went around various parts of the city, shouting slogans
against the alleged election irregularities, the recent price hike
in petroleum products and corruption. The procession eventually
converged into a mass meeting at the local open air theater.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, NC President Girija Prasad Koirala
alleged that the ruling parties distributed ballot papers well
before the start of voting, police forced voters to stamp ballot
papers in the sun, and ballot boxes were captured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile over 30 NC workers were injured in clashes with
police and 100 arrested in southern parts of the country on the
same day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> New Car Model From Sino-French Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Citroen's new car, with a
1.6-liter engine and new electronic and fuel system, has hit the
Chinese market in Shanghai, as the latest car for the 1990s in
China.
</P>
<P>
The car is produced by the Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co. Ltd,
a joint venture of China Dongfeng Automobile Company and France's
Citroen.
</P>
<P>
An executive in charge of market affairs says that Shanghai was
chosen because it is a "dragonhead" in economic development along
the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and is a crossroads for the Chinese
and international markets.
</P>
<P>
The new cars are said to be faster starting, more energy
efficient, and a speed of 180 km/per hour. The company expects to
manufacture 2,000 cars this year, with a sticker price of 160,000
yuan to 168,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was started in May 1992, with headquarters in
Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province. It spent 10.35
billion yuan on the first phase of construction and will have an
annual production capacity of 150,000 cars and 200,000 engines by
the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Tourism to Stay HK's Top Earner, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Tourism will remain Hong Kong's
biggest foreign exchange earner, Hong Kong Secretary for Economic
Services Stephen Ip Shu-kwan predicted.
</P>
<P>
Tourism replaced textiles and garments as Hong Kong's top
foreign exchange earning industry last year, generating 84.5
billion HK dollars (10.8 billion U.S. dollars) from 11.7 million
visitors, today's South China Morning Post quoted Ip as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There will be more and more people traveling to Hong Kong
because of the many new attractions and activities organized to
lure people to come here," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that after the handover "even more people will come to
see that the city is still a good place".
</P>
<P>
A new high is expected in the number of visitors this year --
about 12.4 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourist
Association, set up by the government in 1957 to develop the
industry.
</P>
<P>
This would raise tourism revenue to 92.8 billion HK dollars
(11.9 billion U.S. dollars), up 10 percent from last year.

<HEADLINE> Private Cargo Handling to Be Introduced in Chittagong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The authority of Bangladesh's
largest Chittagong Port finally allowed private participation in
the cargo handling activities from June 30 within the protected
areas after the port users threatened to boycott the port
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong port workers, however, decided to observe
one-hour token work abstention everyday from today, in protest
against the use of private equipment.
</P>
<P>
A formal tripartite agreement, which paved the way for private
cargo handling in the port, was signed Sunday between the port
users, port authorities and Chittagong Mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, the Port Users Forum called off
the strike scheduled to begin from this morning to materialize the
demands for use of private equipment in this usually
slowly-working port.
</P>
<P>
The issue on the use of private equipment emerged from early
March this year when a shipping company brought some of its
equipment inside the port jetty for handling its cargo, which was
resisted by the port's workers.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the Workers Union, the port authority
withdraw the permission of private cargo handling in late March.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Port Employees Coordination Committee Sunday
announced that they will also go for an indefinite work abstention
program from June 30, if private equipment is allowed to be used
in the port.

LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is concerned
with the devastation to the human resources by the AIDS as about
4,000 people die of the deadly disease in Zambia every year.

<P>
The remarks were made by Zambian Deputy Minister of Health Nkandu
Luo at the weekend at a function of the Rotary Club of Lusaka Central.
</P>
<P>
There are also other diseases like dysentery and cholera in the
country due to a lack of clean water and environments in most
townships, according to Luo.
</P>
<P>
She said that service clubs like Rotary and NGOs play an
important role in the development of the nation and the government
is keen to develop further its relationship with service clubs and
NGOs to ensure sustainable health delivery is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Luo noted, "Even the most beautiful health policies cannot be
achieved without being implemented. The government cannot reach the
grassroots and that is where the NGOs and service clubs come in."

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce New Airports Policy Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive airport policy
is being finalized by India's Civil Aviation Ministry to lay down
guidelines for all future private sector investments in airport
projects in efforts to develop the crucial infrastructure, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Whether foreign companies can hold a majority equity stake in
airport projects is under discussion among government departments
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The quantum of foreign equity for airport development was
likely to exceed the present 40 percent ceiling stipulated for
domestic air operations, as the government was in favor of
allowing foreign companies to invest majority funds in
capital-intensive infrastructure projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies are allowed to form joint ventures with
Indian firms and foreign equity up to 40 percent has been
permitted in operating domestic airlines. But there has been no
proposal yet to grant permission to bring 100 percent foreign
equity for airport development.
</P>
<P>
The airport development policy will also include a framework
for related projects such as multi-storeyed parking lots, hotels
and other airport infrastructure facilities, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Fire Engulfs A Gas Field in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Fire expert teams from Singapore and
United States are flying into Bangladesh to fight an ever-biggest
gas field fire which is still ranging today, said an official at
Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation.
</P>
<P>
A massive explosion in a gas well in Moulvibazar under
northeastern Sylhet division early Sunday sent fires leaping up to
160 meters.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties. However, many people
were missing, said a worker who escaped unhurt, and the
authorities have asked people in nearby villages to remain on red
alert.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that an area of about one and a half square km
was engulfed by the fire in the Magurachhara natural gas field,
which is being operated by Occidental of Bangladesh Ltd, a United
States company.
</P>
<P>
There were two explosions of such type in Sylhet in the 1950s
and in Chittagong in the 1960s respectively, but the fires caused
by these blasts were not as big as the present one.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was in a visit to Turkey on
Sunday, has asked all officials concerned to take immediate
measures to fight the fire.
</P>
<P>
All fire brigades in Sylhet division were kept stand-by. But
fire brigade officials said it was beyond their capacity to
control the raging blaze.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which has destroyed property worth tens of thousands
of U.S. dollars, including rig, trailor cars, cranes, also damaged
nearby rail tracks, cutting off direct rail transport from Sylhet
to the capital city Dhaka and Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
A high-level inquiry commission, comprising representatives
from local administrations and Occidental, has been formed to
investigate the cause of the devastating fire.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers said the fire broke out as gas was found at a
very early stage of drilling while they thought it would take very
deep digging.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government signed production-sharing contracts
two years ago with Occidental and another firm on exploration of
gas in eight out of 23 blocks in the natural gas-rich country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- India will need a massive 150
billion rupees (about 4.23 billion US dollars) investment over the
next decade in the crucial infrastructure sector to sustain annual
economic growth of 7-8 percent, said the government's latest study
published today.
</P>
<P>
India's per capita electricity consumption was less than
one-tenth of the global average and the penetration ratio of
telephone was still low at 1.5 per 100 people as compared to the
global average of 10 per 100, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure development held the key to the country's future
development, it said.
</P>
<P>
Though infrastructure was a major bottleneck, its development
also presents enormous opportunities for investors, particularly
foreign direct investors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Aware of this potential, the Indian government has taken some
initiatives to attract foreign investment, particularly in the
power sector, allowing 100 percent foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a five-year tax holiday is provided and it is followed
by a deduction of 25 percent for the next five years for
build-operate-own-transfer (BOOT) projects in power, roads,
high-ways, bridges, airports, ports, rail systems, water supply,
irrigation, sanitation and sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
Similar deductions are being considered for the
telecommunications sector.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A large international computer
fair will be held in North China's Tianjin from August 13 through
16. It's the latest stride the city is taking into its future,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China International Computer and Networking Show will bring
dozens of international computer vendors and their most advanced
computer hardware, application software, mass storage peripherals,
networking and communications and office management systems.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 visitors are expected at the show sponsored by
the Tianjin municipal government, the Ministry of Electronics
Industry and International Data Group of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Qu Weizhi said the fair will provide Tianjin with
the opportunity to become acquainted with the latest computer
technologies and promote international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Qu said the show will also help the city's Information Port
Project, considered a key step toward Tianjin's goal of becoming
an international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The project, started last year, will be completed in 2010. It
involves setting up 11 applications systems, nine databanks, a
public communications network and an information exchange network.
</P>
<P>
The applications systems cover banking and finance, commerce,
foreign trade, taxation, insurance, scientific research and
education.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has promised financial support to the
project and to provide preferential policies to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the project, Tianjin will become a main
manufacturing center for information technology equipment, with a
solid public communications network backbone and advanced
technological support.
</P>
<P>
Information technology is one of the municipal government's key
industries to be developed during its Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000). Tianjin was selected by the State to test
computer-aided-design technologies and business management
automation programs.

<HEADLINE> No Foreign Pilots Wanted: Nepali Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepali pilots threatened that if
the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) goes ahead with its
plan to "import" foreign pilots along with a Boeing 757 plane,
they would drag it to the court.
</P>
<P>
Nepali pilots said they have been flying Boeing 757 for ten
years, the plan ignores their skills and experience.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that Tajikistan, from whom the
Royal Nepal Airlines leases a Boeing 757, demanded that Nepal
accept both the crew and the plane because it leased the plane for
a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
But the Nepal Airlines Pilot Association (NAPA) has warned that
"to invite foreign pilots is to crush our rights. If they are
brought in despite our protests, we will be forced to go to the
court."
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Captain S.K. Sharma as saying that "we are
capable of flying the aircraft. Nepalis have been smoothly
operating Boeing 757 for the last ten years."
</P>
<P>
"Compared with foreign pilots, local pilots better understand
the geographical features of the country," said Sharman. "This has
been obvious from our experience."
</P>
<P>
The NAPA has submitted a protest letter to the prime minister,
deputy prime minister and minister for tourism and civil aviation
to urge the RNAC to reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the RNAC said the Tajiks have insisted on their
demand.
</P>
<P>
Nepali pilots had earlier protested the RNAC's plan to lease an
Airbus A 310 with its foreign crew.

products decreased sharply in the first eight months of the 1997
fiscal year starting on October 1 last year.

(2.89 U.S. billion dollars) in revenues during the eight months,
12 percent below the target.

<HEADLINE> Huge Lump of Natural Gold Found in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A lump of natural gold weighing
6,577.5 grams has been discovered in a gold mine in the Qilian
Mountain in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Pu Jianqing, an engineer with the Qinghai provincial gold
administration, said the huge lump of gold was discovered in a
15-meter deep pit on June 8 by the gold company of Menyuan
County in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the weight of the pure gold contained in the
lump would reach at least 4,500 grams, as the second largest piece
of natural gold ever found in the province.
</P>
<P>
A 7,709.55-gram lump of natural gold, the biggest of its kind,
was discovered by three farmers in Qaidam Basin in the western
part of Qinghai Province in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He said the new lump is in the shape of a "mother monkey"
squatting with a "baby monkey" in her arms. Most part of the gold
was covered by rock, and only the mother monkey's head and limbs
and the entire baby monkey are shining.
</P>
<P>
Pu said natural gold usually appears in three forms -- gold
wrapping stone, stone wrapping gold or gold containing liquid
inside.

<HEADLINE> CSCEC Eyes World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region,
witnessing a new era of fast economic growth, remains the target
for Chinese building contractors engaged in the worldwide
construction market.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic about a more dynamic international market,
with the Asian-Pacific area as the center," today's China Daily
quoted Xu Peng, vice-president of the China State Construction
Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Formerly the State Construction Engineering Administration,
CSCEC is now China's flagship transnational construction group
under direct supervision of the State Council. It was restructured
into a corporation in 1982.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of CSCEC's overseas construction business
has been in the Asia-Pacific region, including Hong Kong, Macao,
Viet Nam, Pakistan and other regions and countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Chinese building firms have begun to compete in the
world contracting market and their business has been growing.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it ranked 34th in the world's 225 largest contractors
and the world's seventh biggest housing constructor, according to
Xu.
</P>
<P>
CSCEC's annual overseas turnover grew to a high of 1.59 billion
US dollars last year, almost four times the 430 million US dollars
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
CSCEC has built more than 3,100 projects abroad, ranging from
schools, hospitals, factories, dams, power stations, airports,
irrigation systems, land reclamation, highways and bridges to
housing and municipal facilities. It also has undertaken many
foreign-aid construction projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, one of CSCEC's showpiece projects under
construction in Asia is the 10 billion HK dollars terminal
building of the new airport in Hong Kong. CSCEC is undertaking the
project with four overseas companies. The airport, which costs
more than 50 billion HK dollars, to open in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted CACEC also hopes to extend its business to other parts
of the world, such as Europe, the Middle East and the United
States, although he confessed "market competition in the regions
has been crucial."
</P>
<P>
Besides overseas branches, the 150,000-member State-owned
corporation includes eight domestic construction engineering
sub-bureaus, six domestic building design institutes and 44
domestic sub-companies.

<HEADLINE> Investments Surge in Philippine Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Investments in the Philippines'
economic zones surged to 92 billion pesos (3.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first five months this year, compared to the 14
billion pesos (530 million dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest investment level has already exceeded by 23 percent
the government-set target of 75 billion pesos (2.9 billion
dollars) for the entire year, today's press reports quoted
Economic Zone Authority Director-General Lilia de Lima as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investments for economic zones' development projects accounted
for the bulk of 52 billion pesos (about 2 billion dollars) with
the approval of 14 new economic zone projects.
</P>
<P>
According to De Lima, the authority was confident that the
10-billion-dollar exports target for the country's economic zones
this year would be surpassed.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has so far established 53 economic zones all
over the country, which have become one of the country's major
foreign reserve earners in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, exports from these economic zones reached 6.5 billion
dollars, accounting for more than one-third of the country's total
exports that year.

CHENGDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Since China started opening to the
outside world in late 1978, Sichuan province's privately-owned
enterprises have had 100 billion yuan in industrial output value

</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, the province has seen marked
increases in the number in these in the first five months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The growth comes because of preferential policies that

<HEADLINE> Interview: Civil Servants' Commitment Vital to HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The total commitment of civil
servants to serving the people of Hong Kong is vital to Hong
Kong's future, said Chau Tak Hay, Secretary for Broadcasting,
Culture and Sport.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Chau said, "I firmly
believe Hong Kong has a brilliant future, but that would require
the joint efforts from Hong Kong people as well as Hong Kong's
180,000 civil servants."
</P>
<P>
Having served for almost 30 years at Hong Kong's civil service,
the 54-year-old secretary has worked successively as
Director-General of Trade, Secretary for Health and Welfare,
Secretary for Trade and Industry, and Secretary for Broadcasting,
Culture and Sport.
</P>
<P>
Chau studied economics at the University of Hong Kong, where he
obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967. He believed that,
while what he had studied in university was not directly relevant
to his work, university education did provide him with the basic
analytical and problem-solving skills required to meet the many
challenges in his career.
</P>
<P>
Starting when he was in his twenties, Chau had participated for
many years in international negotiations on the export of Hong
Kong's textiles and clothing. He recalled that Hong Kong,
together with other developing countries and regions, had to face
unfair and discriminatory treatment by the developed countries in
those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The constant need to defend Hong Kong's interests vigorously
had instilled in him a strong attachment and a deep commitment to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1984, he was stationed in Geneva as Hong Kong's
permanent representative to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT). He was Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry
from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The frequent contacts and exchanges with the outside world help
him take a world view in looking into all matters.
</P>
<P>
Sine 1995, he has served as Secretary for Broadcasting, Culture
and Sport. He will also serve in the same position after July 1,
1997 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's position as a broadcasting hub in the Asia-Pacific
region is constantly being challenged by other cities in the
region," he said. The HKSAR must ensure that its broadcasting
policies, particularly those on satellite TV broadcasting, are
attractive to regional broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of the press is one of the major factors contributing
to Hong Kong's success as an international financial and business
center," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that press freedom was one of the freedoms guaranteed
by the Basic Law. He was confident that freedom of the press
would be maintained after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR,
had time and again assured Hong Kong people that they would
continue to have freedom of the press and expression.
</P>
<P>
On cultural policy, Chau said that it was natural that after a
hundred and fifty years' separation from the motherland, many Hong
Kong people did not have a very deep understanding of Chinese
history and culture.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the promotion of patriotism as well as national
history and values was entirely compatible with the maintenance of
an open and democratic society.
</P>
<P>
He felt that the process should start within the education
system first. Recent archaeological discoveries in Hong Kong
could also serve to cultivate a greater attachment among Hong Kong
people to Chinese history and culture.
</P>
<P>
In his spare time, Chau likes to watch news programs as well as
Chinese historical drama series on TV. During his recent trips to
Beijing, he bought video cassettes of TV dramas including "Empress
Wu Zetian", "Romance of Three Kingdoms", "Emperor Ming Huang of
the Tang Dyansty" and "Stories about the States of the Eastern
Zhou Dynasty".
</P>
<P>
He also enjoys watching movies, opera and reading. He said, "I
am an optimist by nature and I am very optimistic about Hong
Kong's future" he said.

SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the largest rebel group in the
country, today freed 70 government soldiers who had been held for
months.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were handed over to the representatives from the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the Colombian
Committee for National Reconciliation at the town of Cartagena Del
Chaira in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
An international monitoring group, including former Costa Rican

Guatemala Manuel Conde Orellana, attended the hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>

injured during that skirmish.
</P>
<P>
The other 10 were captured in an ambush in Choco province in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
In return for the release, Colombian President Ernesto Samper
accepted a FARC condition to demilitarize a 13,200-square
kilometer jungle zone in the Caguan River valley as of May 23.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not Ready to Liberalize Finance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not submit an
improved offer to liberalize its finance sector by the target date
of July 14 required by developed members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's commitments should be fulfilled based on a
progressive process as the government has to take into account the
development level of local businesses and their readiness to meet
competition, said Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, Thai ambassador to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also will take time to assess other members' offers,
he said in a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Some developed members, like the United States, Canada, the
European Union and Japan, insisted that the target date be met so
negotiations at WTO level could be settled by December this year,
according to Krirk-Krai.
</P>
<P>
Industrial powers are pressing other members, especially
Southeast Asian countries, to scrap all restrictions on foreign
investment in banking and insurance services, in particular in
foreign shareholdings and issuance of licenses for foreign banks
and insurance companies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some other developing members are also not to submit their
offers to meet the July 14 target date, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Tax Authorities Clamp Down on Evaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Tax authorities in south China's
city of Shenzhen, a boom town neighboring Hong Kong, are clamping
down on tax evaders and declaring that adamant offenders would be
severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Honochi Golf Leisure Club, a Sino-Japanese joint
venture, was recently found guilty of evading taxes totalling 70
million yuan. After the several warnings went unheeded by the
company, the local tax authorities in April confiscated 13 million
yuan from its bank accounts and publicly auctioned 10 of its
vehicles as its punishment.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the company still refused to pay up the
remainder of the amount due.
</P>
<P>
"Including the fine, the amount of money related to the case
has hit 130 million yuan, becoming the largest tax evasion case in
China," according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The punishment imposed on the company has exerted a strong
impact on similar offenders.
</P>
<P>
According to the tax authorities, a Japanese-funded steel
company, stunned by the action, recently approached the local tax
bureau and delivered 1.6 million yuan in back taxes due between
1994 and 1996.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Twice world champion Michael
Schumacher regained the lead in the drivers' championship when he
was declared the winner of the crash-hit Canadian Grand Prix on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari driver was two seconds ahead of second-placed Jean
Alesi after 54 laps of the scheduled 69-lap race when it was
halted because of a massive accident involving Alesi's fellow
Frenchman Olivier Panis.
</P>
<P>
Panis, in a Prost car, crashed after 51 laps at high speed
into the barriers, wrecking the front end of his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
He was lifted from the cockpit and taken by stretcher to the
circuit medical centre before being taken by helicopter to
hospital. The race continued behind a safety car for three laps
before being stopped.
</P>
<P>
Early reports at the circuit said Panis had suffered a broken
right leg and a suspected broken right arm. He was said to be
conscious and in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Victory lifted Schumacher to 37 points in the drivers'
championship, seven clear of nearest rival Jacques Villeneuve of
Canada who crashed out in front of his home fans on the second
lap.
</P>
<P>
Italian Giancarlo Fisichella recorded the best result of his
career to take third place for Jordan ahead of German
Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.

Goals by Marco Etcheverry and Julio Baldivieso gave the hosts

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today urged the parties in Congo Brazzaville to seek
peaceful solution to their conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General continues to be concerned about the
precarious situation in Congo Brazzaville," said a statement by the
U.N. spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
"He is gratified that the parties have agreed to seek a
negotiated solution to the conflict, and he urges them to
respect the cease-fire," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Annan also expressed his gratitude to the
Government of France for the excellent way in which it carried out
the evacuation of all foreign nationals, including the staff of
the United Nations, other international organizations and
non-organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conflict started in June after the government army
surrounded rebel leader Denis Sassou Nguesso's home as part of a
crackdown on private militias and unauthorized armies in the run-up
to a July 27 election.
</P>
<P>
The two sides declared a truce on Wednesday. But the fighting
resumed on Sunday after two days' lull. It is reported that the
envoys of the two sides left the capital earlier today for peace
talks in Gabon.

<HEADLINE> EU Jobs Summit in October Possible: Luxembourg Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg may call a special
summit meeting in October to address the European Union's high
unemployment, a spokesman for the Luxembourg delegation said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Several countries have approached us and we would be willing,"
Guy Schuller, spokesman for Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude
Juncker, told Reuter Newsagency.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a jobs summit was immediately confirmed by
Junker himself, whose country will hold the next six-month EU
presidency from July.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries have come with the idea of this. It seems to be
excellent under the condition that we know clearly what we want,"
Juncker told French daily Le Figaro in an interview to be
published in Monday's edition.
</P>
<P>
France demands that the issue of unemployment, which currently
affects one in nine EU citizens, should be dealt with as the
priority at the EU Amsterdam summit on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A job summit was being seen by EU officials on the sidelines of
the meeting as one possible way to acknowledge the demands of the
new French socialist government without making immediate promises
to commit funds to job creation schemes.
</P>
<P>
France has been demanding more attention be paid to employment
issues in the run-up to the launch of the Economic and Monetary
Union on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It wants funding for major infrastructure programs such as
Trans-European Networks(TENs) as a way for creating jobs. TENs
include road, rail and telecommunications links between and within
the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Germany has ruled out costly Europe-wide job-creation
programs, which, it argues, have in the past merely raised
inflation and interest rates and failed to cut unemployment. Bonn
believes that the way to fight joblessness is through structural
reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The cost of crime to the small
business sector is almost 6 billion pounds (9.6 billion US
dollars) a year, according to a report from the British Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that the average cost of a burglary is
5,865 pounds (9,384 US dollars), while the average cost of
vandalism is 2,595 pounds (4,152 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BBC has called on Home Secretary Tack Straw to help small
businesses in response to "this staggering bill".
</P>
<P>
The survey of 505 small companies showed that they expect to
suffer from crimes as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
It said that "85 percent of small businessmen are resigned to
the fact that they expect their businesses to be victimized at
some point in time".
</P>
<P>
Half of the respondents to the survey said that their business
had suffered from crimes in the past year, with each business being
hit three times on average.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, BBC deputy director-general, said: "The cost of
crimes on the small business community is totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"It affects all of us as it inflates prices, reduces
competitiveness and costs jobs," Peters added.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Begin Withdrawing from Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The 1,250 French troops stationed in
Brazzaville today began to withdraw from the Congo Republic after
completing their week long "Pelican Operation" of evacuating
foreigners, despite a "strident" appeal by Congolese President
Pascal Lissouba to them to stay.
</P>
<P>
French troops flew away the last group of 88 foreigners from
Brazzaville this afternoon to send them to Pointe-Noire in western
Congo which was spared of the fighting, and the Gabonese capital
Libreville, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
French troops evacuated a total of 6,000 foreigners, including
1,600 French nationals, since they began their operation on June
9, said the French military.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting resumed between the government troops and
the "Cobras" militiamen of former President Denis
Sassou-N'Guesso today in Brazzaville, on the eve of peace talks by
the warring sides to be held in Libreville.
</P>
<P>
"Cobras" launched offensive against government forces in a
bid to capture an air base of government troops near the
Brazzaville airport and the parliament building, according to
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
One of the representative of Sassou N'Guesso, Ambroise
Noumalazaye, said that the militiamen were responding to
bombardments by government forces on "three very populous
districts of Brazzaville" Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"The reprisals had as purpose to destroy the origin of the
firings and crush the dorsal spine of the forces of President
Lissouba," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congolese officials estimate that from 2,000 to 3,000 civilians
were killed in the violences which broke out on June 5.
