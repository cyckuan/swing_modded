Fujimori Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori appeared on Sunday to be headed
for a lopsided re-election victory in a runoff vote questioned by foreign
observers and boycotted by his opponent. Angered at what they considered a
rigged election process, hundreds of demonstrators trying to march to the
presidential palace were pushed back by riot police firing volleys of tear gas.
With 26.9 percent of the vote counted, Fujimori had 50.1 percent of the ballot
to Alejandro Toledo's 16.5 percent, election officials said. They said 32.4
percent of the ballots had been intentionally spoiled and 1 percent left blank.

Eritreans Flee Heavy Fighting

<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Fighting raged Sunday between the Horn of Africa's
warring neighbors on the eve of peace talks -- opening a new front in Eritrea's
smoldering humanitarian crisis. Infantry and artillery clashes in what's become
the heaviest fighting in the 2-year-old border war threaten to uproot 200,000
people around the central city of Mendefera, the United Nations warned. The
2-week-old Ethiopian offensive already has sent nearly one-seventh of Eritrea's
people fleeing north, some into neighboring Sudan.

train that derailed and caught fire at the edge of town. Saturday's blaze,
fueled by exploding rail cars that sent fireballs into the sky and ash raining
down on neighborhoods, had subsided to a few small fires Sunday. But the
smoldering wreckage of the seven rail cars that burned still contained hazards.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Lawmakers and rice farmers from Arkansas began a trip to Cuba
Sunday aimed at making agricultural contacts on this communist island and
showing support for a partial lifting of a U.S. trade embargo. ''We're anxious
to see how we can provide products and open up trade with Cuba,'' U.S. Sen.
Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat, said upon arriving Sunday night in Havana.

   PARIS (AP) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin opened an international
monetary conference Sunday reiterating his confidence in the euro, saying the

Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks edged up in early trading Monday as investors
hunted for bargains following a recent decline in share prices. The Nikkei rose
153.04 points to 16,161.18 points in the first 30 minutes of morning trading.
Prices were higher as investors snapped up underpriced issues following recent
declines. But investors were expected to begin selling shares before the Nikkei
225 reaches 16,300 because of growing concern over U.S. stocks, particularly
U.S. technology shares.

<HEADLINE> Suriname Elections Said Fair  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Suriname's elections last week were
fair, despite the omission of some voters from registration rolls,
the Organization of American States said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems forced election officials to hurriedly change rules
about identification of voters. The organization's 16-member
observer mission said in a written statement that there were few
problems at the polls during Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission concludes that Suriname has a strong election
tradition and an expert cadre as to organizing elections,''
observers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters selected hundreds of legislators and local government
officials on Thursday. The newly elected members of the National
Assembly will select a president from their number after the totals
are made official later this week.
</P>
<P>
   With only two polling stations left to count Sunday, officials
said the opposition New Front of former President Ronald Venetiaan
had won 79,156 of the 166,375 votes tallied, or about 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result gives the New Front 33 of the 51 National Assembly
seats, one short of the two-thirds needed to choose a president. To
win the needed seat, it was expected to strike an alliance with the
Democratic Alternative 91 Party or the Federation of Agrarians and
Farmhands Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Alternative 91 garnered 9,625 votes, or 5
percent; the Federation of Agrarians and Farmhands received 7,744
votes, or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Coalition of former military dictator Desi
Bouterse had 25,091 votes, or 15 percent. The Democratic National
Platform 2000 of incumbent President Jules Wijdenbosch only
mustered 16,449 votes, or 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The minority Palu Party won 1,207 votes, less than 1 percent but
enough to win one seat.

   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Terry Nichols, a backup defensive lineman
at Texas A&AMP;M, has been killed in a traffic accident in El Paso that
left three other people injured.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, 21, was killed about 11:15 p.m. Saturday when a car
crossed the center median in east El Paso and collided with the car
in which he was riding in the front seat, the El Paso Times

</P>
<P>
   Nichols was a former standout at El Paso Irvin High School.

   Police said Gordon Polley Jr., 19, of El Paso was westbound when
he struck the median and lost control of his 1991 Mitsubishi, which
crossed into the eastbound lanes and crashed into a 1993 Honda
driven by Ruby Williams, 21, of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols died at the scene, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Polley and back seat passenger Jara Harris, 22, of El Paso, were
taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Polley was the only
person in the Honda who was wearing seat belts, according to
police.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two climbers were reported missing Sunday and
presumed dead after an avalanche on Mount Foraker in Denali National Park and
Preserve. National Park Service spokeswoman Jane Tranel said another team of
climbers witnessed a mass of ice give way and heard screams and shouts at the
8,000-foot level of the mountain at about 1 p.m. Saturday. The two missing
climbers, whose names have not been released, were going up a route known as the
Infinite Spur, a steep route of ice and rock. Park rangers who flew to the site
said they saw an abandoned camp and two sets of footprints leading into the
avalanche zone. There was about 100 yards of avalanche debris, but no sign of
the climbers.

<HEADLINE> Russia-US Missile Deal Not Expected  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, doesn't expect any arms agreements from next
weekend's summit in Russia, but he dismissed George W. Bush's
suggestion that Clinton ought not try.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, suggested
last week that Clinton refrain from signing any arms pact. No
agreement would be better than one that ''ties the hands of the
next president and prevents America from defending itself,'' the
Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people elect their presidents for four years, not
for three years,'' Berger said Sunday on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
''The United States can't say to the world 'we're out of business'
for one year out of four.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Clinton's predecessor, Bush's father, signed
the last strategic arms control treaty in December 1992, after he
lost the election. Clinton ''is not going to act for the sake of
acting,'' Berger said, ''but he's not going to not act for the sake
of not acting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton will use the summit on June 4-5 to urge Russian
President Vladimir Putin to accept treaty modifications that would
allow deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system. He said Putin is
not expected to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the leaders will have a full agenda for their first
official get-together, with three additional meetings probable this
year. Subjects will include Russian economic change, regional
issues such as Korea and Chechnya and stopping the spread of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we're certainly going to talk about these arms-control
issues,'' Berger said, but ''I do not expect any agreements to be
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   As ordered by Congress, the United States is working to develop
a system to intercept missiles fired by countries that the
administration calls ''rogue states.'' Those mentioned Sunday by
Berger and by Defense Secretary William Cohen, on NBC's ''Meet the
Press,'' are North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good opportunity for us to explain our view of
the threat and President Putin to talk about his concerns,'' Berger
said. The idea is to ''see whether we can understand each other
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves tonight for Portugal, which currently heads the
15-nation European Union, to meet with EU ministers. En route to
Russia, he stops over in Germany for an informal gathering of world
leaders. A stop in Ukraine has been added after Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In their discussions Wednesday at Queluz Palace outside Lisbon,
EU leaders plan to discuss such questions as the Balkan problem,
Internet matters and AIDS in Africa. The meeting is the latest in a
series that began in 1990 between the world's two largest trading
blocs.

<HEADLINE> Laos Bombing Injures 20  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) -- A bomb ripped through an indoor shopping
market in Vientiane, injuring about 20 people, three of them
seriously, in the latest blast to rock the capital of communist
Laos, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon's explosion destroyed one stall in the Morning
Market, near some gold shops. A shopkeeper said the bomb was placed
underneath a stone seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a miracle no one was killed,'' he said, without giving
his name.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred on the final day of an official visit to
Laos by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. A Thai foreign ministry
official said the premier had already returned to Thailand at the
time of the blast
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, there have been four blasts in
Vientiane, normally one of the most placid capitals in Southeast
Asia. The United States and Australian embassies have issued travel
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Hmong insurgents have been fighting the communist regime
since it took power 25 years ago. There has been an upsurge in
unrest in remote central and northern areas of the country this
year but guerrillas have rarely, if ever, staged attacks in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The regime, which monopolizes political power in Laos, one of
Asia's poorest nations, has come under mounting criticism for the
country's economic problems and for repressing it's critics.
</P>
<P>
   The last attack on May 4 outside a state-run hotel also
coincided with an official visit to Laos by senior Thai government
delegation, leading to speculation the blasts could be intended to
embarrass the Laotian regime.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign diplomat in Vientiane said the first three explosions
had arisen from private business disputes, but Sunday's explosion
had happened in an open area where people congregate perhaps
suggesting a political motive.
</P>
<P>
   A Laotian foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment about
the explosion.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Appears Headed for Victory  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori headed to a
lopsided victory in an election boycotted by his challenger, who
urged thousands of his supporters gathered in the capital to
peacefully resist the election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of demonstrators tried to march toward the presidential
palace late Sunday but riot police drove them back with tear gas.
There were no immediate reports of injuries and tens of thousands
of Fujimori foes demonstrated peacefully nearby.
</P>
<P>
   With just over half of the vote counted, Fujimori had 50.3
percent of the ballot to Alejandro Toledo's 16.2 percent, election
officials said late Sunday, adding that 32.4 percent of the ballots
had been defaced and 0.8 percent left blank. Final results were
expected Wednesday, at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Promising jobs and capitalizing on his Indian appearance, Toledo
made a surprising surge in the first round of voting April 9. But
Fujimori fought back, depicting the U.S.-trained economist as a
populist who would plunge the country back into the political chaos
and hyperinflation of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors withdrew before the election after warning that
a fair vote could not be guaranteed. They wanted to delay Sunday's
runoff to be able to evaluate new software for tabulating votes,
but election officials refused, prompting international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Toledo supporters massed Sunday on a
central Lima plaza in a nighttime outpouring to shout their
opposition to a Fujimori victory.
</P>
<P>
   From there a breakaway group of hundreds of students marched
toward Fujimori's official residence, the palace, but were
repeatedly driven back amid tear gas. Some 1,000 riot police
guarded the palace before the protests began subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators set garbage ablaze in the streets and
vandalized ATM machines and public telephones.
</P>
<P>
   On the San Martin Plaza six blocks away, the scene was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come to tell the people of Peru, 'Enough of this
dictatorship!''' said Toledo, 54, addressing a roaring, festive
crowd from a podium overlooking the plaza. ''Fujimori has taken off
his mask and killed democracy in Peru!''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated calls for ''peaceful resistance'' to Sunday's
election results after a day in which riot police fought Fujimori
opponents in sporadic street clashes in downtown Lima. Only a few
officers watched the crowd on the plaza as Toledo said: ''Let's not
be provoked to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators waved banners reading ''No to Fraud!'' while
chanting, ''The dictatorship will fall!''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Toledo rallies were reported elsewhere nationwide, and one
march by 30,000 people in the central Andean city of Huancayo
turned violent when vandals broke the windows of public offices.
</P>
<P>
   The events unfolded after a largely peaceful vote in which long
lines formed outside polling stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who said he did not cast a ballot, had originally urged
Peruvians to boycott the runoff election. But voting is compulsory,
and he later told voters to spoil their ballots by scrawling on
them: ''no to fraud.'' Failure to vote is punishable by a $33 fine
in a country where the monthly minimum wage is less than $120.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori gave no speech and made no public appearance Sunday
after the voting ended. Earlier, he cast his ballot in Lima and
said the absence of foreign observers would not take away from the
''validity'' of what he called a free and fair vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an election in which there are two candidates because
Mr. Toledo has not withdrawn,'' he said, noting Toledo was still on
the ballot despite his boycott and unsuccessful attempts to have
his photo and name removed.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, 61, who came to power in 1990, counted on Peru's poor
majority to help him win. His support is solid in the sprawling
shantytowns on Lima's outskirts, where he has paved streets,
installed electricity, built schools and provided soup kitchens for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   During the first round of voting, Fujimori won 49.9 percent of
the ballot, just shy of the majority he needed to avoid a runoff
against Toledo, who collected 40.2 percent and afterward complained
that fraud prevailed. Election officials were unable to explain how
the number of ballots cast exceeded the number of voters by more
than 1.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Hantavirus Threat  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- As people begin trekking to the outdoors this
season, scientists are warning that the mystery disease hantavirus
is a threat throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   Once thought to mainly haunt the Four Corners area of the
Southwest, doctors say it has proved deadly from Canada to
Argentina. And late spring is the deadliest season as people begin
cleaning barns and stables, and head to the hills to hike, bike and
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get calls from people in California saying we're going to
New Mexico and asking how to avoid hantavirus. We say there are
cases in California, too. We need to change some thinking there,''
said Joni Young, hantavirus surveillance coordinator for the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   CDC studies have found the virus, carried by deer mice, likely
is as widespread in the East as in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''Healthy, active people are more likely to become infected
because their activities often put them in contact with the
virus,'' a CDC advisory says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service over the weekend said it has warned
visitors of parks of the disease. ''Essentially, we assume all
parks have hantavirus,'' said Joseph Winkelmaier, a public health
consultant for the Pacific West region of the park service.
</P>
<P>
   Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome begins much like a flu, with
muscle aches and a fever, followed by shortness of breath and
coughing. It typically progresses rapidly, requiring ventilation
and hospitalization within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Vermont became the 31st state to confirm a case. As
of May 8, 250 cases had been reported in the United States since it
was first identified in 1993. Of those, 101 victims died.
</P>
<P>
   This year California, Kansas and Colorado have each reported one
death.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities reported the death Friday of a 68-year-old
southwestern Manitoba woman of the disease, bringing their death
toll to 13. Also on Friday, California officials reported the
second case this spring in Yolo County in the north. The victim is
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Artsob of the Canadian Science Center for Human and
Animal Health in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said all confirmed cases of
the virus in Canada have been in the western provinces. ''But we
find the virus coast-to-coast in deer mice and the potential for
the disease exists across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is spread through rodent urine, feces or saliva, people
typically contract the disease in rural areas by inhaling the virus
particles while cleaning out a rodent-infested space, such as a
barn, cabin or stable.
</P>
<P>
   Young, Artsob and Colorado state epidemiologist John Pape say
there is no doubt many cases go undetected because doctors are not
familiar with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''It becomes a surveillance phenomenon, like the plague.
Physicians here think about it because they have cases nearly every
year. Doctors back East usually wouldn't think of it,'' said Pape.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Police Working in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Five years ago, international
peacekeepers had to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina to enforce the
truce that ended a bitter war among its three main ethnic
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an ethnically mixed police contingent from that Balkans
state is far from home helping keep the peace in East Timor as the
new nation recovers from the bloodshed and destruction of its break
from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Policing the aftermath of a war is a rare task for most
officers. For the Bosnians who arrived in April, it's an all too
familiar routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we Bosnians have a lot of experience with the
same kind of problems facing East Timor,'' said Sgt. Samir Muslic,
a Slavic Muslim, his shaved head glistening in the tropical sun as
he walks a beat amid the ruins of Dili, East Timor's capital. ''We
know how these conflicts start and how to work to resolve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia has made some progress toward rebuilding a unified
society, but its Muslims, Serbs and Croats remain deeply divided
and reconciliation efforts still face strong resistance from ethnic
extremists. About 24,000 peacekeepers remain in Bosnia enforcing
the accord that ended the 1992-94 war, which killed 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was told that Bosnia was prepared to contribute
policemen, I was truly elated because it was the first such
opportunity to see Bosnians from different backgrounds
participating in a U.N. operation after having themselves benefited
by what the U.N. did in Bosnia,'' said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the
world body's chief representative in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The half-island state was devastated last year when
pro-Indonesian militias went on a rampage after the territory's
people voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds were killed and 250,000 fled their homes to seek refuge
in other parts of Indonesia. Whole towns and villages were reduced
to rubble. Families suffered the horror of rape and murder of loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Peace was restored with the arrival of an Australian-led
multinational military force. Eight months later, 8,300 U.N.
soldiers still are stationed here to make sure the violence does
not re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is administering the territory while it
builds up a government structure, including a new police force.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, 1,200 police officers from 37 nations are
scattered across the mountainous territory, settling property
disputes and protecting returning refugees as well as
pro-Indonesian sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Their duties also include mundane police work such as dealing
with drunken teen-agers on Saturday nights and enforcing newly
introduced traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the tropical island is not exactly paradise for the
dozen Bosnian officers. Living accommodations are spartan and the
heat is unrelenting. They all miss Bosnian food.
</P>
<P>
   ''East Timor is a dangerous place -- not because of guns, though,
but because of mosquitoes,'' Muslic said, referring to the malaria
and other mosquito-borne diseases already plaguing the peacekeepers
and U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 12 men have built strong bonds and feel united in
their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that we've gotten to know each other, we've come to trust
each other,'' said Mirko Luzic, a Serb. ''The problems in our
homeland are now mainly between politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his office in Sarajevo, Douglas
Coffman, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Bosnia, said that when
the police unit was first assembled for training, officers from
different ethnic groups sat in separate parts of the classroom.
Within a few days, however, they were all mixed up, laughing and
joking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message for the local people in East Timor is that former
enemies can work together, even keep the peace somewhere else,''
Coffman said.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Said Dreamed of Skydiving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The man who hijacked a Philippine
Airlines jet and died after leaping out of the plane with a
homemade parachute had once dreamed of floating through the sky,
his brother said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He longed to be a skydiver,'' Rannie Chua said of his older
brother, Reginald. ''But he had never jumped before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Chua wore a ski mask and swimming goggles and armed
himself with a grenade and a pistol to hijack Thursday's flight
from southern Davao City to Manila.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the pilot of the Airbus 330 to turn back to Davao,
but when he was told there was not enough fuel, he ordered the crew
to collect money from the passengers. He then had the plane descend
to 6,000 feet and jumped from a rear door with a homemade
lavender-colored parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw him separate from the parachute in midair. He
plunged to his death on a mountain in Real, Quezon province, 40
miles east of Manila. His body, nearly buried in mud, was recovered
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His brother said in an interview with the Radio Mindanao Network
that Reginald Chua collected books on skydiving.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother, who managed the family's corn milling
business in Matanao, Davao del Sur province, was deeply hurt after
their father was killed in 1993 and he stopped going to school.
</P>
<P>
   The family believes the father's killing was sparked by a
business rivalry. No suspect has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chua's mother said her son wanted to make more money
so he could move the family away from their community because he
could not bear to see the people involved in his father's murder
roaming free.
</P>
<P>
   The man was first identified by airline officials as Augusto
Lakandula, the name on his ticket. He carried a resident
certificate with the name Augusto Lakandula and a driver's license
that identified him as Reginald Chua.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit alleging rape by Delta steward nears federal trial  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It began as a routine layover for the crew of a
Delta Airlines flight arriving in Rome from New York on March 16,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching their hotel at midday, flight attendants Penny Ferris
and Michael Young decided to unwind by sharing wine and sandwiches
in his room. Ferris remembers ''starting to feel sleepy and a real
heaviness in my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   What Ferris says happened next in Room 609 of the Savoy Hotel
has resulted in a nasty legal dispute pitting her against her
alleged attacker and the nation's third largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed last year in Brooklyn federal court, Ferris,
51, claimed Young spiked her wine with a date rape sedative,
leaving her helpless as he methodically molested and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 39, says it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff also accused the airline of knowing that Young had
a history of sexually harassing fellow attendants and of doing
nothing to stop him before he went too far. Delta denies the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The case is going forward despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
mid-May saying women cannot sue their attackers in federal court.
That's because it involved a broader claim against a third party,
Delta, and because it was too close to trial to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a jury of six men and six women will begin hearing
testimony -- including that of Ferris and Young -- to decide whether
the rape occurred. If jurors believe Ferris, Young would be liable
for damages, and a second trial with another jury would decide if
Delta should be held liable as well.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges Delta has condoned a ''sexualized environment''
in which female employees are degraded and subjected ''to unwelcome
and inappropriate touching and verbal and visual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's attorney, Robert Conway, would not discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But in a deposition, Young, of Dallas, denied ever assaulting or
harassing any co-workers. He also said he was never alone with
Ferris in Rome that day.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, meanwhile, contends it has a long record of
enforcing strict policies against sexual harassment. It says that
on learning of Ferris' allegations, it launched an internal
investigation, which led to Young's suspension; he later resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said airline officials ''are very
concerned about these allegations and ... looking forward to
learning the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the case reach a second phase against Delta, other flight
attendants who Ferris' lawyers say were harassed by Young could
testify. But for now, the dispute's outcome hinges almost solely on
the word of Ferris and Young.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' attorneys describe her as a reliable 30-year employee
who won a 1998 Flight Attendant of the Year award. A divorced
mother of two adult daughters who lives in Lake Arrowhead, Calif.,
she has continued to work on international flights while pursuing
her suit, attorney Duane Klapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she tells a compelling story,'' Klapp said. ''There's
no reason she would make this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' story is detailed in both a November 1999 deposition and
an anguished report submitted to the airline before she sued.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Young,'' she wrote, ''used my body without my
permission!''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said that Young, whom she didn't know before the
Rome flight, told her on the plane that he was a weightlifter and
male stripper. In Rome, Young urged her to come to his hotel room
to share some red wine. She had no romantic interest in him, partly
because she suspected he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ferris said in her deposition, ''It's like a fraternity
on the airlines. ... We trust one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris recalled sitting on the bed opposite Young while they had
lunch and watched television. After finishing about a half glass of
wine, she began to feel tired -- so tired that she couldn't move her
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said she told Young she wanted to go back to her
room, but he encouraged her to lie down. She said she remembers him
pulling off her clothes over her protests.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferris faded in and out of consciousness over the next few
hours, she realized Young was raping and sodomizing her, she said.
But she said she was powerless to fight him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like I was dead weight or something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris remembers stumbling back to her own room hours later.
When Young tried to make small talk with her on the flight back to
New York, she asked him what went wrong the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things just happened,'' she recalled him replying.
</P>
<P>
   But in his own deposition, Young said he never had a problem
with any flight attendant and directly denied the alleged encounter
with Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even recall this lady,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New book 'Make Love, Not War' traces history of sexual revolution  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the early 1960s, the nation's libido sought
liberty in a landscape drawn by Puritan forebear.
</P>
<P>
   Take 1962, for example. The president of Vassar College tells
female undergraduates sex before marriage is grounds for expulsion.
And Helen Gurley Brown, in ''Sex and the Single Girl,'' advises
young women: ''Not having slept with the man you're going to marry
I consider lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ''Make Love, Not War. The Sexual Revolution: An
Unfettered History,'' author David Allyn measures the distance
between the attitudes of Vassar's president and author Brown in
unraveling the many factors that contributed to the nation's
changing notions of sex in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Allyn pointed out how unusual was Brown's
bragging of her own sexual exploits, noting most women at the time
would be ashamed to admit to having sex before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''People would look at you as a whore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nothing had an impact on women's sex lives more than
the birth control pill. In 1960, the pill was licensed by the Food
and Drug Administration. It ''gave women a greater sense of sexual
freedom than any contraceptive device that had come before,'' Allyn
writes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which sometimes seems academic, includes an exhaustive
bibliography and a multitude of interviews with those involved
firsthand in the erotic upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn introduces leaders such as Jefferson Poland, the founder
of the Sexual Freedom League, who preached free love and instigated
the first demonstration for homosexual rights in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers a look at how private Americans' lives were
transformed. Interracial sex, cohabitation, homosexuality,
communes, group sex and swinging are all included in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Eunice and Trevor Lake, of Indiana, were swingers -- a couple who
engaged in swapping partners. Eunice kept a journal of her
experiences and in one entry from the 1970s declared how happy and
''open to life'' she felt after a communal erotic experience with
another couple. She later declared, ''Happiness is conformity? No
way!!''
</P>
<P>
   So when Allyn visited the couple decades later -- and they
invited their former swinger friends to gather and discuss their
experiences -- he was struck by an answer to one of his questions.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the group, who ranged in age from their 50s to 70s, how
they would feel if they learned that a son was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''One said, 'I'd throw them out of the house,''' Allyn said.
''It was sort of sad. They weren't the heroes I thought they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was very difficult to know if the sexual revolution
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn points out the gains the revolution made, including
acceptance of premarital sex and birth control, legalization of
abortion, greater freedom for gays, interracial marriage and
lessening of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   And in the epilogue he writes, ''But overall, the sexual
revolutionaries of the '60s and '70s did not accomplish nearly as
much as they had hoped they would.''

<HEADLINE> 37 years after 'Feminine Mystique,' Betty Friedan remains provocative </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- She was reluctant to divorce the husband who she
says gave her a few black eyes, and insists that she shares the
blame for their fights.
</P>
<P>
   She dismisses ''Take Our Daughters to Work Day'' as ''BLAH! A
big hype.''
</P>
<P>
   And like any other proud but forgetful grandma, she boasts about
her offspring -- only to repeat herself, word for word, a half-hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   Even a feminist like Betty Friedan -- now 79 and the author of a
new memoir, ''Life So Far'' -- never tires of telling strangers:
''My children turned out beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these paradoxes -- refusing to term herself a victim of
domestic violence, rejecting anything she deems ''politically
correct,'' chatting about ''my son, the theoretical physicist'' --
are why Friedan remains so intriguing and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   From across a hotel lobby, she looks like somebody's elderly
aunt in town for afternoon tea, in a white pantsuit, big-brimmed
sun hat and flat, soft-soled shoes. But a few minutes' conversation
demonstrates that while age, asthma and heart problems have slowed
her and dulled her hearing and memory, they have not softened her
opinions or the rage that fired ''The Feminine Mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   That book, published in 1963, helped launch the women's movement
by depicting women as prisoners of a culture that made a fetish out
of motherhood and housework while barring them from careers or
intellectual pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan wrote ''Life So Far,'' her sixth book, because she felt
several recent biographies of her ''didn't get it.'' One of them,
Daniel Horowitz's ''Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminine
Mystique,'' asserts that Friedan's feminism grew out of her
left-wing politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's wrong! He's full of it!'' she scowls. ''I actually did
live the life of a suburban housewife! I was fired for being
pregnant with my second child! ... There was actually a reality
limiting and restricting the life of women in society. I was there,
and I lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Life So Far,'' Friedan credits part of the success of ''The
Feminine Mystique'' to her husband Carl Friedan's knack for public
relations. But she also thinks her celebrity sparked physical
fights between them.
</P>
<P>
   ''In those years when women didn't even have careers, suddenly,
you know, I was famous. I was making more money than he and it was
threatening,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she eschews the words ''domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't even have that term then,'' she says. ''I didn't
really consider it an abusive marriage. We just fought a lot. I was
a good fighter. I was no passive victim. But if the fight did come
to more than words, he was bigger, and I'd get the black eyes. This
was just in the last year or so of our marriage, and ultimately I
got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Friedan has launched a Web site, at www.carlfriedan.com, to
refute the descriptions of physical violence in ''Life So Far,''
which he refers to as ''So Far Out.'' ''I was the victim, not
her,'' he said in a phone call. ''She would come at me in a
scuffle.'' Asked if she ever got a black eye during their fights,
he said: ''A couple of times probably, but it was me in reaction to
her. I categorically deny that I initiated anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Life So Far'' begins in Peoria, Ill., where Betty Goldstein
was born and raised. Her Russian-Jewish father was a jeweler who
provided maids, tennis lessons and the latest New York fashions for
his wife and three children; her mother played bridge, shopped and
volunteered, but the emptiness of that life turned her into a
shrew.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan escaped the intellectual and emotional suffocation of
those early years by attending Smith College, an elite women's
school in Northampton, Mass. There she excelled, winning academic
honors and getting her senior thesis published in a psychology
journal. But she turned down a prestigious fellowship to study
psychology after a boyfriend broke up with her, saying: ''I'm never
going to win a fellowship like that.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent the next decade reporting for the Federated Press, a
left-wing news agency, and United Electrical News, a union paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''But don't think I got the women's stuff from there because I
didn't,'' she says. ''The left, liberal, radical, whatever -- they
were as bad on women as conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband had the first of their three children in
1948. She went back to work as a reporter a year later, but lost
her job after getting pregnant again. Her husband left community
theater, where he had eked out a living producing plays and
writing, for more steady work in advertising, and they moved to a
big house in a Rockland County suburb north of New York City. She
supplemented his income writing ''mundane, inane'' articles for
women's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Feminine Mystique'' grew out of a questionnaire she
circulated among Smith alumnae to find out how these educated women
felt about being relegated to home and children. She later
interviewed other women, folded in the history of suffragettes, and
critiqued ads for refrigerators and cake-mixes as a societal plot
to turn women into consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't writing just about myself. I was writing from the
passion of personal truth,'' Friedan says. But her memoir shows
that many of the things she documented in ''The Feminine Mystique''
as happening in society had happened to her -- right down to writing
''housewife'' as her occupation on the Census form instead of
''writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ''Life So Far'' reads like a series of chatty,
impressionistic letters from someone in a hurry to get a lifetime
down on paper. The result is a conversational read that sometimes
gets bogged down in trivia and other times suffers from a
mind-boggling sloppiness, like when Friedan writes of family leave
in the United States: ''What is it now, nine weeks, 12 weeks?'' or
when she states that women provide half the income in half of U.S.
families and adds, ''I may not be remembering that percentage
completely accurately, but it's pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that no editor cared enough to check a simple statistic
or camouflage an aging author's uncertain recollection for a book
that will become part of the historical record on how women's roles
changed in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ''Life So Far'' documents Friedan's role in the growth
of the women's movement as a founding member of the National
Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights Action
League. But if you're looking for gossip about infighting or
Friedan's strained relations with people like Gloria Steinem, you
won't find it here.
</P>
<P>
   ''People writing about the women's movement always want to
exaggerate whatever differences existed between the leaders,'' she
says. ''They don't do that with men! They understood that men who
are in major movements don't always agree with each other. Why
expect women to?''
</P>
<P>
   As for her fight to limit the role of lesbians in the women's
movement, she says: ''I was right to fight it. It would have been
wrong to see the whole women's movement as a movement of lesbians,
because the great majority of women in America are not. They love
men for better or for worse. They get married to men and have
children with men. If anything, I was always a majoritarian -- I was
a mainstream feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, she says, she is a strong supporter of gay
rights. ''There's a real acceptance in the last five years that
there are many ways of loving, and that's wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan now directs a policy institute in Washington, D.C., on
women and work called The New Paradigm that is associated with
Cornell University, and she periodically teaches Cornell students
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But she's less informed about current hot topics among women
than might be expected, expressing surprise when asked about the
gulf between stay-at-home moms and working mothers and skeptical
when informed that polls show white women are reluctant to support
Hillary Rodham Clinton for Senate. ''Where did you read this?'' she
demands to know, as if it might not be true.
</P>
<P>
   But she insists that the women's movement is not obsolete:
''It's in society. It's all over the place. Some of the things we
fought for are now taken for granted by our daughters and our
granddaughters. Whether or not women should work -- it's not a
debate, it's a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her contribution, she says: ''Women looked at themselves
and their lives very differently and were seen by society very
differently than they are today. ... Wife, mother, housewife -- she
really wasn't supposed to be a person herself. That's certainly not
true now. And I helped make the change.''

<HEADLINE> Amish Aim To Curb Underage Drinking  </HEADLINE>
By AMY BETH GRAVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLEFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- It's Saturday night, party night.
Dozens of teens are gathered in a town parking lot, eating fast
food and joking around. Many leave when they discover the site of a
party where beer will be flowing all night.
</P>
<P>
   Some leave in their black horse-drawn buggies.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish in this northeast Ohio city have long struggled to
curb underage drinking in their community. The problem has been
serious enough that despite their tradition of avoiding the outside
world, Amish leaders have reached out to police and judges in
recent years for help breaking up drinking parties and doling out
tough sentences to offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some Amish families, while they don't condone it, they
overlook it because they want the kids to get this out of their
system,'' said Middlefield police Chief David Easthon.
</P>
<P>
   The number of alcohol-related arrests appears to be down, but
authorities say it remains a problem in this farming and industrial
area 30 miles east of Cleveland. Geauga County is home to more than
6,000 Amish -- one of the nation's largest settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish live a simple lifestyle and shun modern conveniences
such as cars, telephones and electricity. Someone born into an
Amish family is not automatically a member -- they decide in their
late teens and early 20s whether to join.
</P>
<P>
   It's just before that crucial decision that young people
sometimes ''sow their wild oats'' because the partying stops as
soon as they join the church, Easthon said.
</P>
<P>
   Chardon Municipal Judge Craig Albert said it was after he
sentenced three Amish teens to 60 days in jail for violating the
terms of their probation for underage drinking convictions that
Amish leaders asked him for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 30 days, the Amish community was begging and
complaining. They wanted the kids to go to church and I let them
out. It was a real wakeup call,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   He and the county sheriff gave a series of speeches to about
1,600 Amish adults and teens on drinking's dangers and penalties.
The speeches featured an Amish man who was an alcoholic. After the
talks, the number of arrests trailed off until last summer,
according to the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are quick to note that drinking among Amish youth is
not as widespread as it is in the rest of the teen-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Albert said the dozens of Amish alcohol-related cases he deals
with yearly are a small portion of his caseload. Very few Amish are
repeat offenders, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The drinking usually takes place during the warm months at
bonfire parties that can attract up to 200 youths. Police often
rely on tips to find the parties because most are hidden on rural,
private farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't seem to think they're doing anything wrong. They'll
bring the cases of beer out in the open as they unload them,'' said
sheriff's spokesman John Hiscox.
</P>
<P>
   The problem gained attention last September when a 17-year-old
Amish boy passed out in the front seat of his buggy, and his horse
trotted home on its own through dangerous intersections. Police
weren't able to rouse the teen by blaring their sirens and horns.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-mile, low-speed chase, the buggy hit a police
cruiser and overturned, ejecting the youth. His injuries were
minor, but the teen was arrested. So was his 21-year-old Amish
buddy who bought him the 12-pack of beer for a party.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a serious thing, but people perceived it as being
funny but it's not funny,'' Easthon said. ''The horse doesn't know
when to stop for signs. It was a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers have been working at cutting off Amish teens' access to
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, stores often would let Amish buy alcohol without
showing any identification because they don't have driver's
licenses, Easthon said. Now stores and the town's two bars are
supposed to ask for a state identification card for any Amish
person who looks underage.
</P>
<P>
   And officials are keeping an eye out for taxi drivers buying
large quantities of alcohol because they have been known to sell it
to Amish youths for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Myers has been trying to steer Amish teens away from
alcohol through Turning Point, an alcohol awareness class. Juvenile
Court Judge Charles Henry orders about 50 Amish youngsters every
year to take the class, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the county's 39 Amish schools also have Drug Abuse
Resistance Education courses. The DARE program teaches students the
dangers of drugs and alcohol and how to resist peer pressure.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Release UN Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's hostage crisis
appeared to be over after the release of the last of some 500 U.N.
workers who had been held hostage by Revolutionary United Front
rebels for more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said 85 captives arrived late
Sunday in Freetown from neighboring Liberia, whose president,
Charles Taylor, had been negotiating for a steady stream of hostage
releases in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Liberian military official said more hostages were
waiting on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border and would be flown out
today. Wimhurst could not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's spokesman, Fred
Eckhard, said Annan ''hopes that the freeing of the remaining
peacekeepers will help create conditions in which the long and
agonizing search for peace and stability in Sierra Leone can at
last be brought to a successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear why RUF rebels had decided to release their
hostages, most of whom were Zambian. Neither the United Nations nor
Taylor, the RUF's closest regional ally, released any details.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hostages freed Sunday were in good shape, although
some were being treated for malaria, minor injuries and fatigue,
said medical officials in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very happy. I thought we were never going to reach this
place. Thank God we are here,'' said Zambian Lance Cpl. Elias
Mwanza in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
   Mwanza, who suffered from a swollen jaw and other injuries, said
some of the captors had tormented the hostages while others were
kinder and promised not to kill them ''because we are their African
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Four peacekeepers who were unaccounted for were believed to have
been killed in fighting when the hostage crisis first began May 6,
Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 23 Indian peacekeepers remained surrounded by rebels in
the eastern Sierra Leonean village of Quiver, but were not
considered hostages and had been allowed to keep their weapons,
Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the releases, fighting between rebels and pro-government
forces was reported over the weekend at the strategic crossroads of
Rogberi Junction, 50 miles east of Freetown, Wimhurst said. He had
no further details.
</P>
<P>
   West African heads of state gathered for weekend meetings in the
Nigerian capital, Abuja, to discuss the crisis in Sierra Leone.
Informal talks were held Saturday and the main gathering was
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, 143 hostages were flown from Monrovia to
Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. The 85 released Sunday came in
three batches from remote northeastern Sierra Leone to Monrovia,
then went on to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF is a secretive and isolated group notorious for its
diamond dealing and atrocities against civilians. Its followers
have killed tens of thousands of people and intentionally mutilated
many more during Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war. The conflict
reignited earlier this month when the rebels took the U.N.
peacekeepers hostage and began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a ragtag alliance of pro-government forces has tried
to push the rebels away from the capital. The rebels' leader, Foday
Sankoh, is in government custody and officials have said they may
prosecute him for illegal diamond dealing and the killings of 21
people during a public demonstration outside his home earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Any prosecution of Sankoh threatens to spark an escalation of
civil war. Sankoh's rebels have reportedly demanded his release.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was convicted and sentenced to death for treason once
before in 1998 but was released and given amnesty under a peace
accord signed last July. His rebels abandoned the deal in early
May.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de
Mora and Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork were killed Wednesday in
an ambush by RUF rebels in Sierra Leone. South African cameraman
Mark Chisholm and Greek photographer Yannis Behrakis suffered light
injuries in the same attack.

<HEADLINE> Rudy Giuliani Said Going Soft  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Something distinctly un-New York has happened
here of late.
</P>
<P>
   When no one was looking, it seems, someone implanted the sweet
and gentle disposition of a mayor of some modest-sized Midwestern
burg into the honorable Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's famously
ill-tempered leader.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. In the city of hard knocks, Rudy's gone soft.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, the old, combative Rudy counted among his favorite
words ''pathetic'' and ''jerky,'' the new, introspective Rudy is
all about ''love.'' In a recent television interview he used the
word a dozen times in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a word that crossed Rudy's lips publicly only sparingly --
and then only to insist that his plan of taking children away from
homeless mothers who refuse to work is compassionate public policy.
</P>
<P>
   This was bad, old Rudy about whom former Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower once said, ''They say if you want to
keep the beer real cold, put it next to Rudy's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened since then.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks, Giuliani, who turned 56 on Sunday, was
diagnosed with prostate cancer; announced he was separating from
his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover; and, dropped out of the U.S.
Senate race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of old remarks made by Giuliani -- and
collected in the recently published book ''Sayings of Generalissimo
Giuliani,'' edited by Kevin McAuliffe -- contrasted with statements
he made in the past few weeks as the new Rudy emerged.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1998, old Rudy said goodbye to the old year with a
kiss-off to his fellow New Yorkers: ''If people like my
personality, thank you. If you don't, I really don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   But on April 28, 2000 -- the day after he disclosed he had
treatable prostate cancer -- a more mellow Rudy thanked fellow New
Yorkers for their kind messages and described them as ''the most
generous and the most loving in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, after undercover police officers fatally shot Patrick
Dorismond, an unarmed black man, Giuliani said the victim was ''no
altar boy.'' He released Dorismond's sealed juvenile record and
refused to send condolences to his family.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was soundly criticized for his attitude but replied:
''I think I handled it appropriately, appropriate to the situation
and appropriate to what had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, new Rudy uttered a mea culpa for his behavior and
admitted to possessing something many New Yorkers didn't even know
he had. ''I made a mistake,'' he said. ''I should have also
conveyed human feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   New, sensitive Rudy has apparently even sought to mend fences
with the city's teeming animal populace by holding several press
conferences in which he cuddled puppies and urged people to adopt
pets.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's attitude toward pet owners had been characterized by
an infamous radio rant last August in which he attacked owners of
particular pets, ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something deranged about you,'' old Rudy inveighed.
''This excessive concern with little weasels is a sickness. ... You
should go consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, old Rudy told a caller on his radio show to
''take some Valium'' and said to another, ''Get off the phone you
crazy nut. I don't like you.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a Daily News poll published Sunday, many New
Yorkers aren't so sure the once tough-as-nails mayor has really
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of 505 New Yorkers surveyed said Giuliani's
travails have not created a more sensitive mayor while 37 percent
said they did perceive a turnaround. The poll, which had a margin
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points, was conducted by
Blum &AMP; Weprin Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just because old Rudy was nasty didn't mean he wasn't
occasionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1989 Republican primary for mayor, he said his
opponent -- cosmetic heir Ronald Lauder -- was unfit to be a
''dogcatcher,'' then added memorably, ''suffering to him is the
butler taking the night off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, vintage Rudy. Once, when asked whether some of his
political tactics were fair, he just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it fair?'' he asked. ''Come on, it's politics.''

Russia-US Missile Deal Not Expected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, doesn't expect any arms agreements from next weekend's summit in Russia,
but he dismissed George W. Bush's suggestion that Clinton ought not try. Bush,
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, suggested last week that
Clinton refrain from signing any arms pact. No agreement would be better than
one that ''ties the hands of the next president and prevents America from
defending itself,'' the Texas governor said. Clinton ''is not going to act for
the sake of acting,'' Berger said, ''but he's not going to not act for the sake
of not acting.''

Peru President Appears Headed for Victory

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru President Alberto Fujimori appeared Sunday to be
headed for a lopsided re-election victory in a run-off vote that has been
questioned by foreigners and boycotted by his opponent. With 26.9 percent of the
vote counted, Fujimori had 50.1 percent of the ballot to Alejandro Toledo's 16.5
percent, election officials said. They said 32.4 percent of the ballots had been
intentionally spoiled and 1 percent left blank. Failure to vote was punishable
by a fine equivalent to $33 in a country where the monthly minimum wage is less
than $120.

S. Leone Rebels Release UN Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leonean rebels on Sunday freed what
appeared to be the last of some 500 U.N. hostages seized earlier this month,
signaling ''a positive change of direction'' among the rebels toward bringing
peace to the war-torn West African nation, a U.N. spokesman said. Eighty-five
former captives arrived in Freetown Sunday night from Monrovia, the capital of
neighboring Liberia, said U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst. A senior Liberian
military official who spoke on condition he not be named said more freed
hostages were still on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border and would be flown out on

Turner died Sunday afternoon at Los Robles Hospital, according to a nursing

<HEADLINE> Pair arraigned in Wendy's murders  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A prosecutor described in chilling detail how
two men accused in the Wendy's massacre systematically bound and
gagged their victims, then forced them to their knees and shot them
one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were marched single file into a big freezer box,''
Assistant District Attorney Greg Lasak said, his voice tremulous
with emotion, at a court hearing Sunday. ''They were told to get on
their knees, and they were each shot by the defendants once in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, John Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, were
formally charged in Queens Criminal Court before Judge Michael
Aloise with shooting seven people, five of them fatally, during the
robbery last week. They were not required to enter a plea at this
stage of the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the men were each charged with two counts of
first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder for each
of the five victims, attempted murder for the two men who survived,
robbery and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered a .380-caliber handgun in Taylor's possession
that they believe was used in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has 120 days to decide
whether to seek the death penalty or life without parole. Brown,
who has recommended the death penalty in two prior cases in his
jurisdiction, said he would use the time to investigate the
circumstances of the crime, talk to the victims' families and
evaluate the defendants' backgrounds, state of mind and mental
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision in regard to the death penalty is a decision I do
not take lightly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasak, the assistant district attorney, asked that the two men
be held without bail, saying there was ''no greater risk of
flight'' than a potential death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Taylor was a fugitive at the time of his
arrest, having jumped $3,500 bail set in a previous fast-food
restaurant robbery. Queens prosecutors had sought $100,000 bail in
that case, but it was knocked down by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed defense attorneys John Youngblood, of the state
Capital Defenders Office, and Heidi Segal, of the Capital Division
of the Legal Aid Society, reserved the right to apply for bail at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   The judge remanded the defendants to jail without bail,
acquiesced to a request from the defense to have Taylor placed on
suicide watch and set the next hearing for June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, heavyset man, stood ramrod straight during the
proceeding, staring ahead. Godineaux, a tall man who towered over
his alleged sidekick as they stood side by side in the courtroom,
hung his head.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspects left the courtroom, a woman who appeared to be a
friend of Godineaux but refused to identify herself, shouted, ''I
love you, Craig!''
</P>
<P>
   She then broke down in sobs and wailed, ''Oh, God.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasak, the assistant district attorney, told the court that the
suspects made videotaped confessions and that investigators also
recovered a security videotape the pair had removed from the
restaurant. In addition, both men were picked out of lineups by
witnesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not identify the witnesses, but they were
believed to include one of the survivors and a Wendy's customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence we have to tie these defendants to the case is
overwhelming,'' Lasak said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor used to work at the Wendy's but was fired last fall. He
and Godineaux allegedly waited until the customers left at closing
time Wednesday before carrying out the holdup.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the district attorney, refused to comment on media
reports that Taylor had said ''No witnesses'' as his reason for
shooting the workers after taking $2,300. Most of the money,
recovered at Taylor's house, was in coins, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has an arrest record stretching back to 1996, when he was
accused of trying to break into a safe at a McDonald's where he was
assistant manager. He was sentenced to five years' probation in
that case.
</P>
<P>
   In one week last June, Taylor was linked to robberies or
attempted robberies at four fast-food businesses in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed at Wendy's were Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita
C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Ryan Mele, 18; Ali Ibadat, 40, and Jean
Auguste, 27, the night manager.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Castro, 23, shot through both cheeks, freed himself and
called 911. He was released from a hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   JaQuione Johnson, 18, remained in critical condition at New York
Hospital Medical Center in Queens.

<HEADLINE> Eritreans Flee Heavy Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Ethiopian infantry and artillery battled
Eritrean troops trying to hold back a massive 2-week-old offensive
that has driven more than 12 percent of the population from their
homes and shows no sign of ending -- despite today's peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the heaviest fighting yet in the 2-year-old border war,
200,000 people around the central city of Mendefera were in danger,
the United Nations warned Sunday. The Ethiopian offensive already
has sent 550,000 of Eritrea's 4 million people fleeing north, some
into neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's military now is pushing miles deep into Eritrea --
sending citizens into a panicked flight. Increasingly punished by
the latest offensive, Eritrea agreed last week to withdraw from all
disputed territory and return to talks set for today in Algeria on
resolving the neighbors' war over their poorly delineated border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has made plain its bargaining strategy for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall negotiate while we fight, and we shall fight while we
negotiate,'' Prime Minister Meles Zenawai told African diplomats in
the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Ethiopian warplanes bombed a nearly completed
power plant near the port city of Massawa, Eritrea's Foreign
Ministry said, calling the attack ''vandalism and senseless
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said the planes attacked a military installation, not a
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Ethiopia accused Eritreans on Sunday of shelling
its forces near Bure, one of the eastern towns from which they had
pledged to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopians rallied by the hundreds of thousands
to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the overthrow of the military
regime that once ruled Ethiopia, which in 1991 still included the
then-province of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration's participants -- grizzled veterans of the
guerrilla war against Benito Mussolini's forces as well as young
men in uniform -- had new triumphs to celebrate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invading Eritrean forces have been demolished!'' President
Negasso Ghidada told the elated crowd, listing towns and
territories retaken by the country's forces in past days.

<HEADLINE> Indians 12, White Sox 3  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel, for one, knows
winning the AL Central five straight times is not as easy as it
looks.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the improved Chicago White Sox threatening to give
the Indians a run in the division they've dominated, it could be
tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''People always make it out that we've cruised and winning the
Central came easy to us,'' Manuel said. ''We still have to go out
and play. I've tried to imbed that into our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got the message Sunday, beating the White Sox 12-3
to avert a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still early. Some teams are hot early, some teams cold,''
said Kenny Lofton, who had four of Cleveland's 15 hits. ''We
haven't really started off like we're used to and everybody has
made a big deal out of it. But that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are certainly not full strength. They've already
made nine trips to the disabled list and currently have five
pitchers there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever since day one of the season, we've never been able to get
out five-man rotation going,'' Manuel said. ''We've never got it
set. Once we get it organized and set, we can beat anybody in our
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's win Sunday came less than 24 hours after a 14-3
pasting from the White Sox. The White Sox still lead the AL Central
by 1{ games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just reminded us that we're a good team that can score
runs. It reminded them that we are a good team,'' said Travis
Fryman, whose two-run homer sparked a five-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox face a tough schedule over the next three weeks.
They'll play 16 of their next 19 games on the road, including three
games in Cleveland. Then they'll meet the Indians four more times
at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just got to play well. There's still a long way to go.
This is a very special club, but it's still early,'' Chicago's
Frank Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's see what we've got at the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland won Sunday despite the struggles of Bartolo Colon
(5-2), who threw 118 pitches in five innings, gave up four hits
with five walks and eight strikeouts. He's now 6-0 against the
White Sox in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman's two-run homer off reliever Sean Lowe gave the Indians a
5-1 lead in the sixth and set a club record -- Cleveland has now
homered in 19 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   After singles by Einar Diaz and Lofton, White Sox infielders
Jose Valentin and Herbert Perry made back-to-back errors for
another run, and Jim Thome then hit a two-run double for an 8-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel good winning two out of three. It is really difficult
to beat a good team three straight,'' said Chicago manager Jerry
Manuel, unhappy with his team's play in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a two-run homer, his 10th, to pull the White Sox
within 8-3 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Alomar and Manny Ramirez hit consecutive RBI doubles
in the eighth to restore the seven-run lead. Diaz hit a two-run
homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Roberto Alomar played despite a painful sprained left
wrist. Alomar suffered the injury swinging the bat Saturday night.
X-rays taken Sunday were negative. ... The Indians also homered in
18 straight games in 1996 and 1959. ... Valentin has 13 errors this
season and the White Sox have 48 in 49 games. A day after driving
in six runs and nearly hitting for the cycle a second time this
season, Valentin fanned four times. ... A fungus on the infield
forced the Comiskey Park grounds crew to take up all the grass
after Sunday's game. The fungus developed because the field had to
be covered with a tarp so many times because of rainy weather.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- What a difference a year makes for the
Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   After losing all 12 games to Texas last season, the Twins beat
the Rangers for the fifth time in six games this year, getting
seven strong innings from Sean Bergman in a 4-3 win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Minnesota's first series sweep of the Rangers since July
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another year,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ''You
start 0-0. You start all over. Last year doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman (3-3) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings
to lower his ERA from 9.93 to 9.11. He struck out six and walked
none in his first win since April 25 against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great feeling,'' Bergman said. ''It's been a long
time since I've had that feeling. I never doubted myself, but they
easily could have given up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins pitched the ninth for his first major league
save. He showed little emotion after striking out pinch-hitter
Jason McDonald for the final out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just my first save,'' said Hawkins, who spent most of his
first three years with the Twins as a starter. ''When I get No.
300, maybe I'll start breakdancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie, who had three RBIs Saturday night, hit a two-out
single in the third inning to drive in two runs as Minnesota took a
4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two-out hits seem to be a backbreaker for the other team,
especially with runners in scoring position'' Koskie said. ''I felt
it was a pretty big hit in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Rick Helling (7-2) gave up six hits in seven-plus
innings and allowed all four runs. He lost for the first time in
six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minnesota played us well in this series and swept us,'' said
Helling, whose only other loss this year was a 6-3 decision against
Boston. ''It's tough to lose three straight to anybody. I know I
don't take anybody lightly and neither do the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit his seventh homer of the year off Bergman in the
fourth to make it 4-3, but Bergman retired 11 of the next 13 he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''Except for the pitch to Segui that he hit 500 feet I thought I
pitched pretty well,'' Bergman said. ''I feel real good about the
results today.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota won the first two games of the series by a combined
score of 20-7. Twins manager Tom Kelly, who has been critical of
his own managing decisions at times this season, was asked if he
preferred closer games.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' he laughed. ''I'd rather sit there and do nothing. Our
best strategy is to keep my out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea had a single, double and triple in four at-bats for
Texas, which took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Alicea's triple
and Chad Curtis's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota tied it in the bottom of the inning on Jacque Jones'
leadoff home run, his seventh homer of the season. The Twins went
ahead 2-1 one out later when Matt Lawton singled, stole second and
took third on a throwing error by catcher Bill Haselman. Lawton
scored on Ron Coomer's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb's RBI single in the second made it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: After allowing just three home runs in his first eight
starts, Helling has given up five in his last three. He was trying
to become the first Texas pitcher to win six games in a month since
Kenny Rogers did it in August 1993. ... Lamb's RBI single in the
second snapped an 0-for-13 slump. ... Twins DH Butch Huskey was
ejected in the third inning after protesting a called third strike
by plate umpire Paul Emmel. ... Jones has four career leadoff
homers, two this season. ... Coco and Kelly Miller, twins from
Rochester, Minn., who play together on the Georgia women's
basketball team, were part of ''Twins Day'' at the Metrodome. About
500 sets of twins attended the game.

<HEADLINE> Missile May Be On Koreas Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said today he may bring up Japan's concern over North Korea's
missile program during a June summit with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim made the remarks after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori, who was on a half-day visit to South Korea, his first
since took the post in April. He replaced Keizo Obuchi, who died
after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart,
Kim Jong Il, in the North's capital, Pyongyang, on June 12-14 in
the first summit of the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not fixed the agenda for the summit,'' Kim said at a
joint news conference with Mori. ''But by bringing up various
topics (in the summit), each side can know what the other side
thinks and misunderstands.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tough negotiations, the two Koreas recently
adopted a broadly defined agenda for the summit, calling for
efforts to promote peace and national unification.
</P>
<P>
   That opens the way for North Korea to raise the sensitive issue
of the U.S. military presence in South Korea. South Korea in turn
can focus on promoting peace through economic exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has said he would not rush to reap any big success from the
summit. ''I would rather try to agree on whatever is feasible. More
can be agreed on at the second and third summit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Berlin in March, Kim offered South Korean
investment to help build the North's dilapidated economy, hoping
that would ease deep-rooted tension and distrust between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's concern over North Korea's missile and nuclear programs
rose to a fevered pitch after the North lobbed a multistage missile
in mid-1998 over Japan. It landed in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Japan resumed normalization talks with North Korean in April for
the first time in eight years. However, the next round of talks,
originally scheduled for last week, were postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese media attributed the postponement to Pyongyang's
unwillingness to investigate allegations that about a dozen
Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to South Korea, Mori was criticized for his
recent remark about Japan being a ''divine nation centered on the
emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment has been harshly criticized in Japan as being linked
to the emperor-worship that fueled Japanese aggression against
Asian neighbors in the 1930s and 1940s. Mori has apologized for the
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong in South Korea, especially
among older people who vividly remember Japan's oppressive colonial
rule of Korea from 1910-45.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of protests against Mori's visit. Despite
the lingering historical animosity, Japan and South Korea have
become close economic and political partners. Their navies held
their first joint exercise last summer.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis and its astronauts
returned to Earth early Monday and closed out a successful space station repair
mission. Throughout Sunday, NASA had fretted that the crosswind might be too
strong. But the wind eased to within safety limits, and Mission Control gave the
crew the go-ahead to come home. Atlantis glided onto the floodlighted runway at
2:20 a.m. It was only the 14th time in 98 flights that a space shuttle landed in

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's hostage crisis appeared to be
over after the release of the last of some 500 U.N. workers who had been held
hostage by Revolutionary United Front rebels for more than three weeks. U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst said 85 captives arrived late Sunday in Freetown from
neighboring Liberia, whose president, Charles Taylor, had been negotiating for a
steady stream of hostage releases in recent weeks. Most of the hostages freed
Sunday were in good shape, although some were being treated for malaria, minor
injuries and fatigue, said medical officials in Liberia.

Scientists Warn of Hantavirus Threat

	   DENVER (AP) -- As people begin trekking to the outdoors this season,
scientists are warning that the mystery disease hantavirus is a threat
throughout North America. Once thought to mainly haunt the Four Corners area of
the Southwest, doctors say it has proved deadly from Canada to Argentina.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome begins much like a flu, with muscle aches and a
fever, followed by shortness of breath and coughing. It typically progresses
rapidly, requiring ventilation and hospitalization within 24 hours.

Russia-US Missile Deal Not Expected

the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, suggested last week that
Clinton refrain from signing any arms pact. No agreement would be better than
one that "ties the hands of the next president and prevents America from
defending itself," the Texas governor said. Clinton "is not going to act for the
sake of acting," Berger said, "but he's not going to not act for the sake of not

Turner died Sunday afternoon at Los Robles Hospital, according to a nursing

<HEADLINE> Hollywood on Pace For Record Year  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Star Wars''? Who needs ''Star Wars''?
</P>
<P>
   Heading into its busiest season, the movie industry has a good
head start on breaking its box office revenue record for a third
straight year, without the benefit of a mega-blockbuster ''Star
Wars'' flick.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues are up 9 percent from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the lower-profile lineup of movies this
summer can collectively match last year's torrid pace. A record 12
movies released between May 1999 and early September 1999 hit $100
million, while the overall box office from Memorial Day to Labor
Day last year was an all-time high of nearly $3 billion. Two
surprise hits alone, ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''The Sixth
Sense,'' accounted for 10 percent of the summer total.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was in a box office funk until about this time last
year, when ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' set off a
flurry of film-going that resulted in a record $7.5 billion in
movie grosses for 1999. ''Phantom Menace'' took in $431 million
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the industry enters its busy summer season a step
ahead of 1999. Through May 21, U.S. audiences had spent $2.44
billion on movie tickets, up from $2.25 billion in the same period
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, the months of May, June, July and August all were
record months,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which tracks movie ticket sales. ''That's tough to beat,
but the year looks good so far.''
</P>
<P>
   While revenues are up, movie attendance remains far below
Hollywood's heyday of the 1930s and 1940s. Still, movie attendance
climbed through much of the 1990s, and audiences the last two years
have been the largest since the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when blockbusters such as ''The Matrix'' and
''The Mummy'' dominated the pre-summer period, the wealth has been
spread among a slate of more modestly successful films. Two
pictures, ''Gladiator'' and ''Erin Brockovich,'' have hit $100
million this year, while many others have delivered respectable
returns, including ''Scream 3,'' ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' ''Next
Friday,'' ''Snow Day,'' ''Romeo Must Die,'' ''Rules of Engagement''
and ''U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ''Gladiator'' and Disney's ''Dinosaur'' kicked May
into high gear, with Tom Cruise's ''Mission: Impossible 2'' close
on their heels. Cruise's caper opened Wednesday, taking in $80
million in its first five days, distributor Paramount estimated
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think of 'Gladiator,' 'Dinosaur' and 'Mission:
Impossible,' that's a fairly strong month of May,'' said Walter
Parkes, co-head of DreamWorks Pictures, the studio's movie
division. ''Let's just hope it carries over into summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While nothing has quite the hype ''Phantom Menace'' did in 1999,
this summer has solid prospects with Nicolas Cage in ''Gone in 60
Seconds''; Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in ''What Lies
Beneath''; Mel Gibson in the flesh for ''The Patriot'' and by voice
in the animated ''Chicken Run''; Samuel L. Jackson in ''Shaft'';
Jim Carrey in ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene''; George Clooney in ''The
Perfect Storm''; Eddie Murphy in ''Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps''; and those comic-book mutants in ''X-men.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile movies include ''The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' featuring Robert De Niro; Clint Eastwood and Tommy
Lee Jones in ''Space Cowboys''; Keanu Reeves in the football comedy
''The Replacements''; and ''Pokemon The Movie 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sleeper hits likely will crop up. Kevin Bacon's
invisible-scientist turn in ''Hollow Man'' includes visceral
special effects that could help the movie catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, no one saw ''The Sixth Sense'' coming, with Bruce
Willis working with a boy who saw dead people. This summer, Willis
is paired with another boy in ''Disney's The Kid,'' a comedy that
could break out in a summer that's light on funny family films.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners are counting on summer's diverse lineup to pack
in the crowds. A building boom by cinema developers has been
credited for drawing audiences back to movies, but it also has left
theater chains burdened with debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we will have a third straight record year in terms of
total grosses,'' said John Fithian, president of the National
Association of Theatre Owners. ''We need to, frankly, because we
have more screens than we've ever had before.''

<HEADLINE> Costly Fuel Forces Coast Guard Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEABROOK, Texas (AP) -- Drunken boaters speeding across
waterways. Damaged buoys that leave dangerous channels unmarked.
Drug smugglers moving unseen along deserted stretches of coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Those are possible scenarios because rising fuel costs have
forced the Coast Guard to cut back nearly every type of patrol but
search-and-rescue missions by about 25 percent along the Texas
coast and into the Midwest, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no other recourse,'' said Rear Adm. Paul Pluta, whose
Eighth Coast Guard District covers 26 states and includes 1,200
miles of Gulf Coast and 10,300 miles of navigable rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have increased dramatically in recent months,
reaching $34 a barrel in March, almost $10 higher than in January.
Prices were down to about $28 a barrel this month, but the Coast
Guard still needs more money to make up for higher costs, Pluta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the cost of the higher fuel prices for the Eighth
District would take between $700,000 and $1.3 million, Pluta said.
It's just the latest funding problem for a Coast Guard that's still
using boats and planes dating back to the Vietnam era and before,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is discussing the possibility of appropriating more
money to make up for the shortfall, but it could takes weeks, Pluta
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks will mean fewer patrols for boating safety
violations, less frequent maintenance of channel markers and less
time spent enforcing environmental regulations for fishing and
shrimping boats, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priority, Pluta said, will be placed on search and
rescue operations, which won't be cut back.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Davidson, director of the Corpus Christi Marina, said
it's already difficult to reach the Coast Guard in times of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will only come for what they consider to be a life or
death situation. That means if someone runs their mast into a
bridge or an old man runs aground, they just say to call a salvage
company. They don't come to a lot of situations that could result
in serious injury or death,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Coast Guard needs to be doing more, not less,'' Davidson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Galveston, the marine safety unit has reduced offshore
flights and consolidated harbor patrols from three days a week to
one, Lt. Marie Byrd said. In general, Coast Guard units have
stopped routine safety patrols, but are responding to any reports
of wrongdoing, Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   The effects stretch beyond the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the buoys aren't maintained, it could cause us problems,''
said Dave Harms of Lake City, Minn., who boats on the upper
Mississippi River. ''The barges are having enough trouble with low
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, other safety patrols and police organization will
be able to make up for the cutbacks. In New Orleans, Benton Brown,
harbormaster for the Southern Yacht Club, said his yacht club can
rely on the sheriff's department patrolling the northern half Lake
Pontchartrain and local police patrolling the southern half.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, Chief Warrant Officer Chris Haley said
Sunday that the shortage is theoretical -- so far. But he said his
13th District was fortunate that it had some financial cushion
built in.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've told us to be prepared for operational cuts, and right
now we're looking at our budget to see where we can cut, what we
can cut, and still provide the best service to the public,'' Haley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is feeling the pinch from funding shortages, and
that could mean more cutbacks in some nonessential services, Jack
O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize we have 34,000 people patrolling 144,000
miles of shoreline,'' O'Dell said. ''If it's not a life-threatening
situation, we have to ask how much involvement from the Coast Guard
there should be.''

<HEADLINE> Old Rudy might have asked: Who's that 'jerky' new guy at City Hall? </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Something distinctly un-New York has happened
here of late. When no one was looking, it seems, someone implanted
the sweet and gentle disposition of a mayor of some modest-size
Midwestern burg into the honorable Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's
famously ill-tempered leader.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. In the city of hard knocks, Rudy's gone soft.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the old, combative Rudy counted among his favorite words
''pathetic'' and ''jerky,'' the new, introspective Rudy is all
about ''love.'' In a recent television interview he used the word a
dozen times in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, ''love'' was a word that crossed Rudy's lips
publicly only sparingly -- and then only to insist that his plan of
taking children away from homeless mothers who refuse to work is
compassionate public policy.
</P>
<P>
   So what's happened? A lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks, Giuliani, who turned 56 on Sunday, has
found out he has prostate cancer; has gotten caught squiring around
a woman other than his wife, actress and television personality
Donna Hanover; has announced he wants a legal separation from
Hanover; has denied Hanover's claim that he had an affair with a
former aide, whom he later helped install in a plum public job, and
has dropped out of the U.S. Senate race against first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. On Sunday, he said that it was ''terrific'' and
that he was a ''very fortunate man'' after 100 people sang ''Happy
Birthday'' to him at a Memorial Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Still skeptical about this new Rudy?
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a sampling of remarks made by Giuliani -- and
collected in the recently published book ''Sayings of Generalissimo
Giuliani,'' edited by Kevin McAuliffe -- contrasted with the mayor's
statements in the past few weeks as new Rudy was emerging.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1998, old Rudy said goodbye to the old year with a
kiss-off to his fellow New Yorkers: ''If people like my
personality, thank you. If you don't, I really don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to April 28, 2000, the day after he disclosed he had
treatable prostate cancer. Mellow Rudy thanked his fellow New
Yorkers for all their kind messages and described them as ''the
most generous and the most loving (people) in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, after undercover police officers shot Patrick
Dorismond, an unarmed black man being questioned by narcotics
officers, Giuliani said the victim was ''no altar boy.'' He
released Dorismond's sealed juvenile record and refused to send
condolences to his family.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was soundly criticized for his attitude but replied:
''No regrets. ... I think I handled it appropriately, appropriate
to the situation and appropriate to what had to be done in order to
make sure that the public got information that the media to this
day is still suppressing.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, new Rudy uttered a mea culpa for his behavior and
admitted to possessing something many New Yorkers didn't even know
he had.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake,'' he said. ''I should have also conveyed
human feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow.
</P>
<P>
   New, sensitive Rudy has apparently even sought to mend fences
with the city's teeming animal populace by holding several press
conferences in which -- while publicly cuddling puppies -- he urged
people to adopt pets.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the mayor's attitude toward pet owners was
characterized by an infamous radio rant on August 21, 1999, in
which he attacked owners of particular pets, ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something deranged about you,'' old Rudy inveighed.
''You need somebody to help you. This excessive concern with little
weasels is a sickness. I'm sorry, that's my opinion. You should go
consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist with this excessive
concern -- how you are devoting your life to weasels.''
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, old Rudy told a caller on his radio show to
''take some Valium'' and said to another, ''Get off the phone, you
crazy nut. I don't like you.''
</P>
<P>
   This was bad, old Rudy, about whom former Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower once said, ''They say if you want to
keep the beer real cold, put it next to Rudy's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just because old Rudy was nasty didn't mean he wasn't
occasionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1989 Republican primary for mayor, he said his
opponent, cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, was unfit to be a ''dog
catcher,'' then added, memorably, ''suffering to him is the butler
taking the night off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, vintage old Rudy. Once, when asked whether some of his
political tactics were fair, he just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it fair?'' he asked. ''Come on, it's politics.''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit alleging rape by Delta steward nears federal trial  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It began as a routine layover for the crew of a
Delta Air Lines flight arriving in Rome from New York on March 16,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching their hotel at midday, flight attendants Penny Ferris
and Michael Young decided to unwind by sharing wine and sandwiches
in his room. Ferris remembers ''starting to feel sleepy and a real
heaviness in my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   What Ferris says happened next in Room 609 of the Savoy Hotel
has resulted in a nasty legal dispute pitting her against her
alleged attacker and the nation's third largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed last year in Brooklyn federal court, Ferris,
51, claimed Young spiked her wine with a date rape sedative,
leaving her helpless as he methodically molested and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 39, says it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff also accused the airline of knowing that Young had
a history of sexually harassing fellow attendants and of doing
nothing to stop him before he went too far. Delta denies the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The case is going forward despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
mid-May saying women cannot sue their attackers in federal court.
That's because it involved a broader claim against a third party,
Delta, and because it was too close to trial to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a jury of six men and six women will begin hearing
testimony -- including that of Ferris and Young -- to decide whether
the rape occurred. If jurors believe Ferris, Young would be liable
for damages, and a second trial with another jury would decide if
Delta should be held liable as well.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges Delta has condoned a ''sexualized environment''
in which female employees are degraded and subjected ''to unwelcome
and inappropriate touching and verbal and visual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's attorney, Robert Conway, would not discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But in a deposition, Young, of Dallas, denied ever assaulting or
harassing any co-workers. He also said he was never alone with
Ferris in Rome that day.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, meanwhile, contends it has a long record of
enforcing strict policies against sexual harassment. It says that
on learning of Ferris' allegations, it launched an internal
investigation, which led to Young's suspension; he later resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said airline officials ''are very
concerned about these allegations and ... looking forward to
learning the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the case reach a second phase against Delta, other flight
attendants who Ferris' lawyers say were harassed by Young could
testify. But for now, the dispute's outcome hinges almost solely on
the word of Ferris and Young.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' attorneys describe her as a reliable 30-year employee
who won a 1998 Flight Attendant of the Year award. A divorced
mother of two adult daughters who lives in Lake Arrowhead, Calif.,
she has continued to work on international flights while pursuing
her suit, attorney Duane Klapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she tells a compelling story,'' Klapp said. ''There's
no reason she would make this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' story is detailed in both a November 1999 deposition and
an anguished report submitted to the airline before she sued.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Young,'' she wrote, ''used my body without my
permission!''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said that Young, whom she didn't know before the
Rome flight, told her on the plane that he was a weightlifter and
male stripper. In Rome, Young urged her to come to his hotel room
to share some red wine. She had no romantic interest in him, partly
because she suspected he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ferris said in her deposition, ''It's like a fraternity
on the airlines. ... We trust one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris recalled sitting on the bed opposite Young while they had
lunch and watched television. After finishing about a half glass of
wine, she began to feel tired -- so tired that she couldn't move her
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said she told Young she wanted to go back to her
room, but he encouraged her to lie down. She said she remembers him
pulling off her clothes over her protests.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferris faded in and out of consciousness over the next few
hours, she realized Young was raping and sodomizing her, she said.
But she said she was powerless to fight him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like I was dead weight or something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris remembers stumbling back to her own room hours later.
When Young tried to make small talk with her on the flight back to
New York, she asked him what went wrong the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things just happened,'' she recalled him replying.
</P>
<P>
   But in his own deposition, Young said he never had a problem
with any flight attendant and directly denied the alleged encounter
with Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even recall this lady,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mixed signals from White House confuse Florio-Corzine debate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Jon Corzine favors investing part of
the Social Security Trust Fund in the stock market to achieve a
better return and boost the system's viability.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent for the party's Senate nomination in New Jersey,
Jim Florio, calls that an overly risky approach to America's
bedrock retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine and Florio have this much in common: each claims to
be on the side of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine calls his plan to invest up to 15 percent of Social
Security funds in equities the ''Clinton-Corzine plan to strengthen
Social Security.'' Florio has declared that Clinton and Gore
''agree with me that Social Security Trust Fund moneys must not be
subjected to the Wall Street roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   So which candidate is right? Both -- and neither.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House has given mixed signals on Social
Security and the stock market for the past 18 months -- twice
floating a plan to invest Social Security revenue in stocks, then
reeling the idea back in.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed
creating an independent government board to invest nearly $700
billion in expected budget surpluses over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound
for 55 years,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many Republicans in Congress, quickly
denounced the ideas as gimmickry.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a congressional
committee that moving Social Security money into the stock market
was not in itself a solution for the coming retirement of the huge
baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan says lawmakers must consider structural reforms to
Social Security, such as raising the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999, Clinton had stopped promoting the idea of
investing Social Security funds in the market. But Corzine, by that
time, had declared himself a candidate for Senate and pledged his
support for the stock market idea.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Florio launched his first broadside against
Corzine's plan, telling an audience of senior citizens that his
opponent would ''deconstruct'' the nation's retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Social Security is not designed for speculation,'' Florio
said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Clinton seemed to resurrect the stock market
investment idea. His budget plan for fiscal year 2001 proposed
transferring $690 billion in surpluses to Social Security in
2011-2016, with the government investing half the money in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign touted the proposal as proof that Corzine's
position was in fact consistent with the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April, Vice President Al Gore told The Washington Post
that the White House had shelved the idea of investing Social
Security money in equities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't really propose it. We talked about the idea,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked days later for a clarification, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said investing in the stock market is ''still quite
controversial.'' He said it has not been ruled out, but is now ''on
the back burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New Jersey, both Democrats took that as proof they were
right.
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist to the Democratic debate, Florio was confronted
with a tape recording of a May 1999 speech in which he said he
''had no difficulty'' with investing a small part of the Social
Security fund in equities.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he ''misspoke'' at that event and has always opposed
the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Though Social Security and the stock market has become a
defining issue in the Democratic race, the bigger difference is
between the Democrats and the four Republicans also vying for the
Senate seat now held by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring when
his term expires.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Republicans -- Bob Franks, William Gormley, Murray
Sabrin and Jim Treffinger -- would allow people to take control of
part of the money they now pay in payroll taxes and invest the
money in personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP candidate for
president, also supports the idea. Clinton and Gore oppose it. So
do Florio and Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of left-leaning groups, united under the banner
Campaign for America's Future, opposes the notion of partially
privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that's going to be the big debate of the presidential
election, and it's also going to be a big issue in many
congressional and senatorial campaigns,'' said Roger Hickey, a
co-director of the group.
</P>
<P>
   But like Florio and Corzine, members of the coalition are
divided on the idea of the government investing Social Security
money in the market.

<HEADLINE> CBS Has Risk-Taking Summer Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's voyeuristic summer begins this
week, with cameras following a pack of hardy adventurers dodging
rats on a tropical island and 10 strangers trying to co-exist in a
house on 24-hour display.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more startling than the shows themselves is the network
where they'll air.
</P>
<P>
   Both ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' are on CBS, the
broadcaster with the oldest audience, which is usually careful to
avoid shocking its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are big gambles,'' CBS President Leslie Moonves
conceded. ''You don't know who is going to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Both shows adapt ideas that were phenomenally successful
overseas. ''Survivor'' debuts Wednesday and the hourlong show will
run once a week through the summer. Sixteen people were dumped on
Pulau Tiga off Borneo, forced to test their survival skills in a
contest where the winner gets $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' begins July 6, and will air five nights a week
through September. Ten volunteers will live in a California home
outfitted with 28 cameras and 60 microphones. Like ''Survivor,''
there's an element of backstabbing: Residents vote colleagues out
until three are left, and viewers choose which one wins $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am surprised that CBS has acted in an aggressive way to
acquire these programs,'' said Gail Berman, Fox's new entertainment
president. ''It doesn't seem on the surface to be CBS's kind of
shows. I think Les is trying to shake things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Will viewers be fascinated or repulsed? That's the chief risk
for CBS. Berman's network learned with ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' that outrageous ideas can backfire into public
relations disasters. (CBS carefully checked the background of its
contestants to try to avoid embarrassing disclosures.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC gambled last August when it decided to air a game show
imported from Britain several nights in a row. ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' only transformed the industry and earned ABC a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't want to see the 'We're closed for the summer'
signs going up,'' Moonves said. ''We're trying things that are
relatively inexpensive, because that's all you can afford to do in
the summer. And you've got to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, CBS's rivals are effectively hitting the beach.
There are a handful of new summer shows -- and ABC will keep
producing new ''Millionaire'' episodes -- but the march of reruns
has begun.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's merger with Viacom, and its youthful cable networks
Nickelodeon, MTV and VH1, gives the broadcaster a place to promote
its summer shows to young people, said Steven Sternberg, a senior
partner at the advertising firm TN Media. CBS could reduce the
average age of its viewer, which now stands at 50.
</P>
<P>
   While the reality programming should bring in more youthful
viewers, Sternberg said he doesn't expect CBS will be too shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know who their audience is,'' he said. ''They know they
are not Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS displayed some boldness in the spring, too, by showing a
live drama, ''Fail Safe,'' and introducing a new mobster series,
''Falcone,'' with nine airings in eight nights. ''Falcone''
faltered, but ''Fail Safe'' did well.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said the ideas aren't as risky as some are making them
out to be. Financially, the series cost about a third of what a
traditional comedy or drama would be to produce. ''Survivor'' has
already sold all of its advertising time, and CBS is guaranteed a
profit no matter how many people watch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Survivor'' participants ranging in age from 22 to 72,
there's someone for almost every viewer to relate to, and root for
or against, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there will be a part of each and every one of us who
says, 'How would I react? How would it be for me in the same
situation?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is confident enough to have a second ''Survivor'' series in
the works. And ''Big Brother'' will come to its climax during the
Olympics -- an event most networks don't bother competing against.
</P>
<P>
   '''Big Brother' is probably more risky,'' Mooves said. ''But
it's very inexpensive programming. If it works, great. If it
doesn't, we're happy we tried it.''

<HEADLINE> New Pacemaker-Like Device Tested  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Kent was the most avid of outdoorsmen,
constantly golfing or fishing or hunting. Then a mountain hike left
him gasping for air. Heart failure, doctors said. Within a few
years Kent's heart was so weak he was housebound and on the waiting
list for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 5 million Americans have congestive heart failure, where
their hearts gradually lose the ability to pump blood. Drugs help
many, but those like Kent whose hearts worsen despite medication
have few options.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists are experimenting with a new pacemaker-like
device called a ''ventricular resynchronizer'' that promises to
help these struggling hearts beat more normally.
</P>
<P>
   Kent is one of the few Americans to try one -- and today the
60-year-old Louisiana man is back on the golf course and off the
heart transplant list. Prompted by such early promising results,
scientists are hunting 2,000 more heart failure patients for a
study to prove how well the experimental treatment, made by Guidant
Inc., really works.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now there's not a lot you can do for these patients,''
said Dr. Eric Prystowsky, electrophysiology director at St. Vincent
Hospital in Indianapolis. ''This is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart failure is not a heart attack. Nor does it mean the heart
suddenly stops.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a heart weakened by age, damage from a survived heart
attack or some other disease gets flabbier as it struggles to push
blood out to the rest of the body. Lacking oxygen, patients feel
dizzy or faint. Eventually, they're pressed even to walk across a
room. Their legs swell. Fluid seeps into their lungs, blocking
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Just half of victims survive five years. When medications fail,
they have few options.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the ventricular resynchronizer.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically a souped-up and redesigned pacemaker. But it
doesn't speed up a sluggish heartbeat like regular pacemakers do.
Heart failure causes the opposite problem -- the struggling heart
beats faster to compensate for weakened pumping. And the heart's
two bottom chambers, the ventricles, don't pump together in rhythm
like they're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Resynchronize the right and left ventricles so they
pump at the same time, making that pumping more forceful. Then the
heart might not wear itself out pumping so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors thread three separate pacemaker wires, ''leads'' that
deliver electricity, into a vein near the collarbone. Two leads are
popped down to the heart's right side, just like a routine
pacemaker implantation. The breakthrough came when scientists
figured out how to put a third lead on the more vulnerable left
ventricle, so both sides can be sparked to pump together. It's
tricky, requiring threading into just the right spot in a vein
lying on the ventricle's wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a cure. But early results are promising, German
scientist Dr. Angelo Auricchio told a recent meeting of the North
American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. In a study of 42
severely ill Europeans, a single month's use of the device improved
the heart's pumping efficiency by 15 percent, and significantly
increased patients' ability to walk. Longer use seems to be
reducing hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Higgins of Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego has
implanted 60 Americans with the Guidant device. He says people once
too weak to get out of bed now go shopping and do other routine
activities. Kent was his best patient, shooting a hole in one last
summer months after the implant.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're enjoying life more. That's a key advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based Guidant, which developed the device at its
facility in St. Paul, Minn., just began selling it in Europe. The
company is recruiting 2,000 Americans at 80 hospitals for the
so-called ''Companion'' study to prove its usefulness here. (Check
http://www.guidant.com for information.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a hot field: Medtronic Inc. is developing its own
ventricular resynchronizer, also called ''biventricular pacing.''
St. Jude Medical is creating another pacemaker-like device
especially for heart failure worsened by the irregular heartbeat
atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   The devices' long-term impact isn't proven. But Kent, the Port
Allen, La., man, calls his implant life-changing. ''It's nothing
worse in the world than not being able to breathe ... But right
now, nothing's too strenuous.''

<HEADLINE> New program that lists people with mental disabilities draws fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- Mental health advocates in New Jersey
are criticizing a new program that allows the Burlington County
Sheriff's Department to maintain a list of county residents who
have severe mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The registry, called Persons-at-Risk, is designed to help police
find people who might become lost or wander off. It was launched
this month and allows caretakers to list names of loved ones
suffering from such conditions as Alzheimer's disease, autism,
schizophrenia, dementia and bipolar disorder. The list is made
available to police departments and emergency dispatchers.
Advocates say it affords families greater peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have raised privacy concerns over the program, which
so far has about 30 names and lists psychological and medical
conditions, physical descriptions and contact information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so little public understanding that it can backfire on
someone with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,'' Elaine Goodman,
president of the Gloucester County chapter of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, told The Philadelphia Inquirer for Monday's
editions. She and others worry that careers and social lives could
suffer if the information falls into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington County registry sounds like a good idea ''but
there are many ramifications of this that you don't think of,''
Goodman said. Her group recently helped Gloucester County develop a
police training program on dealing with the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Another mental health advocate said he also questions the
Burlington County program.
</P>
<P>
   If the family member whose name is registered doesn't want to be
listed, ''then you're bordering on the realm where there might be a
problem,'' said Joe Young, deputy director of New Jersey Protection
and Advocacy Inc., a federally funded agency that monitors the
rights of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they want the data base to be put together with
strict guidelines to verify that the people listed in the registry
do have a mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington County Sheriff Gary Daniels said there are no formal
guidelines in the program to ensure confidentiality. Although it is
possible people who didn't want their names on the list could be
included, the listing would do no harm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said the information would be given only to medical
personnel in the event the information is needed to provide
treatment. Daniels said he sent a letter to all county police
chiefs to ensure confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the concerns are legitimate,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   But the safeguards may not be adequate, mental health advocates
contend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Data bases just aren't secure in this society,'' said Joseph
Rogers, executive director of the private Mental Health Association
of Southeastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter of the program said privacy concerns could hamper
finding a lost person if there's not enough information.
</P>
<P>
   ''You actually don't want there to be a privacy concern, because
that might slow things down,'' said Denise Conklin, director of the
Alzheimer's Association of New Jersey. She said she would rather
officials had the information handy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidentiality is extremely important, but equally important
is having enough information to find someone,'' said state Sen.
Diane Allen, R-Burlington, who plans to introduce legislation to
create a statewide program.
</P>
<P>
   She any statewide program would have to pay particular attention
to privacy issues.

<HEADLINE> 'M:I2' Sparks Holiday Movie Record  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Mission: Impossible 2'' blew away the
competition and lifted movie theaters to an overall box-office
record for the Memorial Day weekend, according to studio estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise's second caper with the Impossible Missions Force
grossed $71.8 million from Friday to Monday. It became the
second-best Memorial Day premiere ever, behind ''Jurassic Park: The
Lost World,'' which grossed $90.2 million in its first four days in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the top 12 movies alone grossed $174.7 million over the
weekend, shattering the record of $147.9 million set by the top 50
movies over Memorial Day weekend in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The big weekend gave another boost to this year's overall box
office. It is running about 9 percent ahead of 1999, when audiences
shelled out a record $7.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''What an explosive way to start the summer,'' said Chuck Viane,
head of distribution for Disney, which had the No. 2 and No. 3
movies. Disney's ''Dinosaur'' was in second place with $33.5
million in its second week, while Jackie Chan's comic Western,
''Shanghai Noon,'' debuted with $19.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only other new movie, Demi Moore's ''Passion of
Mind,'' opened with $220,000 in 104 theaters. The film, which
received weak reviews, averaged a meager $2,115 a theater.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks held the fourth through sixth spots with
''Gladiator'' at $17.3 million, ''Road Trip'' at $14 million and
Woody Allen's ''Small Time Crooks'' at $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gladiator'' has grossed $127.2 million, passing ''Erin
Brockovich'' as the top movie so far this year, while ''Small Time
Crooks'' more than doubled the take of Allen's last movie, ''Sweet
and Lowdown,'' in just 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the six days since its opening Wednesday, ''Mission:
Impossible 2'' took in $92.8 million, about $18 million more than
the original ''Mission: Impossible'' made in its first six days
during the 1996 Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel's take so far is more than half the $181 million the
first ''Mission: Impossible'' took in domestically for its entire
run. The new movie has received generally better reviews than the
first, which drew criticism for its confusing plot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the film plays better than the first one, just based
on watching audience reaction in theaters,'' said Wayne Lewellen,
head of distribution for Paramount, which released ''Mission:
Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at 3,653 locations, ''Mission: Impossible 2'' averaged a
whopping $19,655 per theater, compared with $10,145 in 3,302
cinemas for ''Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The enormity of 'Mission's' opening, coupled with the depth of
good movies at the box office, is unparalleled in any other
Memorial Day I've seen,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie-ticket sales.
''Normally, you see one film dominating and the next one at about
$10 million, but to have this many movies in double digits, it's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures were to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' $71.8 million
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Dinosaur,'' $33.5 million
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Shanghai Noon,'' $19.5 million
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Gladiator,'' $17.3 million
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Road Trip,'' $14 million
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Small Time Crooks,'' $3.9 million
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Frequency,'' $3.8 million
</P>
<P>
   8. ''U-571,'' $3.2 million
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Center Stage,'' $2.8 million
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Where the Heart Is,'' $2 million

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Bombs Eritrea Capital  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Ethiopia marked the scheduled opening day
of peace talks Monday with a daylight bombing run on the very edge
of Eritrea's capital -- the first attack on the city of 500,000
since the outset of the 2-year-old border war.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, whose late arrival in
the border-talks venue of Algiers forced their postponement until
Tuesday, made doubly clear more attacks could come -- negotiations
or no.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day when there is no longer a square meter occupied by
Eritrea is the day we'll no longer have a reason to fight,'' Seyoum
told reporters in Algeria's capital after arriving late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Asmara, four Ethiopian MiG-23s swept in over the
international airport at midday, unleashing rockets and then bombs
at a military airstrip just west of the commercial runways.
</P>
<P>
   Two Eritrean MiG's took off in pursuit, with flames and black
and white smoke billowing into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The attack engulfed a guard tower in flames and ignited a grass
fire that sent flames licking within yards of Eritrean warplanes
and Russian-built attack helicopters parked on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   Two civilians were wounded in the attack, Eritrean presidential
spokesman Yemene Gebremeskel.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is a border dispute, what is Ethiopia doing bombing
our airport?'' Gebremeskel demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions resounded in the heart of the capital just three
miles away, stunning residents on a day that was to have focused on
faraway talks on resolving the countries' conflict over their never
properly defined border.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is Ethiopia doing this?'' asked Tedros Tesfamichael, a
16-year-old student. ''We have accepted all the peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The capital's businesses closed early. People retreated inside,
leaving even more desolate streets already mostly emptied of
countless young men and women gone to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government doesn't retaliate soon, Ethiopia is going to
keep on going,'' worried businessman Isaac Abraham, one of those
who kept working.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia launched the offensive into west, southern and now
central Eritrea on May 12 to force an end to the war by military
means.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia insists its artillery, infantry and air offensive will
stop only when it had retaken all land seized by Eritrea at the
outset of the war and broken its adversary's ability to fight
again.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ethiopia said it had ''successfully targeted''
Eritrean hangars and military service facilities with no losses on
its own side.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to incapacitate the Eritrean air force and this
operation was completed in line with this objective,'' Military
chief Lt. Gen. Tsadkan Gebre-Tensae told reporters in Addis Ababa,
the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the first on the capital since June 1998, the
month after the war began. Saying it was retaliating for an attack
that killed 44 civilians, Ethiopia then sent warplanes on a similar
bombing run against the combined military-civilian airport -- the
day after agreeing to a peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea is believed to have installed extensive air-defense
systems around the capital since then. If it did, they were silent
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise and ease of the Ethiopian attack were sure to
heighten the emotional impact of what's become a costly,
humiliating rout for his small, impoverished neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea asked the U.N. Security Council on Monday to convene in
emergency session to exempt Eritrea from an arms embargo imposed on
both neighbors, ''so it can defend itself,'' Gebremeskel said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's 10 poorest nations,
have devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to their border war.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea on Monday picked up a prevalent complaint of the
international community -- that famine-plagued Ethiopia was pursuing
its war while letting foreign nations feed its hungry.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea itself also often stands accused of neglecting its
civilians to feed and man its military.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides reached an accord earlier, but talks broke down
May 4 in the same setting over technicalities of implementing it.
Eight days later, Ethiopia launched its offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent mediators led by Anthony Lake, former
national security adviser, to Monday's talks, as did the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldansae arrived in Algiers
saying he was still prepared to sign a peace deal, despite the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Italian embassies in Asmara said they would review
security in the wake of the bombing. The U.S. Embassy evacuated 206
people, including its nonessential staff, earlier in the offensive.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Workers Freed in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- West African leaders agreed Monday
to send 3,000 troops to Sierra Leone to help U.N. peacekeepers who
have suffered rebel attacks and seen their colleagues kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released Monday by the West African heads of state
meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, did not specify how many
troops would be sent to boost the U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the weekend conference said on condition of
anonymity that leaders had endorsed a proposal made by regional
defense ministers two weeks ago to send 3,000 soldiers, most of
them Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also called on the United Nations to put the force
in Sierra Leone under West African command and change its mandate
from ''peacekeeping to peace enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for peace hopes were also boosted by the release Sunday of
what was believed to be the last of 500 U.N. personnel held captive
for more than three weeks by the Revolutionary United Front rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels signed a July peace accord but reignited the
conflict earlier this month as a Nigerian-led West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG pulled out of the country to
make way for the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries had refused to give financial backing to
ECOMOG because of alleged human rights abuses committed by the
force. Rights groups and U.N. officials agree, however, that rebel
atrocities far outweighed ECOMOG crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The now nearly 11,000-strong U.N. force had been expected to
reach 13,000 troops by the end of June. The new West African
contingent will bring the total closer to the 16,500 recommended by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission has been troubled since it began late last
year. At least 11 peacekeepers have been killed and 25 to 30
wounded, U.N. force commander Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley said
Monday. Rebels have also robbed peacekeepers of their weapons,
vehicles and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Jetley insisted Monday his peacekeepers
were using ''force when necessary'' and had inflicted major rebel
casualties when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rebels are still licking their wounds,'' Jetley said.
''The RUF is in a total state of demoralization at the moment.'' He
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   No fighting was reported Monday, Jetley said, but state-run
radio said the rebels had captured the key town of Lunsar, about 60
miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another battalion of 1,014 Jordanian peacekeepers
left Monday to join some 980 of their compatriots already in Sierra
Leone, the state-run Petra news agency said. The new contingent
includes a field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 85 freed U.N. captives arrived late Sunday at Lungi,
just north of Freetown, from neighboring Liberia, where President
Charles Taylor had negotiated a steady stream of hostage releases
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Liberian military official said on condition of
anonymity that 52 hostages remained on the Sierra Leone-Liberia
border, but Jetley said all the former captives had been returned
to the United Nations in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The motives behind the RUF rebels decision to release their
hostages remained unclear. Neither the United Nations nor Taylor,
the RUF's closest regional ally, gave any details.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' leader, Foday Sankoh, is in government custody and
officials have said they may prosecute him for illegal diamond
dealing and the killings of 21 people by his fighters earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The West African leaders meeting in Nigeria said Sankoh should
be taken outside of Sierra Leone for his own protection. But Sierra
Leone Information Minister Julius Spencer said there was no such
agreement to do so. Therefore it appeared unlikely that Sankoh
would be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Any prosecution of Sankoh threatens to spark an escalation of
the civil war. Sankoh was convicted and sentenced to death for
treason once before in 1998, but was given amnesty under the July
peace accord.

<HEADLINE> State holiday sought to remember Harriet Tubman  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In ceremonies across New York state Monday,
Harriet Tubman was remembered as a Civil War nurse, scout and spy
for the Union Army who helped hundreds of slaves find freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tubman does not have official veteran status, veterans
here saluted her likeness on the Women Veteran's Memorial and
joined the call for a state holiday honoring the heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harriet Tubman is long overdue for honors from the state in
which she lived and where she is buried,'' reads a letter calling
on state officials to adopt a bill making March 10 ''Harriet Tubman
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   She ''devoted her life to the realization of the American credo,
'Liberty and Justice for all,''' the letter reads.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day gatherings in Queens, Syracuse, Binghamton, Buffalo
and the Bronx also celebrated the life of Tubman, who earned the
nickname ''Moses'' for her pivotal role in leading slaves to the
Underground Railroad -- a secret escape route used before the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by thousands of ''conductors'' who helped escapees get
from one hide-out to another on their way north, more than 100,000
slaves are estimated to have met freedom through the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Deputy Speaker Arthur O. Eve, D-Buffalo, and
State Sen. Michael Nozzolio, R-Seneca Falls, have sponsored bills
calling for a Harriet Tubman state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany Monday, James Howe of the 369th Veterans' Association,
an association of black veterans named after the all black unit
that served in World War I, presented state officials with a stack
of petitions signed by 10,000 people calling for the March 10
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is thicker than the Manhattan phone book,'' Howe said,
''and on Tuesday we've got five more volumes going to the
governor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor's office did not immediately return
a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the measure would make Harriet Tubman day the 13th
official state holiday and the most recent since Martin Luther King
Jr. Day was created in 1985 in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Bachmann of the Women's Building, a feminist organization,
said an official day honoring Tubman would also be the first
holiday in the country named for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a brave woman who deserves the necessary recognition
that other historic figures have had,'' Bachmann said. ''With
10,000 signatures of people calling for this, it can't be too long
before politicians feel pressure to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   A pamphlet produced in support of the holiday by the Black
Women's Leadership Caucus describes Tubman as the first woman to
serve in active duty in the Armed Services and calls her the only
woman in American history to lead an armed attack during a state of
war.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Smith, vice president of the Black Nurses Association,
said Tubman was much more than a ''relentless and fearless
soldier,'' explaining how she created a nursing home in upstate New
York to care for freed slaves who fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I treat her as a mentor and role model; a woman of distinction
who I strive to emulate,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A day in Tubman's honor would be a celebration of ''freedom,
justice and equality,'' said Hayley Eaddy, who attended the Albany
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a woman who had a major role in the building and
reconstruction of America.''	   
</P>
<P>
   Tubman died March 10, 1913 and is buried in Auburn, 23 miles
west of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Ontario Water Test Regs Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- Ontario's environment minister on
Monday announced regulations to improve water testing and guarantee
immediate reporting on contamination, following an E. coli epidemic
that has killed five and sickened hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Police and health officials were still investigating how the
wells in Walkerton, 90 miles west of Toronto, were infected with
the intestinal bacteria E. coli, and whether local officials broke
laws by failing to report water problems immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of people getting sick has decreased, health
officials said some of the two dozen hospitalized could still die,
including an elderly patient regarded as terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The province's environmental minister, Dan Newman, said new
health regulations would require all of Ontario's municipalities to
use accredited water-testing labs and to inform the government when
hiring a new private testing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Water plants would be reviewed and certified every three years,
and the ministry would clarify procedures requiring laboratories to
notify health officials, city officials and the environment
ministry of irregularities, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   One class-action lawsuit already has been filed, accusing local
officials of failing to notify Walkerton residents of the E. coli
contamination for days after finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Monday shut down a school in a Wingham, 25 miles
southwest of Walkerton, after its water source tested positive for
E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The type of E. coli detected in the school's well was unknown,
but more tests were being done. No sickness has been reported, but
officials told parents they should seek immediate treatment for
children suffering from diarrhea, nausea, cramps, and other
symptoms associated with E. coli, Huron County health inspector
Klaus Seeger said.
</P>
<P>
   Often spread through animal or human feces, E. coli bacteria may
have entered Walkerton's wells in flooding that followed a storm on
May 12. City officials acknowledged that the chlorinating system on
one of the town's two main wells was malfunctioning for weeks
before people started getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   A provincial water agency took control of the local water
utility last week, after Mayor Dave Thomson of Brockton
municipality, which includes Walkerton, disclosed that the utility
knew as early as May 18 of the E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomson and a local health official, the utility
failed to tell them about the problem, and a boil order for
Walkerton water was issued only on May 21 after increasing reports
of bloody diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Palmateer of GAP EnviroMicrobial Services said his company
had found another type of bacteria in the town's water supply as
far back as January. Palmateer said the findings showed surface
water was seeping into the town wells, and that he notified local
and Ontario officials about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry received test results in January and April that
showed coliform bacteria, but no E. coli, a ministry statement said
Sunday. Coliform bacteria can cause illnesses, but it is not as
deadly as certain strains of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10, Walkerton's water utility assured the province by
phone that ''corrective measures were being taken,'' including
extra chlorinating and additional tests, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Walkerton utilities commission submitted a lab report to the
ministry May 3, saying follow-up testing showed no traces of
coliform or E. coli bacteria, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Meets Russians  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Following a Monday meeting with top Serbian
opposition leaders, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged the Yugoslav
government to return an opposition-controlled TV station that was
seized last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition delegation appeared to fall short of its goal
of persuading the Kremlin to drop its support for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, Vuk Draskovic and Vojislav Kostunica, who lead
opposition parties struggling to oust Milosevic, met with Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev and other ministry officials,
but not with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Ivanov declined to say
whether he would meet with the trio, the news agency Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Moscow came as tensions rise in Serbia, the main
republic of the Yugoslav federation. Milosevic has intensified his
crackdown on opponents by shutting down independent media and
arresting activists, moves which have sparked violence and street
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian opposition wants Russia to use its close political
and economic ties with Yugoslavia to press Milosevic to hold early
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The importance was noted of stabilizing the situation in
Serbia and Yugoslavia, resolving the problems that are springing up
in a constitutional way, by the path of constructive dialogue,''
said a statement from the Foreign Ministry after the meeting. The
statement said Russia ''called for the quick return to television
station Studio B of its property.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of Studio B triggered days of mass protests and
clashes with Milosevic's powerful police. But the demonstrations
fizzled out, partly because the opposition failed to come up with a
clear strategy for what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has expressed concern about the situation under
Milosevic, but has shown little sign of abandoning its support for
him. Moscow vehemently opposed NATO's 78-day air campaign last year
against Yugoslavia, and recently said it was prepared to extend a
$102 million loan to Yugoslavia to help repair damage from the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is that official standing of Russia
is full support for the democratization of Serbia,'' Draskovic told
reporters after Monday's meeting. ''It is not my job to tell you
what the Russians are going to do, but I hope the Russians will
demand from Belgrade the same things existing in this state -- a
real multiparty parliamentary system, freedom of media.''

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Shooting in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An attacker shot and killed a
4-year-old Serb boy and two men in an eastern Kosovo village
patrolled by U.S. peacekeepers, NATO officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday evening attack in the village of Cernica, 28 miles
southeast of the capital, Pristina, also injured two men, said
Capt. Russell Berg, a spokesman for American forces stationed in
Kosovo. The men were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at
Camp Bondsteel.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, thought to be ethnic Albanian, remained at large,
Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings provoked widespread Serb protests, including a
threat by moderates to withdraw from an interim government
administered by the United Nations with both Serb and Albanian
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs rejoined the council only last month after a
months-long boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is high time we reconsidered where our participation in the
administration ... is leading us,'' said Momcilo Trajkovic, a
representative of Serb moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, armed with an automatic weapon, opened fire on a
group of Serbs gathered in a store in Cernica, killing 4-year-old
Milos Petrovic, said Lt. Scott Olson, a spokesman for U.S. forces
at nearby Camp Monteith.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandfather, Vojin Vasic, 60, and Tihomir Simjanovic,
45, also died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. peacekeepers were only a few hundred yards away, but didn't
see the attack, Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They heard the gunfire and ran in that direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers evacuated the wounded to a hilltop near the local
Serbian Orthodox Church so a helicopter could land and ferry them
to the hospital. The three died before the helicopter's arrival,
Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings were the latest in a series of attacks on Serbs by
ethnic Albanians seeking to get even since the end of the Serb
crackdown in the province nearly a year ago. Violence -- or fear of
attacks -- has led tens of thousands of Serbs to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 100,000 Serbs now live in Kosovo, down from some
200,000 before the outbreak of fighting last year between Yugoslav
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels that led to NATO intervention and
the deployment of international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, immediately
denounced the attack, insisting that only the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic stands to gain by unrest in this
southern Serb province.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can possibly be gained by killing a child?'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said a person reported by Serb media to be a suspect in the
shooting had turned himself in to authorities, but peacekeepers
said they had not yet determined whether the man could be described
as a suspect or a witness.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 villagers -- almost all those in Cernica -- attended the
burial of the three Monday evening, the Serbian news agency Beta
said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came just as U.S. peacekeepers were attempting to set
up a meeting between the community's ethnic Albanian and Serb
leaders in a bid to work out problems and build trust.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time such a meeting was close at hand -- only to
be shattered by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting the killings, more than 1,000 Serbs rallied in the
divided northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica, briefly blocking
traffic near the main bridge that divides the town into Serb and
Albanian halves.
</P>
<P>
   The local Serb leader, Oliver Ivanovic, called on the Serbs to
''guard your own houses and streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's committee for cooperation with the U.N. mission in
Kosovo said Monday the attacks on Serbs present ''a new brutal
phase of the ethnic cleansing,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year after the arrival of the international security forces,
the situation in Kosovo is dramatic,'' said the statement. ''The
international community has not secured peace and has not preserved
a multiethnic Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Qatar, Bahrain Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Gulf state of Qatar accused
neighboring Bahrain of establishing illegal settlements on its
territory as the World Court opened hearings Monday into its first
Middle Eastern border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After more than half a century of strife, including a 1986
skirmish, the two oil-rich states have agreed to abide by the
judgment of the U.N.'s highest court on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Qatar's desire, which I'm sure is shared by Bahrain, is to
find a just and peaceful solution to the long-standing dispute
between the two sisterly states,'' said Abdullah bin Abdulatif
Al-Muslemani, Qatar's representative to the court.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his conciliatory tone, Al-Muslemani insisted that
Bahrain was the guilty party in the dispute, which he said dated
back more than 60 years, well before both countries' independence
from Britain in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has soured relations between the two states, not only
because of the injustice that has been dealt to Qatar, but also
because of the natural feeling of provocation that any state would
feel at the existence of a foreign power in its territorial waters
only 150 meters from its shores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain's media had a different take on the case. ''Bahrain's
sovereignty over these islands stretches back to time immemorial,''
the English-language Gulf Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel centers on pearling and fishing rights in Gulf
waters, as well as sovereignty over the Hawar islands and the
Zubara land strip in Qatar where Bahrain's ruling family lived 200
years ago. The dispute flared in 1986, when Qatari forces seized 29
workers sent by Bahrain to build a coast guard station on a
contested reef.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain will begin presenting its case June 8. Sixteen sessions
of arguments and rebuttals are scheduled until June 29. No date has
been set for the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of 24 now before the court, formally known as
the International Court of Justice, which has never before heard a
dispute between Middle Eastern countries. Established after World
War II, the court has no enforcement powers and relies on voluntary
compliance with its rulings.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Pull Out of Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Hundreds of Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers
accompanied by tanks and artillery pulled out of the Kisangani
airport under U.N. supervision Monday, the first step toward
creating the first demilitarized city in warring Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies are nominal allies, each backing a rebel faction
in a 1{-year-old civil war against Congo President Laurent Kabila,
but their clashes in the northern city earlier this month claimed
at least 28 civilian lives. After that, they agreed to disengage
troops in the city and turn it over to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The withdrawal is in progress. Everything ... is according to
the plan,'' Maj. Ramadan Sissoko, one of 20 unarmed U.N. military
observers overseeing the pullback, said by telephone. ''This is a
very good day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The two armies have agreed to pull back 60 miles from Kisangani,
leaving 216 soldiers each until the United Nations deploys a
promised battalion of observers and troops. Each side Monday left
one platoon that will jointly control the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda each support a different and rival group of
Congolese rebels opposed to Kabila. The two governments accuse
Kabila of harboring their enemies -- Rwandan Hutu militiamen
responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and Sudan-backed
Ugandan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But their differences over the conduct of war led to fighting in
Kisangani, the only city in Congo where the two armies touch. The
conflict flared first in August, then again this month when the
Ugandans tried to introduce reinforcements from northern Congo and
expel the Rwandan units, according to U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told parliament in
the capital, Kampala, that Ugandan forces would not pull out of
Congo until others have done so -- including Kabila's allies from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia as well as Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has promised to strengthen the more than 100
military observers in Congo with a 5,537-member U.N. force that
would oversee the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and the rebels signed a peace accord in August, as did
their foreign backers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jews Make Final Pleas  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- The lawyers for 10 Iranian Jews charged with
spying for Israel closed their case Monday, arguing the accused
should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the court is not politically influenced, the judge will
have no choice but to clear all the charges against the
defendants,'' lawyer and spokesman for the defense team, Esmail
Naseri, told reporters and relatives of the defendants outside the
court in this southern Iranian city.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri said he had made the same point to the judges, causing
some of the relatives to cry for joy at his words.
</P>
<P>
   The case now turns to the prosecution side, which is led by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the indictments do not carry the death
penalty but that the accused could receive long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Jews accused in the same trial were not in court
Monday, presumably because the charges against them are less
serious. They are free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 13 Jews have pleaded guilty. Four, including the
three on bail, have pleaded innocent, and one has said he passed
information to Israel, but that it did not constitute espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has generated international concern amid accusations
of unfairness by defense lawyers. The United States has said the
outcome could affect its policy toward Iran. Israel has denied that
any of the 13 were its spies.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen said in Tehran Monday:
''We have come to Iran to express our concern about the 13 Jews and
we hope the trial will be fair and just.''
</P>
<P>
   His Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, insisted the trial was
an internal affair. ''We don't like other countries to interfere in
the domestic matters of Iran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri, the defense counsel, accused the state media Monday of
''conducting their own trial'' and acting as if the defendants
already had been convicted. A television cameraman was called in to
film the 10 defendants, who were forced to stand in a line like
''prisoners of war or slaves'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trial Naseri complained when confessions of two
defendants were broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   The main 10 defendants are accused of collecting photographs of
military installations for Israel and studying ways to poison the
water supply of Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   In the televised confessions, two defendants said they were
trained and paid by Israel to gather secrets in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argue that the confessions should not be
accepted as the accused endured 15 months in detention. The lawyers
also say the state failed to produce evidence that secret
information was handed to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   They also questioned the fairness of the revolutionary court
where the judge is also the prosecutor and there is no jury. The
trial, which began last month, is closed to the public on grounds
it involves national security.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows Chechnya Excess Probe  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Monday promised
leaders of the European Union that Russia would investigate alleged
war crimes in Chechnya, but said he would continue the military
action against the republic's rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are categorically against using the thesis of human rights
as a pretext to prevent Russia from restoring order in the
region,'' Putin told reporters, after meeting a high-level EU
delegation at the Kremlin. The delegation was led by Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country holds the rotating
EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has cut assistance to Russia, accusing Moscow of human
rights violations and disproportionate use of force in Chechnya.
After the talks, European Commission President Romano Prodi said
the EU may review its decision to cut funding to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin denies allegations of systematic human rights abuses
and insists that the heavy bombing and shelling of Chechnya, in
which many civilians have died, was needed to wipe out secessionist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations of law in Chechnya, whoever has committed them,
will be resolutely stamped out,'' Putin said. ''Dozens of lawsuits
have already been initiated ... including against military
servicemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Russia would cooperate with international
organizations to make the situation in Chechnya ''more
transparent,'' as EU leaders demanded greater access to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to see humanitarian aid arriving without
difficulty from the European Union... the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe should be able to enter and play their
role,'' EU foreign policy representative Javier Solana told
Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a political point of view we would like to see the
beginning of some kind of political dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin says that the bulk of rebel forces has already been
destroyed and it promises to rebuild the war-ravaged region and
restore normal life under military control. Putin said Monday that
the Russian parliament would soon pass legislation setting up a
temporary government in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, Prodi said the current situation in
Russia -- low inflation, a strong trade surplus and an austere
budget -- created a favorable environment for boosting trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Putin stressed his desire to bolster economic ties with western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia has been and will remain a European country in its
location, culture and attitude to economic integration,'' Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected president in March, wants to secure
stable relations with the West, and financial aid and investment to
help revive Russia's shattered economy.

<HEADLINE> Ex-French Leader Gets Onassis Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis and an American
scientist were named Monday as this year's recipients of the
Onassis Foundation awards.
</P>
<P>
   D'Estaing, 74, won the prize for ''International Understanding
and Social Achievement,'' for his efforts to form the European
Union and helping Greece to enter it.
</P>
<P>
   Theodorakis, 75, a prolific composer known for film score for
''Zorba the Greek,'' received the foundation's cultural award, and
John Doran, 55, professor at the University of Nebraska and a
researcher at the Soil and Water Conservation Research Unit in
Lincoln, Neb., received the environment prize.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive their awards at a ceremony Nov. 7 at the
Athens concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was established by the late Greek shipping
magnate Aristotle Onassis, in memory of his 23-year-old son
Alexander, who was killed in an airplane crash in 1973. Each award
is worth $250,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Bogosian likes the analogy of how
baseball's major-leaguers play virtually every night, just like
theater people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder, how do they get themselves up to really care every
time they go to bat, but they do,'' says the writer-actor, whose
latest one-man show is running off-Broadway. ''Every show is
important, because the people who are sitting out there have never
seen it before.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Wake Up and Smell the Coffee'' is the sixth such show he's
done off-Broadway since the '80s, and now he's not so tense while
performing.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he did one of these shows ''it was like being
thrown into boiling oil,'' he told The Associated Press. ''In the
old days, it was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to be scared while performing. Years ago, he says, ''I
realized one night when I was standing on stage that my toes were
curled inside my shoes as if I was trying to hang onto the stage.
And I was so tense that I would do the entire bit with my toes
curled ... And now I'm relaxed. ... I think the most important
thing is to remember to enjoy it.''

<HEADLINE> Probation officers seeking to carry firearms on duty  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The system is as old as the republic: the
legislative branch makes the laws, the judicial branch interprets
and the executive enforces them.
</P>
<P>
   It is the separation of powers doctrine, and it is at the heart
of a modern debate over whether New Jersey's probation officers
should be allowed to carry firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A state senator says they should, citing the fact that they are
frequently assigned to visit potentially violent felons in
dangerous neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court maintains that allowing probation
officers to carry guns and make arrests like police officers would
distort the separation of powers among branches of state
government.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, corrections officers and sheriff's deputies
fall under the executive branch. All are allowed to carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey probation officers ultimately report to the state
Supreme Court, whose chief justices for the past 30 years have
denied requests to arm them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delegating law enforcement duties and powers to probation
officers threatens their neutrality by allying them with law
enforcement and the executive branch of government,'' said Daniel
Phillips, the court's legislative liaison, in a letter to
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, however, the separation of powers
argument does not make sense, said state Sen. Robert W. Singer,
R-Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say if they carry a gun, they can't be impartial. Why?''
Singer asked.
</P>
<P>
   He has introduced a bill to allow probation officers to carry
weapons and to give the officers powers of arrest. It also seeks $3
million for firearms training.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee voted
unanimously to approve the bill, sending it the Appropriations
Committee. Singer introduced a similar measure in 1998 that did not
win full legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   He says probation officers today deal with a different type of
criminal than one who served probation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're more violent people, more dangerous people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a probation officer does not feel safe when visiting clients,
court rules tell the officer to leave the area or call police.
</P>
<P>
   Local police have duties of their own, and do not have time to
escort probation officers, said George Christie, president of the
Probation Officers of New Jersey, the union representing about
1,600 officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are serving a sentence of probation. Probation is
really prison without walls,'' Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   They know the officers are unarmed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had many, many incidents of assault and people being
attacked by dogs,'' Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   But a state official said statistics do not support the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, only one probation officer was injured and required
medical attention, said Richard B. Talty, the state's acting
assistant director of probation. That officer fell while chasing a
suspect, Talty said.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officers are required to attend a five-day safety
training program. Later they must attend a two-day refresher
course. Officers also carry pepper spray and get six hours of
training to be certified to use it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In dangerous areas, officers are required to make visits in
pairs, Talty said, and they are not penalized if they do not go
into places they feel are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't make a stop. You don't make a visit. Safety comes
first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, each county decides if probation officers carry
weapons. But the officers report to county administrators, not the
judiciary, said Sheryl Zunna, president of the New York Probation
Officers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officers in most states report to the judicial branch
and are not allowed to carry weapons, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an uphill battle that New Jersey is fighting,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Peres Said Ahead in Israel Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was
chosen by his party Monday to run for president and succeed Ezer
Weizman, who plans to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Peres is widely seen as the leading contender in the election,
scheduled to take place by secret ballot in Parliament on July 31.
Lawmakers will be choosing between Peres and legislator Moshe
Katsav of the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   The election for the largely ceremonial post was called
following the announcement Saturday by Weizman that he would step
down. His resignation comes after the attorney general ruled that
Weizman acted improperly by accepting gifts while in public office.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old president had said previously that he would
resign sometime this year, citing ill health and the implications
of a police investigation into more than $300,000 in gifts that he
took from a French millionaire. He has maintained that the money
was a personal gift.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, an architect of the Oslo Accords that launched the peace
process with the Palestinians, received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize
for trying to end the decades-long conflict. Although he is revered
abroad as a statesman, he has drawn criticism from the more hawkish
elements at home as being too conciliatory to Israel's Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Peres said Monday that if elected, he would act to unify the
country, which is deeply divided along religious and ethnic lines.
He added that although the president in Israel does not set foreign
policy, he would continue to be involved in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to abstain from anything. I'm not going to a
monastery,'' Peres said.

journalist jailed on Monday, his wife said, the latest sign of a
crackdown on pro-reform media and writers.
</P>
<P>
   Emadeddin Baqi was taken to Evin prison after being tried in a
press court with no jury, said his wife, Fatemeh Kamali.
</P>
<P>
   Baqi's lawyer, Masoud Haeri, said the detention was illegal.
''They cannot try a journalist without a jury,'' he explained, and
said he would object through legal channels.
</P>
<P>
   Baqi was tried in connection with articles he wrote last year in
the now-banned Neshat daily that questioned aspects of Islamic law.
He also has accused senior hard-line officials -- including former
Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian and former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani -- of involvement in the 1998 murders of five dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Intelligence Ministry has admitted some of its agents were
involved in the murders. The agents are believed to have been
sympathetic to hard-liners, who recently lost control of parliament
to reformers in elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wave of arresting and imprisoning journalists is clearly
aimed at stalling the reforms,'' Baqi said last month after he was
ordered to appear in the court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Saeed Mortazavi was also behind the closure of 18
pro-reform publications. Several other reformist journalists have
been jailed by the hard-line judiciary in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners have been fighting back against a popular reform
movement led by President Mohammad Khatami. But the hard-liners
control the judiciary, military and the broadcast network.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Dodges Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alberto Fujimori, Peru's autocratic president,
has won an unprecedented third term in an election questioned at
home and abroad. Now he faces the challenge of weathering the
domestic turmoil and international isolation that could befall
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday -- a day after a runoff election that saw a boycott by
the only challenger and clashes between demonstrators and riot
police -- the U.S. State Department called the vote invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors had wanted to delay the runoff to evaluate new
computer software for tabulating votes. During the April 9
first-round election, officials could not satisfactorily explain
how the number of ballots cast exceeded the number of voters by
more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''No president emerging from such a flawed process can claim
legitimacy,'' the State Department said in a statement. ''The
manner in which the Fujimori regime handled this problem is a
serious threat to the inter-American system and its commitment to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 61-year-old Fujimori, known for his cunning and
patience, has had his back to the wall before and has always
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that after his flawed victory Sunday over
challenger Alejandro Toledo, the legitimacy of his government is in
doubt. But most do not expect the international community to impose
severe sanctions against Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is just waiting to see if all the tough talk is going
to be matched by any real pain, and the only real pain would come
in the form of economic sanctions,'' said Catherine Conaghan, an
expert on Peru at Canada's Queens University who was in Lima
studying developments.
</P>
<P>
   Even the United States, viewed as the country most likely to
take strong measures to punish Peru, has to weigh other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is a key player in the anti-cocaine war in the Andes, and
Fujimori has been successful over the past five years in cutting
the output of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine, in half.
Also, any measures aimed at destabilizing Fujimori's government
could have unforeseen consequences in the Andean region, where
Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador all pose security problems.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with foreign journalists ahead of Sunday's election,
Fujimori made a point of mentioning his good relations with the
United States in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sort of laughing in everyone's face,'' Conaghan said.
''When he was asked last week about economic sanctions, he said
something like, 'What kind of economic sanctions are they going to
level against a country that's been judged to be very cooperative
and successful on the drug effort?'''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after Fujimori's lopsided victory, Franciso
Tudela, his running mate, said there would be no serious
consequences even if Washington imposed economic sanctions. He said
Peru had refinanced its foreign debt successfully, routinely
purchases arms from European nations rather the United States and
is willing to carry on the drug war without U.S. help if it comes
to that.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States imposes sanctions, he said, ''the
apocalypse that some predict is not going to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong action is even less likely from Peru's neighbors. Eduardo
Stein, chief of election monitors sent by the Organization of
American States, told The Associated Press before he left Lima that
he thought it would be difficult for OAS member states to agree on
any sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Fujimori had 50.9
percent to Toledo's 17.1 percent. Another 30.9 percent of the
ballots were spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo had boycotted the vote, saying the outcome was already
rigged, and he urged voters to void their ballots. Foreign monitors
withdrew before the election after warning that a fair vote could
not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have doubts that Toledo -- who has no organized
party and surged into second place only in the closing weeks before
the April 9 first round -- will be able to keep up the pressure on
Fujimori's government. Piero Ghezzi, a Peruvian financial analyst
at Deutsche Bank in New York City, predicted Toledo will quickly
fade, as did Fujimori's main opponents in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And despite large street protests Sunday against Fujimori's
victory, many Peruvians seemed resigned to his re-election. For
months, polls have shown that a majority of Peruvians have believed
all along that he would remain in power, by hook or crook if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Velasquez, a 52-year-old waiter, said he had no interest
in taking part in street protests called by Toledo to challenge the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we can do is just keep working at our jobs. What other
alternative do we have?'' he said. ''Fujimori will remain as
president no matter what we do.''

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Says Rebels Won't Disarm  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrilla
group said Monday its fighters will not disarm despite the Israeli
army's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as Israel threatens Lebanon every day with strikes,
attacks and punishment, Lebanon has the right to maintain all
elements of strength that can confront these Israeli threats,''
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in remarks published
Monday. His Iranian-backed guerrillas led the fight that pressured
Israel into withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the clearest signal so far that guerrillas will not lay
down their arms following Israel's withdrawal from a southern
Lebanese border enclave it had held for almost two decades as a
buffer against attacks on northern Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the withdrawal, Hezbollah had refused to divulge its
post-pullout plans. Israel has threatened harsh retaliation against
Lebanon if guerrillas attack northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening and Monday, Hezbollah guerrillas blocked the
road leading to the volatile border crossing point outside Kfar
Kila village with concrete barriers, rocks and dirt. The move came
hours after at least three people were injured there when Israeli
soldiers fired on stone-throwers at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese have been coming by the hundreds to the crossing point,
50 miles southeast of Beirut, some to throw stones and others to
take pictures or get a closer look at Israel, a country most have
never seen. Monday, few people showed up as normal life resumed
after the busy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today everybody is back to work,'' said Hussein Mahmoud Mehdi,
a street vendor selling date rolls. ''Those who've showed up
apparently have no work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army, deployed at entrances to the former Israeli
security zone in the south, reinstated measures that require travel
permits in an attempt to control the influx of people to the border
region and the flow of weapons seized by guerrillas from Israel's
allied militia.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Israeli army continued to wrap up the final
phases of its withdrawal, blowing up a large outpost just inside
Lebanon. Construction along the entire length of the border
continued as Israel hurriedly set up a new fence and
fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that he expected
the United Nations to recognize Israel's deployment to the
internationally recognized border ''in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah, Lebanon and their Syrian allies say Israel must
also leave the Chebaa farms, a strip of land tucked into the
western foothills of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with the London-based Arabic weekly magazine Al
Wasat, Nasrallah said that ''as long as the Chebaa farms area is
still under occupation, we do not consider what happened as a
complete withdrawal. This means that we will continue our Jihad
(holy war) to liberate this occupied territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon considers Chebaa farms part of its territory, a position
supported by Syria. But Israel says 90 percent of Chebaa farms is
part of the Golan, which was captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war. The United Nations considers the area Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen, who has been shuttling between
Israel and Lebanon to work out the deployment of peacekeepers, said
Monday after a meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud that
Israel has vacated the interior of southern Lebanon and is working
''intensively'' on leaving the border areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic family reunions happened Monday between Palestinians
living in Lebanon and their relatives inside Israel. People, some
overwhelmed with tears, clutched hands between the barbed wire
fence at the border checkpoint of Yareen, just east of the coast.

<HEADLINE> US Reps, Farmers Visit Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Arkansas lawmakers and rice farmers met Monday
with Cuban officials amid moves in Washington to ease the
four-decade trade embargo against this communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been very supportive of opening up trade with Cuba,''
U.S. Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln said after meeting with trade and
agriculture officials in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look over the past four decades, you will see those who
have been most affected are the people of Cuba, not the
government,'' the Arkansas Democrat said. There was little specific
information on the delegation's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member delegation from Arkansas traveled to Havana as the
U.S. House of Representatives debated legislation that would allow
food and medicine to be sold to Cuba. A vote by the full House was
expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved a similar trade measure last
year, and the House Appropriations Committee approved the measure
35-24 earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some 220 House members signed a letter supporting an easing of
the embargo, though there was fierce opposition from some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like the embargo ... has not worked,'' said Rep.
Marion Berry, a Democrat. Berry said that lifting the restrictions
on food and medicine sales would benefit both the Cuban people and
hard-hit Arkansas farmers seeking new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is the United States' No. 1 rice producer, as well as
an important supplier of poultry, pork, and soybean.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit to Cuba, members of the Arkansas delegation
were to tour an agricultural cooperative, a poultry farm and a
farmers' market. The group arrived in the capital, Havana, on
Sunday night, and was to return to the United States on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Yankee Victor Wins Met Mile  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Morales said he did all he could to
prepare Yankee Victor for Monday's Met Mile at Belmont Park. It was
more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did the best I could, and the horse did wonderful,''
Morales, a 36-year-old native of Venezuela, said with a grin after
the 4-year-old colt's impressive 4}-length win.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big test for him and he showed what he's made of,''
Heberto Castillo Jr. said after riding Yankee Victor home in 1:34
2-5.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Victor showed he is a premier miler, winning for the
third straight time at the distance. The three wins have come in
four starts since he had a testicle removed in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good trip and everything worked out,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Victory was a head behind leader Straight Man after the
first quarter-mile and was in front by a head over him after a
half-mile. He was a half-length ahead of Richter Scale with a
quarter-mile remaining, then drew off to win, with Honest Lady, the
only filly in the field, second.
</P>
<P>
   It was another three-quarters of a length to Sir Bear, the 1999
winner of the race, officially called the Metropolitan Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Victory paid $10.60, $5.90 and $3.50 and earned $450,000
for his owners with his fourth win in six starts this year and his
eighth in 18 career races. He has three wins in four tries at a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady, ridden by Jerry Bailey, returned $5 and $4. Sir
Bear, ridden by Eibar Coa, was $3.70 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the order of finish were Big Jag, Liberty Gold,
Richter Scale, Western Expression and Straight Man.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a four-race winning streak for the 6-year-old
Richter Scale, but none of those victories was farther than six
furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady carried 112 pounds, five less than either Yankee
Victor or Sir Bear. She was trying to become the first filly to win
107-year-old Met Mile since Gallorette in 1946.

<HEADLINE> Devils, Stars Match Similar Styles  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- When the New Jersey Devils gaze
into the Stars, they see themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Neutral zone trap? Check. A goaltender offended when he allows
more than a goal a game? Check. A defense that has left its mark on
the playoffs -- and their opponents? Check.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL waited until 2000 to stage the Stanley Cup finals that
were supposed to happen in 1999, or 1998. The Dallas Stars are the
defending champions, but the Devils consider themselves their equal
going into a Game 1 Tuesday night where hard hits should be
plentiful and goals should be at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the NHL's version of the Knicks vs. the Heat, one where
the team that wins won't necessarily be that with more skilled
players, but more survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a very interesting series,'' Stars forward Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ''We don't know each other real well now, but it
won't take long.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call it boring, even if the Stars allowed only 14
goals against Colorado, the fewest in a seven-game conference
finals or Stanley Cup semifinals in 50 years. Or that the Devils
have permitted only three power-play goals in 51 chances in three
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what they said last year, too, that Dallas and Buffalo
was a boring series,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
''Ask our fans, ask Buffalo, ask their fans. If that's boring, I'd
(love) to see it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, exciting isn't a word commonly used to describe two teams
with remarkably similar systems and stratagems that can be traced
to the Montreal Canadiens. Devils coach Larry Robinson, for
example, once was a Montreal teammate of Stars general manager Bob
Gainey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care, they can call us whatever they want,'' Robinson
said. ''If you are standing there with the Stanley Cup, you don't
care what kind of hockey you played, exciting or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Devils were the NHL's top two regular-season teams
in 1998 and 1999, but didn't meet in the finals either year, only
to make it in a season whether neither finished No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who swept their only Cup finals in 1995 against
Detroit, were overtaken by Philadelphia down the stretch in the
East. The Stars scrambled to finish sixth-best overall following a
succession of injuries and a terrible start.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference has won the last four Stanley Cups, but
the Devils -- the last Eastern Conference team to hoist the cup --
are the closest thing going to a Western Conference-style team.
</P>
<P>
   All three teams the Devils have eliminated (Florida, Toronto and
Philadelphia) had more points than any team Dallas defeated
(Edmonton, San Jose and Colorado). And, while most of the stars in
the East are goal scorers (Jaromir Jagr, Pavel Bure, Mats Sundin),
the Devils' biggest names are defenseman Scott Stevens and
goaltender Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the playoffs, the Stars' talented and
punishing defensemen, led by captain Derian Hatcher and Matvichuk,
will line up against those just as skilled in delivering big hits
and shutting down scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7 of the Devils-Flyers series, for example, may have been
decided when Stevens wiped out Flyers star Eric Lindros with a
clean but concussion-causing hit that may have ended Lindros'
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to play physical, but only when it's there,'' Stevens
said. ''We want to finish our checks and get in people's way and
make things tougher for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars own a decided edge in scorers with Brett Hull and Mike
Modano, who are tied for the playoffs lead in scoring. But Stevens
has controlled every goal scorer he has encountered this spring;
Bure, Sundin and the Flyers' John LeClair combined for one goal
against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game 1, I think, is going to be a little nerve-wracking for us
because we haven't been there in a while,'' the Devils' Jason
Arnott said. ''But it's going to be high-tempo and hard-hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no decided advantage in goal, where Brodeur and the
Stars' Ed Belfour are almost identical statistically; Brodeur's
goals-against average is 1.77; Belfour's is 1.81. Belfour is
exceptional in traffic, while few goalies move the puck as well as
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are both great goaltenders,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robinson said, ''The edge always goes to the Stanley Cup
champs of the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. For the first time since 1995, the Stars don't own
home ice advantage. That could prove significant since the Stars
have won 11 of their last 12 playoff home games and are 9-1 in
Reunion Arena in these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, didn't the Stars win twice in Buffalo last season while
winning the Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a certain status that goes with teams that have won
two Stanley Cups, especially two in a row,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ''And we want that status badly.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Terror Trial Continues  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A witness in the case of 28 men suspected
of planning terror attacks against Americans and Israelis testified
Monday that CD-ROMs seized from one of the suspects contained
information about assassinations and bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Ziad Hajaya, a computer expert at the General Intelligence
Department, told the military court that one of the 12 discs
included information on ''explosives and manufacturing explosives,
toxic and heavy weaponry.'' Hajaya is a prosecution witness.
</P>
<P>
   Hajaya said the CD-ROM also contained ''sketches of forged
stamps and aerial views, leaflets on the methods of intelligence
and assassinations, and information on military bombs and
rockets.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say to which of the 28 suspects the discs belonged,
but military prosecutor Lt. Col. Mahmoud Obeidat previously
identified the owner as defendant Khaled Mughames, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the 28 -- all Arabs -- are in police detention. The
remaining 12 are believed to be outside of Jordan and are being
tried in absentia. All are suspected of having links to Saudi
militant Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Obeidat charged the 28 defendants with different crimes,
including possession of explosives and affiliation with ''an
outlawed group'' involved in a ''conspiracy to carry out terrorist
attacks'' in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment sheet did not identify the group, but Obeidat has
told reporters the suspects were linked to al-Qaeda -- or ''the
base'' -- a terrorist organization allegedly led by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is wanted in the United States for allegedly plotting
the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
bombings claimed 224 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses already have implicated at least one
defendant of having ties to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials say the 28 planned bombing attacks on U.S.
and Israeli tourists during New Year's celebrations. The targeted
sites were Mount Nebo -- where tradition says Moses saw the Promised
Land -- and a Christian settlement along the Jordan River said to be
the site where Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's four-hour hearing, another prosecution witness
testified that Japanese-made communication equipment seized from
the defendants could have been used as remote control detonators,
effective for a distance up to 2.5 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys argued that the equipment could be found
in the local retail market.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which opened April 20, resumes Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Braves 1, Cubs 0  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Andres Galarraga ended Jon Lieber's no-hit bid by
homering with two outs in the seventh, and that was all Greg Maddux
needed Monday as the Atlanta Braves beat the Chicago Cubs 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finished with just two hits in eighth innings off
Lieber (5-4), who retired 20 straight after walking Quilvio Veras
to begin the game. Rafael Furcal singled in the eighth for the
other Atlanta hit.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (7-1), winning his third straight, allowed just six hits
and pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth by starting a
double play. In the eighth, Dave Martinez doubled off first base
with one out, but Maddux got Sammy Sosa on a grounder and struck
out Henry Rodriguez to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber, working on three days rest, struck out a career-high 12.
After getting Chipper Jones on a called strike three with two outs
in the seventh -- Jones was subsequently ejected for throwing his
bat -- Lieber hung an 0-1 pitch to Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga sent the ball into the left-field bleachers for his
13th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber pitched a perfect game for 6 2-3 innings last September
against the Cardinals, and it ended in similar fashion when Mark
McGwire homered. The Cardinals followed with five more hits and
sent Lieber to a 7-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieber got Veras on a called third strike to end the sixth,
Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was ejected when he came out to argue
with plate umpire Doug Eddings. Cox was tossed and then threw his
hat down during the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs loaded the bases in the fourth on a double, single and
hit batsmen, but Maddux showed why he has long been one of the
game's best fielding pitchers, grabbing Jose Nieves' comebacker and
starting a 1-2-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first shutout and second complete game this season
for Maddux, who walked two and struck out eight. He has 29 career
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs were hoping to activate Mark Grace from the
disabled list based on his performance in batting practice. It
apparently didn't pan out. Dave Martinez got the start at first.
Grace has a strained hamstring. ... The Braves scored 50 runs in
Maddux's previous 11 starts. ... The Cubs are now 14-6 against
Atlanta in the regular season since the start of the 1998 season.
... Controversial Braves reliever John Rocker had no apparent
trouble in the close confines of the bullpen along the right-field
line. Rocker chatted with fans and even shook hands with one while
he was stretching. ... The crowd of 40,123 was the largest of the
season at Wrigley Field.

<HEADLINE> Missiles May Be On Koreas Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
indicated Monday that Japan's concern over North Korea's missile
program might be discussed at a summit with North Korea in June.
</P>
<P>
   Kim alluded to the missiles at a joint press conference with
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori who was on a half-day visit to
South Korea, his first since he took the helm in April. He replaced
Keizo Obuchi, who died after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong
Il, in the North's capital, Pyongyang, on June 12-14 in the first
summit of the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a reporter's question whether he would raise the
North's missile program, South Korea's Kim said: ''The Japanese
concern and other international issues can also be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not fixed the agenda for the summit,'' Kim said. ''But
by bringing up various topics (in the summit), each side can know
what the other side thinks and misunderstands.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea in mid-1998 launched a multistage rocket that flew
over Japan and landed in the Pacific, raising fears over
Pyongyang's missile capability in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tough negotiations, the two Koreas recently
adopted a broadly defined agenda for the summit, calling for
efforts to promote peace and national unification.
</P>
<P>
   That formula could let North Korea raise the sensitive issue of
the U.S. military presence in South Korea, while South Korea in
turn can focus on the reunion of separated families and promoting
peace through economic exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he would not rush to reap a big success from the
summit. ''I would rather try to agree on whatever is feasible. More
can be agreed on at the second and third summit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Berlin, Germany in March, Kim offered massive
South Korean investment to help the North's dilapidated economy,
hoping that would ease tension and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Japan resumed normalization talks with North Korea in April for
the first time in eight years. The next round of talks, originally
scheduled for last week, has been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese media attributed the postponement to Pyongyang's
unwillingness to investigate allegations that about a dozen
Japanese were kidnapped by North Korean agents decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mori asked President Kim to convey Japan's eagerness to
normalize ties with the North during his visit to Pyongyang, Mori's
spokesman, Ryuichiro Yamazaki, said.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to South Korea, Mori was criticized for his
recent remark about Japan being a ''divine nation centered on the
emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment also has been harshly criticized in Japan as being
linked to the emperor-worship that fueled Japanese aggression
against Asian neighbors in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Mori apologized for the comment on Friday and reiterated the
apology at Monday's press conference, but has not retracted the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Japanese sentiment lingers in South Korea, especially among
older people who remember Japan's oppressive colonial rule of the
Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.

<HEADLINE> Kimani Wins Bolder Boulder 10K  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Kenya's Joseph Kimani, shrugging off
sweltering heat, raced to the largest victory margin in men's
Bolder Boulder history, beating countryman Dominic Kirui by 57
seconds in the annual 10-kilometer event on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Derartu Tulu led an Ethiopian sweep of the top three places in
the elite women's race, edging teammate Merima Hashim by just one
second -- the smallest margin of victory ever in women's competition
here.
</P>
<P>
   Three Kenyans claimed the top prize of $15,000 in the team
competition, with Ethiopian women sharing the $15,000 women's team
purse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a temperature at the start of 91 degrees, Kimani pulled
away from the pack at the third mile and steadily increased his
lead. He led Kirui by 18 seconds at four miles and by 40 seconds at
five miles.
</P>
<P>
   Kimani, 27, the world record-holder in 10K (27:04), slowed to a
stop about 15 yards before the finish line, thinking that
scaffolding which marked the start was also the finish. Told to
keep going, he resumed running the remaining few yards and crossed
in 28 minutes, 55 seconds to earn the $3,000 first prize for
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the finish was there because we started there,''
Kimani said. ''Someone was telling me, 'No, no, the other side.' It
didn't matter because I was so far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''At three miles, I decided to push. We train in Kenya in hot
conditions, so when I came here it was no problem for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimani spent two days traveling from Kenya to Boulder,
overnighting Saturday in London and arriving in Boulder on Sunday.
But he showed no signs of jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Kimani's winning margin over Kirui more than doubled the
previous largest margin, set in the first Bolder Boulder in 1979,
when Ric Rojas beat Frank Shorter by 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Kirui was second in 29:52. Ecuador's Silvio Guerra passed the
remaining Kenyan, Stephen Kiogara, to take third in 29:54 and
prevent a Kenyan sweep. Kiogara finished fourth in 30:03. David
Galindo of Mexico was fifth in 30:09, and Jonathan Wyatt of New
Zealand was sixth in 30:18.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Berhanu Adane of Ethiopia placed eighth in
30:29.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Simonich of Salt Lake City, Utah, was the top American,
finishing 36th in 32:08.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race, which began in 85-degree heat, Tulu held
off a charge from Hashim in the final kilometer, giving Ethiopia a
repeat in the team competition.
</P>
<P>
   Tulu, 28, finished in 33:09, with Hashim crossing in 33:10 and
Eyerusalem Kuma in 33:40.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Colleen De Reuck, the prerace favorite, finished
fourth in 33:53 after leading the first two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Coogan of Boulder was the top American, placing 26th in
37:47.

<HEADLINE> White Heart Wins Whittingham  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- White Heart let Self Feeder set the
pace and stalked him all the way before rallying in the deep
stretch for a neck victory in Monday's $300,000 Charles Whittingham
Memorial Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer, the even-money favorite, was pulled up 50 yards
out of the gate and was taken off in a van.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what happened here,'' Hall of Fame trainer Ron
McAnally said.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale and jockey Kent Desormeaux have gotten
more attention this month for winning the Kentucky Derby with
Fusaichi Pegasus, but they teamed up again Monday for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The race had special significance for Drysdale, a former
assistant to Whittingham from 1970-74. The Hall of Fame trainer
died last year at 86.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted to win the race because it's named for
Charlie,'' Drysdale said. ''Everything I do has a reflection on
Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Self Feeder set the pace under Eddie Delahoussaye, while White
Heart ran second until dropping back into fourth behind Self
Feeder, Deploy Venture and Sardauker at the top of the stretch
before angling out.
</P>
<P>
   ''They started sprinting at the half-mile pole, and my
experience is that if you start sprinting there, you usually come
up a little empty in the stretch,'' Desormeaux said. ''I thought if
I would let those three horses sprint alone and save my horse a
bit, I'd have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   British-bred White Heart covered 1\ miles on the turf in 2:00
4-5, the longest race ever for the 5-year-old, who carried 116
pounds. He paid $13.20, $6.80 and $5.
</P>
<P>
   Irish-bred Self Feeder returned $9.60 and $5.40, while
British-bred Deploy Venture and Matt Garcia were another
half-length back in third and paid $11.20 to show. Senure, the lone
non-European in the six-horse field, was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garcia's horse got a head in front, but I waited for my horse
to switch leads and when he did, man, he really took off,''
Delahoussaye said. ''I said to myself, 'All right, we're going to
get there,' but then out of the corner of my eye, I could see the
other horse coming.''
</P>
<P>
   White Heart, who won two stakes over a mile last year in Germany
and England for owner Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum, came to the United
States late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was run pretty much the way we thought it'd be run for
us,'' Drysdale said. ''We didn't want the lead too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer was close up coming out of the gate, but Chris
McCarron said he heard a popping sound from his mount, who was
coming off a pair of Grade II wins in the San Luis Rey Stakes and
the San Luis Obispo Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sure that I did,'' he said of hearing the popping sound.
''At that point, you don't guess.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnally wasn't sure what happened to Dark Moondancer, who
carried high weight of 123 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris said he heard something pop, but he said when he pulled
him up he looked all right. He thought maybe something was wrong
behind, but when he walked onto the ambulance, he said he looked
OK,'' McAnally said. ''I can honestly say he has never, never been
unsound since we got him.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settler Warns Barak  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak risks an attack on
his life if he evacuates Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip as a peace concession to the Palestinians, the
leader of a radical settler group warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Riklin said his comments were meant to alert security to
possible dangers posed by ultranationalists and should not be
interpreted as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, when I see Barak's plan and I hear the (settler)
voices, I say that if, God forbid, he will carry out this dangerous
plan, his days could be numbered,'' Riklin told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak told Time magazine in an interview published
its Web site that Israel would consider annexing such settlements,
as well as areas that ring Jerusalem, if the Palestinians
unilaterally declare statehood before striking a peace deal with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''That same night, if there is a unilateral declaration, we will
take steps that might include a decision of annexing blocs of
(Jewish) settlements (in the West Bank and Gaza Strip) or areas
which are needed for our security or areas around Jerusalem and so
on,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between senior negotiators from both sides are
slated to resume this week in Stockholm, Sweden. Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have set September as the deadline
for a permanent agreement on the thorniest issues between them such
as borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he would declare a Palestinian state by
September unilaterally if no peace deal is in place by then. The
Palestinians demand that they be allowed to establish a state in
all the Gaza Strip and West Bank as part of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Riklin is a leader of the Second Generation group of young
settlers who have seized West Bank hilltops in hopes of thwarting
the transfer of land to the Palestinians. Barak has said that some
settlements will have to be evacuated so land can be handed to the
Palestinians as part of a future peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers, politicians and religious leaders condemned Riklin's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unstable and weak-minded people who are inclined to get worked
up could use these words to commit violent acts,'' Chief Rabbi
Israel Meir Lau told the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Yigal Amir, an ultranationalist Jew
assassinated Yitzhak Rabin because he opposed the prime minister's
land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Zehava Galon of the dovish Meretz party said that Barak
should consider disarming settlers like Riklin who serve in reserve
units of the army. Galon said there was concern armed settlers
would try to disrupt a troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Rome Yanks Gay Pride Sponsorship  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Rome's mayor said Monday he was yanking the city's
sponsorship of July's Gay Pride events, which the Vatican doesn't
want taking place during the Holy Year called by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows an appeal by a top Italian cardinal to move
the event elsewhere. Premier Giuliano Amato has called the
scheduling of Gay Pride week during Holy Year ''inopportune'' and
added that ''unfortunately'' Italy's constitution doesn't allow the
gathering to be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist Mayor Francesco Rutelli, citing events like a gay
fashion show to be held near a church, said the city was
withdrawing official backing of the event although it would still
''be the guarantor of the gays' freedom to demonstrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians, including the president of Lazio region,
which encompasses Rome, have demanded the events, which range from
sports activities to cultural appointments, be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights leaders attacked the mayor's decision. ''It's a
matter of deciding if Italy is a lay country, free and democratic,
or it's a Vatican serfdom,'' said Franco Grillini, who heads a
commission in the national government's equal opportunity ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Oakley-Melvin, an American serving as international
director for the events, said about 200,000 people were expected to
come from abroad but that many of them have been asking organizers
if all will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tell them, 'Come, we're doing it. We'll march,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents fear the event will turn into a demonstration
against John Paul, who has defended the Vatican's condemnation of
homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley-Melvin said Rome's police headquarters told organizers
that neo-fascists were threatening to attack gay participants and
thus permits couldn't be issued for the various outdoor events.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pilgrims from the pope's homeland, Poland, are
expected in Rome for Holy Year activities at the Vatican the same
week as the gay events are scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Patient Rice Breaks Out for Lakers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- The triangle offense employed by Phil
Jackson and his coaching staff was terrific for Michael Jordan and
the Bulls in Chicago, and it's working well for Shaquille O'Neal,
Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Glen Rice, a prolific shooter coming off screens most of
his 10-year NBA career, it hasn't been ideal, because that's not
how it works. So Rice hasn't been the scorer with the Lakers that
he was been in the past, especially in these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the third quarter Sunday in Portland, when the
Lakers looked for Rice, and he rewarded them with 12 points to
spark a 34-19 surge that put Los Angeles ahead for good en route to
a 103-91 victory over the Trail Blazers and a 3-1 lead in the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always get down a little bit when you go out there and
can't do the things you're capable of doing,'' Rice said Monday at
the Lakers' practice facility. ''I've realized I've got to be
patient; good things come to those who are patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice finished with 21 points -- his first 20-point game in six
weeks -- and seven rebounds as the Lakers moved within one win of
their first NBA Finals appearance in nine years. They can clinch
that berth Tuesday night at Staples Center in Game 5 of the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to use Glen all year, he's been there for us
in tough times,'' O'Neal said. ''I'm sure he's going to be there
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice was there Sunday, his 33rd birthday, at least in part
because Jackson made sure he'd be there, stressing the 6-foot-8
sharp-shooter get opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always make a conscious effort to try and get Glen the
ball,'' Jackson said. ''Once Glen got going, he was fine. We didn't
have to go back to specific sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who brought a 20.6-point scoring average into the season,
entered the game having averaged 12.9 points in 13 previous playoff
games and 9.7 in the first three games of the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see the way they went out and looked for me (Sunday), ran
me off screens, it was a big plus,'' Rice said. ''The first thought
that came to mind was, 'All right, I can do what I do best.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's right knee bothered him during and after the Lakers'
106-77 loss to the Blazers in Game 2 at Staples Center on May 22,
but three days off before Friday night's third game gave him a
chance to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The knee is pretty solid,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, so are the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was definitely a big test for us,'' Rice said of Games 3
and 4 in Portland. ''Winning twice up there was no surprise to us.
We realize when we go out and play the way we're capable of
playing, we're the best team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things we do very well, we learn from our mistakes.
I think that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has said he hopes to remain with the Lakers following this
season, when he becomes a free agent. Whether the parties will be
able to agree to a financial package both can live with is in
question.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the focus is on the present.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big accomplishment for us,'' Rice said of the wins in
Portland. ''But we realize the series is not over. Portland is a
great team, they've beaten us on our court before, pretty much
manhandled us.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to go back to Portland, give them any
confidence. By putting the pressure on them, I think we can pull
this thing out. We've got to move the ball, try to get their legs
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   It might help if the Lakers find No. 41 a little more, as they
did Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 5, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- B.J. Surhoff hit a three-run homer
and Pat Rapp won for the first time in more than a month as the
Baltimore Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-1 Monday for
their fifth win in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff's sixth homer finished a four-run second off Steve
Trachsel. Rapp (4-2) scattered 11 hits, but only allowed one run in
six-plus innings for his first victory since April 25 -- a stretch
that included two losses and three straight no decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick homered off Trachsel (3-5) in the eighth. Jeff
Conine had a RBI single in the second, but twice hit into double
plays with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, pitching on two days' rest after lasting just a third
of an inning in a loss to Oakland on Friday night, got off to
another shaky start. Conine's RBI single gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead,
and Surhoff followed with his sixth homer before the Tampa Bay
starter settled down.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander worked out of a jam in the third after Delino
DeShields singled and Albert Belle doubled with one out. Will Clark
was given an intentional walk to load the bases, but the Devil Rays
escaped when Conine hit a pop foul up the right field line and
first baseman Fred McGriff made the catch, and then threw to the
plate to catch DeShields, who was trying to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who's two homers shy of 400 and stuck in a 5-for-33
slump, struck out with two runners on in the first, grounded out in
the same situation in the third and was retired on a soft liner to
first with two runners on in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay had nine hits -- all singles -- off Rapp before Russ
Johnson doubled leading off the seventh. Felix Martinez reached on
an infield single, and Rapp lost his shutout when Johnson scored on
Randy Winn's grounder to DeShields, who was charged with an error
when he failed to get a force out at second.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Trombley replaced Rapp and got the first two outs in the
seventh. Buddy Groom came on to get McGriff to line to Will Clark
to get out of the jam. Bordick restored the Orioles' four-run lead
when he hit Trachsel's first pitch in the eighth into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Turn Back The Clock Day at Tropicana Field, with the
Orioles wearing replicas of uniforms from their 1970 World Series
championship season. The Devil Rays wore uniforms of the 1966 minor
league St. Petersburg Saints ... Plate umpire Tim Timmons was
brought in as a replacement for Ed Rapuano, forced to leave Sunday
night's game between the Yankees and Red Sox when he was struck on
the right knee by a foul ball ... Surhoff was 7-for-55 (.127)
before his homer ... The jerseys the team wore will be auctioned
for charity. Bidding started over the weekend and Cal Ripken Jr.'s
jersey already was at $1,276.

<HEADLINE> Ritchie Signs Extension With Pirates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pitcher Todd Ritchie, once a bargain buy as a
minor league free agent for the Pittsburgh Pirates, signed a
two-year contract extension worth about $5.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates signed Ritchie out of the Minnesota Twins' minor
league system on Nov. 8, 1998. They picked him up thinking he could
add pitching depth for their Triple-A farm team.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie wound up leading the major league staff with a 15-9
record and a 3.49 ERA that ranked him sixth in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of amazing when I step back and look at it,''
Ritchie said. ''I think they made a good choice. Now I have to go
out and hold up my end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 starts this season, Ritchie is 2-3 with a 4.68 ERA.
Ritchie, who is making $380,000 this season, would have been
eligible for salary arbitration after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty simple,'' Ritchie said. ''The main thing for me
is to get security for my family, relax and go out there and play
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, the Pirates signed center fielder Brian
Giles to a five-year extension worth at least $45 million. General
manager Cam Bonifay said Sunday he has also initiated talks with
catcher Jason Kendall, whose contract expires after next season.

<HEADLINE> Self-Rule Restored in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain transferred governing
authority back to Northern Ireland at midnight Monday, offering new
hope for peace to the divided province.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope these institutions will take root,'' Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble told a news conference at Stormont, the
government's Belfast headquarters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in six months that Britain has returned
a measure of self-rule to the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' narrow approval Saturday of a return to
Catholic-Protestant power-sharing cleared the way for Britain to
restore the administrative authority it suspended in February just
11 weeks into its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling a peace agreement reached in 1998, the province's
power-sharing government began operating in December, ending 27
years of direct rule by Britain. But it was suspended 11 weeks
later because the IRA refused to make any disarmament commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA broke the impasse three weeks ago, promising to begin
putting its weapons ''beyond use'' -- a euphemism for disarming -- if
power-sharing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Trimble narrowly managed to persuade his badly
divided party to give the IRA a chance to live up to its pledge.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Trimble warned the IRA that it must deliver on
its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, leader of the province's major Catholic party,
the pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party, also said the
entire province must ensure that the newly reformed government --
the centerpiece of the landmark 1998 peace agreement -- is able to
survive and function.
</P>
<P>
   ''The body politic, the community at large and the political
process simply cannot take another ending of this administration,''
said Mallon, the senior Catholic in the newly restored Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and Mallon met Monday to prepare for the second transfer
of power. The full Cabinet was scheduled to meet Thursday to get
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Northern Ireland's unlikely local coalition succeeds
will depend largely on IRA actions.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein declined to speculate on when the IRA would begin to
reveal any of its secret weapons dumps to international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities must also deal with the controversial issue of
reforming Northern Ireland's police force and with potentially
divisive questions such as whether to fly Britain's Union Jack flag
over government buildings.

<HEADLINE> Giants 7, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Felipe Crespo tied the score
with a two-run single in the seventh inning, and Bill Mueller
followed with a two-run double as the San Francisco Giants rallied
to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-0 against Curt Schilling, the Giants broke through for
four runs in the seventh, making a winner of Shawn Estes (4-2), who
allowed two runs -- one earned -- on four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored in the second on Desi Relaford's RBI
groundout and in the seventh on Bobby Estalella's passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (1-3), who gave up four runs on nine hits in 6 2-3
innings, kept the Giants in check most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   He was still working on a shutout in the seventh after giving up
consecutive one-out doubles to J.T. Snow and Rich Aurilia. Snow was
forced to hold at second until Aurilia's fly to center started
knuckling in the wind, glancing off the glove of Doug Glanville.
Snow had to stop at third.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella, playing against the Phillies for the first time since
they dealt him to the Giants last spring, popped out, but Crespo
lined a single to right, snapping an 0-for-20 drought by the Giants
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard singled, and Mueller flared a double to left.
Shortstop Relaford, third baseman Kevin Jordan and left fielder Ron
Gant all tried to chase down the bloop, but it wound up falling in.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford came closest, making a running back-hand stab at the
ball, but he tripped over the fallen Gant and the ball popped loose
as Jordan also tumbled over Gant.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling walked Barry Bonds intentionally and was relieved by
Wayne Gomes after walking Jeff Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added three more runs in the eighth on Estalella's
run-scoring double and RBI singles by Armando Rios and Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Embree got his first save of the season in as many
opportunities, the third of his career.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Prior to the game, the Phillies placed third baseman Scott
Rolen on the 15-day disabled list with a left ankle sprain and
recalled left-handed pitcher Bryan ward from Triple-A Scranton to
fill his roster spot. ... The Giants, playing their inaugural
season in their new bayside ballpark, are projected to top the 1
million mark in attendance Tuesday night in their 25th home game.
The quickest the Giants had reached 1 million in attendance
previously was in 1993 in the 36th home date at their old park on
Candlestick Point. ... Jordan's two doubles produced his fourth
straight multihit game. ... Crespo is now 6-for-14 with two walks
and seven RBIs as a pinch-hitter.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Reach New Maturity  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With a weekend sweep in Portland, the Los
Angeles Lakers have erased most of the doubts.
</P>
<P>
   A vastly talented collection of players with questionable mettle
became a gritty team that persevered in one of the toughest
situations the NBA can offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we matured a little bit more, kicked it up a level as
far as execution goes,'' guard Kobe Bryant said. ''If we get in a
tight situation, we're going to remember those games we pulled out.
It's good for your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lead the Trail Blazers 3-1 in the Western Conference
finals. They can make their 18th appearance in the NBA Finals, but
first since 1991, with a homecourt victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, the Lakers had blown their homecourt edge
with a 29-point loss in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we got our homecourt advantage taken away, we
re-focused,'' center Shaquille O'Neal said. ''They're still an
aggressive team, we know that they're not going to lie down. But
for us, when we play together, we're a hard team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was calm confidence at the Lakers' practice facility
El Segundo, the Blazers were a grumpy bunch before their workout
downtown at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday was about as frustrating a game as I've played in,''
Portland forward Brian Grant said. ''We were in control of our
destiny and we weren't able to grasp it. The Lakers have stepped
their game up offensively and defensively, and done what they've
had to do, whereas it seems like we've taken a couple of steps
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to stay in this thing, we're going to have to
bring it tomorrow and let everything hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's Rasheed Wallace wasn't talking, Scottie Pippen was
barely talking and coach Mike Dunleavy was grumbling about how he
believes the officials favor O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen spent about 90 seconds with reporters before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just got to come out and play. That's pretty much it,''
he said. ''We realize now we're one game away from elimination, so
we just have to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy, though, had plenty to say. Before anyone asked him
anything, he was blasting the officiating involving O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were three times in yesterday's game where he commits
fouls that they don't call,'' Dunleavy said. ''... He's not Wilt
Chamberlain yet. He can foul out of the game between now and when
he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   The officiating regarding O'Neal is inconsistent, Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been times we've tried to foul him on purpose but they
aren't called and he winds up dunking the ball because we've got to
foul him harder,'' Dunleavy said. ''Then there are other times when
you can't pick a rhyme or reason. You're just bodying up and the
whistle blows.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's illegal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's interesting to me when I have a conversation on the
sideline with one of the referees and I'm saying 'OK, Brian Grant's
past the hash mark. Shaquille is in the lane with both feet. That
is illegal. Why won't you call it?' And I get no response,''
Dunleavy said. ''That to me is just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The three illegal defenses that were called against the Lakers
on Sunday weren't nearly enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shoot, let's go back to the film and shoot them
retroactively,'' Dunleavy said. ''We might have still won that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious problem defending the Lakers is that O'Neal has to
be double-teamed, Dunleavy said. That means someone has to be open.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a situation where Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice are
role players,'' Dunleavy said. ''They're not exactly chopped
liver.''
</P>
<P>
   And it just gets more difficult when Ron Harper scores 18
points, as he did Sunday, or Robert Horry is hitting 3-pointers, as
he did in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Then if O'Neal is making his free throws, as in his 9-for-9
performance Sunday, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that when we go out and play the way we're capable
of playing, we're the best team in the league,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' solace is the fact that they have won twice on the
Lakers' court, once in the regular season and in Game 2 of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not uncharted territory for us,'' Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   But only six teams have come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look great 3-1,'' Blazers guard Steve Smith said,
''but if we get this one and go back to Portland, I don't see us
losing three games in a row in Portland. So we figure we can make
it back here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' offensive strategy will be to attack the Lakers for
48 minutes, not just in the early stages of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are toughest defensively when it's a halfcourt game,
Portland point guard Damon Staudamire said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever it takes, you've got to put the ball in the hole,''
Stoudamire said. ''You can sit up here and talk about
double-teaming Shaq and Kobe and Ron Harper scores 18, but if we
put the ball in the hole, it's still a different game, that's the
bottom line.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Gonzalez Misses Rangers Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez missed what would have been his
first game against his former team, when he was scratched from
Detroit's game against Texas on Monday because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers manager Phil Garner said he didn't know whether Gonzalez
would be available for any of the three games against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's day to day,'' Garner said. ''But it's worse today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez strained his left foot Saturday during the Tigers' 4-3
win against Toronto. He was the Tigers' designated hitter and went
hitless in Sunday's 12-7 loss to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Garner had Gonzalez as the designated hitter in his original
lineup Monday but Gonzalez told trainer Russ Miller that the foot
was bothering him again.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said the injury is painful when Gonzalez plants the foot
during a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''All it has to do is offset you that much,'' Garner said,
holding two fingers less than an inch apart, ''and you can't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The series between the Tigers and Rangers is their first meeting
since Gonzalez headlined a nine-player deal between the clubs last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a two-time AL Most Valuable Player, is off to a slow
start with the Tigers, batting just .261 with nine home runs and 19
RBIs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENNSAUKEN, N.J. (AP) -- One man remained hospitalized Monday
after nearly two dozen people attending an all-night ''rave'' party
fell ill after apparently taking illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 sent to area hospitals were among an estimated 11,000
people who attended the ''Whistle 3'' event that ran from 7:45 p.m.
Saturday until 7 a.m. Sunday at the South Jersey Expo Center. The
party drew people from several states, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitalized man, age 20, was listed in stable condition at
Kennedy Memorial Hospital. Another man, 26, was discharged Monday
afternoon from that hospital. Their names were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Police also made at least two arrests during the party. Daniel
Uhl, 21, of New York City, was arrested and charged with possession
of illegal drugs and intent to distribute them. Police in
neighboring Cinnaminson police also made an arrest, but details
were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Massacre Survivor Meets Parents  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO MENDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASERIO LA CANOA, El Salvador (AP) -- Most believed that the
6-year-old boy had been massacred by the army along with a thousand
other peasants in 1981, at the start of El Salvador's 12-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years later, Jose Martinez, now 25, has been reunited
with his parents after an exhaustive investigation by the
Association to Support the Search for Children, an organization
dedicated to finding children who disappeared during the war.
</P>
<P>
   He was saved and later adopted by one of the soldiers who
attacked the village of Los Angueta, in the eastern province of
Morazan.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from the Catholic Church's human rights
office, more than 1,000 peasants were gunned down and the victims
were buried in common graves during the massacre, which took place
from December 11-13, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blessed be God, who took care of you so well,'' exclaimed
Martinez's father, Jose Cenobio Guevara, as he hugged and kissed
his son during the reunion Sunday in the small town of La Canoa, 50
miles southeast of the capital, San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believed the war had snatched him from us, but he is alive,
thank God and the heroic soldier who protected him,'' Guevara said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Manuel Ortega Hernandez, protected the boy during
the three-day military operation of U.S.-trained Salvadoran
soldiers, and later adopted him.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez stayed with Ortega until 1990, when the ex-soldier went
to live with relatives in the United States. Martinez still lives
and works as an agriculture specialist in northern Chalatenango
province where the family raised him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank him because he saved my life and because I found my
parents again,'' said a sobbing Martinez, accompanied by his wife
and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing he said to me was, 'You are going to stay at
my side. I'm going to give up my life for you. If you die, I will
die. God willing, you're coming to my house,''' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Association to Support the Search for Children
has investigated 557 cases of children who disappeared in the
Salvadoran war.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has located 90 children, more than 50 of whom
were adopted by families in the United States, Guatemala, Honduras,
and several European countries said the group's director, Father
Jon Cortina.
</P>
<P>
   His organization on Monday asked congress to create a national
commission to help solve the 374 remaining cases.
</P>
<P>
   During El Salvador's 12-year civil war, more than 75,000 people
were killed by soldiers and members of the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front. Peace accords signed in 1992 ended the
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Election Council Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's entire election council
resigned Monday, succumbing to widespread criticism after a general
election was postponed because of technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the five-member board came just hours after
President Hugo Chavez's closest political ally said he hoped the
council would ''facilitate'' the process of scheduling new
elections by stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Miquilena, who is also the head of Venezuela's interim
legislature, said if the council didn't step aside, lawmakers would
have to ask the country's high court to remove its members.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice suspended the May
28 vote, citing a lack of ''credibility and transparency'' caused
by technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, council members have come under fire from civic and
political leaders who say they failed to disclose the problems that
led to the vote suspension. The council is also under investigation
by the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were expected to fill more than 6,200 public offices,
including those of president, congress members, governors, mayors
and local council members. But problems with computer software
needed to tabulate votes and register more than 36,000 candidates
jeopardized the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities have denied any wrongdoing, saying they
were also misled. They blame the Nebraska firm of Election System
and Software for the computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The company denied responsibility, saying changes by election
authorities in posting thousands of candidates hindered the firm's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday's announcement by council second-vice president
Eduardo Semtei, election officials had dismissed the calls for
their resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The council had also come under fire because it was hand-picked
by Chavez's leftist coalition in an exercise widely criticized as
undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   New elections are required by a new constitution Chavez pushed
through last year calling for most public offices to be
''re-legitimized'' through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature must now set a new election date.

   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius, who battled
for church rights when heavily Roman Catholic Lithuania was under
Soviet control, died Sunday, the Vatican said Monday. He was 79
</P>
<P>
   He died in Kaunas, where he served as archbishop until his
retirement four years ago. No cause of death was given.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II said he was ''deeply saddened'' by the death
of a prelate who ''never allowed himself to be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul named Sladkevicius a cardinal in 1988, the first from
Lithuania since it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
Lithuania regained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet authorities had long hindered him from performing his
religious duties and he was held under virtual house arrest from
1963 to 1982, according to the Vatican.

<HEADLINE> 10 Charged in Haiti Ferry Hijack  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Authorities arrested 10 former
Haitian police officers Monday on charges that they disguised
themselves as missionaries, hijacked a ferry boat and attempted to
sail to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 men were returned to the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince,
by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter after the ferry was found adrift in
U.S. waters south of the Bahamas on May 21. There were 121 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were false missionaries. Their real mission was to sail
to Miami,'' said Jean Luckner Louis, captain of the 80-foot
catamaran, Gonave en Fleche.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men were active-duty police officers who were fired
Monday after their journey, and eight were former traffic police,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't steal the boat -- we stole the destination,'' said
former traffic police officer Michel Evrex, 24, as he waited in
handcuffs in front of the office of the Haitian Coast Guard
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they were Protestant missionaries, the 10 men rented the
boat on May 16 to go from Port-au-Prince to the fishing village of
Pestel, an 11-hour trip, according to the ferry's shipping agent,
Serge Jeudi. They paid $2,125, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The men boarded the ferry with 50 other people dressed in white,
who police believe paid to be smuggled into the United States. One
of them told the Associated Press he paid $125 for the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The group then hoisted a flag reading ''The Church of Holiness''
in French, Jeudi said.
</P>
<P>
   There rest were passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before arriving in Pestel, the 10 men pulled out
guns, tied up the crew and forced Louis to change course, the
captain said. They then changed into their police uniforms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other ''missionaries'' danced and clapped their hands,
passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat ran out of fuel 500 miles northwest of Haiti, and was
spotted by a freighter, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Passengers told
Coast Guard officers they had been hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   All were sent back to Haiti, except a 13-year-old boy whose
request for political asylum was being investigated by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Evrex said he and the others hatched the plot to escape Haiti's
crushing poverty. He had been jobless since being fired from the
police force for missing one day of work in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to find work, but no one wanted to hire me,'' he said.
''There was no other way out.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Haitians trying to flee to the United States by
boat has increased recently as the Caribbean country's economy
worsens amid political instability. More than 1,000 Haitians have
been picked up at sea so far this year, compared with 750 people in
all of 1997, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Official Urges No ABM Change  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is even more vulnerable than the United
States to missile attacks by so-called ''rogue states,'' but still
opposes modifying the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to address the
threat, a top security official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed changing the 1972 treaty to allow
a limited system of radar and interceptor rockets to knock out
missiles. Washington says the system would focus only at small
attacks, which it fears could be launched by countries such as
North Korea or Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Russia considers the treaty a cornerstone of nuclear security,
and argues that modifications would destroy the Cold War-era logic
behind the treaty -- which supposes that if a nuclear state lacks a
defense system, it will be less likely to launch an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat from rogue states is greater to Russia than the
United States. We're closer, and even a medium-range rocket can
threaten us while it can't at all threaten the United States,''
said Sergei Ivanov, secretary of the Security Council, which
advises the Kremlin on national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''But even the modernization, as the Americans say, of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty will lead to extremely dangerous and
unpredictable tendencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States opened talks on amending the treaty last
summer. Russia's intransigence dimmed hopes of reaching an
agreement by the June 3-5 presidential summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton set a deadline for this summer to decide on
whether to deploy the anti-missile system. The Pentagon has said
the system could be in operation by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has threatened to quit all arms-control
treaties if the United States goes ahead with the missile-defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   During the upcoming summit, Putin and Clinton planned also to
discuss how to safely dispose of tons of weapons-grade plutonium
Russia stockpiled during the Cold War, Ivanov said. The United
States already helps provide storage containers and a bar-code
labeling system to help prevent theft.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential talks were also likely to touch on U.S.
antidumping measures taken against Russian steel manufacturers last
year, a U.S. quota on Russian-made rocket engines, and regional
security in world hot spots, such as West Africa, the Balkans and
the southern Caucasus Mountains region.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Honoring the nation's war dead, President Clinton spoke on
Memorial Day at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. He
vowed: ''The United States will always honor and never forsake its fallen
heroes, and we will not abandon their families.'' Hours later, Clinton was bound

Union summit meeting and then go to Germany on June 1-3, Russia on June 4-5 and

Elizabeth, Pa., Gore said of his duty as an Army journalist in Vietnam: ''I know
that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes that we honor on
this day.'' At Fort Hood, Texas, Bush, who served stateside in the Air National
Guard during the Vietnam era, said: ''As we recall our fallen heroes, we're
privileged to be in the company of heroes. Thank you for serving our country.
You make us all proud to be Americans.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department today rejected the re-election of
President Alberto Fujimori in Peru as invalid, declaring that ''no president

government's refusal to accommodate international observers and complaints about
the newly installed vote counting system. Fujimori's election was boycotted by
his only challenger, Alejandro Toledo.

<HEADLINE> UN Lauds Nigeria on Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan congratulated
Nigeria Monday on the first anniversary of the country's return to
democracy, calling it ''a significant landmark in Africa's quest
for political stability and economic progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement marking the 1999 inauguration of President
Olusegun Obasanjo, Annan praised the Nigerian leader's commitment
to democracy and his efforts to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's election in February 1999 ended more than 15 years of
often brutal military rule.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued on the day West African leaders meeting
in Nigeria agreed to send 3,000 troops -- mostly Nigerians -- to
support a U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone. Peacekeepers in
the west African country have been humiliated by rebel attacks and
the capture of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has long been divided along blurry ethnic, regional and
religious lines. Since Obasanjo came to power, fighting over such
divisions has taken thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Still Cleaning Up From Floyd  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Janie Teele still gets nervous when it
rains hard, even though she has a place of her own again eight
months after Hurricane Floyd took the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I went through, I see it as the Third World, where you
have monsoons,'' said Teele, a secretary at City Hall. ''I just
can't see it happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's encounters with hurricanes Floyd, Dennis and
Irene, North Carolina emergency officials are taking no chances
with the new storm season that begins Thursday. Dennis battered the
coast for a week before slogging ashore, while Irene menaced, then
veered out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   State Emergency Management Director Eric Tolbert said the state
is still pushing ahead with Floyd recovery efforts while readying
for future hurricanes, both on the coast and inland. Forecasters
have warned that the storms of the past few years are the start of
an active hurricane era.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned with the forecast over the next two
decades of increased hurricane activity,'' said Tolbert.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, North Carolina's worst natural disaster, barreled ashore
Sept. 16 at Oak Island and drenched eastern North Carolina with 20
inches of rain, causing epochal flooding, at least 51 deaths and a
record $6 billion or more in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville, about 70 miles east of Raleigh, sustained at least
$87 million in private property damage. About 20 miles to the
northeast, Princeville, a town founded by freed slaves, was nearly
destroyed; a presidential commission is studying how to help it.
</P>
<P>
   The storm left Teele's mobile home uninhabitable. She lived with
her three grandchildren in an aunt's house until she got a
government-financed apartment. Her mobile home is one of about 800
Greenville dwellings that are part of a federal buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding had such an impact on the city of 58,000 that the city
government published a 2000 calendar with pictures from the storm's
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 6,000 Greenville residents were evacuated after the Tar
River crested about 16 feet above flood stage, inundating a third
of the city. Because of the experience there and in other eastern
North Carolina communities, officials embarked on a campaign to buy
and tear down structures in flood plains. By May, the governments
planned to spend $291 million to buy 4,160 structures that once
housed about 5,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   At Oak Island, Floyd's ground zero 30 miles south of Wilmington,
bulldozers continue to move sand onto the beach to form new
protective dunes while workers hammer and saw on everything from
damaged beachfront steps to fishing piers.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd ripped out about 800 feet of deck at the Long Beach Pier
and dumped up to 3 feet of sand in the streets; today, the pier
owners have rebuilt most of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't believe the devastation,'' said Tommy Thomes, son
of the pier's owner. ''I've been here for other hurricanes before,
but this one was really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty beachfront homes were destroyed, and others survive
precariously.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look down the beach either side from the pier, the
amount of brand new treated lumber ... there's tons of rebuilding
going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once regarded as largely a coastal phenomenon, hurricanes
recently have struck deep into North Carolina with such frequency
that emergency management officials may revise their advisories to
coastal residents, said Tolbert.
</P>
<P>
   He said coastal residents may be told in the future to stay put
if they are safe from rising waters. During Floyd, people fled
their coastal homes to Greenville, Rocky Mount, Wilson and other
inland cities, only to face floodwaters there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flood reinforced the risk of people fleeing a safe area,''
Tolbert said. ''There's no way of knowing where a hurricane is
going to go and what kind of damage is going to happen inland.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, all but three North Carolina counties -- Madison,
Mitchell and McDowell, all in the state's far west -- have reported
hurricane damage, said Tom Hegele of the emergency management
division.
</P>
<P>
   The change began with Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which came ashore
at Charleston, S.C. It tracked through Charlotte and Winston-Salem
before exiting into Virginia. In 1996, Hurricane Fran barreled into
Raleigh with 100 mph winds, immobilizing parts of the city for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, Assistant City Manager Marvin Davis and other
city officials meet regularly to discuss recovery issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things we are trying to do is get people out of
harm's way,'' Davis said as he drove past block after block of
abandoned houses and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had about 2,000 structures that had 12 inches or more of
water in them'' after the storm cut off access to the city for
about a week, Davis said. ''It could happen again.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Shortstop Hurt, Leaves Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez injured
his left forearm when he tagged out the Dodgers' F.P. Santangelo
and had to leave Monday's game against Los Angeles in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets said no X-rays were needed and that Ordonez is listed
as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, picked off first base by pitcher Al Leiter, took off
for second. Ordonez, a three-time Gold Glove winner, came across
the bag to get the wide throw from first baseman Todd Zeile and
whirled around before slapping a tag on Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo's helmet hit Ordonez on the arm as he slid in head
first. The Mets shortstop was down briefly, got up and made several
short tosses to see if there was pain, then walked off the field,
slamming his glove on the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott replaced him at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez is hitting .188 with nine RBIs.

</P>
<P>
   The race had special significance for Drysdale, a former
assistant to Whittingham from 1970-74. The Hall of Fame trainer
died last year at 86.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted to win the race because it's named for
Charlie,'' Drysdale said. ''Everything I do has a reflection on
Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Self Feeder set the pace under Eddie Delahoussaye, while White
Heart ran second until dropping back into fourth behind Self
Feeder, Deploy Venture and Sardauker at the top of the stretch
before angling out.
</P>
<P>
   ''They started sprinting at the half-mile pole, and my
experience is that if you start sprinting there, you usually come
up a little empty in the stretch,'' Desormeaux said. ''I thought if
I would let those three horses sprint alone and save my horse a
bit, I'd have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   British-bred White Heart covered 1\ miles on the turf in 2:00
4-5, the longest race ever for the 5-year-old, who carried 116
pounds. He paid $13.20, $6.80 and $5.
</P>
<P>
   Irish-bred Self Feeder returned $9.60 and $5.40, while
British-bred Deploy Venture and Matt Garcia were another
half-length back in third and paid $11.20 to show. Senure, the lone
non-European in the six-horse field, was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garcia's horse got a head in front, but I waited for my horse
to switch leads and when he did, man, he really took off,''
Delahoussaye said. ''I said to myself, 'All right, we're going to
get there,' but then out of the corner of my eye, I could see the
other horse coming.''
</P>
<P>
   White Heart, who won two stakes over a mile last year in Germany
and England for owner Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum, came to the United
States late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was run pretty much the way we thought it'd be run for
us,'' Drysdale said. ''We didn't want the lead too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer was close up coming out of the gate, but Chris
McCarron said he heard a popping sound from his mount, who was
coming off a pair of Grade II wins in the San Luis Rey Stakes and
the San Luis Obispo Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sure that I did,'' he said of hearing the popping sound.
''At that point, you don't guess.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnally wasn't sure what happened to Dark Moondancer, who
carried high weight of 123 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris said he heard something pop, but he said when he pulled
him up he looked all right. He thought maybe something was wrong
behind, but when he walked onto the ambulance, he said he looked
OK,'' McAnally said. ''I can honestly say he has never, never been
unsound since we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the $100,000 Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes, Caller One,
ridden by Corey Nakatani, went to the lead out of the gate and
stayed in front to win the race honoring the late trainer of Triple
Crown winner Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Caller One covered seven furlongs in 1:21 and beat Dixie Union
by two lengths in the field of four 3-year-olds. Caller One paid
$6.60 and $3.60. Swept Overboard was third and Archer City Slew
fourth. There was no show wagering after Elegant Fellow was
scratched.
</P>
<P>
   In the $75,000 Willard L. Proctor Memorial Stakes, Squirtle
Squirt survived a stewards' inquiry to beat Our Magistrate by 1{
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., Squirtle Squirt covered 4{ furlongs
in :51 4-5, which equaled the stakes record set in 1998, and paid
$3.60, $3 and $2.40. The winner bumped leader Our Magistrate while
taking the lead with a sixteenth remaining.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Conservative Wins Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A poll published Monday showed the
conservative opposition candidate running for Mexico's presidency
won the second televised debate, the last before the July 2
election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Vicente Fox also won the first televised debate
against ruling party candidate Francisco Labastida, which was last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six percent of those who saw the Friday night debate and
were interviewed over the weekend by the newspaper Reforma said Fox
won. Twenty percent gave the victory to Labastida and 18 percent
said leftist opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted face-to-face with 1,455 people and seemed
to confirm a survey Reforma did Friday immediately after the
debate. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Fox pulling roughly even with Labastida after the
first debate, in April.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous polls released by different agencies in recent weeks
have shown varying results about Mexicans' voting preferences, with
some portraying the Labastida-Fox race as neck-and-neck, others
with Labastida in the lead, and still others with Fox surging
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey, an independent ACNielsen poll conducted for
the newspaper Milenio last week, showed Labastida with 42.9
percent, Fox with 35.8 percent and Cardenas with 17.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's debate came off only after protracted negotiations
in which Fox had been seen as stubborn and contradictory. The
Reforma poll showed 37 percent of those surveyed saying Fox put up
the biggest fight in the talks. Another 16 percent pointed to
Labastida and 11 percent named Cardenas.

<HEADLINE> 25 Sue Priest for Alleged Sex Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Twenty-five men have accused a Roman
Catholic priest of abusing them as children.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Doug Ray said that from the third
or fourth grade until he was a freshman in high school, his parish
priest subjected him to ''an incremental scale of sexual abuse as
bad as one can imagine, and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Elliott claims he had a similar experience with the same
priest, the Rev. Maurice Grammond.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents entrusted us to Grammond believing this would be
the last place harm would come to us. He and the church broke that
trust,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 41, was the first to accuse Grammond in a lawsuit in
December. Others joined gradually, with 13 joining in Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Elliott said they were molested during the 1970s in
Seaside, where Ray is a city councilman. Elliott is a hairdresser
in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Both sat in front of enlarged photos of themselves as grade
school students and seemed on the verge of tears at times. Several
other plaintiffs were present but kept their anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese issued a statement on Friday saying it
confronted Grammond after an accusation in 1991 and that Grammond
denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Archbishop sent him for professional assessment and
suspended him of all priestly ministry,'' the statement said.
Grammond has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Slader said the statute of limitations prevents
criminal prosecution of Grammond, who is 79, and living in the
Alzheimer's unit of a retirement center in suburban Portland.
</P>
<P>
   But he said civil suits can be pursued for up to three years
from the time a victim ''discovers...significant injury in his
life'' resulting from molestation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks at least $4.6 million for each
defendant, was filed against Grammond, the archbishop and the
Archdiocese of Portland and others.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese is accused, among other things, of failure to
notify parishioners of Grammond's past molestations of boys,
failure to monitor his activities and advise authorities and
failure to have other adults accompany Grammond on camping trips
and other youth activities.
</P>
<P>
   Slader said the case is the biggest of its kind after the case
of the Rev. James Porter of Massachusetts, who was accused by 99
people of molesting them while they were children in the 1950s and
1960s. He pleaded guilty in 1993 to molesting 28 children and was
sentenced to 18-20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Ships Crash Off Portugal, 6 Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASCAIS, Portugal (AP) -- A Norwegian cargo ship sank Monday
after colliding with another vessel off the Portuguese coast,
leaving six crew members missing, state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-foot Nord Frakt went and a 910-foot South Korean ship
crashed off Cascais, about 10 miles west of Lisbon, state radio RDP
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were searching from the Nord Frakt's missing
crewmen. The report gave neither the nationalities of the crew
members nor the total number of people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials confirmed the collision and sinking but would
give no other details.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean vessel, the Hunday Emperor, sustained minor damage,
the news agency Lusa said. Officials said one or both of the ships
apparently failed to respect sea lane boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean ship took part in search operations for the missing
crew, along with a Portuguese air force helicopter and plane, two
Portuguese navy ships and two merchant vessels.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Comes to 'Friendly Confines'  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- John Rocker at Wrigley Field was a prescription
for chaos at a baseball park that's already had a major fan-player
run-in this season.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, the Chicago Cubs implemented their latest policy
aimed at curbing fan rowdiness, and it coincided with the first
Wrigley appearance this season of the Atlanta Braves' controversial
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after members of the Los Angeles Dodgers
went into the stands when a fan took catcher Chad Kreuter's hat,
security was tight.
</P>
<P>
   It might get even tighter
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hallinan, head of security the commissioner's office, and
members of the Cubs' security staff sat in the first row of seats
behind the Braves' right-field line bullpen that is separated from
fans by a chest-high brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   After a fan came down the aisle and began screaming at Rocker,
he was taken away by security, according to a Chicago Sun-Times
reporter. He said Hallinan plans to speak with Cubs officials about
tightening security in the stands around the bullpen even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and Braves play again Tuesday night, the first night
game at Wrigley since the incident involving the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got mild applause when he took the field during batting
practice. Once the game started, he headed to the bullpen after the
top of the first, took his seat, signed an autograph for a fan on a
Braves cap and then posed for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   He stretched casually in the grass behind the bullpen, but
didn't get into the Braves' 1- 0 victory Monday over the Cubs, a
game witnessed by 40,123 -- the largest crowd of the season at
Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me they are good fans,'' Braves reliever Mike Remlinger
said. ''Whether it was us or the Dodgers, once something like that
happens, it's kind of preventative and after the fact. Once it
happens, nobody wants it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the May 16 brawl involving the Dodgers, the
Cubs had already beefed up security around the bullpen area.
Nineteen members of the Dodgers were suspended for a varying number
of games, and one of the fans involved has filed suit against both
the Dodgers and the Cubs organization, saying he was injured in the
fracas.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy that went into effect Monday reduced the number
of beer vendors by 10 percent; reduced vendors' inventory by 50
percent during their last trip into the stands; cut off beer sales
in the bottom of the sixth instead of the top of the seventh; added
more security personnel; and prohibited fans from sneaking down
into lower sections from other seats.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour before Rocker emerged from the Atlanta dugout for
batting practice, three security guards were stationed near the
Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said he was not aware of any more
stringent security plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any more than any time we've been here,'' Cox
said, adding he'd like to see the Rocker hype die down. ''I wish it
would go away, but apparently it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Don Baylor, who was the Braves' hitting coach last
season, said he didn't know how many players would be able to
handle the scrutiny Rocker has endured since he made offensive
comments about minorities, gays and immigrants in a Sports
Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker missed the Braves' earlier trip to Wrigley this season
because he was serving a season-opening suspension stemming from
the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough situation to be in -- teammate wise, visiting
teams -- it's a hard situation for anybody,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And had he still been with the Braves, would Baylor -- who is
black -- have had problems with Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe not with him, but what he said and who he said it
about,'' Baylor said. ''He jumped on a lot of guys over there who
are real good guys.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies 8, Astros 7  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton homered twice for the second time in
three days, helping the Colorado Rockies rally past the Houston
Astros 8-7 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Helton homered leading off the second and broke a 7-all tie with
a leadoff shot in the eighth off Jose Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   With his fourth multihomer game this season, the 12th of his
career, Helton raised his season home-run total to 17 and lifted
his major league-leading batting average to .417.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros dropped to 2-14 in one-run games this season.
Houston's last four games have all been decided by one run,
starting with last Friday's win over Atlanta, the Astros' first
one-run victory this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (5-0) pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Jose
Jimenez survived a two-hit ninth for his eighth save. Colorado has
209 runs in 23 home games, an average of 9.09.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hildago went 3-for-3 with a three-run double for
Houston, and Jeff Bagwell hit a 452-foot, two-run homer in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter Pedro Astacio allowed seven runs and nine hits
in 5 2-3 innings. Houston's Octavio Dotel gave up five runs, 10
hits and six walks in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Caminiti's homer off Astacio put the Astros ahead 7-4 in
the sixth, pinch-hitter Jeffrey Hammonds hit an RBI single off
Yorkis Perez in the bottom half and Colorado tied it in the seventh
on run-scoring singles by Tom Goodwin and Mike Lansing off Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman's sacrifice fly put Houston ahead in the first.
Helton's first homer and Brent Mayne's RBI single gave Colorado a
2-1 lead in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's three-run triple made it 4-2 Astros in the third, but
Colorado came right back and tied it in the bottom half on Mayne's
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's two-run homer then gave Houston a 6-4 lead in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bagwell needs two RBIs for 1,000. ... Houston has homered
in 16 straight games, extending the team record set Sunday. ... The
Astros have not been shut out in 79 games, the longest current
streak in the NL.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 91, Pacers 89  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- So well were they playing and so easy were the
points coming, that the New York Knicks got a two-minute standing
ovation at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The game got closer and a 17-point lead shrank to one, but the
Knicks never stopped playing at a high level as they defeated the
Indiana Pacers 91-89 Monday to even the Eastern Conference finals
at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if we made a statement, but we did come out with
an edge to us, a good mental determination, intensity and energy,''
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''Indiana is so good offensively that
leads are not as safe as they'd be against defensive-oriented
teams, and thankfully the clock ran out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   No player came up bigger than Larry Johnson, who was flashing
his ''Big L'' gesture and spinning gleefully in circles after
hitting a 3-pointer with 4:25 left to swing the momentum back New
York's way after the Pacers had pulled within one.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward added a 3-pointer two minutes later for an
eight-point lead that helped the Knicks wrap it up after they
dropped 33 points on the Pacers in the first quarter for their
highest-scoring quarter of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   New York played again without center Patrick Ewing, who sat out
his second straight game with acute tendinitis in his right foot,
but their other injured players -- Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby
-- suited up.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who broke a bone in his left foot at the end of Game
3, jumped so high for a thunderous dunk in the first quarter that
he nearly hit his forehead on the rim. He finished with 12 points
and held Jalen Rose to 18, while Camby played on a sprained knee
and had eight rebounds, five points and three blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised,'' said Kurt Thomas, who filled in admirably
for Ewing. ''I know the character of this team.'
</P>
<P>
   Another of the injured Knicks was Johnson, whose chronically
sore back stiffened up Sunday and forced him to miss the second
half of practice. Repeatedly scoring on isolation plays in the low
post against Dale Davis and passing to open teammates when he was
double-teamed, Johnson shot 10-for-16 from the field, making five
3-pointers, with seven rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-pointer with 4:25 left led to the longest-lasting ''Big
L'' gesture of his career, Johnson cocking his right arm into a
right angle and pointing at his elbow with his left fist for almost
10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The shot gave New York an 85-76 lead, and the Knicks hung on
from there to ensure that the series will return to Madison Square
Garden for Game 6 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This game was the most I've been open during the series,''
Johnson said. ''They went to double-team and I found myself wide
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Wednesday night at Indianapolis, where the Pacers
looked so confident just a few days ago after winning the first two
games of the series. But it was the Knicks who had that look over
the weekend, even as the injuries kept piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston scored 17 points for the Knicks, Thomas added 16
and Ward had 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds. New York
was 10-for-14 from 3-point range and outrebounded Indiana 41-32.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller had 24 points for the Pacers, who could never come
all the way back after allowing the Knicks to open a 14-point lead
at the end of the first quarter and the 17-point lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel like we're going to win this series,'' Rose said.
''I feel like we're the better team. We're disappointed, because
any time you get a 2-0 lead and you're the No. 1 seed in the
conference you expect to find ways to win on the other team's
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing for nearly the entire game, the Pacers got back
into it with a 22-10 run bridging the third and fourth quarters.
Miller made a 3-pointer from in front of Spike Lee's courtside seat
with 6:50 left -- a large portion of the crowd of 19,763 groaned as
the ball was in mid-air -- to make it 77-76.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson answered with a 3-pointer after a scramble for a loose
ball under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the biggest shot of the game right there,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller missed a 3 from the same spot as before and then threw
the ball away on an entry pass, and Thomas converted a 15-foot
jumper to make it 82-76 with 5:12 left. Rose missed a hook shot and
Johnson buried his 3-pointer from the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana pulled within three on a 3-pointer by Travis Best with
10.5 seconds left, but Sprewell iced the victory by making the
second of two foul shots with 4.1 seconds to go. Sprewell actually
missed his second attempt, but Rose was called for a blatant lane
violation to give Sprewell another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Best scored a meaningless tip-in at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks improved to 5-1 against Indiana in the playoffs when
playing without Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the percentage with or without him,'' Indiana center
Rik Smits said. ''I hope he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley started in Ewing's place and picked up two quick
fouls, bringing Thomas into the game earlier than expected. Thomas
started looking to score right away, hitting a jumper the first
time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell wasn't looking hobbled at all by the broken bone in his
foot, soaring through the lane for an emphatic two-handed slam that
started the Knicks on an 8-0 run for a 22-12 lead. The Knicks hit
10 of their first 12 shots and finished 14-for-18 in the first
quarter to take a 33-19 lead into the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had an 8-0 run early in the second quarter to pull
within six, but it proved to be just a brief flash of cohesion.
Failing to run the same plays that had been working in the first
three games, such as getting the ball to Smits in the low post or
clearing out for isolation plays by Rose, the Pacers repeatedly
jacked up jumpers and rarely drove to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Johnson, Houston and Ward all reached double figures by
the half, and the Knicks received the thunderous ovation as they
walked off the court with a 57-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers kept trying to sustain runs in the third quarter, and
each time the Knicks stole the momentum. Two offensive rebounds by
Dudley led to second-chance 3-pointers by Johnson and Ward, and
another offensive rebound led to Johnson's turnaround jumper for a
67-54 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana was looking to go more to Smits and Rose, but Smits was
rushing shots and missing while Rose was trying to find a rhythm.
Rose scored nine points in the quarter while Johnson scored seven,
and the Knicks took a 73-65 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: This victory ended a trend for the Knicks. After falling
behind 2-0 in the playoffs in 1996, 1998 and 1999, they won Game 3
and then lost Game 4 each time. ... New York's victory means that
the start date for the NBA Finals will be Wed. June 6. ... New
York's Chris Childs committed three fouls in the first half, and
not surprisingly he complained after each one. ... Dudley finished
with five fouls, five rebounds and no points in eight minutes. ...
Derrick McKey played four minutes for Indiana. His only statistics
were two turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Memorial Day Address  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the final Memorial Day observances of his
presidency Monday, President Clinton promised continued commitment
to the search for lost American war dead and paid solemn tribute to
families left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans never fought for empire, for territory, for
dominance, but many, many Americans gave their lives for freedom,''
Clinton said following the traditional wreath-laying at the Tomb of
the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and North Korea will resume
negotiations early next month in Kuala Lumpur over excavations for
soldiers missing half a century. Those talks have been stalled
since December, when the Pentagon balked at new North Korean
demands for humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will always honor and never forsake its
fallen heroes, and we will not abandon their families,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to find and identify American war dead, primarily
from the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, demonstrates ''our
commitment to seek the fullest possible accounting,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited families of missing soldiers to breakfast at the
White House before the ceremony, and several families rode in the
presidential motorcade for the short distance to Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no more compelling way to understand how important
our continuous (repatriation) efforts are to the hearts and minds
of Americans than to hear it from family members themselves,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest area targeted for U.S. recovery operations in North
Korea is near Unsan, a site of major battles between elements of
the U.S. Army's 8th Cavalry Regiment and Chinese troops that swept
south across the Yalu River in early November of 1950. The Pentagon
believes more than 500 sets of remains could be recovered there.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, U.S. recovery operations in North Korea have yielded
42 sets of remains. More than 8,000 servicemen are still missing
from the war -- many from the battles with Chinese troops in late
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at graduation ceremonies at Georgetown University's
law school, retired Gen. Colin Powell praised Vietnam and Korean
War veterans for their sacrifices in unpopular wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two wars claimed the lives of over 100,000 young
Americans who were doing their duty,'' Powell told 1,000 graduates.
''In one case, they saved a nation from communism that has become a
thriving, wealthy democracy,'' Powell said of South Korea. ''In the
other we lost the war and tyranny prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the
government installed in Vietnam after the war cannot last. ''We may
yet see that our ideals prevailed in Vietnam as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Clinton marked the national ''moment of
remembrance,'' which asks each American to pause for a minute of
reflection on the service and sacrifice of veterans. A red-coated
Marine trumpeter played taps on a White House balcony at 3 p.m.
EDT, as Clinton, golf cap over his heart, listened from his private
White House putting green.
</P>
<P>
   The observance began in 1997 as an informal effort. This year,
Congress voted to establish the ritual as a national event. Clinton
also ordered the federal government to recognize the observance.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton left for Portugal, to begin a week of
economic meetings and political summitry in Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that his trip marks the first visit of an American
president to Berlin since the city became the capital of a unified
Germany and the first time an American president will address a
democratically elected legislature in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world today would not be recognized by those who lived in
the beginning of the Cold War,'' Clinton said. ''Old adversaries
have become allies, dictatorships have become democracies. Europe
is more peaceful and united, the communism we fought to contain has
collapsed.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers, Knicks Series All Even  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie Miller knew this wasn't going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   His Indiana Pacers marched into Madison Square Garden halfway to
their first berth in the NBA Finals after beating the New York
Knicks twice at home. And two games later, that's where they still
are.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to put a stranglehold on the Knicks, Indiana came
up well short of that goal, losing on Saturday and then again
Monday. Now they head back home with the best-of-seven series
reduced to a best-of-three and the Knicks with all the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a team that went to the NBA Finals last year, knocked
us out and were shorthanded,'' Miller said of the Knicks. ''They
wouldn't do that if they didn't know how to play. By no means,
nothing comes easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers dug themselves a 17-point hole in the first half and
nearly climbed out of it, narrowing the Knicks lead to one in the
fourth quarter before losing 91-89.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback hardly satisfied Miller, who led the Pacers with 24
points but made just nine of 23 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for me to take anything from a loss,'' he said. ''We
played harder, got up into them in the third and fourth quarters.
We've got to start that way. We need a defensive effort for 48
minutes, not just a half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were terrible in the first 24 minutes, outrebounded,
outshot and outhustled. They took a halftime tongue-lashing from
coach Larry Bird and played much better after that.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said there was no mystery about what had happened early.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all defense,'' he said. ''We didn't play defense in the
first quarter. We had our usual start that we have every once in a
while. They were hitting shots and they were just ripping us apart.
Second half, we decided to defend. We forgot to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's with the lackadaisical start for a team in position to
take control of the series?
</P>
<P>
   Bird said that was nothing new for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had problems all year in the first quarter,'' he said.
''We feel if we can keep it even in the first quarter that we're
probably going to win the ballgame. A lot of times we bury a hole
for ourselves. Sometimes we get out and sometimes we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Pacers' second-half spurt was fueled by Jalen Rose,
who managed just three points in the first half but finished with
18. He remains optimistic about Indiana's chances to recover from
this lost weekend in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel like we're going to win this series,'' he said.
''I feel like we're the better team. We're disappointed, because
any time you get a 2-0 lead and you're the No. 1 seed in the
conference you expect to find ways to win on the other team's
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird also tried to take a positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked so hard all year to get homecourt advantage and we
lose two games in New York,'' he said. ''But we are going back
home. We can't use that as a cushion, but we are going back home.
Hopefully, we can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   They better if they want to get to the finals.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Military Takes Control  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Moving to end Fiji's crisis, the country's
army commander imposed martial law Monday night and began to
isolate the rebels who have been holding the prime minister and
other government officials hostage for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, announced he had
assumed control of Fiji and that President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara
had quit after running the country since the coup began May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have, with much reluctance, assumed executive authority of
the country, and henceforth declared martial law,'' Bainimarama
said at a news conference. He said soldiers will restrict access to
the parliamentary compound where the insurgents are holding Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Coup leader George Speight is a member of the ethnic Fijian
majority. He wants Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister from the
Indian minority, removed from power and Indians barred from leading
the country again. Fijians of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of
the population of 813,000 on this Pacific island, but control much
of the nation's commerce in this country 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Speight refused Tuesday to recognize Bainimarama's authority and
called on the army to replace him. Only half of the Fiji's military
support the commander, Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting access to the parliament compound, the military hopes
to isolate the rebels from supporters who have come and gone
freely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country will be run by a military government,''
Bainimarama said. ''The primary objective of this government is to
take the country toward peace and stability and the well-being of
Fiji at the earliest opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the commander spoke, the military imposed a
48-hour curfew in the capital, Suva. In a show of force, numerous
troops and police patrolled the streets. Because of the crisis, the
U.S. State Department warned Americans Monday night not to travel
to Suva and urged U.S. citizens here to register with the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bainimarama's military previously had expressed support
for President Mara, the troops had taken little action. The
strategy changed Monday, one day after a mob supporting Speight
killed a policeman and knocked Fiji television off the air. The
death of the policeman was the first fatality in the hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, negotiators had met again to seek a resolution
to the standoff, but no progress was reported. The streets in Suva
were largely quiet after police advised people to stay home and
schools to close.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Speight's rebels had threatened to kill Mara's daughter, Adi Koila
Mara, a Fijian legislator and one of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a measure of the man,'' Downer said. ''This is an
appalling thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A former insurance salesman, Speight was fired last year by the
prime minister as chairman of two companies involved in managing
Fiji's lucrative timber trade. He had been appointed to both posts
by the previous government, in which his father was a senior
member.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and countries including Australia, New
Zealand and the United States have criticized Fijian forces for
failing to crack down on Speight and his allies. Sanctions have
been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly condemn the repugnant, criminal actions of George
Speight and his band of gunmen who continue to hold hostages in
Fiji's parliamentary complex,'' the U.S. Embassy in Suva said in a
statement Monday. ''We reiterate our call ... that the hostages be
released immediately and unconditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic torch relay had been scheduled to go through Fiji on
Saturday on its way to the Sydney games in September. Olympic
authorities in Australia announced Monday that the torch would
bypass the country.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Sentenced Over Affair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECHELT, British Columbia (AP) -- A female teacher who had an
affair with a 17-year-old student and now lives with him received a
10-month conditional jail sentence Monday for sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Ingram, 30, could have been sentenced to up to five
years in prison. Her lawyer said the conditional sentence limited
Ingram's movements without confining her to home.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, who has quit teaching, pleaded guilty in April to having
sex with an underaged student. Under Canadian law, the student, now
18, cannot be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The student testified he pursued the relationship and that
Ingram never exploited him. Under the Canadian criminal code, the
sexual relationship amounted to exploitation because Ingram held a
position of authority over the student.
</P>
<P>
   The student's mother, in a statement to the court last month,
said Ingram had been a positive influence on her son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heather is not a criminal and (my son) is not a victim,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Out; Knicks Win Again  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell didn't play particularly well,
Marcus Camby didn't play much and Patrick Ewing didn't play at all.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Ravaged by injuries, New York broke out to a big lead and held
on down the stretch for a 91-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers on
Monday in Game 4 to even an Eastern Conference finals the Knicks
once trailed 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''By no means, even if they are shorthanded, is anything going
to come easy. They wouldn't have come this far,'' Indiana's Reggie
Miller said of the Knicks. ''This is the team that went on to the
NBA Finals, that knocked us out last year. And they were
shorthanded then, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing sat out Game 3 on Saturday with tendinitis in his right
foot, an injury he sustained early in Game 2; Camby sprained his
right knee in the second quarter Saturday, didn't return, and was
wheeled out of Madison Square Garden; and Sprewell broke a bone
near the little toe on his left foot in the fourth quarter of Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell started Monday's game and played 44 minutes, but
managed just 12 points, 20 fewer than he had in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something that was in the back of my mind,'' Sprewell
said of his injury. ''It's not so bad that I can't be effective. I
just told myself to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby came in late in the first quarter and provided the
occasional athletic play, but was not much of a consistent
contributor. He wound up with five points, eight rebounds and three
blocks in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was cleared to play by team doctor Norman Scott, and went
on the court Monday for pregame layup drills. But after attempting
a few shots, Ewing -- the team's top rebounder and third-leading
scorer in the postseason -- headed back to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   His foot ''feels a lot better today than it did yesterday. If it
feels good on Wednesday I'll play,'' Ewing said referring to Game 5
in Indianapolis. ''I've improved a lot but not enough for me to be
able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are 5-1 against the Pacers over the last two
postseasons without Ewing and 1-3 with him. Ewing's 1999 season
ended in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, also against
Indiana, when his left Achilles' tendon gave out. New York won
three of the next four games to win the series 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the percentage with or without him. I hope he comes
back,'' said Indiana center Rik Smits, who had 13 points and one
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   New York coach Jeff Van Gundy discounted the theory that his
team is better off without its veteran center, saying the won-loss
records with and without Ewing ''gets manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley made his second straight start in Ewing's place
Monday, but was in for just eight minutes because of foul trouble.
That gave the bulk of the minutes in the middle to Kurt Thomas, who
scored a career playoff-high 16 points, and added six rebounds and
four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson (25 points and seven rebounds despite a stiff
back), Allan Houston (17 points, six rebounds) and Charlie Ward (16
points, seven assists, six rebounds) joined Thomas in making up for
the injury-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter who played, who played was not nearly as important
as how we played and what we had to do was be consistent regardless
of who was able to play and I thought our guys did that,'' Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell's injury, which he said came when he dived for a
ball in the final minute of Saturday's game, is exacerbated, he
could need surgery, according to Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was presented to him,'' Scott said. ''It's extremely
unlikely, but he's aware of it.''

   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Suriname's newly elected government
will replace the Central Bank Henk Goedschalk and other top

<P>
   ''We hope he steps down, or we will have to dismiss him,'' Fred

   The coalition blames the Central Bank for soaring inflation and

   Derby promised a broad investigation into government contracts
including the bridge construction, which was funded partly with
redirected earnings from bauxite sales.

<HEADLINE> Turner's Death Shocks NFL, UCLA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The death of Oakland Raiders defensive back
Eric Turner, who had denied he was seriously ill, was met with
shock on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric was certainly one of the top players we had during my 21
years at UCLA,'' Bruins defensive coordinator Bob Field said.
''This is a tragic loss for anyone who knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 31, died Sunday at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks.
The cause of death appeared to be complications of abdominal
cancer, according to Craig Stevens, medical examiner at the Ventura
County Coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have lost a respected warrior on the field and a great
teammate and father off the field,'' the Raiders organization said
in a statement. ''The Raiders will miss Eric's special qualities.
Unfortunately millions of people will not be exposed to the
greatness of Eric Turner's winning personality and talents in the
decades to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders coach Jon Gruden said Turner was ''a great guy who will
be sorely missed by a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to miss this guy terribly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Donahue was the head coach at UCLA when Turner earned
All-America honors in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric was a good guy, a really nice person, a marvelous player,
as good a Bruin football player as there ever was,'' Donahue,
director of personnel for the San Francisco 49ers, told the Los
Angeles Times on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him when we played Oakland in the preseason,''
Donahue said. ''I sent him a letter a couple of weeks ago, but I
don't know if he ever got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in May, reports surfaced that Turner had stomach cancer
and lost 70 pounds from his playing weight of 215.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders officials initially refused to comment on his health.
Turner had missed the club's mini-camp in April.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Turner released a statement through his agents
stating that reports he was seriously ill were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize people are concerned, but I have chosen to keep this
issue within my family,'' Turner said. ''Contrary to published
reports, I have not lost 70 pounds and am not gravely ill.''

   Turner's health worsened Sunday. A recorded hospital statement
said he had difficulty breathing and was taken to the facility by
ambulance at 10:30 a.m. Sunday. He was admitted to the intensive
care unit, where he died at 4:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Originally drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the second
overall pick in the 1991 amateur draft, Turner signed with the
Raiders in 1997 after making his second Pro Bowl in 1996 with the
Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Turner led the Raiders with 111 tackles in 1997, but was limited
to six games in 1998 and 10 games last season due to injuries.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Readies for Return  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The bulky brace spanning Larry Walker's right arm
was the only indication that the two-time defending NL batting
champion remains an observer when game time arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who has been sidelined with an elbow injury since May
11, had an encouraging batting practice session Monday, hitting two
balls into the bullpen beyond right field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he felt fine swinging,'' Rockies trainer Tom Probst
said. ''He felt comfortable and pain-free.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado right fielder also played catch for the third
straight day, but his return remains uncertain as the Rockies take
a cautious approach to his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would all be speculation because it could turn a heck of
a lot better than it is right now. It could turn a heck of a lot
worse,'' Probst said. ''To put a date on it, that's just not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Walker's absence, the Rockies have flourished without
the six-time Gold Glove winner, going 11-4. Todd Helton has been a
big reason for the success. He leads the majors with a .417 average
with 17 homers and 49 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're showing what kind of team we are,'' reliever Gabe White
said. ''What if you throw Walker in there, hitting .350 or .400
maybe with a healthy arm? We've got a good team and we never give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's success has helped manager Buddy Bell succumb to the
temptation of rushing Walker's return. He considered allowing
Walker to be the designated hitter when the Rockies play a
three-game interleague series at Seattle on June 5-7, but the risk
outweighs the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Walker's lively 20-swing hitting session, Bell
tempered his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's positive, but I'm not really paying much attention to
it right now,'' he said. ''I can't let myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Walker's injury, the Rockies were temporarily
without starting left fielder Jeffrey Hammonds, who strained his
left hip flexor Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds sat out Sunday's series finale against Pittsburgh but
returned Monday against Houston. He had an RBI single as a
pinch-hitter in the sixth and remained in the game for the final
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was fine,'' Bell said. ''I thought another day
would make sense. Unfortunately we couldn't give him a whole day,
but he should be all right.''

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain transferred governing authority
back to Northern Ireland at midnight Monday, offering new hope for peace to the
divided province. ''We hope these institutions will take root,'' Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble said at Stormont, the government's Belfast

   BEDFORD, Va. (AP) -- As thousands gathered, a granite arch and statues were
unveiled and 13 flags raised today at the National D-Day Memorial, placed in
this town because it lost two-thirds of its soldiers in the June 1944 invasion.
''I think there are a few days in our history that should never be forgotten,''
Jeannie Schulz told about 4,000 people who endured chilly, intermittent rain to
witness the unveiling. The $12 million memorial honors the 6,603 Americans
killed along the coast of France in the D-Day invasion of Nazi-held Europe
during World War II.

Elizabeth, Pa., Gore, citing his duty as an Army journalist in Vietnam, said:
''I know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes that we
honor on this day.'' At Fort Hood, Texas, Bush, who served in the Air National

privileged to be in the company of heroes. Thank you for serving our country.
You make us all proud to be Americans.''

martial law to bring stability to the nation that has been in crisis since
rebels took the government hostage on May 19. The army leader, Commodore Frank
Bainimarama, said that President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who has been running
the country since the coup began, had resigned. Repeated phone calls to the

Iran Reform Journalist Jailed

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian court ordered a reformist journalist jailed
on Monday, his wife said, the latest sign of a crackdown on pro-reform media and
writers. Emadeddin Baqi was taken to Evin prison after being tried in a press
court with no jury, said his wife, Fatemeh Kamali. Baqi was tried in connection
with articles he wrote last year in the now-banned Neshat daily that questioned
aspects of Islamic law. He also has accused senior hard-line officials of
involvement in the 1998 murders of five dissidents.

Microsoft Moves To Challenge Palm

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. may be King of the Hill in basic software
for personal computers, but in the realm of handheld computing a competitor has
a near monopoly. Four out of every five personal digital assistants, or PDAs,
sold the past few years have come from Palm Inc. To take on Palm, which has its
own operating system for handhelds, Microsoft launched last month a revamped
operating system called Pocket PC. Microsoft insists the Pocket PC can do so
much more than the Palm, which is focused on simple phone book and calendar

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The death of Oakland Raiders defensive back Eric Turner,
who had denied he was seriously ill, was met with shock today. Turner, 31, died
yesterday at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks. The cause of death appeared
to be complications of abdominal cancer, according to Craig Stevens, medical
examiner at the Ventura County Coroner's office. Early in May, reports surfaced
that Turner had stomach cancer and lost 70 pounds from his playing weight of
215. Two weeks ago, Turner released a statement through his agents stating that
reports he was seriously ill were unfounded.

<HEADLINE> Thomas an Unlikely Hero for Knicks  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nicked-up Knicks are 2-0 against the Pacers
with Patrick Ewing out and not a lot from Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Thomas, one of the team's least likely heroes, is a big
reason why.
</P>
<P>
   New York was in dire need of an inside presence against a much
larger Indiana team in Monday's Game 4 of the Eastern Conference
finals. Thomas came through with a playoff career-high 16 points,
plus five rebounds and three assists as the Knicks won 91-89 to
even the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kurt did a good job giving us some additional points that we
needed today, and he got on the boards,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was part of a whole fleet of Knicks who stepped into the
void left by injuries to Ewing, Camby and Latrell Sprewell, who
played with a broken bone in his foot and scored only 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson led the team with 25 points, while Charlie Ward
had a second straight strong game, with 16 points, seven assists
and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team just shows tremendous heart and ability to step up
and make big plays,'' Thomas said. ''When Jeff calls our number
we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has wondered aloud why he doesn't get to play more
minutes, and circumstance finally gave him a chance. He played 35
minutes Monday, 21 above his average during this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready every game. I prepare to play 30 minutes,'' Thomas
said. ''If I play six, I just have to keep my head up and keep
playing. ... I know I can play on this level. I know I can score. I
know I can play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he's seen a different Thomas this series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he went through a period of adjustment when he wasn't
playing as much,'' the coach said. ''I thought going into Game 7
(of the second round against Miami), he came in with a better
mental approach to that game and it has carried on forward from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   New York lost the first two games in Indianapolis and things
looked bleak when Ewing went out early in Game 2 with tendinitis in
his right foot, the injury that kept him out of Games 3 and 4.
Camby sprained his knee in the second quarter of Game 3, didn't
return to that contest, and had just five points while playing 18
minutes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With Chris Dudley a complete non-factor -- he started at Ewing's
center slot and finished the day with five fouls and no points --
Thomas had to be the answer in Game 4 and he did not disappoint at
either end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Thomas gives away seven inches to Pacers center Rik
Smits, but he compensated with muscle mass and slick footwork.
Thomas helped hold Smits to 13 points and one measly rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''He defended Smits as well as you can at 6-8,'' Van Gundy said,
stealing an inch from Thomas' listed height.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Thomas looked nothing like a player who was
averaging 3.4 points and 2.9 rebounds through the first 13 playoff
games. He scored with jumpers and inside moves, looking as
comfortable fitting into a suddenly flowing offense as he normally
looks uncomfortable on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' biggest contribution, though, might have been one of his
missed shots, which came with 6:28 left in the game and Indiana --
which trailed by 17 points at halftime -- suddenly within a point
after Reggie Miller's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Camby snuck inside to grab the rebound and kicked a pass out to
Johnson, who buried one of his five 3-pointers to make the score
80-76, and Indiana never got closer than that again.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas ran down the court, hopping like a little kid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just a little excited, a little pumped up,'' he said.
''I was just really enjoying being out there on the floor.''

<HEADLINE> Ewing Out Again; Knicks Win Again  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell didn't play particularly well,
Marcus Camby didn't play much and Patrick Ewing didn't play at all.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Ravaged by injuries, New York broke out to a big lead and held
on down the stretch for a 91-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers on
Monday in Game 4 to even an Eastern Conference finals the Knicks
once trailed 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''By no means, even if they are shorthanded, is anything going
to come easy. They wouldn't have come this far,'' Indiana's Reggie
Miller said of the Knicks. ''This is the team that went on to the
NBA Finals, that knocked us out last year. And they were
shorthanded then, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing sat out Game 3 on Saturday with tendinitis in his right
foot, an injury he sustained early in Game 2; Camby sprained his
right knee in the second quarter Saturday, didn't return, and was
wheeled out of Madison Square Garden; and Sprewell broke a bone
near the little toe on his left foot in the fourth quarter of Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell started Monday's game and played 44 minutes, but
managed just 12 points, 20 fewer than he had in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something that was in the back of my mind,'' Sprewell
said of his injury. ''It's not so bad that I can't be effective. I
just told myself to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby came in late in the first quarter and provided the
occasional athletic play, but was not much of a consistent
contributor. He wound up with five points, nine rebounds and three
blocks in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was cleared to play by team doctor Norman Scott, and went
on the court Monday for pregame layup drills. But after attempting
a few shots, Ewing -- the team's top rebounder and third-leading
scorer in the postseason -- headed back to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   His foot ''feels a lot better today than it did yesterday. If it
feels good on Wednesday I'll play,'' Ewing said referring to Game 5
in Indianapolis. ''I've improved a lot but not enough for me to be
able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are 5-1 against the Pacers over the last two
postseasons without Ewing and 1-3 with him. Ewing's 1999 season
ended in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, also against
Indiana, when his left Achilles' tendon gave out. New York won
three of the next four games to win the series 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the percentage with or without him. I hope he comes
back,'' said Indiana center Rik Smits, who had 13 points and one
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   New York coach Jeff Van Gundy discounted the theory that his
team is better off without its veteran center, saying the won-loss
records with and without Ewing ''gets manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley made his second straight start in Ewing's place
Monday, but was in for just eight minutes because of foul trouble.
That gave the bulk of the minutes in the middle to Kurt Thomas, who
scored a career playoff-high 16 points, and added five rebounds and
three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson (25 points and seven rebounds despite a stiff
back), Allan Houston (17 points, six rebounds) and Charlie Ward (16
points, seven assists, six rebounds) joined Thomas in making up for
the injury-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter who played, who played was not nearly as important
as how we played and what we had to do was be consistent regardless
of who was able to play and I thought our guys did that,'' Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell's injury, which he said came when he dived for a
ball in the final minute of Saturday's game, is exacerbated, he
could need surgery, according to Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was presented to him,'' Scott said. ''It's extremely
unlikely, but he's aware of it.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 10, Marlins 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kevin Young and John Vander Wal each drove in
three runs as the slumping Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Florida
Marlins 10-4 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had lost nine of 12 games and just returned from a
1-5 trip to Arizona and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schmidt (2-4) pitched 6 2-3 innings, allowing 10 hits and
four runs. He left after allowing an RBI double by Mark Kotsay and
Preston Wilson's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored four runs in the first against Vladimir Nunez
(0-5) and added four more in the sixth against Dan Miceli.
</P>
<P>
   Young's three-run double came in the sixth and Vander Wal
followed with a single for his third RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal singled with the bases loaded in the first inning and
scored on Pat Meares' double as the Pirates sent nine hitters to
the plate. Nunez walked leadoff hitter Warren Morris and gave up
singles to Wil Cordero and Brian Giles to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez gave up single runs in the fourth and fifth. Jason Kendall
hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth and Meares had an RBI single in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bako had the last of three Marlins singles in the fourth.
Schmidt gave up a leadoff double to Kotsay in the fifth and Cliff
Floyd singled. Schmidt pitched out of the jam by getting Preston
Wilson to ground into a double play.
Notes: Florida's Luis Castillo was 2-for-4, stretching his hitting
streak to nine games, a club best for the season. Castillo has
reached base in 18 consecutive games. ... Nunez is 3-12 in his
career as a starter. In 11 starts this year, he has allowed at
least five earned runs in six games. ... The Pirates played their
first game on a Monday. They were rained out on April 3 and May 1.
The other six Mondays were open dates. ... Morris broke an 0-for-10
slump with two doubles in four at-bats.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Junior Agogo scored both goals for Colorado on
Monday and the Rapids beat the New England Revolution 2-1 to snap a
three-game losing streak at home.
</P>
<P>
   Agogo, who leads the team with six goals and 16 points, scored
in the 38th and 80th minutes to give the Rapids (6-7-0) a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Keegan scored in the 90th minute for New England (5-4-4),
which lost both games against Colorado this season.
</P>
<P>
   Agogo's first goal capped a three-pass play that was started in
the Colorado end by Paul Dougherty.
</P>
<P>
   Agogo's second goal came after he was pulled down at the left
side of the 6-yard box by New England defender Rusty Pierce. Goalie
Jeff Causey made the save on the penalty kick but Agogo converted
the rebound for the 2-0 lead. It was third save in as many penalty
kicks for Causey.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado played without defender Marcelo Balboa, who injured his
hamstring last Saturday against Miami, and midfielder Jason Bent,
who was with the Canadian national team.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shawn Green hit his second grand slam in
eight games, and Chan Ho Park allowed two hits in seven innings as
the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Mets 4-1 Monday, handing
Al Leiter his first loss of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The only hits off Park (5-4) were a leadoff single by Kurt
Abbott in the fifth inning and pinch-hitter Nunnally's two-out
single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Park struck out six, but he also walked six. He threw 115
pitches and was removed for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (5-1) gave up four runs and six hits in six innings,
hitting two batters in his final inning. The Mets had won all nine
of Leiter's previous starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino led off the sixth with a single and Park
sacrificed him to second. Leiter then hit F.P. Santangelo in the
hip, and Mark Grudzielanek in the left elbow, loading the bases for
Green, who drove Leiter's next pitch to him into the right-field
pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam was the fourth of Green's career and the team's
seventh of the year, the most for the Dodgers since 1952, when the
team was in Brooklyn and hit eight. Green, who has 10 homers, hit
his first slam of the year May 21 against Florida's Antonio
Alfonseca.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was taken out of the game in the eighth because his
elbow was bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez fractured his left forearm when when
he tagged out the Dodgers' F.P. Santangelo sliding into second in
the first inning and will be sidelined for six weeks, New York
general manager Steve Phillips said. Ordonez, a three-time Gold
Glove, was replaced by Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza made a fine defensive play in the
fifth. The former Dodger leaped high to snare a relay throw,
blocked home and tagged out his former roommate, Eric Karros, to
keep the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Karros was attempting to score from first on Chad Kreuter's
double into the gap in left-center. Center fielder Joe McEwing
chased the ball to the fence, whirled and threw to shortstop Kurt
Abbott. Abbott's throw home was high, but Piazza was able to grab
it, make the tag and keep the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing hit at RBI double in the ninth off Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sandy Koufax, the Dodgers' Hall of Fame left-hander,
visited the Mets' clubhouse before the game. ... Phillips said that
RF Melvin Mora probably would be activated Tuesday to fill
Ordonez's roster spot. Mora, who has played seven rehab games in
the minors, was eligible to come off the DL Sunday. ... INF Adam
Melhuse was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque by the Dodgers after
3B Adrian Beltre went on the 15-day disabled list. Beltre, batting
.269 with five homers and 31 RBIs in 44 games, strained his right
hamstring Saturday running out a grounder against Philadelphia.
Pitcher Jeff Williams was transferred from the 15-day DL to the
60-day DL to make room for Melhuse on the 40-man roster.

<HEADLINE> US WWII GI Returns Flag to Japanese  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A flag that a Japanese soldier took with him to
fight World War II is being returned to his family more than a half
century after he was killed in one of the bloodiest battles of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The flag comes as a gift from the step-grandson of an American
soldier who died four years ago without ever explaining how he came
into possession of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just thought if my dad was killed, I would want it (the
flag) back,'' said Joseph Seredick, the step-grandson of Edward
Schuett, a former U.S. Marine corporal.
</P>
<P>
   Seredick, 35, spent eight months searching for the owner of the
flag, which was given to him last year by his aunt. With the help
of the Japanese Embassy in Washington, Seredick located the
brother-in-law of Yoshiaki Kondo, the soldier killed in the Battle
of Saipan in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Seredick, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Cary,
forwarded the flag to the Japanese Embassy for delivery to Kondo's
family. The flag will be given to the Japanese family after an
enclosed letter is translated into Japanese from English, which
could take a few days, Japanese Foreign Ministry official Hideya
Hoshi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As with many returning soldiers, Schuett was reluctant to
discuss his experiences. He said he was a radio operator during the
battle in 1944, but added few details, including whether he was the
one who had killed the Japanese soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of World War II veterans saw some pretty horrific
things,'' Seredick said. ''When they came home, they wanted to put
the war behind them, raise their families, send them to school --
and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Seredick, Schuett's stepson, first saw the flag as a
teen-ager when Schuett took it out of its box -- one of the handful
of times he ever did so -- and explained its significance. Schuett
pointed to brown smears and told the boy they were the blood of a
dead soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soldiers traditionally kept the flags folded inside
their uniform pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On the side of the flag was written, ''Wishing you ever-lasting
good luck in war.'' It is signed by nearly 60 family members and
friends from the soldier's neighborhood outside Nagoya, a large
city in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When Seredick mailed the flag, he enclosed a letter to Kondo's
family, saying he hoped ''that this small gesture will help honor
Kondo-san's memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Taichi Ono, an official with the Japanese Embassy in Washington,
told the Chicago Tribune he receives word of swords, flags and
other artifacts that Americans are hoping to return perhaps every
other week.
</P>
<P>
   If relatives in Japan can be located, the item is sent on. But,
Ono said, ''Not so often do we find the families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kondo relatives sent word they did not want to comment on
the flag, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Dry Conditions Blamed For Fla. Fires  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MARK
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hampered by dry conditions and heat Monday, firefighters across
Florida battled a rash of brush fires, some of which forced the
evacuation of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the fires are under control, but they're breaking out
daily,'' said Matt Weinell, spokesman for the Forest Protection
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 46 fires that broke out Sunday, several fires
thought to have been extinguished have rekindled, Weinell said.
Those fires have already burned hundreds of acres on Florida's west
coast and continue to be a threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In north and central Florida, brush fires consumed at least six
structures in Osteen in Volusia County. Fires also raged in
Osceola, Orange and Brevard counties.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious fires were near Osteen and near Bay Lake
Estates in Osceola County, where residents were evacuated as flames
threatened dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but one fire truck was scorched, Weinell said.
About 300 acres burned, destroying a garage and two sheds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Piney Woods subdivision, just north of the St. John's
River, about 50 acres burned and evacuations were mandatory early
Sunday evening -- though many people were allowed to return home
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials believe juveniles started the blaze, which
destroyed four cars, two mobile homes, a shed and a barn. No
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, fire crews were trying to control a blaze near the
coastal community of Palm Bay, which burned a 50 acres Monday
afternoon after a hotspot flared.
</P>
<P>
   The fire previously consumed about 700 acres last week, said
Mark Francesconi, a district chief with Brevard County Fire Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A fire that has been raging in Sarasota County since a lightning
bolt struck a tree last week has scorched more than 6,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires in Florida have become so severe that the federal
government will help pay for protection. Once local and state
governments spend $1.5 million to fight fires, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency will pay 70 percent of the rest of the
costs, it was announced Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit a Changed Europe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Profound changes have swept Europe since
Bill Clinton took office eight years ago, and European analysts
give the U.S. president, on perhaps his last visit here, much of
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Key elements of the new Europe include an expanded NATO alliance
and a European Union committed to accepting new members from among
its former adversaries. Throughout Europe, leaders are engaged in a
wide-ranging debate about the continent's economic, political and
social future.
</P>
<P>
   Nations which once rejected the American economic model outright
are now struggling to find ways to adapt it without sacrificing
their own traditions and identity.
</P>
<P>
   Without disregarding the role of European leaders themselves,
European analysts acknowledge that much of the impetus for these
changes has come from Washington during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   In an expression of gratitude, Clinton will be awarded the
prestigious International Charlemagne Prize during a ceremony
Friday in Aachen, Germany. The award is presented annually to a
person who has worked toward European unity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Washington Monday night for the weeklong European
tour. He will also attend a summit of EU leaders in Portugal before
traveling on to Germany. He will journey on to Russia for weekend
talks with the new president, Vladimir Putin, and then travel June
5 to the Ukraine for a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma before
departing for Washington that night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's contribution, analysts believe, was not in promoting a
new vision for Europe. Instead, he built on the legacy of others --
President George Bush, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, French
President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl --
at a time when many Europeans expected America to withdraw from the
continent after the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration stepped in after the Europeans
themselves stumbled in the critical years after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The key event was the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which
broke out in the twilight of the Bush administration. Elected on a
domestic platform, Clinton -- like his predecessor Bush -- considered
the Balkans a European problem without any vital U.S. interest at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   As the bloodshed worsened and with the Europeans unable to
resolve their own policy differences, Washington became more and
more involved, finally orchestrating the 1995 peace settlement for
Bosnia in Dayton, Ohio, and the intervention in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics acknowledge that nothing moved without America.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be seen as the one who waited too long to do anything
about Yugoslavia,'' Per Egil Hegge, foreign affairs commentator of
the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, said of Clinton. ''Not that
the Europeans were better. But they are used to looking to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO expansion resulted in a new European security system and an
affirmation of Washington's commitment to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as Europe is concerned, what will remain of Clinton
first and foremost is NATO enlargement,'' said Dominique Moisi of
the French Institute for International Relations. ''It was a symbol
of the fact that, contrary to what everybody was expecting after
the end of the Cold War, there was more of America in Europe, not
less.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a fact which is always appreciated in a continent of
stately capitals which considers itself the world's leader in
culture and sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ''More 'America in Europe' also means more resentment by the
allies,'' Moisi said. ''I think psychologically it creates a big
trauma in Europe,'' where governments resent a perceived role as
Washington's junior partners.
</P>
<P>
   However, for all the carping about American hegemony, the
greatest fear in foreign ministries from Dublin to Sofia is that
America's role in Europe may diminish after Clinton is gone because
Congress and the American public remain wary of international
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It is often difficult to appreciate the changes in Europe since
an obscure Arkansas governor, Clinton, was just another Democratic
presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a decade ago, Europe was divided into hostile
Cold War camps. In the East, a Communist system was tottering on
the verge of collapse. In the West, entrenched political interests
defended their state-influenced economic systems, resisting any
hint of change.
</P>
<P>
   Spearheaded by American pressure, the NATO alliance now includes
former Soviet allies Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Virtually every other former Moscow ally -- including Latvia and
Lithuania which were republics of the Soviet Union -- is clamoring
to join.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the former communists in Bulgaria, once
considered Moscow's most loyal Eastern European ally, announced
their support for NATO membership, a move analysts said was
necessary for the party to survive politically.
</P>
<P>
   ''During his two terms, he launched and fulfilled the ideas of
NATO,'' Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said of Clinton.
''This was extremely important for central and eastern Europe, a
region where two world wars began.''
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. encouragement, the European Union agreed to accept
former Communist countries into eventual EU membership. Although
the process is likely to take years to complete, some European
analysts doubt the EU would have moved as quickly as it did, if at
all, without Washington's urging.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the European Union is talking about integration, if
not for the leading role of the United States, nothing much would
have happened,'' said Rudolf Janssens, who lectures on U.S. policy
at the Dutch naval college. ''This is also a statement about the
sad state of affairs in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's transformation is incomplete and may in the end produce
a continent different from what American policy-makers would have
wanted. Talk of a European defense force independent of NATO
accelerated after the Kosovo air campaign and has raised concern in
Washington, despite assurances from British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and others that this would not diminish the alliance's
premier defense role.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's interest in unilateral defense will likely increase,
however, if the United States goes ahead with plans for a missile
defense system, which Russia warns will trigger a new arms race.
The controversial proposal is due to figure prominently in talks in
Moscow during Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 3, Diamondbacks 0  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Garrett Stephenson is quickly becoming the St.
Louis Cardinals' ace.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his first complete game in two years, Stephenson
pitched his first career shutout, a six-hitter Monday that led the
Cardinals over the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you throw a shutout, it's got to be a pretty good game, but
I don't know what my best game is,'' Stephenson said. ''Early in
the season, it was just one or two pitches that were making me give
up a couple runs, and right now those couple of pitches are staying
in the park and being caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who struck out eight and walked none, joined Bob
Gibson as the only Cardinals' starting pitchers to begin the
regular season with eight straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was 8-0 in 1965, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Cardinals pitchers have opened the season with more
consecutive wins: reliever Frank DiPino went 9-0 in 1989 and Howie
Krist, who started and relieved, finished 10-0 in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's classic pitching,'' manager Tony La Russa said. ''You
move the fastball around, throw the breaking ball and add a
changeup -- three pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis stopped a three-game losing streak, which matched its
longest of the season. Arizona lost its second straight home game
after 11 straight wins at Bank One Ballpark, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre (8-3), who left because of discomfort in his
right elbow, allowed one run and two hits in 5 1-3 innings, struck
out four and walked three. Stottlemyre bypassed surgery after
tearing his right rotator cuff in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. David Zeman said he would be evaluated after
an MRI on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something I've been fighting pretty much the whole
year,'' said Stottlemyre, who argued with manager Buck Showalter to
stay in. ''Today, it was a little more irritating, a little more
discomfort. My velocity was good, my stuff was as good today as
it's probably been all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina and Edgar Renteria, the top of the order, provided
the runs Stephenson needed. Renteria had an RBI single in the third
inning, and Vina hit a two-run single in the seventh after Russ
Springer loaded the bases by walking Ray Lankford, J.D. Drew and
Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good at the time,'' Vina said. ''I mean, we're up 1-0,
and that's the time for us to get a few more runs. When you're
playing the Diamondbacks, they're such a good team, you can't be
happy with just one run.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who lowered his ERA to 3.82 with the fourth complete
game of his career, did allow a double and two singles to Tony
Womack, who extended his hitting streak to 24 games, the longest in
the major leagues this season. Luis Gonzalez also had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had some pitches up for me, which was a rare thing,''
Womack said. ''He kept his pitches down for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire was 1-for-3 and has not homered in 22 plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Stephenson beat Florida 5-1 with a five-hitter on May 24,
his first complete game since Sept. 24, 1997, against Atlanta. ...
Gonzalez robbed Lankford of a homer in the eighth inning with
McGwire on first. Gonzalez jumped to the left-field fence, and hung
on the wall with his right arm to make the catch. ... Lankford
walked twice, moving ahead of Rogers Hornsby for sixth on St.
Louis' career list with 661. ... Stottlemyre was with St. Louis
from 1996-98 and was the last Cardinal to throw back-to-back
complete games -- on May 16 and 21, 1998. His first start against
the Cardinals gave him one against every major league club,
including the Diamondbacks. ... St. Louis LHP Jesse Orosco, coming
off an injured left elbow, will jojn Peoria of the Class-A Midwest
League on Tuesday for a rehabilitation assignment.

<HEADLINE> Report: 44 Die in Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Suspected Muslim militants attacked a
Christian village in the Indonesian province of North Maluku,
killing 44 people, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maluku military commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela said raid came
before dawn on Monday and also left dozens injured, according to
the Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
   Tamaela said he suspected the attackers came from a neighboring
island. North Maluku, 1,600 miles northeast of Jakarta, and Maluku
provinces were known as the Spice Islands during the Dutch colonial
era. The region has been plagued by sectarian violence for more
than a year that has left at least 2,500 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack was similar to a predawn raid last week in the
same area which left 34 civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jakarta Post quoted a local priest, Rev. Biso, as saying
that many of the victims were killed while they slept. The
attackers reportedly used guns and homemade bombs in the raid.

<HEADLINE> Aristide Party Wins Senate Control  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party has won control of Haiti's Senate, according to
partial returns from last week's election, released for the first
time Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the May 21 vote -- which was delayed at least four
times -- suggested strong support for the controversial former
priest, who is expected to run for president again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot was widely seen as a last chance for democracy in the
impoverished, unstable Caribbean nation of 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The first results, released Monday by Electoral Council
spokesman Jean-Gardy Lorcy, showed the Lavalas Family Party winning
14 of the 27 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other five seats that were up this election, one was won
by independent Luc Fleurinor, two had not been counted as of Monday
night and voting was rescheduled in two because of technical
problems. The eight seats that were not up for re-election are held
by representatives from non-Lavalas parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas also won 16 of the 83 seats that were up for election in
the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. In another
31 races for the lower house, no candidate won an absolute
majority, and a runoff was scheduled for June 25. In most of those
districts the Lavalas candidate was leading.
</P>
<P>
   The results of several thousand local government positions were
not announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no totalitarian intention,'' said Yvon Neptune,
Lavalas Family spokesman. ''The Haitian people want to get out of
the rut of crisis, and we want to implement a project that will
change society. We want peace and security, so we can concentrate
on the big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although voting was peaceful, the results seem likely to only
deepen divisions here.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Pierre-Charles, the leader of the Struggling People's
Organization, the majority party until January 1999, denounced the
results as ''the implementation of a totalitarian plan to take over
every institution of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents claim fear that Lavalas widely intimidated opposition
candidates in the months before the vote, rendering it unfair. They
say they will not accept the results and will boycott any runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people were slain in political killings in the two
months leading up to the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, dissolved
Parliament in January 1999 and appointed a new premier two months
later. Most opposition parties accuse Preval and Aristide of
collaborating to establish a totalitarian state.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was elected in 1990 but overthrown in a 1991
army-backed coup. U.S. troops restored him to power in 1994, but
Haitian law barred him from seeking a consecutive term in 1995
elections. Since the invasion, the international community has
poured more than a billion dollars into this Caribbean nation, one
of the world's least developed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million Haitian voters -- an estimated 60 percent of
the electorate -- cast their ballots in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were numerous alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Many election stations were staffed exclusively by Aristide
partisans, opposition parties complained. They charged that their
pollwatchers were expelled from the stations because the electoral
council had only validated the identity cards of Aristide poll
workers.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, ballot boxes were piled up at the central
election office and ballots spilled out in the street, making a
recount impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, both the National Council of Election
Observers and the Organization of American States Election
Observation team said the elections were acceptable.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Chief's Kin Shot Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The granddaughter of Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks was shot to death as she drove away from a fast-food
restaurant in the city's South Central area, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker apparently was aiming for a male passenger, who
escaped injury in the Sunday night shooting, Lt. Horace Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Gonzalez, 20, was shot several times by the gunman, who
walked up and opened fire on the car in the driveway of a Popeye's
chicken stand, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger, also 20, ducked and was not injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Area resident Bruce Smith said safety concerns keep him away
from restaurants in the neighborhood late at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gang problems, drug problems -- we have in this part of town. I
wouldn't consider it 100 percent safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and his family were ''grieving in seclusion,'' according
to a police statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is the daughter of one of Parks' three daughters,
Felicia, Officer Jason Lee said. Parks also has a son.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's death isn't the first time Parks' family has made the
news. In 1998, Clark County, Nev., prosecutors dismissed drug
trafficking charges against one of Parks' daughters, Michelle
Lynette Parks.

<HEADLINE> US Sees Peru Election As Invalid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department on Monday rejected the
re-election of President Alberto Fujimori in Peru as invalid,
declaring that ''no president emerging from such a flawed process
can claim legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In view of the refusal of the government of Peru to
accommodate international observers' complaints regarding lack of
time to validate the newly installed vote counting system, we do
not see the election as being valid,'' the department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The manner in which the Fujimori regime handled this problem
is a serious threat to the inter-American system and its commitment
to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's election was boycotted by his challenger, who urged
thousands of his supporters gathered in the capital to peacefully
resist the election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   With just over half of the vote counted, Fujimori had 50.3
percent of the ballot to Alejandro Toledo's 16.2 percent, election
officials said late Sunday, adding that 32.4 percent of the ballots
had been defaced and 0.8 percent left blank. Final results were
expected Wednesday, at the earliest.

States. We're closer, and even a medium-range rocket can threaten us while it
can't at all threaten the United States,'' said Sergei Ivanov, secretary of the

Microsoft Targets Palm
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. may be King of the Hill in basic software
for personal computers, but in the realm of handheld computing a competitor has
a near monopoly. Four out of every five personal digital assistants, or PDAs,
sold the past few years have come from Palm Inc. To take on Palm, which has its
own operating system for handhelds, Microsoft launched last month a revamped
operating system called Pocket PC. Microsoft insists the Pocket PC can do so
much more than the Palm, which is focused on simple phone book and calendar
tasks.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ravaged by injuries, New York broke out to a big lead and
held on down the stretch for a 91-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday
in Game 4 to even an Eastern Conference finals the Knicks once trailed 2-0.
Patrick Ewing sat out Game 3 on Saturday with tendinitis in his right foot, an
injury he sustained early in Game 2; Marcus Camby sprained his right knee in the
second quarter Saturday, didn't return, and was wheeled out of Madison Square
Garden; and Latrell Sprewell broke a bone near the little toe on his left foot
in the fourth quarter of Game 3.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shawn Green hit his second grand slam in eight games, and
Chan Ho Park allowed two hits in seven innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat
the New York Mets 4-1 tonight, handing Al Leiter his first loss of the year. The

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Edgar Martinez drove in a pair of runs to
increase his major league-leading total to 57 and John Halama won
his sixth straight decision as the Seattle Mariners rallied past
the Chicago White Sox 5-4 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has hit in 14 consecutive games, went 2-for-2 with
a pair of singles and two walks. His two-run single in the four-run
fifth inning tied the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle went ahead 4-3 when Alex Rodriguez, whose infield single
had driven in the first run of the inning, scored from third on
Mike Sirotka's wild pitch to John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (6-0), who hasn't lost in nine starts since last
Oct. 3 against Oakland, allowed four runs -- three earned -- and six
hits in seven-plus innings. Last year as a rookie, Halama won nine
straight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaz Sasaki pitched the ninth for his seventh save in eight
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (3-5) allowed four runs -- all unearned -- four hits and
four walks in seven innings. While he has given up just eight runs
in his last four starts for a 2.73 ERA, he is only 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Halama retired his first 10 batters before Jose Valentin reached
on a throwing error by third baseman David Bell and advanced on
consecutive wild pitches. Frank Thomas walked, and Magglio Ordonez
followed with his 10th homer, a three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle center fielder Mike Cameron, acquired in the Ken Griffey
Jr. trade, saved a run in the fifth by leaping at the fence and
catching a drive by Herbert Perry that would have gone over.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's fielding error on Dan Wilson's grounder to third led to
the unearned runs in the fifth, with walks to Mark McLemore and
Cameron setting up the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner homered off Bill Simas in the sixth for a 5-3 lead.
Carlos Lee homered leading off the eighth, chasing Halama.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez is 10-for-17 with three homers against Sirotka.
... Seattle is 16-6 at home, the best home record in the majors.
... Paul Konerko played in his first game since fouling a ball off
his foot against New York on Thursday. ... Lee stopped a 1-for-18
slide with a double in his first at-bat. ... Sirotka tied his
season-high with six strikeouts. ... Chicago's AL-leading 49 errors
have led to a league-leading 35 unearned runs.

   NORWOOD, Mass. (AP) -- Police arrested a man Monday for allegedly
stealing a helicopter from Norwood Airport and flying it to a
farmer's field 35 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Santanastaso, 40, was arrested after police searched his
house in Lancaster, according to Norwood police officer Paul
Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Santanastaso returned to his home just as the officers
conducting the search were leaving, and he was arrested, Bishop
said.
</P>
<P>
   Santanastaso faces larceny and possibly other charges, Bishop
said.
</P>
<P>
   The $170,000 two-seat Robinson R22 helicopter was taken Sunday
morning from Norwood Airport and discovered later that day in a
field owned by 94-year-old Lancaster farmer Russell Bashaw,
Santonastaso's next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot had asked Bashaw if he could leave the helicopter in
the field, Lancaster Police Patrolman Douglas DeCesare said. Police
were alerted by another neighbor of the farmer who heard about the
missing chopper on the news, he said. The helicopter was covered
with blankets and duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   The thief radioed the tower at the Norwood airport Sunday
morning requesting permission to take off. Unsuspecting controllers
granted the request but soon lost contact with the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Bruce, president of the Northern Lights flight school,
which was leasing the helicopter, flew the aircraft back to the
airport Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said the male voice on the tape is not one of her students
but that she is not ruling out the possibility that one of her
students was an accomplice. Police checked the helicopter for
fingerprints Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had noticed Thursday that the ignition key to the
helicopter didn't work, and a headset was missing, Bruce said. It
appears that the real key was swapped with a dummy key, she said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Men Throw 'Acid Bombs' From Window  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- A section of a public park was evacuated
Monday because two men were throwing homemade acid bombs from their
third-story balcony, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at Ellis Lake Park called police after seeing a
two-liter bottle fall from the balcony and explode on the park
ground in a caustic mess of singed plastic and grass, said Police
Lt. Susan Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The men admitted to police they had been filling soft drink
bottles with aluminum strips and muriatic acid, a form of
hydrochloric acid used in swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a chemical reaction that explodes, and they were
lobbing them off the balcony and watching them explode,'' Jones
said. ''They said they had gotten the recipe off the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Braddy, 22, and Michael Vierow, 20, were arrested and
charged with several crimes including possessing caustic chemicals
and wrongfully possessing chemicals with the intent to destroy
property. Their bail was set at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Concord is about 30 miles east of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Ordonez Breaks Forearm  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New York's Rey Ordonez made a spectacular
play at second to tag out the Dodgers' F. P. Santangelo and as a
result will spend about six weeks on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Gold Glove shortstop broke a bone in his left
forearm on the play in the first inning of the Mets' 4-1 loss to
Los Angeles on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that the best shortstop in the league is going to
be out,'' said New York's Kurt Abbott, who replaced Ordonez. ''Even
though he's struggled offensively, defensively he's the best in the
league. He still solidifies the defense out there and he's a big
part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, picked off first base by pitcher Al Leiter, took off
for second. Ordonez lunged across the bag to grab the wide throw
from first baseman Todd Zeile and whirled around backward, facing
left field as he slapped a backhand tag on Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ''That play was unbelievable -- I mean, just to have the
instincts to be able to catch the ball over on the other side of
the bag and totally flip your body around and 180-degree it, and
'Bam.' It was impressive,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo's helmet hit Ordonez on the arm as he slid in head
first. The shortstop was down briefly, got up and played catch for
a moment to see if there was pain, then walked off the field,
slamming his glove on the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't really hear anything that would make me think he
broke his arm,'' New York third baseman Robin Ventura said. ''But
he did hit it clean, right on the helmet. It's just one of those
things he does all the time. That's his style -- that's just the way
he learned to play.''
</P>
<P>
   New York manger Bobby Valentine said Ordonez, whose only stint
on the DL was in 1997 with a broken bone in his left hand, didn't
want to come out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he had broken it when I went out there. He could
squeeze the ball and make a fist, but he tried to catch a ball and
he just couldn't lift up the glove,'' the Mets' manager said.
</P>
<P>
   New York will recall Melvin Mora, who has been on the DL since
May 13 with a cut on his right index finger, and has made seven
rehab appearances in the minors. Ordonez is batting just .188.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll make do,'' Valentine said. ''We have Kurt Abbott, Melvin
Mora and Joe McEwing play there. I'd like to have Rey back, but
we'll do the best we can without him. Maybe the won't hit any balls
to shortstop in the next six weeks.''

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook central Taiwan
on Tuesday, seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties.

   A 7.6-magnitude quake devastated the region in September,

Report: 44 Die in Indonesia Violence

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Suspected Muslim militants attacked a Christian
village in the Indonesian province of North Maluku, killing 44 people, a
newspaper reported Tuesday. Maluku military commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela
said raid came before dawn on Monday and left dozens injured, according to the
Jakarta Post. Tamaela said he suspected the attackers came from a neighboring
island. North Maluku, 1,600 miles northeast of Jakarta, and Maluku provinces
were known as the Spice Islands during the Dutch colonial era. The region has
been plagued by sectarian violence for more than a year that has left at least
2,500 people dead.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 8, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Marquis Grissom hit his first homer in 212
at-bats and drove in four runs as the Milwaukee Brewers beat San
Diego 8-3 Monday night, snapping the Padres' four-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes (6-3) gave up seven hits in 8 1-3 innings. He
struck out three and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom hadn't homered since Sept. 30 against Pittsburgh. He hit
a leadoff shot to center off Brian Meadows (4-4) in the second, and
the Brewers made it 5-0 after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom hit a two-run double in the seventh and an RBI single in
the ninth to finish 3-for-4 and walked once.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins had two hits, scored twice and drove in a run in
his first game back from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes had a hit before the Padres did, as he doubled with one
out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes held the Padres hitless until Al Martin homered leading
off the fourth inning. Tony Gwynn followed with a double and scored
on Ryan Klesko's one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who fractured his right middle finger on May 5 when he
lost control of his bat during a swing, was activated earlier in
the day. He provided Milwaukee's first two runs in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins hit an RBI double on the first pitch he saw from
Meadows, then moved around on two wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes hit an RBI single in the fifth and the Brewers got
another run when Jose Hernandez grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows lasted just 4 2-3 innings, giving up five runs -- four
earned -- on seven hits, with four strikeouts and four walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Davey Lopes, who was named Milwaukee's manager on Nov. 4,
was San Diego's first base coach for the last five years. ... To
make room on the roster for Jenkins, INF Kevin Barker was sent to
Triple-A Indianapolis. ... Adam Eaton, one of three pitchers
obtained from Philadelphia for Andy Ashby in November, is scheduled
to start Tuesday night, making his major league debut. He was 4-1
with a 2.68 ERA in 10 starts at Double-A Mobile. The Padres will
purchase his contract on Tuesday. Eaton was the clincher to the
deal, and it turns out that he will pitch for the Padres before the
other two pitchers obtained in that deal. RHPs Carlton Loewer
(broken left ankle) and Steve Montgomery (strained shoulder) have
been on the disabled list all season. ... The Padres committed
three errors, giving them 21 in 10 games.
