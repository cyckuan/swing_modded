<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Law on Donation   (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30 scholars and representatives from various
non-profit institutions and organizations across the country took
part in the symposium, and helped to draft the law.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the draft law will regulate actions
regarding voluntary donations of any citizen, legal person or
other organization to any legally-founded fund or charity
institution, or any non-profit organization for public welfare.
</P>
<P>
Donations aimed at profit-making and various kinds of free aid
will excluded from the law, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tuan, the CCF deputy secretary-general, said that with the
introduction of policy of reform and opening to the outside world,
China is receiving an abundance of donations.
</P>
<P>
A CCF report shows that donations from overseas Chinese from
1979 to 1995 totals at least 30 billion yuan, and those from the
inland people are also rising, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the CCF, founded three years ago, now has a
membership of 59 local charity organizations, and the fund it has
collected over the past few years has topped 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts felt that donations for public welfare have played an
important role in promoting the development of China's education,
science and technology, culture, health, and sports, and in
helping the poor, the disabled and the people suffering from
disasters, and in improving environmental protection.

The children, all of whom suffered from cleft lip, were
successfully treated in Nanning, Baise, Hechi and Guilin.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministers to Take More Urgent Steps for Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government decided today
that it needs to take "more urgent measures in short term" to
increase public confidence in the economy and to stabilize the
Thai currency, according to a Government House press release
issued here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting today of economic ministers,
who heard reports on the economic situation of the country for the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ministers admitted that the Thai currency baht was still
weakening since its float on July 2.
</P>
<P>
It was noted at the meeting that on June 30, the day before the
float, the midrate fixed by the central bank was 25.79 baht to one
U.S. dollar, and on July 24 it plunged to 32.108 baht to one U.S.
dollar, depreciating a staggering 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some Thai commercial banks have raised their
saving interest rate in order to inject more deposit and
facilitate liquidity, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Since the baht's float, the Thai government has held continuous
consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
financial and fiscal policy planning as well as on financial
institution management, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai financial authorities have been working with IMF
officials on a package of economic measures to address the current
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The package will be submitted to the cabinet for approval at
its meeting, which will take place on Tuesday (July 29) in Chiang
Rai, northernmost Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers believed that the urgent measures to be
taken will include steps to manage and maintain the exchange rate
at an appropriate level, through, among other things, market
intervention by the government and securing financial sources for
the intervention.
</P>
<P>
Steps will also be taken to increase liquidity of finance
institutions and businesses, through the reduction of income tax
from interest earned on savings deposits, expenditure exemption of
debt occurred in corporations, and credit lending with low
interest rates, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya told
reporters that Thailand may seek standby credit from the IMF to
boost the country's sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Thai government may not draw monetary
assistance from the IMF, but if it does, the loan will be used to
strengthen the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that Thailand, with foreign reserves of
about 33 billion US dollars as of May, would need 10-20 billion
dollars for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Usually if a country seeks an IMF rescue scheme, the IMF will
put the country under strict IMF measures in exchange for
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya is
scheduled to unveil the government's economic stabilization
program, agreed upon by the IMF, on August 5.
</P>
<P>
The program will include policy initiatives to stabilize the
shaky baht, fiscal measures to solve tight liquidity problems in
the depressed property market, measures to rehabilitate financial
institutions, steps to speed up privatization, fiscal measures to
improve the industrial sector and measures to boost revenue
collection.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the government's initiative to seek IMF's
assistance indicates the government's inability to solve the
country's economic downturn all by itself and the public's
confidence in the government will sink further.

</P>
<P>
More than 130 cultural officials and representatives from art

The country will pay more attention to critic's comments on
artistic productions, and arts organizations and experts will set
up public art training centers.
</P>
<P>
The country will increase its investment in artistic
productions and offer better working conditions for them.
</P>
<P>

necessary information for interested viewers and should promote
outstanding performances, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Mortality Rates Down in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Breast cancer mortality rates in
Canada have reached their lowest level in more than four decades,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 28.4 of every 100,000 Canadian females of all ages
died of breast cancer, down from 31.3 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to 1990, the mortality rates remained relatively
steady, fluctuating between 29.5 and 32.0 deaths per 100,000
females. Since 1990, there has been an overall decline.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1995, significant decreases in breast cancer
mortality rates occurred in all age groups from 30 to 70, the
federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"In combination with other factors, such as advances in
treatment and changing fertility patterns, the earlier diagnoses
achieved with mammography may be playing a role in the decline of
breast cancer mortality rates," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The breast cancer mortality rate for Canadian women in their
fifties has dropped by an average of 2 percent a year since 1986,
while for women in their sixties, the rate fell by 4 percent a
year between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 57.4 women in every 100,000 in their fifties died of
breast cancer, down from 62.4 in 1990. Similarly, 80.4 women in
every 100,000 in their sixties died of breast cancer in 1995, down
from 103.5 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Part of this decline stems from changes in fertility: mothers
of the baby boom generation, now in their sixties, appear to have
lowered their risk of breast cancer by having more children
earlier," the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Agree to Resume Peace Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- In a first major breakthrough in
four months, Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
agreed today to renew negotiations this week to save the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a joint conference held here by
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and PNA Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Sha'ath after their
two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Levy told reporters that the Palestinian side stressed to him
its commitments to taking actions against terrorism, including
against the Palestinian policemen allegedly involved in
anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides agreed to reconvene next week
nine joint committees to discuss issues on the opening of "safe
passages" between West Bank and Gaza Strip, building of a Gaza
airport and seaport, and release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath confirmed that the PNA had promised to crack down on
terrorism to ensure the security of both Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized to Mr. Levy again the commitments of President
(Yasser) Arafat and the Palestinian Authority on security matters,
and on prevention and preemption of all acts that will injure,
harm, or create violence against Israelis and against Palestinians
obviously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said he was pleased to hear "Israel's promise to
proceed immediately with matters of great importance to the
Palestinians," including the safe passages, Gaza airport and
seaport and Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He said Levy agreed to carry out the second phase of Israeli
troop withdrawals from West Bank and hold the final-status talks
as soon as possible. Israel also promised to suspend the
controversial Jewish housing project in the Ras el Amud Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath praised those measures for helping ensure "real
partnership and mutual respect" between the two sides, and would
contribute to building "confidence and a better atmosphere for the
future."
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was a follow-up to that held by Levy and Arafat
in Brussels of Belgium last Tuesday under the sponsorship of the
European Union (EU) foreign ministers. Levy and Arafat agreed in
principle to reconvene the nine joint committees, which were
created under the Oslo Accords four years ago and whose work has
been stymied.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy reportedly denied EU Middle East peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos attending his meeting with Sha'ath. He said that
while Israel regarded the EU as its friendly partner, it was up to
Israel and the PNA to conduct direct negotiations without outside
interference.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough in the Levy-Sha'ath meeting was achieved
against the backdrop that Israeli government had promised to
block an American real estate developer from going ahead with the
controversial Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has repeated warned that the new housing project would
kill the peace process, which has already been crippled since
Israel began in March building the Har Homa settlement in
southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which sponsored the Middle East peace
process, has been working on a new initiative to break the
deadlock. Local media reported today that U.S. special envoy
Dennis Ross is expected to return to the region within two weeks
to begin a new round of mediation.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of diplomatic negotiations will mark the revival
of the dormant peace process and help ease mounting tension
between the two sides. But the road ahead is expected to be filled
with twists and turns as the gap between the two sides remains
wide on a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
To lower Palestinian expectations, Israeli state television
quoted officials from Israeli Prime Minister's Office as saying
that they remained dubious about Arafat's promise to crack down on
terrorism and cautioned against any immediate breakthrough in
future talks.

<HEADLINE> Inequality Grows Strongly in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The gap between rich and poor in
Britain has greatly widened during the past 20 years, according to
a study published today by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, an
independent researcher.
</P>
<P>
The report, Inequality in the UK, said that on virtually any
measure poverty has increased dramatically over the past two
decades, hand in hand with affluence.
</P>
<P>
The richest 10 percent of the population now has as much income
as all households in the bottom 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in inequality is probably the biggest social
change we have experienced in the last 20 years," said Paul
Johnson, one of the three authors of the report.
</P>
<P>
"With no apparent change of higher social security benefits,
higher taxes or better earnings prospects for the low paid, this
change and all its consequences is here to stay," he added.
</P>
<P>
The study said that changes in tax rates, increases in
unemployment and benefit cuts have all added to the increase in
wealth inequality.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of mass unemployment has had a major effect on
income distribution," the report said. Unemployment grew more than
eightfold between the 1960s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The number of people earning less than half of average earnings
has risen to 20 percent of the population, compared with 6 percent
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"There is little urge on the part of politicians of any party
to reduce the widening income dispersion," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Greece hopes World Championship Will Boost Olympic Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece hopes that Athens'
successful hosting of the World Athletics Championship August 1-10
will convince sports officials to let them win an even bigger
prize: the 2004 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits from the championships will be enormous. The
image of Greece will be at the epicenter of international
attention, an event that can't be translated into economic terms,"
said Sports Minister Andreas Fouras.
</P>
<P>
Fouras added: "We hope the foreign delegations will become
ambassadors of goodwill for Greece, something exceptionally
important for us since the final decision on the Athens candidacy
for the Olympic Games of 2004 is due very soon."
</P>
<P>
Sports officials here are hoping members of the International
Olympic Committee will be impressed enough to vote for Athens when
they meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, September 5 to pick the host
city.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders are Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cape Town, South
Africa; Rome, Italy; and Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Athens says it has already built more than 70 percent of the
facilities it needs for the 2004 Games and many will be seen by
the 48 IOC officials who will be attending the Championships.
</P>
<P>
Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, president of the Athens bid
committee, said: "This is a completely new bid. We will present a
new city."

fiscal year (from April 1, 1993 to March 31, 1994), causing a
provisional loss of 6,120 million rupees (about 185.45 million

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal-computer market
boomed in the second quarter, supporting healthy worldwide growth,
the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two biggest PC-research firms, International Data Corp. and
Dataquest Inc., reported that U.S. unit sales grew 19 percent and
21.9 percent from the year-earlier quarter respectively and that
worldwide unit sales rose 15 percent and 17 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, both research firms reported that the top four PC
suppliers -- Compaq Computer Corp., International Business
Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Computer Corp. --
control nearly 38 percent of the computer market, up from 34
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said the big vendors such as Compaq and H-P are
getting bigger. They are taking market share away from such
second-tire players as AST Research Inc. and Digital Equipment
Corp., as well as from third-tier direct-sales companies.
</P>
<P>
The trend appears even more pronounced in the business market,
where the top four companies now control almost half the market,
IDC said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that the overall growth figures show the
PC industry's worldwide sales growth rate either holding steady
or advancing slightly from the previous quarter.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Asks Britain to Free or Transfer IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army's (IRA)
political wing Sinn Fein today pressed the British government to
free or transfer hundreds of IRA prisoners in its first talks with
British officials since the IRA declared a ceasefire a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein Vice-President Pat Doherty told reporters after the
meeting that his delegation raised the issues when it met
government officials in Belfast at the final session of
multi-party peace talks before a summer adjournment.
</P>
<P>
He said Sinn Fein would hold talks with Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam either next Monday or Wednesday for
further discussion of IRA prisoners' issue.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam has pledged to review the case of 30-odd prisoners
held in jails on the British mainland for security offenses and to
look favorably on their transfer to Irish and Northern Irish
prisons where hundreds more are serving their sentences.
</P>
<P>
The IRA called for a truce a week ago which allowed Sinn Fein
to take part in the negotiations on September 15 if the IRA truce
is declared genuine by Britain.
</P>
<P>
Doherty also urged the pro-British Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), to shelve objections to government plans on
the surrender of guerrilla arms and to join the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The UUP and two smaller unionist parties voted against
Anglo-Irish proposals that the IRA and pro-British loyalist
extremists surrender weapons during the talks, rather than before
or afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Government officials fear the UUP will not negotiate directly
with Sinn Fein until the IRA is forced to physically surrender
some arms during the negotiations, which was strongly against by
IRA.
</P>
<P>
There have been no IRA attacks since the truce was declared,
but British security forces and the 12,000-strong Northern Ireland
police still remain on the alert against possible violence by
Irish Catholic republicans or their Protestant pro-British
loyalist foes.

<HEADLINE> Chloroquin to Be Phased Out in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
that chloroquin drugs will soon be phased out in favor of
sulphur-based drugs as the first line of treatment for malaria,
"The East African" reported today.
</P>
<P>
John Ouma, head of the Division of Vector Borne Diseases at
the Health Ministry, was quoted as saying that a recent study in
malaria-affected areas revealed "more than 50 percent total
clinical failure after chloroquin drugs were used on patients."
</P>
<P>
Since April, one of the worst highland malaria in recent years
broke out mainly in Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces, western
Kenya, leading to a death toll of 333 people.
</P>
<P>
Ouma noted that a possible cause of the high death toll was
resistance to chloroquin-based anti-malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted Davy Koech, director of the Kenya
Medical Research Institute, as saying that malaria is a curable
infection and the deaths could be as low as zero.
</P>
<P>
He warned that advertisements for chloroquin-based drugs may
be misleading, adding that these messages have made people go for
a product that is only going to suppress and not clear the
parasite.
</P>
<P>
Chloroquin resistance first emerged in Tanzania in the 1970's
after a mass chemo-therapy effort to eradicate the parasite using
chloroquin failed and certain parasites survived.
</P>
<P>
Highland malaria, which occurs mainly in areas at around 2,000
meters above sea level, is caused by the plasmodium falciparum
parasite transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito which thrives in
the wet and humid conditions of such areas after the March-May
long rains in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> IMF Happy With African Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said it is witnessing encouraging signs of progress in
Africa's economies.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of countries is now registering
substantial rates of economic growth while reducing inflation and
financial imbalances," the IMF said in its latest bulletin
released here today.
</P>
<P>
It said, "this relatively favorable over-all performance,
particularly since 1993/94, conveys the sense that Africa is on
the move."
</P>
<P>
Africa's economic performance, at least until recently, had
been characterized by too many cases of uneven or weak policy
implementation leading to poor results, it said.
</P>
<P>
Within this general framework, it said, several countries had
been doing much better than others, mainly because they had been
rigorously implementing a wide range of sound macro-economic
policies and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
At present 21 countries, including Zimbabwe, are implementing
comprehensive programs supported by Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Although Africa's recent economic progress had been
encouraging, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
averaging about five percent, much remained to be done to achieve
sustainable growth and reduce poverty in the context of financial
stability, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said countries which had improved their macro-economic
environment and liberalized their markets but still experienced
weak growth response had domestic and foreign private investment
which had not increased as fast as expected.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, private initiative is still constrained by
extensive regulations, inefficient tax and banking systems, and
the lack of economic security," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, some countries have been giving conflicting
signals regarding their commitment to private sector development,
which should be the engine of growth," it said.
</P>
<P>
Its "second generation of reforms" would concentrate on more
decisive action to eliminate existing obstacles and constraints
on private sector development, it said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said effective management of public enterprises,
whether by the central government or by public enterprises, was
important for growth and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance is critical in that it helps ensure that
public resources are well managed and corruption and fraud are
vigorously addressed," it said.

<HEADLINE> Confidence in Mandela, His Government Declines: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africans turn to have
less confidence in their President Nelson Mandela and the
government, according to a survey by Market Research Africa
(MRA).
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that South Africans, especially the white,
colored and Indian people, believe Mandela's performance has
declined and his government's has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey shows that most black respondents have
more confidence in Mandela and the government now than they did
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
MRA's three-year tracking study has urban adults assessing the
government's and Mandela's performances on a scale of very good,
good, average, poor or very poor.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's performance was voted good to very good by 77
percent of blacks (85 percent last year and 71 percent in 1995).
However, less than one in 10 whites and fewer than two in 10
coloreds and Indians thought the government performing well.
</P>
<P>
The white majority view (55 percent) was that the government
was performing poorly. Forty-one percent of Indians agreed to
this while 42 percent of Indians and just over half the country's
coloreds (53 percent) believed the government's performance was
average.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a population of about 38 million, consisting
of blacks, whites, coloreds and Asians. The black takes 76.7
percent of the population, white 12.7 percent, and colored and
Indians 8.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Air Raids Guerrilla Targets in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes this afternoon
raided a stronghold of Lebanese Muslim militants in Iglim
Al-Toffah, near the Israeli self-declared "buffer zone" in south
Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli jets fired missiles at suspected guerrilla targets
in the area, a ridge the Iran-backed Hezbollah (Party of God)
militants often used to launch attacks on Israeli occupation
forces and its allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said on condition of anonymity that along
with the air raid in which Israeli jets hovered at low altitudes,
the Israelis were also pouring artillery shells into the area.
</P>
<P>
The violent bombardment lasted more than an hour, but there was
no immediate report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
This was a clear retaliation for Hezbollah attacks this
morning on positions of Israeli occupation forces at Az-Zohra and
Sweida in the buffer zone with rocket-propelled grenades and
machine guns.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Shiite fundamentalist
group noted that "a certain number of Israeli soldiers were killed
or wounded." However, a spokesman of the SLA militia, which
patrols the border strip, confirmed the guerrilla attacks, but
denied any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the Israeli forces launched a routine
artillery attack on Habboush, a border village near the buffer
zone, wounding a civilian.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night a SLA militiaman was seriously wounded by a
missile fired by Hezbollah guerrillas at his outpost in the
western sector of the 15-kilometer-wide buffer enclave Israel
set up in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon
to oust the Israeli occupation forces out of the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government is considering to file the second
complaint in a day against Israeli truce violations with an
international cease-fire monitoring committee. It lodged the first
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement reached between Lebanon and Israel in
April, 1996 bars fighting sides in south Lebanon from targeting
civilians or launching military operations from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory bombardment
by Israeli forces and the SLA militia have become a daily scene on
the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> Regional IDDS Workshop Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A three-day workshop on iodine
deficiency disorders (IDDS) started here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants have been drawn from Zimbabwe, South Africa,
Swaziland, Namibia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia and
Lesotho to come up with recommendations on dealing with IDDS.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency is said to be the world's single most
significant cause of preventable brain damage and mental
retardation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 118 countries in the world are reported to have
iodine deficiency disorders, while 1.57 billion people worldwide
or 29 percent of the global population are at risk of iodine
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
In a key address, Zimbabwe's Minister of Health and Child
Welfare Timothy Stamps implored governments to give political
support and make commitment to eliminating IDDS.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is only when governments give political support
and commitment, coupled with international agency support, that
we are assured of virtually eliminating the scourge of iodine
deficiency."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "these can all be reduced or eliminated by iodine
supplementation before pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been on a vigorous campaign during the past few
years to eliminate IDDS.

<HEADLINE> Pan African Women's Organization Congress Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A five-day eighth Pan African
Women's Organization (PAWO) congress started here today, with a
theme of "the effects of conflict on African development, from
rhetoric to action".
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 13 African countries will discuss poverty,
education, violence, economic empowerment and status of women at
the congress.
</P>
<P>
The PAWO, formed by women in 1962 to fight against
colonialism, has now shifted its focus on regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Acting President Simon
Muzenda urged African governments to support initiatives made by
women for social, economic and political recognition.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said although women carried the hopes and aspirations
of nations, they remained marginalized.
</P>
<P>
Despite their contribution, he said, governments found it
difficult to set aside finances in support of women.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said without equality there could never be peace,
adding that peace was not necessarily the absence of war or
violence.
</P>
<P>
He was, however, optimistic that strides had been taken
towards the promotion of women, and most governments had begun to
implement some of the resolutions adopted at the 1995 Beijing
conference.
</P>
<P>
"All countries in the region have already started programs to
address these critical areas of concern," said Muzanda, adding
that most countries, including Zimbabwe, had enacted new laws for
the protection of women.
</P>
<P>
He said lack of political will and economic hardships
continued to militate against the full implementation of the
Beijing platform of action which could see women's lives
improved.
</P>
<P>
He commended international donors and non-governmental
organizations for supporting programs which governments failed to
take up.
</P>
<P>
PAWO Secretary-general Ruth Neto called for the speedy
implementation of the African platform of action in conjunction
with the Beijing platform of action.

<HEADLINE> Israel Suspends Permit To Build New Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The permit issued by the
Likud-dominant Jerusalem Municipality to build a new Jewish
settlement at Ras el Amud in East Jerusalem has been suspended,
reported the state-run Israel Radio this evening.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Chairman of the Interior Ministry's
District Appeal Committee, Ahrom Brushin, took the decision after
an appeal submitted by two left-wing members of the Jerusalem
Municipality against the permit.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will remain in effect until the Appeal
Committee rules otherwise. It is awaiting a decision by the
Jerusalem District Court which is expected to hear this appeal in
about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) Interior Committee members visited the
site of Ras el Amud project this morning. Some backed the project
while others said it would be politically disastrous and illegal.
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led rightwing government has come under increasing
pressure to stop the controversial project. Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
warning of the danger to the peace process if construction at Ras
el Amud goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sent a reply letter to Mubarak saying that he is
opposed to construction of the project at this time.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the hardline Jerusalem City Council gave
green-light to the construction of a mini-settlement in the heart
of the Ras el Amud section of the Mount of Olives, an Palestinian
Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The permit was given at the request of U.S. real estate
developer Irving Moskowitz to build some 70 housing units there.

<HEADLINE> Big US Auto Maker likely to Make Huge Olympic Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corporation is
expected to announce a sponsorship deal this week worth several
hundred million dollars with the National Broadcasting Co. and the
United States Olympic Committee, according to a report of the New
York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal was described as "likely to be the largest
sports sponsorship ever" when the full value of the sponsorships
was totaled up. Among the largest is the current five-year 250
million U.S. dollars between the Coca-Cola company and the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
The deal of G.M., one of the three big auto makers in the
United States, with NBC will start with the 2000 Summer Olympics
in Sydney, Australia, and carry through the 2002 Winter Games in
Salt Lake City, and the 2004 Summer, 2006 Winter and 2008 Summer
Olympics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
G.M.'s arrangement with the U.S. Olympic Committee is to begin
immediately; it will take the organization from next year's Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, which will be broadcast by Colombia
Broadcasting System, through at least 2004, and possibly through
2008.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will provide G.M. the broad-based rights to
market itself as the official domestic car and truck company of
the Olympics for as long as a decade.
</P>
<P>
Experts considered G.M.'s move "far-sighted marketing" in
consideration of the fierce competitiveness of the car market.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Keep Crossing with Iraq Open Round Clock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new government is
planning to keep its border crossing with Iraq - the Habur Border
Gate - open round the clock, the official Iraqi news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Turkey's Minister of State Salihm Yildirim as saying
that extending opening to 24 hours a day of the checkpoint will
allow more trucks dispatched from Turkey to cross into northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The number of trucks passing through the crossing is expected
to increase to 5,000 per day from 2,000 at present. The crossing
was opened in 1994 to facilitate the flux of truckloads of food,
clothing and medicine into the sanctions-stricken Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister also said that Turkey wants to construct a
second oil pipeline to carry Iraqi crude oil and open another
border crossing to invigorate the economy in Turkey's southern and
southeastern areas across from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has already decided to set up two
free-trade zones in southeastern Turkey in a bid to encourage
border trade with Iraq, which was resumed under the U.N.-Iraq
food-for-oil deal allowing Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Turkey estimates its losses at more than 30 billion dollars in
bilateral trade with Iraq due to the U.N.-imposed sanctions
against Baghdad due to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Speaker Calls for Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian House Speaker
Michel Tamer reiterated here today his country's support for the
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, calling
for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
House Speaker Nabih Berri, Tamer stressed his country's
permanent support for Lebanon in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Tamer, told reporters at the end of his meeting with the
Lebanese house speaker, "Brazil has been and will always be
standing on the side of Lebanon's cause and backing up the
international resolutions supporting Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Tamer, a son of a Lebanese couple migrating to Brazil before he
was born, said that his talks with Berri were focused on "the
relations of friendship between the Lebanese and Brazilian peoples
especially between the Lebanese and Brazilian parliaments," and
concrete ways to enhance these relations.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides hoped that the third conference of
parliamentarians of Lebanese origin, which is planned to be held
in Washington next February, will be successful, and agreed to
make efforts for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tamer announced, he and the Lebanese house
speaker reached a "serious and important agreement" that Brazil
and Lebanon will jointly put forward the choice of person for the
election of chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union next
September in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify who will be their choice, but elaborated
that Lebanon will use its influence in the Arab League, the Arab
Parliamentary Union and the Francophonics, and Brazil in Latin
America, "for the election of a best chairman of the IPU."
</P>
<P>
Tamer added that he and the Lebanese house speaker will
discuss the "final steps on this issue in August."
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian house speaker arrived in Beirut Sunday afternoon
on a four-day official visit in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Difference with Greece on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has denied that Greece and Cyprus have different
views on the Cyprus problem and the accession course of Cyprus to
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Kasoulides said "There is
absolute identity of views and any other interpretation of verbal
statements does not correspond to reality."
</P>
<P>
Press reports have said that there is different views between
Nicosia and Athens on the goals, priorities, handling and
assessment of developments of the Cyprus problem and Cypriot EU
accession course.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Manolis Christofides today also
dismissed such press reports, saying "any development on the
Cyprus issue, any move by our opponent which will create new fait
accompli will be dealt with in a dynamic and decisive manner from
both governments in Cyprus and Greece."
</P>
<P>
He told his daily press briefing that the cooperation between
the two governments is "absolute", adding that Greece stands
firmly by Cyprus in all respects.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that both sides believe that the international
community should respond in a resolute manner if Turkey
integrates the northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime signed a
joint declaration for enhancing economic, political and defense
cooperation and threatened partial integration of the northern
island if Cypriot EU accession course moves on.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Both Greece and Turkey were guarantors of Cypriot
independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready for Talks with Syria Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said today that Israel is ready to start negotiations with
Syria without preconditions, the state-run Israel Radio
reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the statement while addressing the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Levy admitted
that he is doing all he can to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Levy stressed that the Golan Heights Bill, which calls for a
majority of 80 Knesset members to authorize a change to the 1981
Golan Heights Law on annexation of the Syrian land, was not
government initiative.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed first reading Wednesday, would make
Israeli concessions on Golan Heights in peace talks with Damascus
more difficult, if not impossible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that he conveyed the message indirectly to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Due to the hardline policy of the rightwing Likud-led
government, the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have broken off
since mid-March this year. The Syrian and Lebanese tracks have
come a standstill ever since February last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister's advisor Uzi Arad met with
European Union (EU) special Middle East peace envoy Miguel Angel
Moratinos here this morning. Arad told Moratinos that the prime
minister's position regarding peace process with Syria is that the
future of the Golan Heights will be determined by a referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior EU source, Moratinos will take with him a
new Israeli idea to renew peace talks with Syria when he meets
with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly made an
oral promise on a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
strategic point captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War. But
the rightwing Likud-led government declared that it would only
honor written agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses US of Plotting to Enter Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today accused the United States of trying to establish
its military presence in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have told one of the Central Asian countries
that they can form a naval force for them and hence establish
their presence in the Caspian Sea under this pretext," he pointed
out during an interview with the Persian-language evening
newspaper Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
"According to our reports the Americans are trying to somehow
establish their presence through military assistance in the
Caucasus or in Afghanistan," he said in the interview carried by
today's edition of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "the Americans have set multi-purpose traps in
our cities and our seas. If we are not active, they will dominate
the countries on our east and west."
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is believed to have one of the largest energy
reserves in the world. Its littoral states, including Azerbaijan,
Iran and Russia, have been conducting oil and gas exploration
programs.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Iran launched two military training ships and
carried out war games in the land-locked Caspian in a bid to
strengthen military capacity and operations.
</P>
<P>
In his first ever attack on the Taliban militia, Velayati said
the group, which now controls two thirds of Afghanistan, was
supported by the Americans and formed to be used as a leverage
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Americans ... were planning to help Taliban dominate
Afghanistan, and hence pose a permanent threat and have a
leverage against us in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "the sophisticated U.S. weaponry at the
disposal of Taliban is clear proof that they are supported by
Americans."
</P>
<P>
He hailed cooperation between Iran and Russia in the
Afghanistan issue, and said this "has brought about security in
the Caucasus, Central Asia and Afghanistan ... has safeguarded the
security of our northern and northeastern border."
</P>
<P>
He said Iran will further promote relations with Russia, adding
"Today our ties with Russia are very important and strategic.
Russia is counting on us for long term relations."
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, (President Boris) Yeltsin and Russian government
would not insist so much, despite U.S. pressure, to continue
technological assistance and to hold wide-ranging cooperation with
Iran,+ he explained.
</P>
<P>
Despite protests from the U.S. and Israel, Moscow is
helping Tehran to finish its first nuclear power plant in the
southern port of Bushehr, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have accused Iran of trying to acquire
nuclear knowledge and capability for military purposes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fuel Scarcity Bites Harder in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Fuel scarcity haunting Nigeria has
led to a bloody clash which killed three persons at the weekend
in Ilaro, western Nigeria as bus drivers raised transport fares.
</P>
<P>
Trouble started on Friday morning when commercial bus drivers
in the town almost doubled the transport fare. The fight between
students of the Federal Polytechnic and drivers continued until
Saturday afternoon, leaving one student and two local people
dead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several houses and many vehicles were burnt during
the disturbance and many students and residents of the town were
injured.
</P>
<P>
The local government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew to
curtail the fracas and the institution has also been closed down
until further notice.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the transport fare, according to analysts, is
a logic outcome of the lingering short supply of fuel throughout
the country since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The biting fuel scarcity has slowed down business activities
and many operators of commercial vehicles, with business nearly
grounded, have resorted to adulteration of petrol.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are reported to mix petrol with large quantity of
kerosine in open places.
</P>
<P>
The real threat of the fuel shortage has been described by the
Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria (MAN) as one of the
contributors to the collapse of the country's industry.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the head of state General Sani Abacha, MAN
argued that the deficiencies in infrastructure had been further
compounded by the shortage of petrol that had occurred in the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the largest oil producing country in Africa with a
daily output of 1.6 million barrels of crude. Oil export
contributes to more than 80 percent of its foreign exchange
income.
</P>
<P>
Due to the poor management and lack of maintenance, all the
four refineries in the country are operating far under capacity,
and some are even near to close-down.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, though reluctant, has to resort to
imports of petroleum products to douse its lingering fuel crisis.
</P>
<P>
But quite a few of the tankers laden with petrol meant for
distribution to filling stations are allegedly smuggled into
neighboring countries, such as Niger and Benin for higher
profits.
</P>
<P>
Petrol is sold at 11 Naira (about 0.13 U.S. Dollar) in Nigeria
and is said to be the last item of social welfare the current
military administration can offer to the public.
</P>
<P>
However, the cheap price of petrol is discourageous to
refineries which can make little profit from the business and
receive nothing from the government as subsidy.
</P>
<P>
This situation partly explains why refineries in Nigeria have
long been in lack of maintenance and poor management.
</P>
<P>
It also gives the reason why reckless smugglers carry the
products to neighboring countries for double profits even as the
government has sent task force to curtail diversion of tankers.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of refineries has been advocated as a means for
final settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government is reluctant to consider the suggestion for
fear that the expected price rise made by private owners of the
plants might trigger off instability nationwide.
</P>
<P>
But the government seems to have soft-pedalled its stance
recently. It is reported the government may intend to hand over
the management of two refineries to Shell and Mobil, the two
multinational oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The move might be attributed to the ban on the sale of oil
equipment to Nigeria by European Union members countries and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
West-owned corporations are believed to be better able to
source spare parts to maintain refineries owned by them,
observers noted.
</P>
<P>
No matter whether the deal will be done or not, what Nigerians
want is a permanent solution so that the recurrent fuel scarcity
will no longer take place in the country.

LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's National Council Speaker
Hassan Abdalla Al Turabi today called on African leaders to come
together to establish an African intervention force.
</P>
<P>
Such a force could be called in to maintain law and order
whenever there was crisis in any part of Africa, the council
speaker said at a satellite tele-conference in the Sudanese
embassy to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africans did not need the Americans to train the
force since "we are not talking of how to handle atomic bombs".
</P>
<P>
What the force needed was just training on how to maintain law
and order, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the issue of torture and rape would be
reduced since members of the force would be Africans dealing with
their fellow Africans.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Enforces Embargo on Sierra Leome: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The clandestine, prodemocracy
radio operating from an undisclosed location in the capital said
today that an air, land and sea embargo "is in force" against
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not say when it was introduced, but added that
the Nigerian task force commander of the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), Colonel Maxwell Kobbeh is in charge
of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Kobbeh "is advising all ship owners, shipping agents, airlines
and travel agents that any violation of the sanction and embargo
by them will be at their own risk", according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the (military) government complies with the
demands of Sierra Leoneans and the international community to
return power to the democratically elected government (which it
overthrew on May 25), ECOWAS will be prevailed on to lift the
sanction and embargo," the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's junta officials told Xinhua that they had no
"prior notice" of the sanction and was "actively studying the
development".
</P>
<P>
The military government of Major Johnny Paul Koroma has
repeatedly accused Nigeria of trying to use force to bring down
the regime by formenting hostility in the country.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products in Sierra Leone have nearly run out with
huge queues of vehicles marooned at fuel stations since Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Traffic between the capital and other towns in the interior
has nearly grounded to a trickle and there are reports of long
distance trucks stranded in the country's second largest city Bo
with large quantities of vegetables and other perishable goods
destined for the capital.
</P>
<P>
There has also been drastic power cuts and many radio stations
using petrol to operate their generators for their broadcast
transmissions have been off the air. The customs department said
it is losing 50,000 Dollars a day because ships are not coming
in.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank suspended a public sector adjustment project in
June after the May 25 coup under which 55 million Dollars would
have been used to finance the import of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
A junta delegation led by Foreign Secretary Paolo Bangura left
here today for Cote d'Ivoire for another round of talks with the
four-nation ECOWAS committe on Sierra Leone to end the current
political impasse.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Role in Liberia Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's Independent Elections
Commission Chairman Henry Andrews has said the role of Nigeria in
shaping a new Africa "will one day, no matter how grudgingly, be
the subject of a worldwide acclaim".
</P>
<P>
"All of us on the Independent Elections Commission are proud
to identify with this historic leadership of your great country,"
Andrews wrote to Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi in a letter
faxed to Abuja, Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic success of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) in the Liberian peace process, coupled with its
resoluteness on the political crisis in Sierra Leone, had
convinced world powers that Africa possessed potentials for
resolving issues.
</P>
<P>
"The enviable fact that this success story has been led by
Nigeria and ensured by the blood, sweat and tears of Nigerians
and our brothers and sisters of ECOWAS is hard for some to
swallow but one cannot change history neither can one argue with
success," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Andrews, who presided over the presidential and legislative
elections in Liberia, paid tribute to the indefatigable role
Ikimi played in the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was enough to earn the minister the honorary title of
"grand architect of the Liberian peace process", he added.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian elections, the first since 1985, saw the
emergence of Charles Taylor, the National Patriotic Party
candidate, as the winner.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 49, is expected to be sworn in this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges Strengthening ACP-EU Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti urged today that relations between the African, Caribbean
and Pacific group (ACP) and the European Union (EU) should be
maintained and strengthened in the next century.
</P>
<P>
After 22 years of successive Lome trade arrangements, the
performance of ACP member countries on the EU market is not very
encouraging, he lamented when opening an eastern African regional
seminar on the future of ACP-EU ties here.
</P>
<P>
Despite existing preferential trading system provided by the
Lome Convention, the ACP share in the EU market fell from seven
percent before the convention started in February 1975, to a mere
three percent in 1995, said Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
This unfavorable trade trend was caused by complicated facts
that the ACP region has less product diversification, depends on
export of raw materials, lacks investment to improve
communications, banking and insurance services and so on.
</P>
<P>
However, EU has a responsibility to support the economies of
the developing countries although the crux of the matter lies
with ACP's own efforts to attract European investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the European Development Council meeting of
ministers in Luxembourg in June, an agreement was reached on
maintaining the Lome Convention with focus on catering for fuller
participation by the ACP countries in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-term Lome IV Convention is coming to end in 2000
and negotiation for a new one should pay attention to
strengthening preferential trade issues and revision of aid
procedures, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Lome Convention was a trade cooperation and economic aid
agreement first signed by 46 ACP countries and nine EU member
states in 1975. By November 1995, a total of 85 countries, 15 of
them EU members, joined the convention.

TUNIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Second Arab Conference on
Security Publicity opened here today with participation of
officials from member countries of the Arab Interior Ministers'
Council.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the council, based in Tunis, said the conference
will discuss issues of security Publicity, challenges of the next
century, means to spread security awareness among arab
individuals, role of the media in fostering cooperation between
individuals and the policemen and requirements of the security
media men.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Ahmed Ben Salem, Secretary General of
the Council of Arab Interior Ministers pinpointed responsibility
of the media in maintaining law and order and in cementing
stability, adding that security publicity means mainly to
disseminate facts and statistics reassuring the public and
educating the public on protection measures.
</P>
<P>
Because strategies and plans by the council are designed to
involve the masses in the fight against crime, Salem said, they can
not attain desired success unless close and concerted cooperation
is ensured between the various media and crime prevention
departments.
</P>
<P>
At the end of its two-day session, the conference is expected
to adopt and publish its recommendations on security to
governments of the member countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Peace Depends on Israel's Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today the future of the Mideast peace process hinges on the
Israeli government's commitment to implementing the agreements
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that a spate of contacts and
consultations are currently under way to salvage the peace process
but much more is yet to be done.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States, as a key sponsor of the
peace process, has a major responsibility to shoulder in breathing
new life to it on the basis of implementing the signed agreements
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also mentioned the European desire to move forward the
peace process, citing the European Union-brokered meeting between
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy in Brussels last week.
</P>
<P>
But "first and foremost, the peace process depends on Israel's
abidance by the signed agreement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel today informed EU Mideast Envoy Miguel Moratinos of the
end of his mission and kept him away from the upcoming meeting
between PNA top negotiator Nabil Sha'ath and Levy, to protest what
it called a biased European stance against the Jewish state
concerning its settlement policy and Jerusalem issues.
</P>
<P>
Egypt stepped in as a major broker between the Palestinians and
Israelis as tensions grew high following Israel's building of a
controversial Jewish settlement in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem
in March.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that he had received two messages from
his Syrian and Kuwaiti counterparts today, which, among other
things, dealt with the latest developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador Issa Darwish, who conveyed the message from
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara to Moussa, described the Israeli
Knesset's (Parliament's) decision last week on annexing Golan
Heights to the Jewish state as "null and void."
</P>
<P>
The illegitimate annexation has been rejected by all countries,
including the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Syria's position remains firm and it will not resume
negotiations with Israel unless they begin from where they were
left off and Israel declares its readiness to fully withdraw to
the pre-June 5, 1967 borders," Darwish said.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Syrian Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war
and refused to meet Damascus' demand to return it.
</P>
<P>
Darwish told reporters the next Arab League foreign ministers'
meeting due to open here in September will formulate an Arab stand
towards the current peace stalemate.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
instructed government and administration representatives to meet
the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church to discuss ways of
reworking the controversial bill, "On freedom of Conscience and
Religious Associations."
</P>
<P>
This came in a report by the Interfax news agency based on
statements by reliable sources in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Last week Yeltsin vetoed the bill approved by the two houses of
parliament regarding some of its provisions which contradict the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kremlin sources, Yeltsin is determined to sign
a law blocking the penetration of Russia by totalitarian sects and
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
They said that he also thinks it necessary to guarantee
conditions for the psychological health of the nation and support
traditional religious associations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said he also supports a religion law the final
version of which must take into account the opinions of the key
religious communities, the biggest of which is the Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that active consultations may begin this
week between government and administration representatives and the
leaders of key religious communities to work out a compromise
version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> IBCA Comments on Kia Group's Bail-Out Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The main creditor banks of Kia
Motors has launched a bail-out scheme which will involve freezing
loan and interest payments for the next two months, according to
an announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
The financial condition of the company, the flagship company
of the Kia Group, has been deteriorating in the past few years due
to a downturn in domestic demand and has recently been suffering
from cash flow difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The creditor committee is led by Korea First Bank (KFB), Kia
Motor's main bank and the rescue package will include 18 of the
group's larger subsidiaries. The creditor banks have an aggregate
exposure of about KRW 5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
In the next few months the creditor committee will decide on
the extension of loan maturities, the amount of additional credits
and to be determined on July 30 and will be provided on a pro-rata
basis by the respective creditor banks, depending on the share of
their current exposure.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the bail-out scheme, IBCA said that the impact on
the banks' earnings will depend on the final outcome of the rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the banks with large exposures will lose
substantial interest income over the next two months and, once
interest payments are overdue more than three months, the loans
are likely to be classified "pre-cautionary" and will require loan
loss provisions, albeit at only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The final outcome will depend on the success of Kia's efforts
to restructure and cut costs and the sale of assets. Nevertheless,
some loss to the creditor banks is inevitable, said IBCA.
</P>
<P>
IBCA's Individual rating of KFB is already very low and that of
Cho Hung was lowered earlier this year in recognition of the
ongoing deterioration in its asset quality.
</P>
<P>
The agency's forthcoming rating report on Shinhan Ban will
assess the implications of its exposure to Kia. The Korea
Development Bank (KDB) is a special case given that is in effect
government guaranteed.

CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Supreme Military Court
sentenced today an anesthetist to 30 years of hard labor plus one
year in prison after finding him guilty of aiding the Muslim
militants, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ramzi Mahmoud Al Muwafi, 43, was condemned to 25 years of hard labor
on charges of affiliation to a terrorist group fighting to replace
the secular government with a strict Islamic rule, serving an
insurgent group in Afghanistan, and teaching terrorist groups the
use of poison and explosives.
</P>
<P>
Muwafi, a former doctor, received five more years of hard labor
for illegal possession of official identification stamps and
forging an identification card.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested early this year on his return to Egypt from
Pakistan when he was found carrying the fake stamps.

<HEADLINE> UK Large Companies Face Late-Payment Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- UK's big companies that fail to
settle their bills to smaller ones on time will be charged
statutory interest under plans introduced today.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the Labor government is determined to carry out
its campaign to end late payments by big companies.
</P>
<P>
A consultative green paper, issued by the Department of Trade
and Industry gives the business world until October 3 to offer its
advice on the best means of tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government says that late-payment by big companies
has caused disproportionate damage to small companies.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be welcomed by many small businesses, but
could run into opposition from others and from large companies
which are mostly hostile to the principle of statutory interest.
</P>
<P>
Observers said, the Labor government is taking a step-by-step
approach to send a signal of its determination to help small
businesses, which often find itself at end of a chain of payments.
</P>
<P>
Government departments and local authorities concerned will
also be obliged to comply as part of their contractual
arrangements with small companies, they added.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that if the scheme succeeds, the
government will look at extending its range to cover all corporate
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Rocke, minister for small businesses, said submissions
to the government had shown that a large majority of small
businesses see statutory payments as the only means remaining of
tackling a problem that prevents long-term financial planning.
</P>
<P>
"We want to send two messages: of support to small business and
determination to deal with a problem that threatens the viability
of many companies and competitiveness in general," she added.

<HEADLINE> Clerides, Denktash to Meet on Humanitarian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash today decided to have a
second meeting here Thursday to continue their discussions on
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
U.N. top envoy Gustave Feissel made the announcement following
a 75-minute meeting this evening between Clerides and Denktash at
his residence situated in the U.N.-controlled Nicosia airport
area.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus
said "the leaders of the two communities have had their first
get-together here to discuss a number of humanitarian questions."
</P>
<P>
The meeting came two weeks after the first round of
face-to-face negotiations between the two leaders at Troutbeck,
near New York from July 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Feissel described today's discussions as "good" and the mood as
"cordial," but refrained from giving any details about the
content.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said Thursday's meeting will decide whether
there will be a third meeting in Nicosia. Convening a third
meeting would depend on "many things and on what they will
accomplish," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said discussing humanitarian issues is obviously an
important aspect which can have a significant impact on the
overall atmosphere and can certainly facilitate moving things
forward.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Denktash refrained from making any statement
after the meeting which was joined only by Feissel.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was reported to have raised the questions of the
people missing since the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the living
conditions of the enclaved people in the Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing after Turkey landed more than 30,000 troops on the east
Mediterranean island following a pro-Greece coup and took over one
third of the island in the north.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this island
nation as bi-communal, bi-zonal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Bar to Iran Pipeline Won't Mean Change of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
would not object to a project of building a 1.6 billion US dollar
pipeline cross Iran, but the tacit approval did not reflect any
easing of longstanding efforts to isolate Iran economically and
diplomatically, the New York Times said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, stretching some 2,000 miles from Turkmenistan,
through Iran and into Turkey and perhaps beyond to Europe, could
eventually carry 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas to
energy-short Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times quoted U.S. officials as saying that the
project did not violate the Iran-Libya sanctions act of 1996,
which gives the president the power to impose sanctions on foreign
companies that invest 40 million US dollars or more a year in oil
or gas industries in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
The White House, anticipating oppositions surrounding the
project from Congress, has reiterated that the Clinton
administration's tacit approval did not mean any change in policy
toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
"There's been no change in policy or any signal regarding that
policy," a White House spokeswoman said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Necmettin Erbakan, who was then the prime minister
of Turkey, signed a deal reached with Iran on buying 23 billion
US dollar of Iran's natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In the months after Erbakan signed the deal, the United States
repeatedly raised its objections in talks with Turks, threatening
to impose sanctions on Turkey if the deal went ahead.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, facing the U.S. threat, signed an agreement in May to buy
Turkmenistan's natural gas instead. But the natural gas would be
carried through the above-mentioned pipeline passing through
Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force
Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald Fogleman today asked for an earlier
retirement for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
The reasons include differences over responsibility for a
terrorist blast last year that claimed 19 airmen's lives, The
Associated Press quoted Pentagon officials as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The four-star general had said that he would resign if Air
Force generals were punished for not preventing the bombing at
Khobar Towers, a military barracks in Saudi Arabia, on June 25,
1996, in which 19 U.S. airmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was scheduled to make a
decision this week on whether to hold one or more top Air Force
officials responsible for the incident.
</P>
<P>
Fogleman informed his top staff this morning of his decision to
retire before September 1, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Fogleman, who has served three years as the 16th Air Force
chief of staff, would be the first ever to step down voluntarily
before his four-year terms was up, if his request for retirement is
accepted by Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall.

<HEADLINE> China To Set Up Unified Pension Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China must accelerate its reform
in the social security sector and set up a unified pension system,
State Councillor Li Tieying said at today's opening of a national
conference on pensions for factory employees.
</P>
<P>
All factory workers, both from state-owned firms and other
enterprises, should be eligible for a pension plan, Li said at the
meeting, which was sponsored by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The existing pension system has only covered those working in
state firms, but the majority of the employees in foreign-funded
and private companies still are not covered by a pension system,
according to Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, China has been experimenting with pension funding
in some pilot cities and some progress has been made, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged that pensions be paid to employees of loss-making
state enterprises. Some retired employees in these firms have not
received their pension money on time, and in the correct amount,
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Food Ration Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iraq government announced
today that it will increase monthly food ration for its people
from August.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency (INA), under the
new ration system, rice will be increased to 2.5 kilograms from 2
kilograms at present and cereals will be doubled to 1 kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The other ration items include 9 kilograms of flour, 2
kilograms of sugar, 150 grams of tea, 1 kilogram of edible oil,
200 grams of soap, 350 grams of detergents, and 150 grams of salt.
</P>
<P>
INA said each individual child is entitled to a monthly ration
of 2.7 kilograms of powdered milk, 350 grams of detergents, and
250 grams of soap.
</P>
<P>
August will be the first time that the 20 million Iraqis can
obtain their food and cleaning ration in full since the
implementation of its "oil-for-food" deal with the U.N. last
December.
</P>
<P>
The deal permitted Iraq to sell 2 billion worth of oil in a
six-month period to buy food and medicine, six years after the
U.N. imposed an embargo on the country for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has time and again asked the U.N. to lift its sanctions
which had been firmly in place since its August 1990 invasion,
which sparked the Gulf War and led to its eventual defeat by the
allied forces headed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it repeatedly complained about the belated delivery
of food and medicine supplies and accused the U.S. of blocking the
approval of the contracts it signed with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. sanctions can only be lifted after an
inspectors' team certify that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations
to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that announcement of ration rise will
consequently lead to a drop in the free-wheeling prices of
foodstuffs in the domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> 11 People Injured in Violent Protest in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were injured here
today in a violent protest against an eight-year compulsory
educational reform package proposed by Turkish new coalition
government led by Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The protest was in reaction to the new educational reform
which bans some religious schools.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 demonstrators from across the country
gathered at the main Kizilay Square in the capital and some
Turkish policemen and journalists were wounded by stones thrown
by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The package, which also proposed to increase the current
five-year elementary education to eight years, has sparked
nationwide reaction.
</P>
<P>
The protesters arrived in Ankara at dawn paralyzing traffic of
the main roads in the capital. They marched from the Kizilay
Square at 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) to the Ulus Square where
they dispersed themselves at 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The educational reform package came as the Turkish military and
secularists have repeatedly complained about the rapid growth of
religious schools, a threat to the secularist system of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Former Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who has been
criticized and brought down for his pro-Islamic ideas, warned that
the ruling ANAP should bear the responsibility for the
consequences of the new educational model.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A charter bus carrying children

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Not Conducting Gun Purchaser Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Police officials in Arkansas of
the United States are still refusing to resume background checks
on gun purchasers, although the state attorney general has said
that it would be legal.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is one of the only two states in the country where
background checks are not being conducted.
</P>
<P>
Police Director John Bailey says the checks would open the
state to unwarranted and expensive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney General Winston Bryant told Bailey last week
that state law allows the checks and Bailey issued his relay
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas police stopped the checks after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that local agencies would not be forced to perform the
checks under the Brady Law, but they could conduct them
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The Brady Act is named after former Press Secretary James
Brady, who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan. It was passed in 1993 after bitter
congressional battles and was strongly opposed by the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
Bryant initially advised the state police that continuing the
checks could lead to lawsuits. But he changed his position under
pressure from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department says Arkansas and Ohio are the only
states not voluntarily conducting background checks. The Ohio
attorney general is leaving the responsibility for the checks with
the counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
Bailey has the support of Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.

<HEADLINE> Canada's 3 Provinces Among Top Polluters in N.America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Three Canadian provinces are among
the top 20 polluters in North America in 1994, according to a new
study released today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's province of Ontario ranked No.3 in the top 20 states
and provinces of all the Canadian provinces and U.S. states, while
Quebec and Alberta provinces rated 12th and 17th respectively.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. state of Texas ranked first, with the release or
transfer of 134.6 million kilograms of pollutants, according to
the study by NAFTA's Commission for Environmental Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, North American industries released or transferred 1.5
billion kilograms of pollutants, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the wastes were released on-site, either
through air emissions, water discharges, land disposal or
injection underground.
</P>
<P>
And the biggest sources of pollution came from the chemical,
paper, primary metal products industries.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Canada contributed 15 percent of North America's
pollution to water, air and land, while the United States was
responsible for 85 percent of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, admitted later to the NAFTA, had only a pilot tracking
system in place and was not included in the 1994 findings.

BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner Emma Bonino
will visit the most flooded areas in Poland and the Czech Republic
later this week, according to a European Commission (EC) press
release today.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the commissioner in charge of humanitarian affairs
followed two EC grants totalling 2.5 million ECU's (2.7 million
U.S. dollars). The aid is intended to provide the two countries
with food and clean drinking water as well as essential relief
supplies.
</P>

Successive heavy rains earlier this month caused the flooding
which submerged a total of 621,000 hectares of land in Poland, of
which a third is still under water.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people became homeless because of the flood, Polish
government spokesman Krzysztof Pomes said.
</P>
<P>
The EC has also decided to re-allocate an initial amount of 65
million ECU's (69.9 million dollars) from another program in Poland as
special assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the decision
by the Israeli government to suspend permit to build a new Jewish
settlement at Ras el Amud in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We approve the decision of the Israeli government to interrupt
the launching of the construction at Ras el Amud," said French
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said France wishes that the status quo of Jerusalem be
maintained "in anticipation of the negotiations predicted by the

<P>
The Israeli Interior Ministry suspended on Monday a permit
given by Israel's Jerusalem municipal authority last Thursday to

neighborhood of Ras el Amud.
</P>
<P>
The permit has aroused strong opposition and condemnation from
the Arab countries and the rest of the world.

This was the second time this year that Israel decided to build
houses in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided in March to build 6,500 apartments in Har Homa
in East Jerusalem, the sector the Palestinians claim as their
future capital. The decision, which was also widely condemned, has
put the Middle East peace process into an impasse.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
pushed harder on the United States as it released its 13th annual
report on barriers on trade and investment there.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page report expressed dissatisfaction with the progress
made from across the Atlantic Ocean trade while acknowledging the
improving market access achieved by the two sides in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Peter Guilford, spokesman for EU member of commission in charge
of external relations and relations with the World Trade
Organization (WTO), told a news briefing that EU remains concerned
at such stubborn obstacles as the "Buy America" provisions, the
excessive use of national security as an excuse to restrict
business, and difficulties facing non-U.S. companies investing in
the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
He also cited sub-federal procurement of telecommunications
equipment, the level of indirect government support to
U.S. aircraft manufacturers, complicated paperwork in customs and
tax procedures, textile and music industries as areas where
improvement could be made by big margins.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU intends to seek WTO consultation over the issue
of sub-federal procurement.
</P>
<P>
The annual report also lashed out at the Helms-Burton Law which
threatens to penalize foreign companies doing business with such
countries as Cuba, Iran and Libya, which are labelled as terrorist
countries.

<HEADLINE> Tung Welcomes Court Decision on HK Provisional Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today welcomed
the ruling of the Court of the Appeal, which confirms the legality
of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the court's decision. Today's ruling confirms that
the PLC is a legal body and laws passed by this council have legal
status and are legally binding," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the legality of the 60-member interim
legislature, founded in December 1996, arose from a criminal
conspiracy trial linked to a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
The three presiding judges of the Court of the Appeal today
unanimously declared that a local court had no power to rule on
the legality of the provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
In a statement afterwards, the Chief Executive said that the
litigation demonstrates the respect the society has towards the
rule of law, which is one of the important factors contributing to
Hong Kong's success.
</P>
<P>
"Various arguments could be presented and ruled in court. We're
pleased that the litigation has been resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the SAR government will work closely with the
PLC on various important public issues in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will continue to work until the first Legislative
Council is elected not later than June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, president of the PLC, today also welcomed the ruling
of the Court of the Appeal. She said: "The decision confirms our
belief that the PLC and its acts are within the bounds of the law;
they are both legitimate."

HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry's Commissioner in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) today announced arrangements
concerning the entry of Taiwan residents living overseas into Hong
Kong in response to press inquiries.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Office said that, according to Article 154
of the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government may apply immigration
controls on entry into or departure from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Immigration Department of the HKSAR Government
and Chinese embassies and consulates in foreign countries have
made the following arrangements for overseas Taiwan residents to
apply for entry into the Region:
</P>
<P>
If the applicants' stay in Hong Kong is no more than 48 hours,
they can submit their applications at Chinese embassies or
consulates in foreign countries. The Chinese embassies and
consulates can issue transit or entry permits for no more than 48
hours without referring the matter to the Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
If the applicants' stay exceeds 48 hours, the Chinese embassies
and consulates will pass the applications onto the Immigration
Department for examination and approval. The applicants can also
send their applications directly to the Immigration Department or
entrust a consultant in Hong Kong to submit the applications at
the Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there is actually no change between these
arrangements and those before July 1, therefore it is as
convenient as before in terms of procedures.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Authorized to Issue Entry Permits to Visitors From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Beginning on August 1, Xiamen Port
of east China's Fujian Province has been given the right to issue
entry permits to visitors entering the city from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This means that compatriots from Taiwan will no longer have to
get entry permits in advance from Chinese embassies in foreign
countries or organizations with similar permit-granting rights
stationed in Hong Kong via a Taiwan travel agency.
</P>
<P>
Neither will they have to, as they have in the past, obtain
other valid certificates of entry in an inland port if they want
to travel or do business on the mainland of China.
</P>
<P>
The permit given to a Taiwan compatriot upon entry in Xiamen
will be sent to other open ports of the mainland via computer, and
will allow the visitor to leave mainland areas from any open port.
</P>
<P>
The move will alleviate the difficulties associated with
applying for multiple entry and exit permits for businessmen from
Taiwan who want to start business in mainland areas and need to
travel back and forth.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, located opposite Taiwan, is one of the five major ports
that receive the most visitors from Taiwan. By the end of 1996,
Xiamen Port had handled 1.72 million visiting Taiwan compatriots,
accounting for one sixth of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities lifted their ban on allowing local
residents to visit or tour mainland areas of China in November of
1987.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has also become a major area for Taiwan-backed
businesses. So far it has approved the establishment of 1,375
Taiwan-funded enterprises which have brought in 2.899 billion
U.S. dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Taiwan and Xiamen had amounted to six
billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1996, making up six percent of
the mainland's total trade volume to Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Trade Soars in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The volume of inter-Korean trade has
soared to 145.4 million U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year, reported the South Korean National Unification Ministry
today.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between South Korea and Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) during the second quarter of this year
totaled 86.7 million dollars, a rise of 47.7 percent from the
previous quarter and 67.7 percent from the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the trade increase to the expansion of
its purchase of DPRK's goods including gold ingots, scrap iron and
zinc ingots.
</P>
<P>
South Korea purchased 58.7 million dollars worth of goods from
DPRK in the second quarter of this year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the purchase were iron, steel and other
metals, while 15.8 percent were textiles.
</P>
<P>
The processing-on-commission trade, in which DPRK processes
South Korea's raw material and resells them as end products to
South Korea, amounted to 21.6 million dollars during April-June
period, up 18.7 percent from the same quarter of last
year.

<HEADLINE> China To Build Up Powerful Defense, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Defense Minister today
reiterated that the country plans to build a powerful defense
sector in line with the theories of late Chinese leaders Mao
Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, as well as the relevant expositions of
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
General Chi Haotian, who is also vice-chairman of the Central
Military Commission, emphasized the strategy at today's meeting to
report on the current situation in the military, which was
sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee and four other departments.
</P>
<P>
Chi also stressed that the Chinese armed forces should be
substantially improved and follow a development road that reflects
China's unique characteristics, so as to strengthen its combat
effectiveness in the age of high technology.
</P>
<P>
China has made great achievements in building its defense
sector and army over the past decades, and the country's
sovereignty, unification, territorial integrity, marine
rights and interests and security have been defended, he told the
1,200-plus audience members.
</P>
<P>
The progress has provided a powerful security guarantee for the
current opening, reform and modernization drive and has played an
important role in enhancing the country's status in the
international arena and safeguarding its sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The present security environment is favorable for China, but
the country should further speed up its pace of defense
modernization as hegemonism and power politics still exist in the
world and the development of military technology throughout the
globe is also challenging the country's efforts to build a
stronger army, according to the general.

<HEADLINE> China To Build World's Longest Coal Transport Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 450 million US
dollars to build a 720-km-long pipeline for coal transport,
believed to be the longest one in the world, the overseas edition
of People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, to be 280 km longer than the existing world's
longest in the United States, is to carry clean coal from Shanxi,
a leading coal producing center in north China, to Qingdao, a port
city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
When completed in 2000, the pipeline will be able to transport
seven million tons of clean coal annually, thus alleviating the
presure on railway transport from Shanxi to other provinces, and
also eliminating the pollution caused by raw coal transport.
</P>
<P>
The coal turned out from the pipeline will mainly serve two
power plants, each of which has an installed capacity of 600,000
kw. Some coal will be exported to other countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Chief Calls for More Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of the Staff of
Israeli army Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, today called on the
government to earmark more funds for the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF), reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Shahak made the call when addressing the powerful Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee this
morning. He warned that the lack of money has hurt the IDF's
readiness for war.
</P>
<P>
The army chief claimed that the Syrians are preparing for the
option of launching an offensive. He also noted that Israel should
be concerned by Iran's efforts to develop a long-range surface-to-
surface missile.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in the Palestinian territories,
Shahak said that, contrary to an earlier assessment, there are
signs that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is interested
in renewing what he called massive terrorist attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sub-committee on the IDF's activities and
defense establishments has drawn up a report pointing to a
serious deterioration in IDF's preparedness for war.
</P>
<P>
The committee report observed that vehicles and ammunition are
outdated; military training has been cut by two thirds; and the
civil defenses against chemical warfare are grossly deficient.
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Ephraim Sneh of the Labor party, said
that he believes that it will take two to three years and an
additional budget of 430 million U.S. dollars to restore the
army's readiness to an appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai boycotted a
special cabinet session in protest against a cut of 59 million
dollars in military spending in the 1997 national budget.
</P>
<P>
He also openly criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for the cut in defense spending.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Relations Across Taiwan Straits Opens in Haikou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on the relations across
the Taiwan Straits, the sixth of its kind, opened this morning in
Danzhou, Hainan Province, with a full slate of talks planned to
cover issues that concern cross-straits exchanges in the period
after Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, more than 80 scholars from
China's mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and from Japan and
the United States will discuss in-depth matters related to future
agricultural exchanges, industrial cooperation and the development
of economic ties and trade across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1996, the Taiwan businessmen
invested a total contractual value of 35.02 billion U.S. dollars
in the mainland. Their actual investment amounted to 16.1 billion
U.S. dollars.

Last year, the volume of trade across the Taiwan Straits was
18.99 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wanxin, vice-president of the Taiwan Studies' Society,

Hong Kong and also provides a new opportunity for further
promotion of economic relations and trade across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the approaching 21st century offers a

<HEADLINE> Damascus Urged to Apologize for Vandalism in Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Damascus was urged today to
apologize for the vandalism in the last two soccer matches that
the Syrian team played within the framework of the Eighth Pan-Arab
Games in Beirut last week.
</P>
<P>
Syrian fans, as well as some Syrian soldiers, staged a
feverish celebration when their football team defeated the
Lebanese Thursday, but let out their angry when Syria was beaten
by Jordan with one to nil in the final three days later.
</P>
<P>
"An apology from the Syrian authorities for their fans'
behavior in Lebanon is the least that can be expected under these
circumstances," the Nahar Ash-Shabab weekly said.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the vandalism on the (Beirut) Sports City
installations and elsewhere," the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
"We also reject the firing of bullets in the air (by Syrian
soldiers) for a victory scored against Lebanon and we wish that
those bullets were fired against the Israeli enemy or were fired
for joy on the day our territories are liberated from Israeli
occupation," it added.
</P>
<P>
The largest-circulated daily An-Nahar also criticized Damascus
today for its indifference to the damages caused by the Syrian
fans to the Sports City.
</P>
<P>
When Jordanians scored the goal five minutes before the final
whistle in the final, angry Syrian fans broke the plastic chairs
and hurled water bottles on the players, disrupting the game for
some minutes.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates said the latest damage was twice as
extensive as the 2,000 chairs destroyed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian government did nothing to prevent the vandalism
that took place during and after the final match played against
Jordan on Sunday, and that targeted installations owned by the
Lebanese state, the host of the games," the conservative daily
noted.
</P>
<P>
It claimed "under these conditions, it is easy for a friendly
football match to degenerate into a confrontation that has
nothing to do with sports and has a lot to do with political
frustrations."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "while it is true that football matches do
not make or break political relations between two countries, it is
up to the central governments in both states to keep the lid on
their public's behavior."
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000-strong forces deployed on some two thirds
of Lebanon's land, is the most influential power broker in this
country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel to Open Additional Contact Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel decided here
today to open a direct channel between the two sides' foreign
ministers and foreign ministries, in addition to the normal
diplomatic channel, to keep bilateral dialogue open on all
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a meeting between Jordanian
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh and his visiting
Israeli counterpart David Levy, who arrived here this morning on
a brief official visit, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Further details of the additional channel for bilateral
contact have not been disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed the latest developments of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, particularly the means
necessary to reactivate the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy is scheduled to meet King Hussein of Jordan and Crown
Prince Hassan later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to local media reports, Levy came here
to persuade Jordan to establish a Jordanian-Palestinian united
kingdom with the Palestinian territories all included in the map
of the future united kingdom.
</P>

The Palestinians will surely resist such a proposal, but
Jordan's stance is still not clear yet, the reports said.

negotiations with the Palestinians would resume soon.

<HEADLINE> S. African Inflation Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
rate dropped to a nine-month low last month, despite an increase
in food prices, the Central Statistical Service (CSS) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a CSS survey, the consumer price index (CPI) for
June declined by 0.7 percent to 8.8 percent, the lowest level
since September last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure, with the monthly increase in the CPI registering
0.3 percent, was better than expected. Prior to the announcement,
most analysts forecast that the inflation in June would be over
nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Annualized food inflation jumped 1.1 percent in June to 12.8
percent, its highest level since May 1995 when its stood at 15.6
percent, while the monthly index increased by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase was attributed to higher indices for
grain products, meat, seafood, milk, eggs, oil, vegetables and
sugar.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase for non-food items was 0.2 percent
largely due to price increases for alcoholic and non-alcoholic
beverages, tobacco, clothing and footwear, the survey shows.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Palestinian Support for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll has showed a
further decline in Palestinian support for the peace process, it
was learned from JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted early this month by the JMCC also showed a
general decline in support for the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian
National Authority, President Yasser Arafat, and the Palestinian
Council.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of people rating Arafat's overall performance as
"good" dropped from 53.8 percent last May to 49.5 percent. In
effect this drop could be translated into a loss of more than
75,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
The trend was more evident in the Gaza Strip than in the West
Bank. Those who rated Arafat's performance as "good" in Gaza
dropped from 67.1 percent in May to 59.5 percent in July. In the
West Bank, there was a decline from 46 percent in May to 43.8
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The poll also indicated that the level of pessimism about the
future had increased by 3.3 percentage points since last May, from
22.4 percent to 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
When asked how their opinion has changed in comparison with
last year on the peace process and the Oslo Accords, 71
percent of the people surveyed said that their opinion of the
peace process worsened, while 65.2 percent said that their
opinion worsened on the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
There were also similar trends with regard to the Palestinian
Council, opposition groups, Palestinian factions of Fatah and
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
A random sample of 1,197 people over the age of 18 were
interviewed face-to-face throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
on July 3-4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The interviews were conducted in randomly selected homes, and
the subjects inside each home were also selected randomly. The
margin of error is 3 percent, with a confidence level of
95.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Set Up Private Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will set up its first private power generation facility, but
owners said the project was not part of the country's
privatization plans, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The private Dubai Investment Company which will own the
project has invited bids for the plant near the Jebel Ali free
zone, 40 kilometers south of Dubai city, the daily Khaleej Times
said.
</P>
<P>
"The plant will supply electricity to ensure users within our
company's industrial installations and other businesses. It has
nothing to do with privatization," the newspaper quoted the
company's general manager Khaled ibn Kalban as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plant, the first of its kind in the UAE, will have a
production capacity of 60 megawatt and the capacity is expected
to be doubled later. Costs could reach some 32.6 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supplies in the UAE are controlled by the
government, but the Gulf country is making plans to privatize
part of the sector.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals in HK Drop in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong
dropped by 14.1 percent to 789,000 in June, compared with some
919,000 in the year-ago month, according to figures released by
the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the first six months of this year still showed a
healthy growth of 5.2 percent, to 5.7 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan believes the fewer than
expected visitors stemmed principally from misconceptions about
the availability of hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
However, Chan said the growth in tourist arrivals from some
areas was encouraging. The number of visitors from the Americas
rose by 18.4 percent during the month, fueled by a healthy
domestic economic situation as well as the handover.
</P>
<P>
Similar reasons boosted arrivals from Taiwan by 27.4 percent,
and Arrivals from South and Southeast Asia also rose slightly
despite economic pressures on several countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the number of visitors in July was also likely to be
down on last year, but she noted the June-August period is
traditionally a low season for visitors.
</P>
<P>
"We can also look forward to the World Bank/IMF meetings in
September which will once again put the international spotlight on
Hong Kong," she said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Meetings See Greater Role in Region, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ended its series of meetings here
today after admitting Laos and Myanmar as its members and
conducting dialogues with major countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The meetings began with a senior officials meeting and an ASEAN
Standing Committee meeting on July 21 and 22 to make preparations
for the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), which was held on
July 24 and 25 with the participation of the nine ASEAN member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The AMM discussed a wide range of questions including
political, security and economic cooperation between member
countries and that with countries outside the region.
</P>
<P>
It recognized "the increasingly central of the ASEAN in the
maintenance of peace and stability in the region" and "underlined
their commitment to continue working closely together as well as
with the ASEAN dialogue partners and the ARF participants to
enhance peace and strengthen regional stability," the ministers
said in the joint communique after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to boost economic cooperation by speeding up
their efforts to set up the ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2003.
</P>
<P>
On regional and international issues, the ministers "had useful
exchange of view on current developments in the regional and
international situation." "The foreign ministers expressed
satisfaction over the increasing constructive exchanges and
cooperation among countries in Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
To enable it to exert greater influence in the region, the
ASEAN officially admitted Laos and Myanmar into the organization
on July 23, on the eve of the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting,
bringing nine of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia under the
ASEAN umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The move enabled the ASEAN to build "a community of Southeast
Asian nations strongly committed to consultation, consensus and
cooperation to create an environment of peace, stability and
prosperity," as pointed out by Abdullah Ahmed Badawi, chairman of
the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, in his statement at the
ceremony for the two countries' admission.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia, which is still outside the grouping because of the
current situation there, the ASEAN is playing its role in helping
restore political stability in the country and expects to admit it
as a member in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In a report on ASEAN economic cooperation, ASEAN
Secretary-General Ajit Singh noted that with the admission of Laos
and Myanmar, the grouping now has a combined population of 481.2
million people and a total gross domestic product of 632.5 billion
U.S. dollars and combined exports of about 339.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, although poor, mean more markets for goods
from other ASEAN members, which in turn could make use of their
natural resources by investing more there, creating common
economic prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
After the AMM, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and Post
Ministerial Meeting were held between July 27 and 29 for ASEAN
member countries to discuss political and security cooperation and
cooperation in other matters with its dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
Now, the ASEAN has as its dialogue partners Australia, Canada,
China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, the United
States and the European Union, which are all major players in the
world political and economic arenas and the two sides meet
annually to discuss questions affecting the region and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At the ARF, ministers from the ASEAN member and observer
countries and ASEAN dialogue partners recognized the diversity in
the region and "reiterated the importance of maintaining the
evolutionary approach adopted by the ARF process and of taking
decisions by consensus," according to a statement by the chairman
of the Fourth ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers agreed that a strong foundation has been laid in
dealing with future challenges facing the ARF," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the overall security environment in the
Asia Pacific region continues to improve; Notwithstanding the
existence of certain challenges, the area remains stable and
peaceful; And economic development has become the main focus of
all countries.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day PMC, the ASEAN conducted dialogue with its
dialogue partners first collectively and then individually with
each dialogue partner.
</P>
<P>
In his dialogue with the Chinese side today, Abdullah Badawi,
whose country is coordinator of the ASEAN's relations with China
this year, expressed satisfaction with the further development of
ASEAN dialogue relations with China and hoped that cooperation in
various fields between the two sides will further expand in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in
the dialogue that an expanded ASEAN will be more closely connected
with China while a returned Hong Kong will serve as a unique
bridge for deepening friendship and cooperation between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop of major historic significance, it is
doubtlessly of great importance for us to hold dialogues once
again and exchange views on how to further consolidate and develop
Sino-ASEAN ties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Chinese President Jiang Zemin is to
attend an informal ASEAN summit at the end of this year and will
meet with ASEAN leaders for the first time.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the meeting "will afford leaders
of the two sides a good opportunity to exchange views on the
long-term development of their ties and that the good-neighborly
relations between the two sides will develop further."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed higher today after metal prices rose overnight, however the

<HEADLINE> Oil Exploration Deal Signed Between Canandian, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Candian firm has signed a deal
worth 30 million U.S. Dollars with the National Oil Corporation
of Kenya (NOCK) to explore oil and gas fields in the eastern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the first to be signed in Kenya's oil and gas
industry in 10 years, Energy Minister Joseph M'Mukindia was
quoted by today's East African Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
Joseph M'Mukindia said the two countries signed two agreements
which cover one in the Lamu basin close to the Tanzanian border
and the other in the Mandera basin close to the Kenyan-Ethiopian
border and both the two agreements are in a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian firm, named Tornado Resources Ltd., "has
committed themselves to spend about 30 million Dollars within
those three years which means about 15 million Dollars per
basin," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary-based firm is to drill at least three wells in
each basin in addition to seismic surveys and most of the wells
will be wild cat wells, the Kenyan minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very hopeful that we are going to discover commercial
quantities of oil or gas and we are very, very excited about this
development because for the last 10 years very little exploration
has been carried out in this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Should commercial finds of oil or gas be discovered, the
Kenyan government and Tornado Resources Ltd. would share revenues
once the Canadians recovered their costs of the exploration,
according to contract documents.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 wells have so far been drilled in Kenya where
exploration efforts have almost stopped since 1992 when Amoco
Kenya Petroleum Company and Shell Exploration BV, who were active
then, decided not to renew exploration contracts.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Leaves for Damascus on Lightning Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left today for Damascus on a lightning visit to Syria where
he will discuss the Mideast peace developments with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is accompanied by a high-caliber delegation including
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and
ministers of electricity, information and oil, as well as Mubarak's
political advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
Moussa got a message from his Syrian counterpart Farouq
al-Shara on the latest developments on the Mideast peace process
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The surprise visit came a day after a breakthrough in the peace
process seems to be shaping up as Israel agreed Monday to resume
talks with the Palestinian National Authority on meeting
commitments made under their interim peace deals.
</P>
<P>
However, another setback came to the Syria-Israeli track when
the Israeli Knesset (parliament) adopted a bill last week,
blocking any future withdrawal from the Golan Heights Israel
seized in 1967 and annexed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The PNA-Israeli peace negotiations have deadlocked since March
while talks with Syria and Lebanon came to a standstill since
February 1996. Damascus refused to return to the negotiating table
unless Israel proclaims readiness to hand back the strategic land.
</P>
<P>
In a message conveyed indirectly to Syria, Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy said Monday that Israel is ready to start
negotiations with Syria without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Levy stressed that the Golan Heights bill was not an government
initiative and warned that it would make Israeli concessions on
the Golan Heights in peace talks with Damascus more difficult, if
not impossible.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior EU source, European Mideast peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos will take with him a new Israeli idea to renew
peace talks with Syria when he meets with al-Assad in Damascus
today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly made an
oral promise on a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights but
the rightwing Likud-led government declared that it would only
honor written agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has issued
precautionary security measures for its visiting staff and those
working in Kenya in the face of recent political disturbances,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
All visiting U.N. staff will be required to obtain clearance
from the designated official in Kenya "so that in the event of a
problem the U.N. Kenya Security Management Team (SMT) will be in
a position to help the staff," said a U.N. statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement issued by the U.N. Information
Center here Monday, the U.N. headquarters in New York has
declared a Precautionary Phase Plan for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"This follows the recommendations of the U.N. Kenya SMT,
which, in the light of the recent political disturbances, felt
that this was the most prudent course of action to ensure the
continuing safety of U.N. staff in Kenya," said Tore Brevik, the
director of the U.N. Information Center.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is not the intention to stop U.N. staff coming
to Kenya for essential missions, including holding of meetings
in Nairobi," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact of the declaration will be "small" for
staff in Nairobi and the SMT will continue to review security
arrangements that are in place.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 13 people were killed during riots sparked by the
disruption of rallies demanding constitutional reforms across
the eastern African country.

ADDIS ABABA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Olympic 10,000
meters champion Haile Gebreselassie Tuesday said he had decided to
compete in the World Athletics Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie said: "In Athens I carry the national banner,
represent my country and lead the Ethiopian team. So despite the
difficult track situation I am likely to face I have decided to
participate."
</P>
<P>
He added that "I am in top form and well prepared."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gebreselassie said he was pulling out of the
world championships because the Athens track was too hard for
long-distance runners.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian national athletic coach Wolde Meskel Kostire said
Ethiopia's Athletics Federation had received assurances from the
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) that the track at
Athens would be improved for the championships, which open on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie set a world record in the 10,000 meters at Oslo's
Bislett stadium earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Denies Claims of Rwandese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan police today denied
claims that the ongoing swoop on illegal aliens in Nairobi is
aimed at Rwandese nationals to be repatriated to Tanzania to face
genocide trials, local newspaper Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent nobody to Tanzania, and not to any other
country. These are mere speculations aimed at politicizing the
operation thant was only intended to arrest illegal immigrants in
the country," said Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police
Dismus Onyiego.
</P>
<P>
All those arrested during the two-week operation were being
held in Kenlyan police custodies, said Dismus Onyiego, who is
also the Nairobi Deputy Provincial police Officer.
</P>
<P>
According to Onyiego, the operation had so far netted 600
aliens across the country, the majority of whom were nabbed in
the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Police intelligence network had proved that the aliens were
actively involved in various crimes ranging from robberies, house
break-ins to non-violent car thefts, said the police boss.
</P>
<P>
The police were still consulting with the Immigration
Department officials on how to deport the illegal aliens back to
their respective countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The police crackdown on illegal immigrants in Kenya began
about two weeks ago with a number of politicians relating the
operation to Rwandese Vice-President Paul Kagame's recent visit
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Rumors had it that the operation was intended to nab Rwandese
Hutus and Tutsis alleged to have perpetrated the genocide that
rocked the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent speculative reports claimed that the Rwandese
arrested had already been sent to Arusha, Tanzania to face trial
before a United Nations Rwanda genocide tribunal.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today that he was cautiously optimistic about peace prospects
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It is sensible to be cautious but we have a ceasefire in place
which is good although we are not dewy-eyed about it," Blair told
The Mirror in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"That (the ceasefire), at least, is proof that there is some
serious intent and desire by Sinn Fein to pursue the democratic
path," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has been fighting
against the British rule of Northern Ireland, declared a ceasefire
which took effect on July 20 so that Sinn Fein could be allowed to
take part in the all-party peace talks on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Blair praised the pro-British Protestant Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) for not walking out of multi-party peace talks
although UUP voted against the government plans demanding all
guerrilla groups to surrender arms during the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Ireland desperately want a lasting political
settlement and it is possible to have it because everyone knows
what we need in Ulster," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Malawi Sign Memorandum on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- After two years of negotiations,
Zambia and Malawi finally signed a memorandum here on Monday to
improve bilateral trade, Zambia daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum is aimed at harmonizing the standards and
quality of the products between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, David Mesa, senior standards officer
of the Zambia Bureau of Standards (ZABS), said that
standardization plays a very important role in the international
trade and, if properly handled, it could improve trading by
reducing technical barriers.
</P>
<P>
Standardization does not mean restriction of trade, Mesa said,
stressing that its promotion would safeguard the health and
safety of consumers by ensuring that only goods of acceptable
quality are traded.
</P>
<P>
Austin Khulumula, director general of Malawian Bureau of
Standards (MBS), described the memorandum as a milestone in
improving trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, the memorandum, fruitful as it is, is not the end in
itself, but a means to achieving standards and quality assurance
which will benefit industries and assist in the exchange of goods
and services.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gold Industry Promising, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold mining
industry, facing low bullion prices and high costs, is in a phase
of "electrifying renewal", said a local industrialist.
</P>
<P>
Local daily, the Citizen, today quoted Tom Main, Chief Executive
of Chamber of Mines, as saying at a mining conference Monday
that there was no reason to believe that failure would be the
likely outcome in the South African mining industry.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than being on the brink of summoning the
pallbearers, the industry is in a phase of electrifying renewal,
Main said.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of mining houses, a landmark productivity
agreement with the powerful National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)
and substantial capital investment projects which will open up
millions of ounces of ore, all contributed to the renewal of the
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold was last trading around 325 U.S. dollars an ounce, some
66 Dollars below last year's average price after reaching a
12-year low of 314 U.S. dollars earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
To meet difficulties resulted from the gold slump, South
Africa's Chamber of Mines and NUM agreed in mid-July to increase
annual gold production by 90 tons countrywide, while mine workers
are to be better paid.
</P>
<P>
Some capital development ventures,
valued at an aggregate of 30 billion Rands (666 million U.S.
dollars), are already underway, Main said.
</P>
<P>
Projects are now under consideration with the prospect of a
gold reserve of 60 million ounces for a projected life of about
65 years and an estimated ore reserve of about 50 million at a
grade of 12 grams per ton.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of ultra-deep mining is also exciting, with Ango
American, a mining giant in South Africa, considering to mine up
to 5,000 meters underground, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's gold output is on steady decline from around
620 metric tons in 1993 to 495 tons last year, despite the fact
that miners have to dig deeper at ever-increasing costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China

</P>
<P>
President Lei Zuhua informed directors attending today's board
meeting that the bank approved 4.82 billion yuan (US$580 million)
and US$13.48 million in export seller's credits for 58 projects,

</P>
<P>
The bank signed five agreements calling it to relend 280
million yuan in preferential Chinese Government loans to overseas
borrowers, with the total value of approved relending loans for 15
projects in 10 developing countries standing at 1.142 billion.
</P>
<P>
EximBank also agreed to relend US$1.5 billion in committed
loans from foreign governments to 48 Chinese projects.
</P>
<P>
"Simply stated, we experienced considerable growth in the first
half of this year," said Lei.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Tong Zhiguang noted that EximBank will continue
to support the development of medium to large state-owned
enterprises by offering funding needed to increase exports of
high-tech and high value-added sets of equipment, vessels,
aircraft, machinery and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Tong pledged that EximBank will use a combination of export
credits and preferential loans to help Chinese enterprises tap
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
EximBank, founded in April 1994, is one of China's three
policy-oriented banks responsible for financing exports of Chinese
capital goods such as machinery, electronic products and complete
sets of equipment.

<HEADLINE> Nepali FM on Foreign Ties, Policy Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Kamal
Thapa has said there is a need to examine his country's relations
with India and China with "redefined meaningful perspectives," the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thapa told an interaction program at the foreign ministry on
Monday that India's attitude towards its neighbors including Nepal
has substantially changed and Nepal should make maximum use of
"the trust and good will" through appropriate diplomatic
overtures.
</P>
<P>
Thapa, who took over the foreign ministry one month and a half
ago, told the scholars and experts that India has agreed to
discuss the much-debated Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed by
Nepal and India in 1950.
The minister called for efforts to make the bilateral dialogue on
the treaty more succinct and fruitful, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Nepal's ties with China, the minister stressed the need to
inject new dynamics and derive benefit from the tremendous
opportunities available to China.
</P>
<P>
"China is making rapid advancement in all sectors and we should
be able to provide new and productive meaning to the traditional
friendly relations with China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said the economic diplomacy is also top on the agenda of
the ministry, which is studying on how to make it more effective
and responsive to the country's needs.
</P>
<P>
But the number-one priority is to enhance the institutional
capability of the foreign ministry itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other priorities of the foreign ministry include the lingering
refugee problem besetting the country for more than six years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now
live in eastern Nepal in eight camps after being forced to flee
their homes in 1989 and the early 1990s.

PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia Tuesday
reconfirmed its welcome to an ASEAN role in restoring stability in
the country, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The reconfirmation was made by Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung
Huot on behalf of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in a letter
addressed to Badawi, chairman of the 30th Ministerial Meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot had invited an ASEAN delegation comprising the foreign
ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand to visit
Cambodia on a convenient date, "if possible this week," Badawi
told reporters at a news conference after the ASEAN Post
Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said at the news
conference that he would go back to Jakarta to report to his
president and then consult with his Thai and Philippine
counterparts before leaving for Phnom Penh as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The three ASEAN ministers' mission to seek a peaceful solution
to the recent Cambodian crisis was earlier rejected by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was originally scheduled to join the ASEAN together
with Laos and Myanmar this month, but its entry was deferred
following the factional fighting between forces of Co-Prime
Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen in early July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress, White House Agree on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressional Republicans
and Clinton administration officials reached a tentative agreement
this evening on a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002 and
a tax cut by about 140 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, there would be a 400-dollar-per-child tax
credit in 1998 for children aged 16 and under and the credit will
rise to 500 dollars in 1999. It would apply to families that earn
less than 18,000 dollars a year and owe little or no income tax.
</P>
<P>
The package was on track to include 35 billion dollars or more
in education tax breaks, a key component demanded by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
After years of trying, Republicans in Congress finally won a
reduction in the rates of capital-gains tax which are paid on
profits from sales of land and other investments. The top rate
would go from 28 to 20 percent, middle-income rates from 15 to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans were also winning an increase in the estate-tax
exemption.
</P>
<P>
In a break for most homeowners, there would be no capital-gains
tax on home sales below a profit of 500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
To help pay for all this, bargainers of both sides were near an
agreement that the cigarette tax would rise a dime in the year
2000 and another nickel in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Today's accord was a follow up to the balanced-budget agreement
reached by the Clinton administration and the Congress in May
under which the U.S. government would have to diminish all the
government deficit by the year 2002 and cut tax by a net 85
billion dollars within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the savings, about 140 billion dollars in five years,
came from Medicare, whose growth would be trimmed by 115 billion,
or about 12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption Authority to Be Formed in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A bill is being drafted in Kenyan
parliament on the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Authority
to investigate high-level corruption by politicians, Kenya's
Attorney-General Amos Wako has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Amos Wako said on Monday that the bill will be tabled in
parliament soon to cater for the repeal or amendment of various
laws for the proposed constitutional reforms, according to a
Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
Details of the authority's composition and appointments have
to be discussed with the government, said Wako.
</P>
<P>
The body, to be headed by a director who may have the status
of a high court judge, will be "Africa's toughest anti-graft"
body, according to a report of the London-based Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a response to the unprecedented call from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week to the Kenyan
government to demonstrate by the end of July that it takes
tougher action against corruption, said the Daily Nation report.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave Kenya a three-year loan package worth a total of
220 million U.S. Dollars in April last year, but regular payments
were made on condition that Kenya's promises on reform and some
other issues were fulfiled.

An IMF team visited the eastern African country two weeks ago
to inspect the allocation of two controversial power contracts,
which have been implemented since the beginning of this year, as
well as the overall management of the country's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF officials "have made it clear to the Kenyan
government" that failure to address concerns about the contracts
and corruption could still prompt suspension of the loan, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Admits Adjusting Greater Israel Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has admitted that he has to adjust his dream for
building a Greater Israel because of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
In a frank interview with Israeli television Monday night,
Netanyahu said the Oslo accords that he inherited has forced him
to relinquish part of his dream for Greater Israel, although this
was not easy.
</P>
<P>
He said he is willing to reach a final settlement with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), but he stressed that his
goal is to preserve what he called the essence for
Israel: retaining control over Jerusalem, Jewish holy places,
Jordan Valley and major Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's statements agree with the plan for the
final-status talks floated by his office in the past weeks, in
which he envisioned building a Greater Jerusalem, retaining
control over most settlements, strategic roads and water
resources in the Palestinian territories to ensure Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, called "Allon-Plus Plan" as it was the
enlarged version of that put forward by late Foreign Minister Amir
Allon after the 1967 War, Israel will control over 60 percent of
the territories in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNA wishes to gain back over 90 percent of the
occupied territories, on which it wants to establish an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks, which Israeli previous Labor government
started with the PNA in May last year, have been frozen since
Netanyahu came to power one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently proposing acceleration of the
final-status talks in hopes to skip the difficult second and
third phase of Israeli troop redeployments in the West Bank
stipulated by the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also hopes to reach a final settlement when Israel
has yet carried out all the redeployments from the West Bank,
which could be used as important bargain chips in conducting
negotiations with the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Leader Calls for Strengthened Unity of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zoran Lilic, a senior Serbian
political leader, today reiterated the need to strengthen the
stability and unity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
This is "the only choice" of the peoples of Serbia and
Montenegro, the two remaining members of Yugoslavia, said Lilic,
vice chairman of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and former
Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
Lilic, who was heading an SPS delegation on a one-day visit to
the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica, made the remarks after
meeting Momir Bulatovic, Montenegrin president and chairman of the
Democratic Party of Socialists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two ruling parties have reached consensus on
their cooperation toward that end.
</P>
<P>
The SPS and Serbia will pursue a policy of building a strong
and stable Serbia, helping maintain the stability of Montenegro
and strengthening economic relations between the two republics,
Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia now comprises only Serbia and Montenegro after
Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina broke away
from it in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Democratization, Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba said here Monday that democratisation, good
governance and economic development were the remedy to internal
strife in African countries.
</P>
<P>
"We Africans must develop a political culture to accept that
changes of governments are normal and necessary for our countries
to grow," he said at a state banquet given by President Benjamin
Mkapa at the state house.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president who is on a three-day visit to Tanzania,
said politicians must accept the verdict of the electorate even
when the results were not in their favour.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba praised the peaceful change of top leadership in
Tanzania, saying "Tanzania has done Africa a great pride in
showing change of leadership."
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president called for the reactivation of the
Zambia-Tanzania joint permanent commission for cooperation
to promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"Although ad hoc arrangements have enable us to conduct our
bilateral cooperation fairly well, these arrangements cannot
substitute for the joint commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the banquet, President Mkapa reaffirmed his
government's commitment to improving the operations, performance
and profitability of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority
(TAZARA) and the TAZAMA pipeline, which, he said, were pillars of
economic cooperations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that economic integration between African
countries was the best way of containing persistent threat of
African continent being marginalised in the emerging
international economic and trade regime.

<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's armed forces have
established close ties with over 100 foreign armies and are
actively engaged in different forms, fields and levels of
cooperation with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army (PLA), founded in 1927, has played
an active role in establishing external links since the
beginning of China's reforms and opening-up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 Chinese military delegations have visited 80
countries during the period. China has in turn hosted over 1,900
foreign military delegations, including more than 1,100
delegations led by defense ministers, commanders-in-chief or
chiefs of general staff.
</P>
<P>
Chinese naval fleets have visited nearly 20 countries since
since the early 1990s. The first Chinese naval fleet to visit the
US mainland completed its March tour with visits to Mexico, Chile
and Peru, with another fleet visiting Thailand, the Philippines
and Malaysia in May. Both naval tours attracted widespread
international attention and touched off warm reaction.
</P>
<P>
China has opened military attache offices in more than 90
overseas embassies, 1.3 times the figure in the pre-1978 period,
with 60-odd countries opening similar offices in their China
embassies.
</P>
<P>
Branches of the PLA have actively participated in professional
and technical exchanges with foreign counterparts. Over 140
related delegations visited foreign countries in 1996, with China
hosting 1,000 foreign military experts and scholars during the
year.
</P>
<P>
Recipient developing countries have expressed sincere gratitude
for staff training and equipment the PLA has provided in the fields
of sports, culture and medical care.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's foreign ties not only have increased cooperation with
foreign armies and improved the external conditions for China's
economic construction, but have also contributed to ensuring
peace, stability and regional development throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese engineering detachments and military observers have
received international praise for their participation in UN
peace-keeping missions since 1989, with various units serving in
the Middle East, Cambodia, Mozambique and a number of other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Monumental achievements in military diplomacy have demonstrated
that the PLA is a highly disciplined peace-loving force which
sincerely serves China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's foreign relations also highlight the fact that China
has played a major role in maintaining peace and stability in
regions throughout the world. The actions of the Chinese armed
forces also emphasize the groundlessness of the so-called "China
threat" a small group of people with ulterior motives have spread
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Knows of Controversial Housing Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu knew in advance of the controversial housing project in
East Jerusalem's Ras Amud Arab neighborhood, Israeli television
Channel 2 reported Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The report contradicted Netanyahu's claim that he had heard
about the Jerusalem municipality's decision to allow the
construction only near midnight last Thursday from the press.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman reiterated that the prime minister had
known nothing about the plan till late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 revealed that Interior Minister Eli Suissa had raised
the issue at a cabinet meeting, but Netanyahu chose to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
In his response to the report, Suissa confirmed that he had
raised various problems connected with settling policy in his
ministry, including the situation in Jerusalem and the building
plan for Ras Amud.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the opposition Labor Party's lawmaker Dalia Itzik
claimed she had solid information from sources in Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert's office that Netanyahu had known about and approved
of the building permits.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is playing a double game. He knew about the
building permits and is denying it. He preferred to let the
report be published so that he could pretend to be against it,"
Itzik charged.
</P>
<P>
The Ras Amud housing project has aroused strong protests from
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the whole Arab world,
who sternly warns that implementation of the plan would kill the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu publicly promised to suspend the project, citing it
was not wise to carry out the plan at this time when the
Israeli-Palestinian tension was running high.
</P>
<P>
By playing the role of "good cop" with Olmert as the "bad cop,"
Netanyahu apparently tried to divert the world's attention from
the Har Homa settlement, which has stalled the peace process for
over four months.
</P>
<P>
Following Israel's promise to block the Ras Amud project and
to proceed with talks on various unresolved issues, the PNA agreed
Monday to resume negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and PNA Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath announced that the
nine joint committees would reconvene this week to discuss the
issues on opening "safe passages" between West Bank and Gaza
Strip, building the Gaza airport and seaport, and releasing
Palestinian prisoners.

<HEADLINE> S.African Govt to Impose Tourism Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
was considering imposing a tourism levy of up to 15 U.S Dollars
on people leaving the country on international flights, the South
African Tourism Board (SATOUR) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
SATOUR's interim executive director Michael Farr said in
Pretoria that the proposed scheme would add about 60 million Rand
(about 13 million U.S Dollar) to SATOUR's annual budget, a local
daily The Citizen said today.
</P>
<P>
Half of the proposed levy would be allocated to SATOUR, about
a third to provincial budgets, and the rest to tourism-related
development projects throughout the country, Farr said.
</P>
<P>
He said the existing system of using tourism establishments
subscribing to SATOUR's grading system to collect bed levies was
not a success, citing some hotel groups had indicated their
intention to withdraw from the system.
</P>
<P>
SATOUR's present budget of 102 million Rand (about 22 million
U.S Dollar), compared with Australia's 88 million U.S Dollar
budget, was insufficient to market South Africa as a tourist
destination, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Unemployment Rate at Three-Year Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment stood at
7.7 percent in May, the highest figure since the first quarter
of 1994, reported the pro-government newspaper The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The jobless figure has been rising since this year, with 7.6
percent in April, 7.5 percent in March and an average of 7.3
percent for the first quarter, the paper quoted an announcement
by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) as saying
</P>
<P>
The latest figure suggests unemployment is rapidly approaching
the 180,000 mark, a rise of some 40,000 over the last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest CBS statistics indicate that unemployment is
possibly rising at a faster rate than Treasury economists
thought when they compiled a report earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The report, which is on circulation among senior officials,
suggests that unemployment will reach 7.7 percent this year, 7.9
percent by December 1998 and between 6.8 percent and 11.4
percent in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury, while forecasting rising unemployment, also
predicts a decline in population growth, one of the main factors
being an anticipated decline in the number of new immigrants,
particularly from the former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
While the population grew in 1996 by 2.6 percent, the
prediction is for a 2.3 percent rise this year, 2.2 percent in
1998 and 2.1 percent in the following two years. Similarly while
immigration reached 71,000 last year, between now and 2000 the
annual inflow is projected to slow to 60,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- An Italian Commission is expected
to arrive in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, today to start
its probing into the torture of Somalian civilians during 1993
and 1994 by the Italian peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
An Agence France Presse report said on Monday that at least 12
Somalis are scheduled to fly to Addis Ababa today to be
interviewed by the commission at the Bole International Airport
before returning home later today.
</P>
<P>
Among those to appear before the commission would be Abdi
Hassan Adow, then a translator for the Italian contingent in
Somalia, who accused an Italian official of raping and killing a
13-year-old Somali boy on March 6, 1994, the Doctor Ismail Center
for Human Rights said last week in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ettore Gallo, chairman of the commission told an Italian
magazine earlier this month that the inquiry had confirmed that
torture had taker place.
</P>
<P>
The commission had previously planed to sit in Nairobi, but
Kenyan authorities withheld permissions, according to the Italian
foreign ministry.

WELLINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
continued its bull run today, pushing the key market indicator to
a new record high.
</P>
<P>
The NZSE40 index soared 28 points to end at 2570 with a
turnover of 76 million NZ dollars (48 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Driving the rises was the weaker kiwi dollar, which will boost
exports and returns for companies with overseas earnings. But
higher interest rates had little effect on the shares as Telecom
shares led the gains, up 11 cents to 796 cents.
</P>
<P>
Most other leaders also closed higher. Fletcher Building rose
11 cents to 488 cents and Fletcher Energy surged 19 cents to 526
cents. Air New Zealand, Brierley Investment and Carter Holt
Harvey each picked up 1 cent to 311 cents, 138 cents and 379 cents
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lion Nathan remained unchanged at 390 cents.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asks Police to Prepare for Protracted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat told Palestinian police in Hebron Monday night to prepare
for a long battle with Israel, the state-run Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to police officials in the West Bank town about the
local situation, Arafat asked them to be more forceful.
</P>
<P>
He said a long battle could be expected between Palestine and
Israel, and they should get ready for it.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Hebron Monday afternoon as part of his
10-day inspection tour of the Palestinian self-rule cities in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Arafat met with some of the city's prominent
figures in the headquarters of the Graduates' League. He discussed
with them the deteriorating economic situation in Hebron due to
the repeated closure of Palestinian stores ordered by Israel
following the recent protest campaign.
</P>
<P>
As Arafat visited the city, Israel ordered the closure of
Palestinian stores in Hebron's Shallalah Street Monday and barred
Israelis from entering the Palestinian self-rule H1 area, which
covers 80 percent of the divided city, for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The latest store closures were enforced after four pipe bombs
were thrown at Israeli troops -- three on Sunday night and one on
Saturday night. No one was injured in the explosion. Israeli
security forces detained 20 Palestinians for questioning on Sunday
night in their search for the bomb-throwers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities had agreed to allow the
stores in the Shallalah Street area to reopen two weeks ago after
some 200 Palestinian police were deployed in the area to maintain
order.
</P>
<P>
The area was the scene of intensive clashes between
Palestinian rock-throwers and heavily armed Israeli soldiers after
an Israeli woman posted leaflets on store fronts in June depicting
the Prophet Muhammad as a pig.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Leaks Makeup of New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Permanent Representative
at the United Nations Kamal Kharrazi will be the next foreign
minister of the new government headed by Mohammad Khatami who
will be sworn in as president on August 4, local press revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Iran News reported that Kharrazi has
already come back from New York to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Born in Tehran in 1944, Kharrazi started his career in the
Foreign Ministry after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He was
deputy foreign minister for political affairs and acting foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Kharrazi also headed the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) before his appointment as the
permanent representative of Iran at the United Nations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq, he was head of
the War Information Headquarters. He played an important role in
persuading former U.N. secretary-general Peres De Cuellar to
condemn Iraq as the aggressor in the war.
</P>
<P>
He also played a key role in resuming Iran's diplomatic ties
with a number of countries, such as Jordan and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Current Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who had openly
voiced his support for Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
the main rival of Khatami during the presidential elections in
May, refused the offer of health minister in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Velayati will become the director of
Masihe Daneshvari Hospital in northern Tehran after president-
elect Khatami takes over the government and will continue to
teach at Iranian universities.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran Daily reported that Khatami has chosen a nine-
member committee of advisors to inspect lists of recommended
ministers from various sources.
</P>
<P>
The report disclosed that Moussavi Khoeiniha will head the
Information Ministry, Admiral Ali Shamkhani will be the defense
minister, Behzad Nabavi will take over Oil Ministry, Abdolvahed
Mousavi Lari for the Ministry of Culture, and Mohammad Farhadi for
the Ministry of Education.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Water Leaks from N-reactor in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's only nuclear research
reactor near its capital Dhaka has been shut down following
leakage of radioactive water since July 17, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The leakage was detected in the cooling water tank during a
routine inspection on July 17. The tank is laden with about 8,600
gallons of waste water that had drained from the reactor over the
time.
</P>
<P>
M.A. Quaiyum, chairman of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy
Commission (BAEC), said that the situation was under control and
necessary safety measures were taken to avoid any hazard to the
personnel in the reactor site and the public in the neighboring
area.
</P>
<P>
He said that the BAEC had measured the radioactivity of the
water at the cooling tank and the level is much below the level
prescribed by the International Commission for Nuclear Protection.
</P>
<P>
The BAEC has been collecting the leaked water in jerry cans so
that the waste water does not seep into the ground, the chairman
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an inquiry committee has been formed to identify the
cause of the leakage and the extent of damage.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the accident was the outcome of long
neglect of the authorities concerned in the operation and
maintenance of the three-megawatt capacity research reactor,
saying that the cooling tank did not have a cover for a long time.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major nuclear hazard in Bangladesh since the
installation in 1986 of the research reactor, TRIGA Mark II.
Earlier in one accident a systems valve of the reactor had burst.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, located at Savar, 25 miles off the capital city,
was installed with technical assistance from the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
It is used for the purpose of research, manpower training for
future need and production of radioactive isotopes for use in
agriculture, medicine and industry.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Satisfied over Dialogue Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today expressed its satisfaction
with the further development of its dialogue ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"We note with satisfaction the further development of our
dialogue relations," Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, foreign minister of
Malaysia and coordinator of the ASEAN's dialogue with China this
year, said this morning in his opening remarks in the dialogue,
which was co-chaired by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi extended the ASEAN's congratulations on
the "historic return" of Hong Kong to China on July 1 after more
than 150 years of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, he said trade and economic relations
between the two sides have been expanding with an increase in the
exchange of delegations and steady increase in the flow of goods
and capital.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development Program is another area
open for ASEAN-China collaboration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged China to take further measures to facilitate greater
participation by ASEAN industrialists and investors in its
development programs, saying the ASEAN also would like to
encourage increased participation of Chinese investors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that some "sensitive" issues between the two
sides can be addressed "in an increasingly substantive manner"
with the development of the dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN looks forward to the convening of its second
informal summit scheduled to be held in Malaysia in December,
which he described as "a good opportunity for our leaders to
exchange views on regional and international questions as well as
on challenges confronting our region in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
China, which became a full ASEAN dialogue partner last year, is
one of the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners which also include
Australia, Canada, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea,
the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The nine ASEAN member countries in the past two days conducted
dialogues with its dialogue partners at the ASEAN Post Ministerial
Conference, as the dialogue forum is known, first collectively in
a plenary session yesterday morning and then in separate dialogues
with each dialogue partner yesterday afternoon and this morning.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Boost Ties With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China today
expressed satisfaction for the progress made in its relations with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the past
year and pledged to further boost its ties with the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
"Much to our satisfaction, new progress has been made in the
friendly relations between China and the ASEAN over the past
year," Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
in a statement in dialogue with ASEAN countries here this morning.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the year 1997 is special for both the ASEAN and
China as the ASEAN has admitted Laos and Myanmar as its members,
thus moving closer to its goal of including all the 10 Southeast
Asian countries in its membership, while China has, in accordance
with the strategic concept of "one country, two systems," smoothly
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"An expanded ASEAN will be more closely connected with China
while a returned Hong Kong will serve as a unique bridge for
deepening friendship and cooperation between China and the ASEAN,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the 30-year-old regional grouping for its "unique
influence in the region and a major force for peace and
development in the world," Qian said, "We highly appreciate the
unremitting efforts and achievements made by the ASEAN and support
a greater role by an expanded ASEAN in regional and international
affairs."
</P>
<P>
He noted that as developing countries, both China and the ASEAN
members share broad common interests and consensus in a number of
areas.
</P>
<P>
The areas include the importance both attach to regional and
global peace and the commitment to national stability and economic
growth, observance of the principle of non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, their readiness for increasing dialogue
and peaceful settlement of disputes and commitment to safeguarding
the rights and interests of developing countries and to promoting
mutually beneficial regional and global cooperation on an equal
footing.
</P>
<P>
"As we share consensus in these aspects, we are looking forward
to working with the ASEAN for the establishment of a
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented toward the
21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian urged the two sides to strive for "an all-round and
in-depth development" of their ties, push forward their
cooperation in various fields on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, properly handle the issues existing between them through
friendly consultations and coordinate with and support each other
in safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the two sides increase exchange of high-level
visits and dialogues for increased mutual confidence and
cooperation and bring into full play the opportunities created by
the ASEAN's enlargement and Hong Kong's return to China to boost
cooperation in economy and trade, science and technology, banking,
business and industries.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more personnel exchanges, enhanced
coordination and cooperation in subregional projects such as the
development of the Mekong River Basin and the Trans-Asia Railway
network and promotion of coordination and mutual support in other
regional and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Qian announced that Chinese President Jiang Zemin will meet
with ASEAN leaders for the first time at the end of this year at
an informal ASEAN summit, also to be attended by leaders of China,
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Calling the summit an event of "far-reaching significance," he
said it "will afford leaders of the two sides a good opportunity
to exchange views on the long-term development of their ties."
</P>
<P>
China became the ASEAN's full dialogue partner last year and is
participating in the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC), the
forum of the dialogue, here together with the other nine dialogue
partners -- Australia, Canada, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia,
South Korea, the United States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Indian Oil Firm Gives More Autonomy to Field Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 29 (Xinhua)-- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is
implementing a package to provide more autonomy to all divisional
heads of its various business units throughout the country in a
bid to raise productivity, IOC sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new package empowers general managers of these business
units to decide at "field level", thereby reducing the time taken
to implement a project.
</P>
<P>
IOC is also working on a move to reorganize its four main
divisions in the country. The new organizational structure
envisages a state-wise break up of the divisions. This will allow
for more compact units and give general managers the freedom and
time to concentrate effectively on his state, the same sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has roped
in international management consultants Mckinsey for
reorganization, IOC's officers have chalked out an in-house
program to de-layer the organization vertically.
</P>
<P>
"This will ensure quick implementation of the project or take
corrective actions, if any," the same sources said.

JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires in Indonesia cause an
estimated loss of 240 trillion rupiah (around 96 billion U.S.
dollars) every year, the local press reported today.
Forest fires in Indonesia destroy about 30 million cubic meters
of timber each year, the reports quoted State Minister of
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja as telling a workshop on forest
fire prevention and management held here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said the losses of forest were caused by forest fires
and controlled burning of forest to clear land for plantations and
housing.
</P>
<P>
"Forest burning damages the soil as it kills all the useful
microorganisms which make the land productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smoke from fires also causes pollution, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged plantation and forestry companies to stop
controlled burning.

TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's auto exports rose 20.6
percent in the first half of 1997 over the same period last
year to 2,179,593 units, press reports here said today.
</P>

The growth was largely due to a 122.3 percent increase in
exports to the United States, their first upturn since 1986, the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Increases in Japan's auto exports to the European Union
countries and Central and South America also contributed to the
growth in the January-June period, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the exports of passenger cars soared 22.4 percent to
1,699,878 units, while those of trucks increased 13.8 percent to

BRASILIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will soon have an
important share of the international chicken market, on an equal

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Municipal Workers Walk Out Against Overdue Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Municipal workers walked out today
for five hours in 11 municipalities of Greater Caracas to protest
the government's overdue payment of salaries and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The strike began at 07:00 a.m. local time, said members of the
United Bloc of Municipal Employees, who alleged that the
government owed them the equivalent of 95.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities affected were Baruta, Carrizal, Chacao, El
Hatillo, Guaicaipuro, Libertador, Los Salias, Plaza, Sucre, Vargas
and Zamora.
</P>
<P>
Union representatives said they expected the Venezuelan Finance
Ministry to send the money for the payment of their back wages
last Friday, but it did not happen.
</P>
<P>
They warned that today's strike is one of the first steps to
press the government into paying the seven months of presidential
bonuses retroactive to January.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan to Discuss Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Nepalese team headed by
Foreign Secretary Kumar Gyawali flew to Bhutan Monday for talks on
refugee repatriation, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This trip, the first by a foreign secretary after the
ministerial-level bilateral talks on the refugee issue deadlocked
in April last year, is being seen by the Nepali Foreign Ministry
as an important occasion which could lead to a "breakthrough", the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials hope that the trip could result in an eighth
round of foreign ministerial-level talks between Nepal and Bhutan
sometime later this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin have
been staying in eastern Nepal in eight UN-run camps since the
Bhutanese authorities forced them to flee their homes in 1989.
</P>
<P>
So far, Nepal and Bhutan have held seven rounds of
ministerial-level talks but achieved no progress.
</P>
<P>
Nepal maintained that all the refugees should be repatriated
while Bhutan only agreed to take back those it considered to be
genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
As most of the refugees are of Nepalese origin, the two
countries differed on how to identify them.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has urged India, who handles Bhutan's foreign and defense
affairs, to help solve the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
But India contended that this problem is a bilateral one
between Nepal and Bhutan.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Reforestation in Arid Zone Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has established a total of
21,328 hectares of plantations since launching a greening project
in the dry zone of the central part of the country in 1994, the
official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Chit Swe, minister for forestry, as telling
an International seminar here Monday that the three-year project
covered 44 townships in nine districts of three divisions in
Myanmar's central dry zone.
</P>
<P>
The minister said two more projects were being implemented in
the Myingyan district watershed mountains, and another 13 in the
central dry zone.
</P>
<P>
Under the projects, an area of 8,075 hectares will be planted
and 29,652 hectares of natural forests will be protected and
improved.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the area of the arid zone in Myanmar has
now reached 131,311 square km, accounting for 20 percent of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The country now is undertaking its reforestation projects with
the aid of an international program -- the neem provenance trial
which is being carried out in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Neem, which is locally known as Tama, is a species that grows
well in the arid area and is greatly connected with the
afforestation of Myanmar's central dry zone.
</P>
<P>
The forestry minister said Myanmar has exchanged neem seeds
with organizations in other countries and has coordinated with
international bodies in the provenance trial of neem in Myanmar
since last year under a Letter of Agreement signed with the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started reforestation work in the country's dry zone as
early as in 1953. Up till 1994, a total of 112,170 hectares had
been planted and large stretches of degraded natural forests been
protected.
</P>
<P>
The on-going four-day International Neem Network Workshop,
sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry and FAO, is being
attended by representatives from 11 countries including
Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam as
well as international experts.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Compensates Guatemala Soccer Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, the international soccer
authority paid compensation check of 6,500 U.S dollars each to
those families of 78 Guatemalans who crushed to death in an
overcrowded soccer stadium last year.
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding led a human avalanche in the cheap seating area
of Guatemala City's Mateo Flores stadium on October 16 just few
minutes before a World Cup qualifying match between Costa Rica and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst tragedy in the history of soccer's World Cup
competition.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said the money for the families came from a "fair play"
fund that pools fines against members for penalties and rule
infractions.
</P>
<P>
With Monday's check-giving, the families will continue to seek
further undetermined damages from the government and sports
authorities blamed in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
FIFA ordered the stadium closed after the tragedy but in April
granted permission for reopening after the Guatemalan Soccer
Federation made changes to guarantee security for fans.

<HEADLINE> College Students Teach Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- College students are not always able
to enjoy rest and relaxation during annual seven-week summer
vacations.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, students from colleges and universities
across the country ventured into poverty-stricken rural areas to
share their knowledge of culture, science and health knowledges
with local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen students from the Chinese University of Science and
Technology based in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui
province, is one of many volunteer teams spending their summer
vacation teaching farmers.
</P>
<P>
The team volunteered to work in Youfangdian Village, Jinzhai
County, Anhui province. Farmers living in the wartime
revolutionary base located in a poor mountainous area, earn an
average annual income of only 1,000 yuan (US$120).
</P>
<P>
According to team member Hui Yi, the team sponsored a book
donation prior to summer vacation started. The successful effort
enabled them to donate over 4,000 books and hundreds of
agrobiology and technology periodicals and pamphlets to
Youfangdian Village.
</P>
<P>
The team cataloged the collection of books and built the
village's first library. One elderly farmer walked 15 kilometers
over narrow mountain paths to visit the library. The elderly man
grasped the hands of one student and praised the young people for
"their efforts to help the village". He said knowledge gained from
library books would help village children escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shouye, the only postgraduate in the group, is not only
conducting research on rural economy and education, but is also
presenting lectures on self-development. Wang explains the
importance of education based on his own experience.
</P>
<P>
The students have also benefited the social practice by
learning the virtue of hard work and thriftiness, as well as local
farming techniques. Liu Yaxing, a young female student unfamiliar
with agriculture prior to visiting, has gained the ability to
appraise the quality of tea.
</P>
<P>
Village official Wang Shilong noted that local farmers have
benefited greatly from the knowledge imparted by college
students. Local farmers encourage their children to study hard and
to follow the example set by the students in order to contribute
to the village.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese University of Science and Technology has designated
Youfangdian as a base for future social practice.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Intervention Not Enough: Indonesian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Currency speculation in various
countries, ASEAN in particular, can not be stopped merely by
central bank intervention, Antara news agency today quoted
Indonesia's noted economist Dr. Djisman Siamanjuntak as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, a number of Asian currencies such as yen,
rupiah, ringgit, baht and peso weakened against the US dollar as a
result of speculative attacks by fund managers.
</P>
<P>
However, Siamanjuntak held that speculators were not always bad
because they had enough funds to motivate the market and boost the
development of the world's investment and money markets.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific monetary authorities actually understood that fund
managers and speculators had a lot of funds in various currencies,
including the rupiah (Indonesian currency), he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, it was a fact that the speculative attacks by
fund managers on various currencies could not be avoided because
they wanted to defend their capital from being affected by
inflation or a policy of a country.
</P>
<P>
He said the international investment growth reached 320 billion
US dollars annually with a stock of about three trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This did not include portfolio investment such as shares and
bonds invested throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of the funds in the money market was controlled
by fund managers and speculative money market traders.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the depreciation of currencies in a number of ASEAN
countries was caused by speculative buying that was done to
prevent losses, he added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to minimize the possibility of currency
depreciation as a result of speculative attacks in the future,
governors of Asia-Pacific central banks should continue to carry
out coordination and hold dialogs.
</P>
<P>
Coordination was needed to exchange information and to create
convergence on cutting down inflation, reducing current account
deficits and building mutual understanding about each other's
difficulties, he said.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Indians Seek Refuge in Costa Rican Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Honduran Indians today
blamed security forces and local landowners for threatening their
lives and sought political asylum at the Costa Rican embassy here.
</P>
<P>
"We are the targets of death threats from the security forces
in complicity with the landowners," said Marcos Gutierrez, Indian
Chorti community leader. "We have neither guarantees nor any
security in our lives."
</P>
<P>
In May, more than 1,000 Indians marched to this Honduran
capital and camped for 12 days until President Carlos Roberto Rei
signed an agreement with them.
</P>
<P>
But Marcos Gutierrez said the government failed to comply with
the commitments it assured to respect and fulfill. "We do not have
any land to plant crops," he said. "The landowners lease small
amount of land at very high prices. We are going to starve to
death."
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Honduran government accused the Indians of
being influenced and advised by the Zapatista Movement of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they are ill advised, because there is no reason for
their request for political asylum," said Deputy Foreign Minister
Tomas Arita. "The government will fulfill its commitments with
them, but everything takes time."
</P>
<P>
The latest move by the Chorti Indians has won support from
other indigenous peoples in the country who were staging a
"sit-in" before the Costa Rican embassy.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Amnesty International sent an urgent fax
message to the Honduran government, asking it to cease political
persecution of indigenous groups and to comply with the agreement
to distribute land to them.
</P>
<P>
The struggles of the native Indians have resulted in the
violent deaths of 64 indigenous leaders since last decade.

<HEADLINE> Latvian President Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Latvia's President Guntis Ulmanis
named Economics Minister Guntars Krasts as the new prime minister
on Monday evening, replacing Andris Skele who quit after losing
support in parliament, the Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Skele said last week he would resign after serious disputes
with the main parties in the coalition government. President
Ulmanis accepted Skele's resignation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president told a press conference on Monday evening that he
and Krasts had discussed the major problems the new government
needs to solve, including ethnic minorities living in Latvia and
implementation of the citizenship law, Interfax reported from the
Latvian capital Riga.
</P>
<P>
Krasts is a 40-year-old economist belonging to the "Fatherland
and Freedom" party. One third of the party members oppose granting
Latvian nationality to immigrants, who account for one third of
the country's population,
</P>
<P>
But the president said Krasts has displayed a "constructive
attitude" towards the problem.
</P>
<P>
The new government will be officially formed next week, said
Krasts, who has won support of three of the four main coalition
parties.
</P>
<P>
The president said his naming of a "Fatherland and Freedom"
party member as prime minister will not complicate Latvia's
relationships with Russia or other neighboring countries, or halt
the European integration process.
</P>
<P>
Skele, 39, an independent, resigned after losing support from
the ruling coalition in parliament, and is expected to return to
business.
</P>
<P>
The four main coalition parties -- the Democratic Party,
Latvia's Way, Fatherland and Freedom, and the Farmers Union -- had
earlier described their choice of Skele as prime minister as a
mistake.

COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has warned
Sri Lanka that it will be compelled to stop the import of prawns,
lobsters and shrimps from it as of July 31 if the quality is still
not up to standard.
</P>
<P>
According to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Fisheries, the EU warning
came after revelations that countries which export seafood to the
EU don't follow hygienic practices.
</P>
<P>
The EU has recommended a method to preserve seafood under
sanitary conditions till exported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the deterioration of the fisheries harbors is
the main cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The lack of facilities, improper maintenance of fisheries
harbors and storage and packaging centers has also contributed to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Japan, to which Sri Lanka exports large amounts
of sea food, have also shown concern about the poor quality of
exports.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Governor Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh confirmed last night that Rerngchai Marakanond,
governor of the Bank of Thailand, had tendered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Central bank sources revealed that Rerngchai last night held a
meeting with senior central bank officials to inform them of his
resignation, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came only hours after the Council of Economic
Ministers approved a Finance Ministry proposal to negotiate for
assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue
the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The resignation is expected to be acknowledged by the cabinet
today at a meeting in the northernmost province of Chiang Rai.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at the council's Monday meeting, economic
ministers accused Rerngchai of failing to come up with measures to
cope with the impact of the baht's flotation, which began on July
2. Since then, the baht has depreciated about 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that other factors leading to Rerngchai's
departure include the central bank's defense of the Thai currency,
which cost several billion dollars in foreign reserves, and the
bank's decision to use 25 billion baht (about 1 billion US
dollars) to bail out the Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC), which was
laden with a huge amount of bad and substandard debt running up to
about 70 billion baht (2.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Chiang Mai University on Monday, Chavalit blamed
the central bank for the present economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Rerngchai's name, Chavalit said the central
bank had failed to warn the government in time of the troubles at
the BBC and in the finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai, who became the central bank's governor in July last
year, had twice requested resignation but had been rejected.

<HEADLINE> Ozone-depleting Chemicals to Be Phased out in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Refrigerator
manufacturers in Colombia have agreed to stop making products
using chlorofluorocarbons as coolants beginning this October.
</P>
<P>
Although the country's production of refrigerators friendly to
environment could have started last January, manufacturers said
they had to wait until October so they could clear inventories.
</P>
<P>
Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are group of chemicals often used
as coolants and cleansers, and in foam and spray products, and are
known to be damaging to the earth's atmospheric ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer, in the upper atmosphere, serves as a
protective shield against excessive and harmful solar ultraviolet
radiations on humans and other forms of life on the earth.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Montreal Protocol for eliminating CFCs,
manufacturers in developing nations have until the year 2006 to
phase out the production of refrigerators using the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Colombian manufacturers said the introduction of new
refrigerators will be gradual to prevent a "shock" among their
dealers who still have a big stock of CFC-based units.
</P>
<P>
Major refrigerator manufacturing companies operating in this
South American country are: Icasa, Haceb, Mabe (Centrales),
Inducel, Challenger (Samsung) and Sergo.

MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Transportation Secretary
Arturo Enrile has postponed indefinitely bilateral air talks
between the Philippines and Singapore scheduled to open today.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspaper Business World quoted Enrile as saying
he would convene the Civil Aeronautics Board Wednesday to tackle
charges hurled by Philippines Airlines (PAL) against Victor
Limlingan, head of the Philippine panel in talks with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
PAL earlier filed graft charges against Limlingan before the
Office of the Ombudsman, the country's anti-corruption body.
</P>
<P>
The airline accused Limlingan of unilaterally amending a
confidential memorandum of understanding to supposedly give
Singaporean carriers an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
PAL President Jose Garcia has asked Enrile to bar Limlingan
from heading the local panel "for serious legal questions that
have been raised in connection with his previous dealings with the
Singaporean government."
</P>
<P>
Garcia also urged the Department of Transportation and
Communications to reject an "open-skies policy" with Singapore,
saying this would be harmful to the country's interests.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines wants to increase its services between
Manila and Singapore from three to five flights daily.
</P>
<P>
PAL has said that this proposal, if approved, will eat into its
market share.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Remote and poverty-stricken areas
in China will be better off in the years to come, the result of an
ambitious program involving highway construction.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications advocates the initiative and
supervises national highway construction and transportation,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In line with the plan, at least one highway -- required to
maintain traffic flown and satisfy economic development demands --
will be available to each poor county by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By then, highways must be built in all townships in eastern and
central regions. In the next few years, about 40 such townships in
western China must have highway access.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 97 percent of towns and 81 percent of villages have
highway access. But more than 1,400 townships, however, are still
without access, mostly in the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry estimates, more than 170,000 kilometers
of highways must be built or renovated in these poverty-stricken
counties.

<HEADLINE> EU to Aid Least Developed Area in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
approved a funding of 203 million ECUs (243.6 million
U.S. dollars) for the development of Portugal's most impoverished
area, Alqueva.
</P>
<P>
The fund, from the European Structural Funds for the Specific
Program for the Integrated Development of the Alqueva Area, will
mainly be funneled to the construction of a dam which is expected to
create 20,000 jobs and help develop the southern part of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Alqueva dam is expected to last till the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The region suffers from chronic droughts, with some areas on the
way to becoming deserts, as described by an EU press release which
came out today.
</P>
<P>
The fund will also be used to improve the infrastructure and
modernize agriculture in Alqueva which accounts for 30 percent of the
total area of Portugal and is one of the least developed areas in the
15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita gross domestic product is in the neighborhood of
42 percent of the European community average.
</P>
<P>
Monika Wulf-Mathies, member of the European Commission
responsible for regional policy, said that the fund will give the
Portuguese in Alqueva an opportunity to bring their region's economy
up to the level of that of the rest of Europe.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved the second annual loan under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for Niger in an amount of 26
million U.S. dollars equivalent.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided to back the government's 1997/98 economic
program. The loan is available in two semiannual installments, the
first of which is made available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of the 1997/98 program include to raise
real GDP growth to 4 to 5 percent a year, reduce inflation to 3
percent by the end of 1997, and contain the external current
account deficit at 11.1 percent of GDP in 1997, and lowering it to
10.5 percent of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for backing member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Niger joined the IMF in April, 1963. Its quota is about 66

<HEADLINE> Flood Damage in Central Europe to Reach Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The costs of damage induced by the
worst floods in central Europe in 200 years could run up to nearly
six billion U.S. dollars, experts of the world largest reinsurance
company said today.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Germany alone, where several villages had been flooded
by the swollen Oder River on the German-Polish border, could face
a damage of more than one billion marks (540 million U.S.
dollars), experts of the German reinsurance company Muenchener
Rueckversicherung said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 14,000 rescue workers of the eastern German
state of Brandenburg were still running round the clock to pile up
sandbags along the 170-kilometer-long dikes to prevent further
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany were also using air-borne infrared cameras
to pinpoint weak points along the waterlogged dikes.
</P>
<P>
Although no dike burst was reported on the German side on
Monday, the situation in the Oderbruch region in the northern part
of the Oder remained critical as the weakening dikes were
threatening to burst at any moment. Some 20,000 local residents
were told to be ready for evacuations at short notice.
</P>
<P>
In the area in the southern part of the Oder, the flooding
appeared to be stabilizing as water levels started to fall after
days of fine weather. However, German officials said they were
expecting another crest in the Oder on Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Monday also said that Germany was running out of
sandbag reserves after two weeks of flooding. More than 810,000
sandbags were being ordered from the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Governor to Resign for Ambassador Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Governor William Weld of
Massachusetts today announced his resignation from the post so
that he can fight his own party full time for Senate confirmation
to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it would be fair to the people of
Massachusetts to permit the conduct of their government to become
embroiled in the vagaries of Washington politics," Weld told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
The resignation will be effective at 5 p.m. Tuesday. The White
House said that it was unaware until Sunday of Weld's plan to
resign and that the governor decided independently.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jesse Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has vowed to block any vote on Weld, arguing that the
governor is too soft on drug issues with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Weld, a moderate formally nominated by the White House last
week, has criticized Helms for refusing to schedule a hearing on
his nomination.
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor, who has little more than a year left
in his second four-year term, would be replaced by Lt. Gov. Paul
Cellucci, who would become acting governor until 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Reaches Nearly 8-Year High Against Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a nearly
8-year high against the mark, a 4-year high against the Swiss
franc and the strongest levels against the yen and pound in three
months Monday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8490 marks, the
strongest since November 1989, before settling in New York at
1.8436 marks, up from 1.8384 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also reached 117.79 yen in intraday dealings, the
highest since May 14, before settling in New York at 117.60 yen,
up from 117.02 Friday. The pound fell to 1.6311 U.S. dollars, down
from 1.6642 U.S. dollars Friday and the weakest since May 12.
</P>
<P>
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar reached an intraday high of
1.5250, the strongest since August 1993, before the Swiss currency
rebounded sharply. The dollar settled in New York at 1.5153 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5167 Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said a main force driving the dollar higher was further
erosion in value of the mark, French franc and other currencies
that will disappear when Europe's single currency is introduced in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday: 6.2120
French francs, up from 6.1945; 1,793.00 Italian lire, up from
1,788.00; 1.3859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3845.

<HEADLINE> Three Libraries Designated UN Depository Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Libraries located in
China, Kuwait and Tunisia have been designated United Nations
depository libraries, becoming part of a network of 359 libraries
in 141 countries and territories that brings UN documents and
publications to users around the world.
</P>
<P>
The new UN depository libraries are the Library of the Foreign
Affairs College in Beijing, the National Library of Kuwait and the
Library of the Faculte des Sciences Juridiques, Politiques et
Sociales de Tunis (Tunis II).
</P>
<P>
The Library of the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing is the
fifth UN depository library to be designated in China. The mission
of the college, the only institution of higher learning under
China's Foreign Ministry, is to train its students for
professional careers in diplomacy, foreign affairs, international
economics and international law.
</P>
<P>
As a specialized library with over 220,000 monographs in
English, Chinese, French, Japanese and Russian, it subscribes to
Chinese and foreign newspapers, as well as to serials in the field
of diplomacy, international relations and foreign languages. Its
facilities include photocopiers, microphotography equipment,
microfiche readers, CD-ROM equipment and on-line access to
external databases.
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, the Dag Hammerskjold Library at UN Headquarters in
New York has arranged for the distribution of UN documents and
publications to users around the world through its depository
library system. At present, there are 359 UN depository libraries:
52 are located in Africa, 99 in Asia and the Pacific, 29 in

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Good Governance for Sustainable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today called for good governance for sustainable human
development at the opening session of an international conference
on governance at the United Nations from July 28-30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, Annan said:"Crucial to the new
policies is a new re-definition of the role of the state. The
state, which is increasingly understood, is not a creator of wealth,
but a facilitator and catalyst of development. An essential
function of the state is to provide an enabling environment: in
which investment can take place, wealth can be created and
individuals can prosper and grow. Civil society can then form and
express itself, involving individuals in decisions affecting their
own lives."
</P>
<P>
"This is the lesson of our efforts and experiences, from Africa
to Asia to Latin America. Without good governance -- without the
rule of law, predictable administration, legitimate power and
responsive regulation -- no amount of funding, no amount of
charity will set us on the path to prosperity," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"A foundation of law and effective national institutions is
essential if governments are to reform their mission and be held
accountable for their actions," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance is also a component of our work for peace. It
has a strong preventive aspect; it gives societies sound
structures for economic nad social development. In post-conflict
settings, good governance can promote reconciliation and offer a
path for consolidating peace," the U.N. Chief added.
</P>
<P>
The international conference on governance is organized by
the United Nations Development program, which prioritizes
governance issues as a key area of development assistance.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges US to Control Tobacco Sale Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) welcomes a public-health panel's
recommendation to the US Congress that the US should actively
promote tobacco control on a worldwide scale, especially in
developing countries, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in response to a report by the Koop-Kessler Advisory
Committee on Tobacco Policy and Public Health, she said, "They
understand that the US, as the largest tobacco exporter, has a
special responsibility not only for the children within its
borders, but in every land."
</P>
<P>
The Koop-Kessler Advisory Committee is a group formed to advise
Congress on a proposed US tobacco Liability settlement negotiated
by state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers and cigarette
makers. The panel is chaired by former US Surgeon-General C.
Everett Koop and former US Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner David A. Kessler.
</P>
<P>
"The global marketing of tobacco is a direct challenge to
UNICEF's mission to ensure the survival of children in developing
countries," Bellamy said. "Acute respiratory infections are
killing 4 million children in those regions every year, a figure
that will surely rise in direct proportion to the expanded
marketing activities of the tobacco industry," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's children and teen-agers, it is estimated that
some 300 million will die of tobacco-related causes in adulthood
if current trends continue.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's role in advocating worldwide curbs on tobacco grows
out of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which
obligates governments to safeguard the health of infants and
children; protect children from drugs and exploitation; and
promote health education. The Convention, ratified as of last
month by 191 countries, is the most universally accepted human
rights instruments in history.
</P>
<P>
"Children have an absolute right to health and development, and
their use of tobacco is frequently a consequence of the denial of
those rights," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
In May, the UNICEF chief urged the US tobacco Liability talks
be used as a first step toward worldwide restrictions on the sale
and promotion of tobacco products, particularly to children and
young people in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Global Debate on Governance Starts at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The three-day International
Conference on Governance for Sustainable Growth and Equity began
today at the UN headquarters with over 1,000 ministers,
parliamentarians, mayors and other participants.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the conference, organized by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), are such pressing issues as
democratization, fighting corruption, free and air elections,
human rights protection and decentralization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, UNDP Administrator James Gustave
Speth said that without good governance, people-centered
development will not move from promise to reality. The fundamental
principles of good governance are universal. "They include human
rights and women's rights, respect for the rule of law,
participation and tolerance, accountability and transparency.
These are mutually reinforcing and cannot stand alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the launch of a 36 million dollar UNDP pilot
program that will support innovative approaches to promoting good
governance in developing countries. More than 75 countries will
receive assistance through the four-year program in such key areas
as strengthening judicial systems and parliaments, human rights,
decentralization, trade and responding to globalization.

<HEADLINE> House Urges Diversion of Cambodia Aid to Refugees Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives on
Monday passed a resolution, urging the Clinton administration to
divert foreign aid already appropriated to the Cambodian
government onto assistance to refugees because of the Cambodia
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved by a voice vote, said the Clinton
administration should continue to suspend aid to Cambodia until
violence ends, an elected government returns to power and steps
are taken to ensure scheduled 1998 elections are free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration suspended aid to Cambodia for a
30-day review after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted his rival
Prince Norodom Ranariddh as the first prime minister early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also sought an emergency U.N. Security Council
meeting to restore what it called peace in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Condemns Canadian Blockade of U.S. Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
today condemned a recent blockade of an American ferry in a
Canadian harbor by Canadian fishermen protesting U.S. position on
salmon dispute.
</P>
<P>
The nonbinding resolution, approved by a voice vote, also
criticized Canada for failing to bring a swift end to the
blockade, which lasted several days.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers urged President Bill Clinton to take immediate
steps to protect U.S. interests in the Pacific salmon industry and
to force the Canadian government to prevent further harassment of
U.S. fishermen.
</P>
<P>
A similar resolution was approved by the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Canadian fishing boats surrounded a U.S. ferry on
July 19 at the Prince Rupert harbor in the Canadian province of
the British Columbia. The fishermen backed off only after being
assured their government would try to settle the dispute over the
salmon with Washington.

<HEADLINE> British, German Shares up on Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed on Monday, with London and Frankfurt closing higher on
the dollar's strength while Paris down in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
On the London market, British shares made moderate gains today,
boosted by strength in the large multinational companies which
benefited from the profit-taking sell-off in sterling, with the
FTSE-100 index closing 11.1 points up at 4,862.6.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said that investors were still cautious ahead
of some UK corporate results and this week's US economic data.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks surged strongly and finished
sharply higher on a strong dollar as well as a stream of funds
pouring into Germany. The DAX-30 index ended up 53.52 points at
4,371.16.
</P>
<P>
But on the Paris bourse, French shares closed slightly lower,
although the CAC-40 index had earlier hit a new all-time high. The
index was at 3,022.20, 3.74 points down at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that trading volume was thin due to the Summer
holidays.

<HEADLINE> Waste, Fraud Rampant in Medicare Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Forty percent of all home
health visits paid recently by Medicare -- the federal health
insurance program covering 37.2 million elderly and disabled
Americans -- in four states should not have been paid, General
Accounting Office (GAO) investigators told Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a fourth of the companies providing such care in the
four states of California, Illinois, New York and Texas, plus
Florida, have abused or defrauded Medicare or misused taxpayer
money, a GAO report found.
</P>
<P>
Overall, home health care, which is used increasingly by
elderly Americans is losing billions of dollars a year because of
rampant fraud and waste, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
The study found The Department of Health and Human Services,
which oversees the program, inadequate in policing the companies
that provide care.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that similar conditions exist
in other states," deputy inspector general George F. Grob told the
Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said the testimony suggested
"fraud, waste and abuse are rampant," and called for forming a
home health care fraud strike force to find the worst cases.
</P>
<P>
An aging population and shorter hospital stays have contributed
to home health care's growth in recent years. In theory, such
services save money _ and improve quality of life _ by keeping
people out of more expensive hospitals and nursing homes. In
reality, costs have spiraled: Medicare now spends about 18 billion
dollars on such care, up more than 500 percent in the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
Home health agencies participating in Medicare increased from
5,656 in 1990 to 9,800 in 1996. But, the government screens very
few claims before paying bills, this study and other reports
found.
</P>
<P>
While stressing "most of the home health care providers are
honest, caring individuals, giving the American taxpayer their
money's worth," Grassley said a strike force would be a
cost-effective say of weeding out the biggest offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration and many in Congress also are trying
to work out a long-term solution, including a system that would
set standardized payments in advance for each type of home care.

<HEADLINE> Dow Edges to New Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
set another record with a small gain, but stocks turned mostly
lower by the close as investors took a defensive stance before
Tuesday's key economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow surrendered most of a 65-point afternoon gain, rising
7.67 to 8,121.11, but that was enough to beat Thursday's record
finish at 8,116.93.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 463.70 million shares as
against 519.65 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 2.34 to 936.45, the
NYSE composite index fell 0.87 to 485.93, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 4.61 to 1,564.97.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.55 to 639.35,
beating last Wednesday's record close at 638.03.
</P>
<P>
Stocks drew support throughout the day from the bond market,
where interest rates sank to their lowest level of the year amid
enthusiasm for an impending budget deal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
As bonds rose today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to
6.40 percent, slipped below last Tuesday's 6.41 percent, which was
the lowest finish since early December.
</P>
<P>
There were no major economic reports today. Investors focused
their attention on Tuesday's data on second-quarter employment
costs and Friday's data on July payroll and wage levels.

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Governor William Weld of
Massachusetts today decided to resign to work full time for Senate
confirmation to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Weld is announcing his resignation today, effective Tuesday,
the governor confirmed as he arrived at the State-house in Boston,
news reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jesse Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has vowed to block any vote on Weld, arguing that the
governor is too soft on drug issues with Mexico.

Weld, a moderate formally nominated by the White House last
week, has criticized Helms for refusing to schedule a hearing on
his nomination.
