<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy Speaks at DNC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democrats stirred memories of John F. Kennedy
at their national convention Tuesday, his daughter Caroline taking
a rare turn in the spotlight and beckoning delegates to turn the
New Frontier into a ''timeless call'' that would send Al Gore to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father served with her own in the Senate, and Kennedy
said she shares a special sense of kinship with the vice president.
''Both of us were raised to believe that we can make the world new
again -- if only we try,'' she said in marking the 40th anniversary
of JFK's nomination in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we are the New Frontier,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The convention oratory unfolded as Gore joined President Clinton
in Michigan in a ceremony passing the torch of party leadership. As
the president looked on approvingly, Gore said Clinton ''worked
hard to get the economy right. I'm not going to let the other side
wreck it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a few Democrats hoped Clinton would now fade into the
background, and said so. ''He's not only got to get off the
stage,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, ''he's got to allow the
vice president to say 'I'm a different person and I am going to do
things differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, JFK's daughter and his brother, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, understood -- neither of them mentioned the president in
their remarks. Instead, the Massachusets senator got the delegates
rocking as he told them -- over and over -- that Gore ''will fight
for you'' when it comes to expanding access to health care,
providing prescription drugs for Medicare and HMO reform.
</P>
<P>
   The convention approved Gore's platform, a document crafted to
stress fiscal caution while providing provide contrasts with the
Republicans for the campaign ahead. ''If America is to secure
prosperity, progress, peace and security for all, we cannot afford
to go back,'' it said, seconding Gore's remarks in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The platform supports abortion rights and gay rights and opposes
school vouchers and partial privatization of Social Security. It
also calls for paying off the publicly held national debt in 12
years, while providing for a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare and tax cuts targeted to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman made a brief tour
of the convention floor and Sen. Kennedy drew loud applause when he
said JFK would be proud of ''the new barrier of bigotry we are
breaking down'' with the nomination of a Jew on a national ticket.
John Kennedy broke his own barrier when elected the nation's first
Catholic president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Ford, a 30-year-old black lawmaker from Gore's home
state of Tennessee, brought the evening to a close with the
Democrats' keynote address, and he used it to try and broaden
Gore's political support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize that I stand here tonight because of the brave men
and women, many no older than I am today, who were willing to stand
up, and in many cases sit down, to create a more perfect union.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I also stand here representing a new generation,'' he
said, urging ''my reform-minded Republican and independent
friends'' to back Gore, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrives in the convention city Wednesday, just a few hours
before delegates nominate him by acclamation. He delivers his
acceptance speech on Thursday, the beginning of the fall campaign
to win four more years for Democrats in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of speakers made the case for four more years for the
Democrats in oratory designed to strengthen Gore's support among
the party's traditional base as well as rekindle the excitement of
the Kennedy era.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, appearing well before the main speakers,
delivered a full-throated denunciation of Gore's Republican rival,
George W. Bush, and his record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Texas, last in children's health care. Last in environmental
protection. The third worst state to raise a child, the fourth
worst drop-our rate and 38th in teacher salaries...
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Bush's father and brother -- one a former
president, the other the current governor of Florida -- and soon had
the delegates chanting along with him: ''Stay Out the Bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ''The American
people will not support old-style attack politics, and tonight's
speech will be remembered as the type of partisanship and
bitterness the country would prefer to leave behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys were put out front by Gore convention planners.
Caroline, rarely in the public eye, made what amounted to a
political debut, and found herself staring out at a sea of blue and
white banners that said, ''Caroline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time, but a timeless call,'' she said. ''Now we are the
New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a president who is not afraid of complexity, who
believes in an open and tolerant society, and who knows that the
world can be made new again. And that president is Al Gore,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced Sen. Kennedy as the man who ''worked harder than
anyone for the world my father envisioned.'' The convention planned
played the son ''You're Still the One.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came at the podium, he, too, referred to that
night in 1960 in Los Angeles when JFK accepted the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, our generation faces its own new frontier,'' he said
... Will we dare to dream of a far horizon, or will we look inward,
look backward, lower our sights and narrow our vision. That is the
choice we face in the election of 2000,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival in last winter's primary, added
his support, drawing delegate cheers where he said, ''Our country
needs a Democratic president, a Democratic Congress and more
important, a Democratic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jackson, Bradley jabbed at Bush, saying that ''as
Democrats, we're not conservative with our compassion,'' pointing
to the party's longtime commitment to civil rights, the minimum
wage and environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators for a variety of causes -- women's rights, animal
rights and public education among them -- paraded near the Staples
Center. Police reported 75 arrests, including 29 bicyclists and an
Associated Press reporter who was covering their activities while
riding a bike. In their protest, riders wove through cars, rang
bike bells and waved signs that said ''End slavery to the oil and
automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   There were one or two discordant notes, including podium remarks
by Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. The champion of campaign
finance reform spoke of his ''concern and dismay that soft money
fund raising has become so much a part of this convention. It
should not be.'' He urged the party to ban it in future
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The polls underscored the challenge ahead for Gore, and
explained the evening program, as well.
</P>
<P>
   He trails Bush by margins ranging from three points to double
digits, and a new survey showed he has yet to either solidify his
Democratic base or gain political credit for the country's strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll taken on the weekend before the
convention found that 49 percent of those surveyed said Gore
deserves no credit for the economic good times. Also troubling for
Gore, the same poll said the vice president has the support of only
78 percent of Democrats, with Bush siphoning off 18 percent. Bush,
by contrast, has the backing of 95 percent of Republicans, and
leads the vice president by 16 percent among independents.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spent part of his time in the convention city trying
to reassure black voters about his views on affirmative action. ''I
want to talk very specifically about it,'' he told black convention
delegates. ''I have supported affirmative action. I do support
affirmative action. And I will support affirmative action,'' he
said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton campaigned together in Monroe, Mich. a
blue-collar swing district where they had appeared in their
successful 1992 campaign. Gore thanked Clinton for the endorsement
he delivered from the convention podium on Monday night. He noted
the prosperity of the past eight years, and said, ''we're just
getting started. We're not turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   In a slap at Republicans, Gore said, ''Why would we squander
these historic surpluses on tax giveaways that bust the budget and
comfort the comfortable? Let's invest in health care, education, a
secure retirement and middle class tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would ''not go along with any plan to privatize
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, delegates eagerly awaited his nomination and
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some reflected, as well, as the past.
</P>
<P>
   One, Mike Vinich, of Wyoming, was on the convention floor 40
years ago when his delegation gave John F. Kennedy the delegates he
needed to clinch a contested nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all split up,'' he recalled. ''There were Kennedy
delegates and (Lyndon) Johnson delegates and Adlai Stevenson men.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinich recalled telling his delegation chairman that Kennedy
''only needs 13 votes; we've got 15. We can give him the nomination
and make a place in history.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, and Vinich said, ''the convention just went wild. What
a moment.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Churns Past Baja  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ileana churned past the
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula Tuesday and headed
out to sea, while Tropical Storm Beryl moved inland, dumping rain
on Texas and northern Mexico as it weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana doused the Baja resort towns of Los Cabos with rain, but
''nothing too severe,'' said Randy Lehr, the American manager of
the Hacienda Beach Resort in Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like we got lucky, and the storm passed by to the
south,'' Lehr said in telephone interview. Guests at his hotel were
warned to stay out of the ocean, and some whiled away the time
playing pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government discontinued a hurricane warning for Los
Cabos and areas slightly north after the storm's center whirled
past 50 miles south of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''There hasn't been any damage so far, and the communications
systems are working fine,'' said Baja California state spokesman
Juan Antonio Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, with winds of 70 mph, was churning out to sea at 10
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Beryl lumbered ashore on Mexico's
northeast coast Tuesday, swirling into land over a sparsely
populated stretch of coast 110 miles south of the border cities of
Matamoros and Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The storm quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it
dropped rain over northern Mexico, and the Mexican government
discontinued most storm warnings for coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane center reported Beryl could cause rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, but predicted the system would probably dissipate by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl's winds had fallen to 35 mph, and the weakening system was
moving roughly west at about 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Mexican border state of Nuevo Leon evacuated
about 1,500 people from low-lying areas near river beds Tuesday as
the remnants of tropical storm Beryl approached the state capitol
of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   State civil defense officials said the evacuees would probably
be able to return to their homes after a few hours, when the danger
of flash flooding had decreased, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   It rained intermittently Tuesday in Monterrey. The city is
vulnerable to flash flooding because of insufficient storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Weather Service canceled hurricane and
tropical storm warnings for South Texas, where some heavy showers
were reported.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley pointedly mocked George W.

''give the fruits of our hard-won prosperity to those who don't need the help.''
Five months after quitting a rough-and-tumble primary race against Al Gore,

Lieberman: Faith May Affect Campaign

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday
that his devotion to Orthodox Judaism would keep him off the campaign trail on
several crucial days before the election. ''I'm just going to do what I've
always done and work extra hard on the days that I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman
said in an interview with The Associated Press. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New
Year, falls on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, falls on
Oct. 9. Sukkot, the Jewish harvest festival, arrives Oct. 14 and 15.

nation. ''We're going forward, to even better times,'' the vice president
declared to a cheering crowd after Clinton left the lectern that bore his
presidential seal. ''Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right. And I'm
pledging to you here Tuesday, I am not going to let the other side wreck it and

Russia Lowers Capsule To Sunken Sub

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian crews lowered a bell-shaped rescue capsule early
Wednesday to a nuclear submarine lying on the Arctic Sea floor, but strong

crewmen was expected to last just two more days, Russia's navy chief said. It

with the children said that troops opened fire without provocation and there
were no guerrillas in the area. Colombia's army chief, Gen. Jorge Mora, said the

<HEADLINE> Group Defies Canadian Lobster Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- A smoldering dispute over
native fishing rights in eastern Canada has reignited, with
government agents seizing hundreds of illegal lobster traps and
natives blockading a road in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict in the lucrative lobster industry -- which pulled in
$298 million in 1998 -- focuses on how to restore some of the
freedom native groups had to provide for themselves before
colonization, while protecting industries built on limited
resources and preserving the environment.
</P>
<P>
   At Burnt Church, one of dozens of native bands in the
economically depressed coastal regions of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia, the government wants to allow the reserve 40 traps for
catching food. The natives say they should be allowed thousands of
traps to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, native fishing boats from Burnt Church, a Mi'kmaq
reserve, went into Miramichi Bay to place new traps after the
Sunday night raid by government fisheries officials.
</P>
<P>
   Three motorboats full of so-called native fishing rangers from
Listiguj, a Mi'kmaq reserve in Quebec near northern New Brunswick,
came to support them. The rangers are uniformed native officers
appointed by the Quebec reserve to patrol their own waters and
other natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Agents on a government fisheries boat looked on from afar, but
there was no sign of any immediate plan to raid the new traps.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really tense,'' fisheries spokesman Andre Marc Lanteigne
said of the standoff. ''We hope people will keep their cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mi'kmaq protesters from Burnt Church also continued to blockade
Highway 11, a major north-south artery in New Brunswick. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police diverted traffic along a 15-minute detour
to avoid the bonfires and immobile vehicles in the road outside the
Burnt Church reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The protest began after the raid by Canadian fisheries officials
Sunday night in which 748 traps were seized or destroyed and one
boat was impounded. Four people were arrested on charges of
obstructing fisheries officials, and Fisheries Department spokesman
Bob Allain said pepper spray was used on two people.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal said Tuesday he wanted
to negotiate a settlement with the Burnt Church band, but that
federal fishing rules would be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Canada, the rule of law is fundamental,'' Dhaliwal said.
''We have to ensure that we have the rule of law and not anarchy
and confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   James Ward, a Mi'kmaq spokesman, said Dhaliwal and the Fisheries
Department must ''realize that they can't dominate us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court ruling last year said natives have the right to
fish for food and for ceremonial purposes, subject to federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to resolve the dispute could lead to violence between
native and non-native fishermen over out-of-season fishing and
other issues. At Burnt Church last October, three natives were
injured and lobster traps and three fish plants were vandalized in
a weekend of violence.

<HEADLINE> Democrats To Raise $4M Thursday  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A star-studded fund-raising gala at the end
of the Democratic National Convention will bring in at least $4
million, party sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All of the money raised Thursday evening will fall under federal
contribution limits -- so-called ''hard money'' -- meaning the
Democratic National Committee can spend it directly on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The gala is to be hosted by actress Whoopi Goldberg and feature
entertainment by Barbra Streisand, Enrique Iglesias, Baby Face and
Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will range from $150 to $20,000 -- the maximum annual
contribution an individual can make to a political party under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Co-chairs will raise $50,000 and vice chairs will raise or
donate $20,000 for the event, scheduled for the Shrine Auditorium,
home of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the first in a series of concerts with low ticket
prices Democrats hope to stage this fall based on the success of a
May 24 fund-raiser that raised a record $26.5 million and attracted
more than 12,000 people. The entertainment included Stevie Wonder,
Lenny Kravitz and Robin Williams. While the top ticket price was
$500,000, thousands of $50 tickets sold as well.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also hope to close the gap in hard money fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Through June 30, the Republican National Committee had $21.1
million in hard money in the bank, compared to just $9.3 million
for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At their convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia, Republicans
raised $10 million at a gala on George W. Bush's first day at the
convention. That total, however, was a combination of hard money,
which fell under donor limits, and unlimited soft money
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   While the party increases its take of money raised under federal
contribution limits, it also is recognizing its biggest donors of
soft money, the unregulated contributions from labor unions,
corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   During convention week, the party has set up a ''chairman's
circle'' to recognize donors of at least $500,000. The list
includes trial lawyer Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore
Orioles; S. Daniel Abraham, former owner of Slim Fast; and several
labor unions, including the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees.

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders End Congo Summit  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRED MULENGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Weary African leaders wound up 18 hours of
talks in Zambia early Tuesday without reaching an agreement on how
to revive the crumbling Congo peace accord, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese President Laurent Kabila and his two key military
allies, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Namibian leader Sam
Nujoma, departed in the early hours Tuesday, leaving chief mediator
President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia to close the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said Kabila resisted calls for him to allow the
unhindered deployment of U.N. monitors and accept former Botswana
President Sir Ketumile Masire as ''facilitator'' for an internal
political dialogue between the Congolese government and rebels
fighting to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has accused Masire, appointed by the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity, of bias toward the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said he was confident Kabila would still comply with
U.N. conditions. ''The Congo wants (U.N.) troops in the country, I
have no doubt about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said regional sanctions on the Congo were not foreseen,
but remained an option to force Kabila to accept Masire.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing disappointment at the failure of a summit, U.S.
deputy ambassador to the U.N. Nancy Soderberg said that the United
States on Tuesday urged Kabila to honor the year-old peace
agreement and end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Soderberg told the U.N. Security Council the United States was
encouraged there was a consensus by non-Congolese signatories of
the agreement on measures to revive the crumbling peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are disappointed that the government of the Congo was not
among the consensus of this group and continues to oppose full
implementation of the Lusaka agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo broke out in August 1998 with rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda accusing Kabila of corruption and of
harboring Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after committing genocide
there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed a
cease-fire agreement last year with Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels.
But the fighting has continued.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has proposed deploying a monitoring force of
5,537 observers and troops to oversee the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council mandate for the force is up for renewal at
the end of this month and will likely be suspended if Kabila does
not yield, leading to fears of a sharp escalation in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, who angered even his close allies by staying away from a
regional economic summit last week, was the last of 10 African
presidents to arrive at a convention center in Lusaka on Monday for
the biggest gathering of high-level officials on the Congo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki and other leaders of
countries not directly involved in the war went to their hotels
after seven hours of closed-door talks Monday. But the warring
parties and Chiluba kept meeting late into the night to discuss
ways to enforce a cease-fire, withdraw forces and foster political
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence of a deal was never high among residents listening
for radio news in Kinshasha, 620 miles away from the nearest
battles in Congo. One woman who gave her name only as Azama said
the meeting was ''just a play.''

   Prices are high, pay is low, and disillusion with Kabila's
government -- which came to power just three years ago after ending
the decades-long rule of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko -- has become
increasingly profound. Politicians are regularly arrested,
newspapers are closed and police harassment is once again the norm.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Christine ''Auntie Doll'' Dillon Denning,
whose ''message in a bottle'' story was recently featured in The
Times-Picayune and distributed by The Associated Press across the
South, died Monday. She was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Denning, known for her precise diction, energy and interest in
other people, never revealed to her family that she had a
trans-Atlantic pen pal. Relatives only recently turned up the stash
of letters that revealed the relationship that began when Denning,
then 28, tossed a bottle into the ocean with a note tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   She was known affectionately as ''The Lady from the U.S.'' by
the poor Irish boy who found her bottle and with whom she
corresponded for five years. She often tucked gifts of money into
her letters.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Denning was an executive with the American
Red Cross and later held a position with the Red Cross in Miami
where she was involved in the repatriation of men who had been
captured in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Fred Gebhardt, Germany's oldest member
of parliament, who left the Social Democrats to protest their move
to the center and joined the former East German communist party,
died Monday after a long illness. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt left the Social Democrats, the party of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, in 1998 after 52 years in protest against the
left-wing party's shift toward the center, which he termed a change
in course ''from an employees' to a neo-liberal business party.''
</P>
<P>
   He had also served as Hesse's Social Democratic chairman, based
in Frankfurt, where he headed an adult education school.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, he was elected to the Bundestag, or lower
house, for the former communists and gave the speech opening
parliament, traditionally delivered by the oldest legislator. He
also served on the human rights committee.

</P>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Leonard Kwan, a master of slack key guitar whose
composition ''Opihi Moemoe'' is considered a classic of the genre,
died Monday in his sleep. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan began recording in 1957 and most recently recorded two
albums for George Winston's Dancing Cat Records. The second will be
released in September.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan also was the first slack key guitarist to publicly share
his instrument tunings in an instruction book.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian slack key, or ki ho'alu, is a unique musical style
dating to the 1830s, when Spanish and Mexican cowboys arrived in
the islands. Some of the guitar strings are slacked from the
standard tuning and songs are played in a finger-picking style,
with the thumb playing bass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he recorded, ''Slack Key,'' the world's first
all-instrumental slack key album.
John Milford:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Milford, a character actor who had roles
in about 500 television productions and a dozen theatrical films,
has died. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Milford collapsed and died Monday while en route to his nearby
home after outpatient treatment for skin cancer in Santa Monica,
said publicist Dale C. Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, who made his film debut in ''Marty,'' had television
guest roles in dozens of popular series over 40 years including
''The X-Files,'' ''MacGyver,'' ''Dallas,'' ''Quincy,'' ''Cagney &AMP;
Lacey,'' ''Dynasty,'' ''Highway to Heaven,'' ''Picket Fences'' and
''Melrose Place.'' As one of ''The Mighty Carson Players,'' he
appeared opposite Johnny Carson on ''The Tonight Show,'' playing
Russian leader Leonid Brezhnev to Carson's Ronald Reagan.

<HEADLINE> 18 Die in Oil Fire in South Uganda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- A fire ignited as villagers scooped fuel
oil from an overturned tanker in southern Uganda, killing at least
18 people, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in a papyrus swamp Sunday evening along
the Kampala-Masaka highway, 25 miles southwest of Kampala, the
independent New Vision newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said more than 30 men were scooping oil spilled on the
road when the fire ignited, according to the daily. Dozens of acres
of swamp burned before firefighters extinguished the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were trying to get fuel from the water. I don't know what
happened,'' District Police Commander Ebiyu, was quoted as saying.
He did not provide his first name.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses said one person struck a match after a
disagreement over how the oil would be shared, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tanker, which had Kenyan registration, was transporting
the oil to Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Mocks Bush, Hails Gore  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Warmly embraced by the delegates who had
turned him aside, former Sen. Bill Bradley mocked George W. Bush's
compassionate conservatism on Tuesday and accused Republicans of
wanting to ''give the fruits of our hard-won prosperity to those
who don't need the help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who quit the rough-and-tumble primary race against Al
Gore five months ago, took the podium at the Democratic National
Convention and immediately went to work to make the case for his
former rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me get right to the point,'' he began. ''We're all here to
elect the next president of the United States, Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely essential that we get behind Al Gore. I
support him. I endorse him. I'll work hard for his victory,''
Bradley said in a speech in which he didn't mention Gore after the
fifth paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   He said his quest for the presidency had been ''a joyous
journey, and I have the scars to prove it,'' drawing a knowing
chuckle from the crowd. Blue signs proclaiming simply ''Bill
Bradley'' fluttered throughout the hall.
</P>
<P>
   The former professional basketball star spent most of his speech
pressing his pet issues -- campaign reform, universal health and
eliminating poverty -- and sharply attacking Republicans for what he
said was a facade of compassion at their recent convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't window-dress diversity. We're the party of
diversity,'' he declared. ''We don't declare ourselves to be
compassionate. We've been acting compassionately for decades. We
don't just talk about prosperity -- we make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Without ever mentioning Bush, he repeatedly mocked the
Republican's campaign slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Democrats, we're not conservative with our compassion. At
our best, we give it generously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the fall election as a ''choice between a
Republican Party that is determined to give the fruits of our
hard-won prosperity to those who don't need the help, and a
Democratic Party that promises to use this great opportunity to
provide care for the ill, to lift up millions from poverty, to heal
the wounds of racial divide and to ensure that every child has a
decent public school.''
</P>
<P>
   But while President Clinton and Gore have tried to make economic
prosperity the theme of the convention, Bradley listed several
statistics suggesting not all is well in America -- 44 million
without health insurance and 13 million children living in poverty.
The reference made Republicans gleeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were Al Gore I would be livid,'' Republican New Jersey
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said, ''since the theme of the
convention is 'Are you better off today than 8 years ago,' and he's
saying just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made passing reference to the sharp disagreements that
surfaced during the primaries -- battles left behind several weeks
ago when he endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you run against someone you get to know him very well,''
Bradley conceded. ''I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging
intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound preparation for
the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life view infused with
tolerance and rooted in religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''What strikes me is that we share so much more than what we
disagree on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley urged Democrats to seize the issues he championed as a
senator from New Jersey and a presidential candidate -- health care,
fighting poverty, campaign finance reform among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every generation has to fight for democracy in its own way,''
he said. ''Our fight is campaign finance reform.''

<HEADLINE> Kerrey: Clinton Must Let Gore Lead  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sen. Bob Kerrey said Tuesday that President
Clinton must step aside and let Al Gore have the political
spotlight if he is to convince Americans he's ready to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't, it will be very difficult for Al Gore to win,''
said Kerrey, a Democrat who has clashed with Clinton in the past.
''He's not only got to get off the stage, he's got to allow the
vice president to say 'I'm a different person and I am going to do
things differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore needs to be allowed to take center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Los Angeles last Friday, attended several
parties and helped raise money for Hillary Rodham Clinton's New
York Senate campaign before delivering his farewell address Monday
night to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president gave a very good speech, a very moving speech,''
Kerrey said. ''He's entitled to come to the convention and speak,
but he's got to -- between now and the election -- move aside and let
the Democratic nominee lead this party.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Richard Nixon in 1960 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968 were
never able to emerge from the shadows cast by presidents Eisenhower
and Johnson, and lost their White House bids those years.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana Plants Discovered in Raid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS OSOS, Calif. (AP) -- More than 5,000 marijuana plants were
found Tuesday at a private ranch in a rugged mountainous area, and
two people were arrested during a morning raid.
</P>
<P>
   The seized plants may have had a street value as high as $15
million, said Sgt. Sean Donahue of the San Luis Obispo County
Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Grown with use of a sophisticated watering system, the marijuana
plants up to eight feet high were found in an area of steep terrain
surrounded by thick shrubs, Donahue said. The property's owner was
not a suspect, sheriff's narcotics detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men were arrested on charges of conspiracy to distribute
marijuana. Bail for each man was set at $50,000.

<HEADLINE> Albright Meets Brazilian Officials  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
stressed the need to preserve the region's democratic advances and
boost free trade on Tuesday during meetings with top Brazilian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and
Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia during her five-hour stay in
Brazil -- the first leg of her whirlwind five-day tour that will
also take her to Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We discussed the need to ensure that the democratic tide
continues to rise in the Western Hemisphere,'' Albright said at a
news conference before leaving for Argentina. ''Over the past two
decades, democracy has made enormous gains, but in some areas of
the region it is experiencing considerable stress.''
</P>
<P>
   She made it clear that she was referring to Peru and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said U.S. officials were concerned about the methods
President Alberto Fujimori used to win re-election to a third
consecutive term in a runoff vote that was criticized by
international monitors as not meeting fairness standards.
</P>
<P>
   After the May 28 election, the Organization of American States
proposed a series of measures to strengthen democracy in Peru,
including reforms in the judicial system, strengthening civilian
control of the military, and protecting human rights and freedom of
expression and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is very important that this road map be followed if
President Fujimori wants to have the respectability and credibility
within the international community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Colombia, Albright said she, Cardoso and Lampreia ''discussed
the importance of backing President (Andres) Pastrana's plan to
combat drug trafficking and restore the economic health of his
country.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last month approved $1.3 billion in mainly
military aid to help Colombia, the world's largest cocaine
producer, fight drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   But Lampreia, who was also present at the news conference, said
Brazil would not support the plan, although it but would consider
taking part in peace negotiations to end that country's 36-year
civil war.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Raises the Roof at DNC  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jesse Jackson led cheering Democrats in
chants of ''stay out the Bushes'' Tuesday night as he blasted
Republicans as a ''grizzly old team'' that wants to give tax breaks
to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is more with Gore,'' Jackson declared at the Democratic
National Convention, ''more health care with Gore, more education
with Gore ... more wages with Gore, more freedom with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I say America, stay out the Bushes, stay out the Bushes,'' he
chanted as the audience shouted along in a refrain against
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat presidential candidate Al Gore ''stood up for justice''
when he chose Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, as his running
mate, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has brought the sons and daughters of slaves and
slavemasters together with the sons and daughters of Holocaust
survivors. He raised the moral chin bar,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign issued a tart response.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Vice President Gore was serious about renouncing personal
attacks and unkind words, he shouldn't have allowed his surrogates
to do it for him,'' Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
''The American people will not support old-style attack politics,
and tonight's speech will be remembered as the type of partisanship
and bitterness the country would prefer to leave behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told the delegates, ''This fall there will be two teams
on the field: two teams, two plans, two directions.'' He warned
that the Republicans are trying to blur the differences between the
parties, adding, ''don't be fooled, just look at the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just Bush and Cheney but grizzled old veterans such
as Jesse Helms and Dick Armey and Tom DeLay and Bob Barr and Strom
Thurmond,'' Jackson said to boos and hisses from the audience.

<HEADLINE> Democrats' Keynoter: Harold Ford Jr  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Harold Ford Jr., a rising black star of the
South, said a Democratic victory in the fall would energize a new
generation of voters while ''some in the other party would have us
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 30, a centrist Democrat from Al Gore's home state of
Tennessee, was cast in Tuesday night's keynote role to help the
Democratic presidential ticket appeal to young voters and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the youngest member of Congress, said, ''I recognize that
I stand here tonight because of the brave men and women, many no
older than I am today, who fought and stood and often times sat
down to create that perfect union.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I also stand here representing a new generation,'' the
Memphis congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   Like both Gore and Republican nominee George W. Bush, Ford is
the son of a prominent politician and has struggled to step out
from his father's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to those of this new generation, I say to all Americans
who share our spirit, if you want a future that belongs to you, if
you want a future that is for everyone, then join with us and make
Al Gore our next president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is faring much better than Gore among young voters, polls
show. Though holding a wide lead among minorities, the vice
president needs to strengthen his bond with traditional Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The son of liberal former Rep. Harold Ford, the two-term
lawmaker has reached for the political middle. He hopes to win
statewide office, breaking ground for a black in Tennessee, and may
someday seek a national post.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported free trade, capital gains tax cuts and a
constitutional amendment protecting school prayer -- placing him
well to the right of his father's generation of black leaders. He
is a member of the New Democratic Coalition, a centrist caucus, and
has clashed with the more liberal House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford criticized President Clinton for his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, even as most black leaders rallied behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans say Ford's stock is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a comer in Tennessee,'' said Tom Ingram, who worked for
former Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander. ''He's
got significant talents. He presents well. He is very articulate.
He comes from a rich political heritage, but he is seen as going
beyond it and seems to have a good bit of political savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford himself believes the sky is the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week about his political future, Ford lifted his arm
toward the ceiling and said, ''If this is the trajectory I'm on, I
like where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the address that introduced him to a nation, Ford listed
Gore's accomplishments -- including the vice president's work as a
30-something lawmaker to improve the environment, strengthen the
military and clean up the political system. ''Some pose for reform
and photo ops, but Al Gore is ready to sign a campaign reform
bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to Bush, not his only one: Ford also said
America ''needs a leader with intellect to understand the
complexities we face, a leader with experience who can grasp the
challenges of our world.'' Voters tell pollsters they wonder
whether Bush is up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the convention's theme, Ford said electing Bush would
return America to the era of former President George Bush, when he
said prosperity didn't trickle down to the poor, educational
opportunities were limited, polluters wrote environmental laws and
the economy was run ''into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Times are good now, he said, ''but some in the other party would
have us go back.''

<HEADLINE> Israel TV Shows Nuke Reactor Photos  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's state-run television on Tuesday
broadcast satellite shots of Israel's nuclear reactor, a sign of an
increasing willingness to discuss the country's nuclear weapons
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The television broadcast photos of the reactor near Dimona, in
the Negev desert, taken in 1968 and 1971, and appearing on the
Federation of American Scientists Web site. The site does not
source the satellite shots.
</P>
<P>
   By clearly noting that the shots were drawn from the Web site,
the TV complied with Israeli censorship laws, which allow local
media unfettered license to quote foreign reports. The FAS monitors
non-conventional weapons capabilities throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the broadcast would have been unimaginable just a few
years ago. Mordechai Vanunu, a one-time technician at the reactor,
was jailed for 18 years in 1986 after he published photos in the
London Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures were featured during a televised debate over
whether Avner Cohen, an Israeli writer living in self-imposed exile
in the United States, should return to Israel to face charges that
he broke the law with his 1998 book ''Israel and the Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here have said they want to question Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who joined the debate via satellite feed from Washington,
said his book revealed nothing new and was based on published
reports. His book argues that Israel and the United States worked
out an understanding in 1970, believed to be still operative, in
which the United States would look the other way as long as Israel
kept a low profile and did not carry out nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Cohen faced charges
because his book placed Israel at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has opted for a policy it describes as ''opacity,''
refusing to confirm or deny whether it bears nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and academics publishing works on the Israeli
military now routinely bypass the military censor if they are
confident they have not revealed military secrets; as late as the
mid-1990s, the censor ordered books removed from bookstores solely
because the writer had not asked for prior permission to publish.

<HEADLINE> Fairly Strong Quake Hits N. Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.9 jolted northern Japan Wednesday morning, while
moderate tremors continued to shake small islands off Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from
either quake, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake in northern Japan was centered about 6 miles under the
ocean floor off the Nemuro peninsula, the Meteorological Agency
said. It struck at 5:21 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nemuro, an eastern port city on Japan's northern main island of
Hokkaido, is about 600 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more moderate earthquakes jolted a string of volcanic
islands south of Tokyo, part of a series of tremors that has been
hitting the area since late June. No injuries or damages were
reported.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out Wiretapping Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court dealt law enforcement
authorities a setback Tuesday in their efforts to keep criminals
from using such telephone features as conference calls and
call-forwarding to thwart surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that the Federal Communications Commission
failed to adequately take into account consumer privacy concerns
and costs imposed on the industry when the agency required
surveillance capabilities added to the telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could also have implications for the FBI's new
''Carnivore'' surveillance system, which can monitor e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   One provision thrown out by the court required phone carriers to
provide to law enforcement agents all numbers dialed after the
subject of a wiretap order connects a call. That was intended to
ensure authorities could get the actual number being called, even
if a suspect first used a 1-800 number or a calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups had argued that the provision could give
authorities access to information beyond the scope of the wiretap
such as credit card or bank account numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia agreed and sent that back to the commission.
Another provision struck down would have given investigators
information about all parties to a conference call, even if some
are put on hold and are no longer talking to the target of the
legal wiretap. Authorities with a court order also could have
determined when someone was using call-forwarding, three-way
calling or other features or when that person placed a call even if
it was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups, which had challenged the rules saying they
expand government surveillance beyond what the law permitted,
applauded the court action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court told the FCC that it was wrong to give in to the
FBI's surveillance demands at the cost of privacy,'' said James X.
Dempsey, Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Telecom Association said the items thrown out
by the court would ''only serve to impose extraordinary and
unnecessary costs on carriers'' and possibly raise phone rates for
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's rules, set in place nearly a year ago, helped to
implement a 1994 wiretapping law. The agency stepped in after the
Justice Department, FBI and the telecommunications industry failed
to agree on a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials expressed hope that the court's concerns can
be addressed to keep the rules in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, we're seeing now folks engaged in criminal
activity using those types of technology to thwart law
enforcement,'' said Stephen Colgate, assistant attorney general at
the Justice Department. For example, some might use calling cards
to frustrate agents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling upheld provisions that require
telecommunication carriers to provide information on so-called
digital packet-switched communications. In these types of
communications, calls are broken up into a number of data packets
carrying both identifying information and content. These packets
travel different routes on the network and are reassembled at their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates had argued that because the content and the
information identifying the caller cannot be separated, the
government would get more than a simple trace order allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The court did stipulate in its decision that law enforcement
agencies still need lawful authorization to intercept content. That
typically would require officials to meet a higher standard such as
those of a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups said the court's assertion could have
implications for Carnivore, the FBI's court-approved system for
monitoring people's e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has clarified the legal standards that law
enforcement must meet before monitoring new modes of
communications. The decision calls into question the legality of
the FBI's controversial Carnivore system,'' said David Sobel,
general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate said the Justice Department will take into account the
court's decision as part of its ongoing review of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   The court also left in tact a provision that allowed police,
with a judge's permission, to track cellular phone users by their
location at the beginning and end of a call.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Appear at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Caroline Kennedy, standing figuratively where
her father stood, paraphrased John F. Kennedy's challenge 40 years
ago and summoned her generation ''once again to ask more of
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After so much Kennedy tragedy, it was a rare appearance Tuesday
for an intensely private person and an emotional return to Los
Angeles, where she was a tot when her father was nominated in 1960
-- a happy triumph that was followed first by his murder in 1963 and
then by the slaying of her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful were all in the jammed convention hall of the most
recent Kennedy tragedy, the airplane death on July 16, 1999, of her
younger brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy's task was to introduce her uncle, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, the liberal warhorse of Democratic conventions, who
delivered a more traditional political speech, but started with a
gem of family history.
</P>
<P>
   So close was the 1960 presidential election, Edward Kennedy
recalled, that John F. Kennedy went to bed on election night
uncertain whether he or Republican Richard Nixon had won. The news
was delivered the next morning, when 3-year-old Caroline jumped on
JFK's bed and shouted, ''Good morning, Mr. President!''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy's long ties to the Democratic Party were captured
by the music that accompanied his entrance and departure -- ''You're
Still the One.''
</P>
<P>
   When Caroline Kennedy spoke, she faced a whirl of blue signs
that said, simply, ''Caroline.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not need to remind anyone who she was quoting. It was
her father. In his inauguration, he implored: ''And so my fellow
Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you
can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy's rendition took account of America's
prosperity. ''Now, when many of us are doing so well, it is time
once again to ask more of ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle said Al Gore's election would result in ''the greatest
chance of my lifetime and the lifetime of our nation to secure the
promise of health care for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been only three times in my life that I have
supported candidates for president as early and as enthusiastically
as I have supported Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two of them were my brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Kennedys were preceded to the podium by two others --
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland, and
Robert Kennedy Jr., whose urgent voice echoed his father's as he
made a case for saving the environment. While Ted and Caroline
Kennedy spoke, their spouses sat nearby on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Determinedly private and nonpolitical, Caroline Kennedy is a
lawyer and co-author of a book on privacy and another on the Bill
of Rights. She is married to Edwin Schlossberg, a museum and theme
park designer.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing the Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman,
she recalled her father's nomination and speech in which he called
for courage and sacrifice on a ''New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time but a timeless call,'' she said. ''Now we are the New
Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Kathleen Townsend, 42, spoke out for sharing
technology with rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   Using a figure of speech that would ring true in coastal
Maryland, she said:
</P>
<P>
   ''We've established America as a lighthouse of prosperity and
peace. But this didn't happen automatically and there's no
guarantee it will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kennedy Jr., 46, in his speech argued that -- contrary to
what he called the Republican view -- ''good economic policy is
identical to good environmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's opening session heard from a fifth Kennedy, Patrick
Kennedy, 33, son of Edward and a Rhode Island congressman. He
invoked the names of Democratic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to make this country the kind of place that lives up
to its principles of fairness and justice for all,'' Patrick
Kennedy said, ''we need to carry on the fight of John Kennedy, we
need to carry on the fight of Robert Kennedy, we need to carry on
the fight of Martin Luther King, we need to carry on the fight of
Cesar Chavez,'' the farm workers' union leader who died in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Nets Love Lure of Kennedys' Camelot  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A chance to revisit Camelot is a trip to
heaven for television, and Caroline Kennedy gave networks all the
excuse they needed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Film libraries were mined for nostalgic footage of Kennedy's
handsome and tragedy-filled political family to mark her appearance
at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remember not just the battles but the glamour, the style,
the charm of them all,'' CNN's Bruce Morton commented over images
that proved his point.
</P>
<P>
   There was first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, elegant in riding gear
and leading a horse carrying a tiny Caroline. There were Caroline
and her father aboard a ship, she nestled in his lap and both
bathed in sunshine on a tranquil sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe there was, however briefly, a place called Camelot. A
child who lived there speaks to the Democrats tonight,'' Morton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real place in the Democratic heart for the Kennedys,
isn't there?'' CNN anchor Judy Woodruff asked analyst Jeff
Greenfield, who was a speechwriter for Robert Kennedy when the
senator was assassinated in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is,'' he replied, citing the sheer number of Kennedys in
politics and the fact they've been part of every Democratic
convention since 1956. Then he got to the emotional core.
</P>
<P>
   By the time President Kennedy was killed in Dallas in 1963,
television was a fixture in most American homes. ''For the first
time, the country mourned in front of a TV set,'' Greenfield said,
creating an enduring national memory.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Foxnews.com called Caroline Kennedy's
appearance ''fraught with meaning,'' noting that Los Angeles was
where her father was nominated and where her uncle was shot after
winning the 1968 California presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The normally private Kennedy was ready for her close-up. She was
undoubtedly a reluctant surrogate, forced into action by the plane
crash death of her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A slender figure in a simple white dress, the telegenic Kennedy
got a rousing welcome from convention delegates when she appeared
on the podium to give a brief speech that introduced her uncle,
Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I look out across this hall and across this country, I know
that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank all Americans for making me and John and all our
family a part of your families, for reaching out and sustaining us
through the good times and the difficult ones and for helping us
dream my father's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   TV analysts went to work even as Kennedy took the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's trying to recapture for the Democratic Party and her
family the legacy of John Kennedy,'' Tim Russert said on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   But in post-speech appearances, Caroline Kennedy put a different
spin on her rare public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a really important election,'' she told
Woodruff on CNN, citing issues including health care, education and
potential Supreme Court appointments.
</P>
<P>
   For a second night, the convention ran past TV primetime in the
East. While broadcasters were willing to stay with President
Clinton until about 11:40 p.m. EDT on Monday, CBS and ABC cut away
at 11 p.m. EDT from Tuesday night's final speaker, Rep. Harold Ford
Jr. of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News, covering the night via cable's MSNBC, remained with
the convention until its conclusion at 11:08 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Making the news show rounds earlier Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy
batted away Dan Rather's question on CBS about a future political
career. ''Well, I'd just like to get through tonight,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her image as the reclusive Kennedy, she told NBC's
Claire Shipman ''I do get around, I do get out of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Her typical refusal to pander to the media made her all the more
the object of its interest.
</P>
<P>
   Cokie Roberts, hosting a segment on ''Kennedys in the
Spotlight'' on the Internet for ABC News, asked Rep. Marty Meehan,
D-Mass., why Kennedy would appear at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well I think that she feels a responsibility as the only
person left from that great family to send a message that her
father would want to be sent here,'' Meehan said. ''And I think she
feels added responsibility because her brother is no longer here.
... I think she feels that it's part of being a Kennedy.''

<HEADLINE> Carnegie Mellon robotics team hopes to score at strange soccer competition </HEADLINE>
By JOE MANDAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) - Sportswriter Grantland Rice couldn't have
envisioned Robocup2000, but he penned the perfect cliche to
describe it: It matters ''not that you won or lost, but how you
played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon
University are competing in the worldwide soccer tournament that
pits 150 computer-simulated and robotic teams from 35 countries
against one another in Melbourne, Australia, Aug. 26 to Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are hoping the technology they use to build
their teams will help them construct better computers - computers
that can solve problems and make decisions on their own, while also
working together as a team, just like the players on a soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the Apollo space program. There was a very concrete
goal of landing on the moon, but to do that, you're going to have
to develop a lot of technologies that are generally applicable
outside the space program,'' said Peter Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is a research scientist at AT&AMP;T laboratories in Florham
Park, N.J., who co-founded the first-ever Robocup in 1996 while
still at CMU. Stone heads the ATT-CMUnited virtual soccer team that
is part of a $1.5 million program funded by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, a military group dedicated to robotics
and computer design.
</P>
<P>
   Stone says soccer players are continually making split-second
decisions: whether and where to run, pass and shoot. And they must
do so in concert with 11 other teammates.
</P>
<P>
   In computerese, teaching a machine to make split-second
decisions is called layered learning.
</P>
<P>
   ''You (rewrite the program) to increase the probability that the
action that was just taken will be taken again in the same
situation,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is that each player on Stone's virtual
soccer team is running on a separate program that must cooperate
with the others on his team - and against a team designed to thwart
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   So how can a computerized soccer game help AT&AMP;T?
</P>
<P>
   Take e-mail, for example. There is no direct pipeline from one
e-mail ''box'' to another - rather, computers route e-mails over a
variety of ever-changing networks.
</P>
<P>
   By writing programs that enable computers to make routing
decisions based on changing conditions - much like a soccer player
dodges a defender or passes to a teammate - e-mail and other
Internet traffic will be more efficient, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Another variable is when artificial intelligence is married to
robotics.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Emery is one of a team of graduate students at CMU who
will enter a soccer team consisting of four robots in Robocup2000s'
''medium-size'' league for robots that are about the size of a
bread box.
</P>
<P>
   The teams play on a carpeted field measuring 9 by 5 meters, with
color-coded goals at both ends. The robots move on motorized
trailers that have cameras allowing each ''player'' to ''see'' the
ball and the goals.
</P>
<P>
   These preprogrammed robots then share that information with one
another and move about - at about one meter per second - in an
effort to nudge an orange ball into their goal, while preventing
their opponent from doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   All the factors Stone must consider are present - but the
computerized soccer commands are now being carried out by robots,
not ''virtual'' players on a video screen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more technology comes into play, including
odometry, a robot's ability to tell where it is at a given moment.
Soccer robots calculate their location based on how much their
wheels spin, which means a robot can become ''lost'' if it is
knocked around by a moving ball or a rampaging opponent, Emery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are developing technology that allows the robots to
link that odometry information with the data they ''see'' through
their cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using the two, the robots can calculate where they believe
they are,'' Emery said.

Caroline Kennedy in Spotlight at DNC
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democrats stirred memories of John F. Kennedy at their
national convention Tuesday, his daughter Caroline taking a rare turn in the
spotlight beckoning delegates to turn the New Frontier into a ''timeless call''
that would send Al Gore to the White House. Gore's father served in the Senate
with John Kennedy and his daughter said she shared a special sense of kinship
with the vice president. The convention oratory unfolded as Gore and President
Clinton campaigned together in Michigan in a ceremony passing the torch of party
leadership to the Democrats' 2000 nominee.

Gore,'' Jackson declared at the Democratic National Convention, ''more health
care with Gore, more education with Gore ... more wages with Gore, more freedom
with Gore.'' ''I say America, stay out the Bushes, stay out the Bushes,'' he
chanted as the audience shouted along in a refrain against Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush.

Democrats' Keynoter: Rising Star Harold Ford Jr
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Harold Ford Jr., a rising black star in the South and Al
Gore's keynote speaker Tuesday night, said a Democratic victory in the fall
would energize a new generation of voters while ''some in the other party would
have us go back.'' Ford, 30, a centrist Democrat, was cast in Tuesday night's
prime speaking role to help portray the Democratic ticket as a fresh alternative
to Republican nominee George W. Bush. Though the Texas governor is only two
years older than Gore, the vice president is portraying the race as Old Guard
vs. New Guard.

Five months after quitting a rough-and-tumble primary race against Al Gore,
Bradley took the podium at the Democratic National Convention and hailed his
former rival for possessing a ''wide-ranging intellect'' and ''a life view
infused with tolerance.''

Russia Lowers Escape Capsule To Sunken Sub

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Racing against time, Russian Navy rescuers prepared to lower a
piloted escape capsule Wednesday to a crippled nuclear submarine in a new
attempt to save the 116 sailors trapped inside, officials said. In an earlier
attempt Wednesday, Russian crews lowered a bell-shaped rescue capsule to the
submarine lying on the Arctic Sea floor, but strong currents and zero visibility
blocked attempts at docking. Oxygen for the vessel's 116 crewmen was expected to

were no guerrillas in the area. Colombia's army chief, Gen. Jorge Mora, said the
children were caught in the crossfire of a battle with rebels outside the

<HEADLINE> Hall Breaks Swim Record  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Get ready, Alexander Popov. Gary Hall Jr. is
coming after you again.
</P>
<P>
   Hall broke a decade-old American record in the 50-meter
freestyle at the U.S. Olympic trials Tuesday night, edging Anthony
Ervin in 21.76 seconds -- the second-fastest swim in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin claimed the second trip to Sydney in 21.80, the
third-fastest time ever that also beat the old American mark of
21.81 set by Tom Jager in March 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's performance set up another showdown with Popov, the
Russian star who has swept the 50 and 100 at the last two Olympics.
Hall won the silver in both events at Atlanta, but his life was
dealt a couple of major blows in the ensuing four years.
</P>
<P>
   First, Hall was suspended for three months after testing
positive for marijuana. Then, he was diagnosed with diabetes,
altering his training routine and requiring him to take up to eight
insulin shots a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the trials, however, Hall earned two more Olympic chances to
knock off Popov, who set the 50 world record of 21.64 at a June
time trial. Hall and Ervin now have the fastest times in a full,
eight-man field.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hall will swim the 100 at Sydney after finishing
second in Indy. Popov holds the world record in that event, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears afterward, Hall read an inspirational
message he received from former tennis star Billie Jean King.
Reflecting a newfound maturity, the 25-year-old refused to reprise
his war of words with Popov.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to make predictions,'' Hall said. ''I'm
predicting a good race. It always is when I race Alexander Popov. I
guess the rivalry continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, 19, of Valencia, Calif., already had become the first
U.S. swimmer of black heritage to make the Olympic team, earning a
relay spot. He stayed with Hall stroke-for-stroke, then leaped into
the winner's arms after looking at their blazing times on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Walker, already headed to Sydney, was third at 22.12. Bill
Pilczuk, who upset Popov at the 1998 world championships, was shut
off the Olympic team after finishing fourth at 22.21.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Ian Crocker completed the improbable trip
from Maine to Sydney by winning the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, the first Maine-based swimmer to even qualify for the
trials, was the latest evidence of a youth movement in the men's
program. The Portland native was the eighth teen-ager to make the
Olympic team; only one male teen, Tom Malchow, went to Atlanta four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to come here and experience it, take it all in,
see what happened,'' said Crocker, who showed little emotion as he
crawled from the pool. ''It turned out pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance was even more amazing considering he doesn't
have a full-length pool for training in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hannan, 20, of Baltimore was ahead of the world record
pace through 50 meters before Crocker caught him at the end,
touching in 52.78. Hannan, who attends the University of Texas, was
a surprising second in 52.81.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan ranked 70th in the world last year and his only major
international experience came at the 1999 World University Games.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Bennett of Plant City, Fla., will get a chance to defend
her Olympic 800 free title at Sydney. She cruised to an expected
victory in 8:23.92, barely missing Janet Evans' 12-year-old trials
record.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett already qualified for the Olympic team in the 400 free.
</P>
<P>
   The real race was for the second berth in Sydney. Kaitlin
Sandeno of Lake Forest, Calif., and Diana Munz of Chagrin Falls,
Ohio, raced to the finish side-by-side, with Sandeno touching in
8:28.61 and Munz just 0.05 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Munz wasn't shut out of the Olympics, having already made the
team in the 400 free. Sandeno, only 17, will swim three events in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Adkins of Gahanna, Ohio, became the third University of
Georgia swimmer to make the women's team when she came from behind
to win the 200 backstroke in 2:12.97 -- a stunning triumph for
someone who considered quitting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never count yourself out,'' said Adkins, who joined college
teammates Kristy Kowal and Courtney Shealy on the Olympic team.
''The last three years were really hard. I've not done my best
times in a long time. Sometimes, it seems you work so hard for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Maurer, a 29-year-old high school English teacher from
suburban Chicago, led through 150 meters but apparently went out
too fast, finishing fifth at 2:15.12. She will have to settle being
a 1992 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Benko of Los Angeles claimed the second Olympic berth in
2:13.19. She already was on the team in the 200 free and 800 relay.
</P>
<P>
   A weary Dara Torres was still better than everyone else in the
semifinals of the 50 freestyle. She breezed into the Wednesday
final by setting a trials record of 24.93.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it would be this tough,'' said Torres, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, defending Olympic champion in the 50, trailed
Torres in 25.11. In Atlanta, she became the first American woman to
win four gold medals at one Games, but a pair of shoulder surgeries
have slowed her since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''This race is my baby,'' Van Dyken said. ''It's been my baby
for a long time. Dara is ahead of me right now. But I enjoy being
the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who came out of retirement in June 1999, was swimming
her fourth event of the eight-day trials, having finished second to
Jenny Thompson in both the 100 butterfly and 100 free.
</P>
<P>
   The trials conclude Wednesday with the women's 50 free and the
marathon of swimming, the men's 1,500 free.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson, bronze medalist at the 1999 Pan Pacific
championships, was fastest qualifier in the 1,500. The 21-year-old
from Roseburg, Ore., finished in 15:21.71 and hopes to break George
DiCarlo's 16-year-old American record of 15:01.51 before heading to
Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Panel To Examine College Sports  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Knight Commission will meet after a four-year
hiatus to see if recommendations it made have helped solve some of
the problems that have plagued college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission was formed in 1990 to address runaway
athletic programs overseen by powerful coaches and athletic
directors. The panel is made up of university presidents, the
president of the NCAA, corporate sponsors and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The panel last met in 1996 after presenting three
recommendations to the NCAA. The organization adopted in large part
the Knight Commission reform slate, based on the Commission's
''one-plus-three'' model, which makes the college president
responsible for three key aspects of the athletic program: academic
integrity, financial integrity and independent certification.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's president, Hodding Carter III, said the group
wants to see how far universities have come since the proposals
were made.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an opportunity to see what has been done to implement
the reforms, to see how the terrain has or has not changed in 10
years,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's major recommendation was placing control of athletic
programs in the hands university presidents. As part of the reform,
college presidents become directly responsible for a sports
program's financial dealings, academic requirements and independent
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Renfro, a NCAA spokesman, said schools have made progress
since the commission's recommendations ''have come to fruition and
then some.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission said athletic programs needed to be open about
their financial dealings with sponsors and boosters, tougher on
their ''no-pass, no-play'' policies and raising academic
requirements, and for departments to have annual audits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see if changes have been made in response to the
commission's reports and we want to see if more recommendations are
needed,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not investigative reporters. We are looking at the
overall picture of intercollegiate athletics -- what has changed and
what hasn't in wake of our reports.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, named for the James L. Knight Foundation, will
hold its first meeting Aug. 28 in Washington D.C., then meet again
there on Oct. 18 and Nov. 28.

<HEADLINE> Angels 8, Blue Jays 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Mo Vaughn and Garret Anderson homered off
struggling David Wells, and Matt Wise earned his first major league
victory as the Anaheim Angels defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 8-4
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant, who homered in the ninth inning, and Vaughn each drove
in three runs. Darin Erstad went 3-for-4, raising his major
league-leading hit total to 184, as Anaheim ended its five-game
road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (17-5) is 2-3 with a 7.27 ERA in seven starts since
starting the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old left-hander, making his 300th career start,
allowed six runs on seven hits in 4 2-3 innings. He tied a season
high with three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Wise (1-1) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings. He
struck out two and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit a solo homer in the second. After Tim Salmon walked
in the fourth, Vaughn hit his 29th home run to give Anaheim a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays loaded the bases in the bottom half, but Gant
robbed Tony Batista off extra bases with a spectacular,
over-the-shoulder catch in left field. Gant crashed into the fence
and held on to the ball, leaving Batista with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   After Wells loaded the bases in the fifth on two singles and a
walk, the Angels scored three runs on Vaughn's bases-loaded walk,
Gant's sacrifice fly and Anderson's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart cut Anaheim's lead to 6-3 in the fifth with a
two-run homer. The Blue Jays have hit 113 home runs at home, a new
club record.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells allowed seven runs in his last start, a 15-7 win over
Kansas City. ... Stewart has 18 home runs, five in his last eight
games. ... Toronto RHP Frank Castillo was put on the 15-day
disabled list because of sprained right forearm muscles and a
sprained ligament in his right elbow. RHP Joey Hamilton, who had
shoulder surgery last September, replaces Castillo in the rotation.
Hamilton went 2-2 with a 3.66 ERA in six rehab starts at Triple-A
Syracuse and is to make his first major league start of the season
on Saturday. ... Gant hit his fourth homer in nine games for the
Angels.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Phillies 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Matt Williams homered, doubled and drove in
five runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 11-6 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista and Greg Colbrunn each had three hits as Arizona
won its third in a row. Bautista's two-run double broke a 6-all tie
in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a two-run homer in the fourth and added a three-run
double in the ninth. He has eight RBIs in two days against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After the Phillies made it 6-all on Scott Rolen's home run in
the seventh, the Diamondbacks took the lead against Wayne Gomes
(4-5) in the eighth. Colbrunn and Damian Miller singled and both
scored on Bautista's double into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (3-5) pitched 2 2-3 innings for the victory. He
gave up Rolen's 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 6-5 lead in the seventh when Tony Womack
hit a two-run triple and scored on Jay Bell's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona starter Geraldo Guzman cruised through four shutout
innings and took a 3-0 lead into the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Randy Wolf's sacrifice fly and Doug Glanville's RBI
single cut the deficit to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Bobby Abreu hit a hard grounder back to the mound
that knocked Guzman's glove off. As Guzman was retrieving the ball,
he appeared to step on it with the back of his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu reached on a single and Guzman left the game with a mildly
sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan relieved and surrendered three straight RBI singles
to Rolen, Travis Lee and Pat Burrell as the Phillies took a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took a 1-0 lead off Wolf on Bautista's gutsy baserunning
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista scored on Womack's shallow fly ball to center field
after a nasty collision at home plate with catcher Tom Prince.
Bautista originally missed the plate, but scored easily when the
ball went to the backstop.
Notes: Glanville recorded an outfield assist, his third in three
games, in the first inning. ... Williams has 36 homers in 400
career at-bats against the Phillies, the most of any club.
Williams' 18 homers at Veterans Stadium is second to Barry Bonds
(25) among active players on the opposition. ... Rolen extended his
hitting streak to seven games with a fourth-inning single. Over his
last five games, he is 15-for-25 (.600). ... Womack's triple was
his 10th, tying him with Colorado's Neifi Perez, and extending his
hitting streak to 12 games. ... Dan Plesac retired the only batter
he faced in the seventh. He has retired seven straight over his
last three appearances.

<HEADLINE> Rockers 72, Miracle 43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland rookie Ann Wauters scored 12 points
as the Rockers defeated the Orlando Miracle, 72-43 Tuesday night to
advance to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland will play host to the New York Liberty, the
regular-season conference champion, on Thursday night in Game 1 of
the best-of-three series. The second game will be played at New
York as will Game 3, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Wauters, the first pick in last spring's draft, made all five of
her shots from the field. The 6-foot-4 center from Belgium also was
a defensive presence inside, keeping the Miracle from completing
passes for easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando had just seven assists. Suzie McConnell Serio had seven
of the Rockers' 24 assists as Cleveland dominated all aspects of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rushia Brown added 10 points for Cleveland, which lost the first
game of the series on the road before taking the last two at home.
</P>
<P>
   Nykesha Sales scored 13 points and Taj McWilliams added 12 for
Orlando, which lost for its 10th consecutive road game.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's determined defense enabled the Rockers to open a
12-2 lead in the first six minutes. The Miracle trailed 32-21 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Game 2, when Orlando used a 10-0 run at the outset of the
second half to get back into the game, Cleveland continued to
extend its lead after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin scored four points in a 10-4 run by the Rockers
that gave Cleveland a 42-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers limited Orlando to 28 percent shooting from the
field, the second-lowest in WNBA playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando won the series opener 62-55 Friday night and the Rockers
rebounded Sunday to tie it with a 63-54 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers improved to 15-3 at home overall, including a 66-65
overtime victory against New York on July 3.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Eric Milton won his fourth straight decision,
and Torii Hunter homered and drove in three runs Tuesday night as
the Minnesota Twins beat the Kansas City Royals 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones also homered for Minnesota, which has won seven of
its last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney homered and drove in two runs for the Royals, who
lost their seventh straight game at the Metrodome dating to last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (12-6) allowed two runs and five hits in seven-plus
innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.95 ERA in his last five starts.
He has allowed 22 hits and struck out 28 in that span, pitch 37
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells pitched two perfect innings for his ninth save in 15
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Suppan (6-7) allowed four runs and nine hits in seven
innings, losing for the first time in eight starts since June 25.
He had won four straight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Johnny Damon, who entered hitting .471
(64-for-136) since the All-Star break, was 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 1-0 lead on Ron Coomer's RBI single in the
first, and Jones homered in the second, his team-leading 17th.
David Ortiz's sacrifice fly in the third made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney hit a solo homer off Milton in the sixth, giving him 20
homers and 101 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie led off the bottom of the inning with a double and
Hunter drove him in with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's RBI groundout in the eighth made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter hit a two-run homer, his third home run in the three
games, off Jerry Spradlin in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Ortiz hit a high pop that was going foul
behind the plate, before it hit a speaker and was redirected into
play. Suppan caught the ball off the speaker in foul territory for
an out.
</P>
<P>
   Twins right fielder Matt Lawton made a nice catch in the
seventh, leaping against the wall to catch David McCarty's fly
ball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Twins manager Tom Kelly celebrated his 50th birthday. ...
After getting his first win of the year against Minnesota on April
8, Suppan went eight starts without a victory. ... McCarty was
Minnesota's No. 1 draft choice in 1991. ... Denny Hocking went
3-for-3 for Minnesota. ... Hunter is hitting .379 in 16 games since
being recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake on July 29. ... Kansas
City's Carlos Beltran, who was suspended without pay, for not
reporting for a rehab assignment, received only a partial amount of
his salary on the first payday since the suspension. Kansas City
expects the players' association to file a default notice with the
commissioner's office. The Royals would then pay Beltran, pending a
grievance hearing, and would deduct the money in the future if an
arbitrator rules in their favor.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 3, Red Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Miguel Cairo doesn't drive in many runs, and
Tanyon Sturtze doesn't start many games.
</P>
<P>
   Both came through as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat Boston 3-1
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A night after hitting a three-run homer off Pedro Martinez in
Tampa Bay's 7-3 loss -- Cairo's first home run of the season -- he
had an RBI single in the second off Jeff Fassero (8-6) and a
sacrifice fly in the seventh against Rich Garces, giving him 33
RBIs this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also had two of Tampa Bay's five stolen bases, matching the
club record he set against Toronto on June 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sturtze, making his 10th career start and fourth this season,
allowed one run and eight hits in 6 2-3 innings. He was especially
effective against Boston's No. 3 hitter, Carl Everett, who went
1-for-5 and stranded six runners.
</P>
<P>
   After singles by Trot Nixon and Lou Merloni put runners on first
and third with one out in the seventh, Everett flied out. Nomar
Garciaparra followed with a two-out single off Sturtze (4-2) and
Doug Creek relieved, retiring pinch-hitter Bernard Gilkey on a
flyout.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff singled home Tampa Bay's final run in the ninth off
Hipolito Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez got five outs for his 22nd save in 28 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Boston lost for the second time in six games, while Tampa Bay is
6-1 in its last seven road games.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero struck out a season-high 10 batters, allowing one run
and five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took advantage of Fassero's early wildness -- and
Cairo's ability to hit the left-hander -- in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Quinton McCracken walked, and advanced to third on a groundout
as Scott Hatteberg's passed ball. Gerald Williams walked and Cairo,
who was 4-for-6 against Fassero coming in, singled.
</P>
<P>
   Boston stranded two runners in each of the third and fourth
innings, and left the bases loaded in the fifth when Brian Daubach
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays threatened in the first when they loaded the
bases on a single by Cairo and walks to Fred McGriff and John
Flaherty. But Jose Guillen fanned.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Guillen singled with two outs and Russ Johnson
followed with a single off the left-field wall. Guillen tried to
score but was thrown out easily by Garciaparra, who took the throw
from Darren Lewis and relayed it home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In the first three innings, Fassero walked four and allowed
four hits. He also struck out four and escaped with just one run.
... Cairo's two stolen bases in the first and second innings gave
him a career-high 25. The team record of 26 was set by Randy Winn
in 1998. ... Daubach battled Sturtze with the bases loaded in the
fifth, fouling off five pitches before striking out on a 3-and-2
pitch. ... The last time Fassero recorded double figures in
strikeouts was July 5 of last season, when he struck out 10 in a
4-0 win over Anaheim. ... Rico Brogna went 0-for-4 after winning
Monday's game with a grand slam in the ninth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima recovered from a shaky start and got
home-run help from Jeff Bagwell and Daryle Ward as the Houston
Astros beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Truby later homered as the Astros won their third in a
row. Houston, with the worst record in the majors, is 17-16 since
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles homered, tripled and doubled for the Pirates, who
have lost seven of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (5-14) gave up a home run to Adrian Brown leading off the
game, and Giles hit a solo shot later in the first inning. Lima has
allowed a major league-leading 38 homers, extending his team
record.
</P>
<P>
   Lima went six innings and allowed three runs and seven hits. He
won for the fourth time in his last five decisions dating back to
July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel pitched 1 2-3 innings to get his sixth save in
eight chances. He gave up Pat Meares' solo homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Giles homered, tripled and doubled in his first three at-bats.
With a chance to hit for the cycle, he was hit by a pitch from
Wayne Franklin in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio ran his career-high hitting streak to 18 games, a
season high for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Benson (8-10) lost his fourth straight decision and is
winless in his last seven starts. He lasted 6 1-3 innings and gave
up four runs on six hits and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown hit his second homer and Giles hit his 27th, the
Astros evened it when Bagwell and Ward hit back-to-back homers in
the bottom half. Bagwell hit his 34th home run and Ward had his
18th.
</P>
<P>
   Lima drove in Eusebio with an RBI grounder to give the Astros a
3-2 lead in the second. Pittsburgh tied it in the third on Giles'
RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Julio Lugo's double gave Houston a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pittsburgh's Aramis Ramirez sat out the game with his sore
left hand, but was available to play if needed. He was hit by a
pitch in Monday's game and X-rays were negative. Club officials
said Ramirez, who has gone 48-for-164 (.293) since being recalled
from Triple-A Nashville June 19, probably will sit out until
Friday. ... The Astros have hit consecutive home runs 10 times this
season. ... Bagwell extended his hitting streak to 14 games.

<HEADLINE> Wayne County man gets 25 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LYONS, N.Y. (AP) - A Wayne County Court judge has sentenced a
man to spend 25 years in state prison for the kidnapping and rape
of a 7-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Allen Jr., 19, pleaded guilty Tuesday to
second-degree kidnapping, first-degree rape and first-degree
sodomy. Judge Stephen Sirkin levied the maximum sentences of 25
years for the kidnapping, rape and sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't want to go to trial, and he obviously didn't want to
cause the (victim's) family any more pain than it has been
caused,'' said Allen's lawyer, Wayne County Public Defender Ronald
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's trial was scheduled to start Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased that we were able to obtain a conviction on
all counts with a maximum sentence without a trial, and the family
is likewise relieved that this is over with,'' said Wayne County
District Attorney Richard Healy.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also waived his right to appeal the conviction.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Rowing Squad Finalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Two-time Olympians Jeff Klepacki and Bob
Kaehler, both members of the United States' men's eight crew that
has won three straight world championships, were among those
selected Tuesday for the team that will compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rowing officials also picked the women's quadruple sculls
crew that finished third at the World Cup in Switzerland this
summer as its Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only country to qualify a full
contingent of 14 boats and 48 athletes for Sydney. Those selected
Tuesday were the final members chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Kaehler was part of all three world championships while Klepacki
was on two. Brown sophomore Dave Simon was the lone newcomer chosen
by men's sweep coach Mike Teti.
</P>
<P>
   Coxswain Pete Cipollone, Chris Ahrens and Garrett Miller also
were part of all three world championship crews. Porter Collins,
Tom Welsh and Bryan Volpenhein were on the last two. Collins will
be participating in his second Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hasn't won a gold medal in the men's eight
since 1964. Americans have earned silver in 1972 and '84 and bronze
in '88 after winning 10 golds in the 12 Olympics from 1900-56.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Korholz and Jennifer Dore-Terhaar were part of the
women's eight that finished fourth at the 1996 Olympics. They'll be
joined in Sydney by Kelly Salchow and Hilary Gehman.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome finished fourth at the 1999 world championships in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has never won an Olympic medal in the women's
quadruple sculls, although an American crew did win a silver medal
in the quad with coxswain in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, both squads have only been nominated. They will
officially be selected when the U.S. Olympic Committee gives final
approval later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Finals for both Olympic events will be Sept. 24.

Caroline Kennedy in Spotlight at Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democrats stirred memories of John F. Kennedy at their
national convention Tuesday, his daughter Caroline taking a rare turn in the
spotlight beckoning delegates to turn the New Frontier into a ''timeless call''
that would send Al Gore to the White House. Gore's father served in the Senate
with John Kennedy and his daughter said she shared a special sense of kinship
with the vice president. The convention oratory unfolded as Gore and President
Clinton campaigned together in Michigan in a ceremony passing the torch of party
leadership to the Democrats' 2000 nominee.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Several dozen protesters were arrested Tuesday during
demonstrations on the second day of the Democratic National Convention, mostly
from an animal-rights protest and a rolling rally by bicyclists. At least 75
people were taken into custody. Forty-five people were arrested as animal rights
activists opposed to the fur trade banged on the windows of businesses,
including a fur shop. About 30 people were taken into custody from a bicycle
rally, but it was unclear whether they would be charged.

Gore,'' Jackson declared at the Democratic National Convention, ''more health
care with Gore, more education with Gore ... more wages with Gore, more freedom
with Gore.'' ''I say America, stay out the Bushes, stay out the Bushes,'' he
chanted as the audience shouted along in a refrain against Republican

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Harold Ford Jr., a rising black star in the South and Al

would energize a new generation of voters while ''some in the other party would
have us go back.'' Ford, 30, a centrist Democrat, was cast in Tuesday night's
prime speaking role to help portray the Democratic ticket as a fresh alternative
to Republican nominee George W. Bush. Though the Texas governor is only two
years older than Gore, the vice president is portraying the race as Old Guard
vs. New Guard.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Racing against time, Russian Navy rescuers prepared to lower a
piloted escape capsule Wednesday to a crippled nuclear submarine in a new
attempt to save the 116 sailors trapped inside, officials said. In an earlier
attempt Wednesday, Russian crews lowered a bell-shaped rescue capsule to the
submarine lying on the Arctic Sea floor, but strong currents and zero visibility
blocked attempts at docking. Oxygen for the vessel's 116 crewmen was expected to
last just two more days, Russia's navy chief said.

<HEADLINE> Advocates won't try again after N.J. Supreme Court strikes down notification law </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Abortion opponents said there was not much
point to revising New Jersey's law requiring minors to notify a
parent before they can get an abortion following the Supreme Court
decision to strike it down.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he saw no room to tighten the
statute he had sponsored and that Gov. Christie Whitman saw fit to
sign even though she is an advocate of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how much more limited it could be,'' Collins
said. Whitman herself issued a brief statement saying the law she
signed ''to increase parental involvement in a minor's decision to
have an abortion'' had been balanced and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Tasy of New Jersey Right To Life, which argued for the law
in court, said the law she helped shepherd through the Legislature
was as limited as it could be and still function.
</P>
<P>
   Tasy said the state Supreme Court showed in its 4-2 ruling
Tuesday it would be unwilling to accept any version of parental
notification, and the best effort now would be get around the
Supreme Court by inserting the rule into the state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had all the bases covered,'' Tasy said. ''It appears that
the only remedy this is to take the courts completely out of the
equation, and it looks like it may be time to change the state
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Deborah Poritz in her majority opinion said the
parental-notification law was unconstitutional ''because a minor's
right to control her reproductive decisions is among the most
fundamental of the rights she possesses,'' and the state failed to
show it had a good reason to interfere with those rights.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Bergen County had upheld the law last
year. The state's highest court accepted the case on direct appeal
and on Tuesday reversed that finding. Because of the litigation,
the law had never been permitted to take effect, and it now stands
nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Tasy said she was outraged by the ruling because the court
ignored public support for the measure. ''This court is completely
out of control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Supreme Court justices had unfairly placed
themselves in the position of lawmakers. ''That is what offends me
the most,'' he said. ''We had one goal. That was to give parents
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Poritz said that while the state government may take steps to
protect parents' rights, the parental-notification requirement
placed an excessive burden on a girl's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We acknowledge that the state has a substantial interest in
preserving the family and protecting the rights of parents. When
weighed against the right of a young woman to make the most
personal and intimate decision whether to carry a child to term,
however, the insubstantial connection between the notification
requirement and the interests expressed by the state is not
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Daniel O'Hern and Peter Verniero dissented, saying the
law did not impair free exercise of the constitutional right to
abortion. New Jersey's version of the law did not require parental
consent, only notice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hern recently retired from the court, and Verniero, appointed
to the bench last year, was also a former attorney general in the
Whitman administration. O'Hern said the federal courts would have
approved this law.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh justice, Marie Garibaldi, had already retired when
the case was argued Jan. 19 and her replacement, Justice Jaynee
LaVecchia, had not yet been sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Poritz said the court deliberately did not address the moral
questions posed by abortion, adding, ''At the end of the day, those
questions are left to the individual to decide for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Poritz made it fairly clear the court's four-member majority
will never accept a law seeking to ban abortion, citing not only
the U.S. Constitution but the state constitution, which has a
clause that protects privacy rights and equal protection of the
laws more specifically than the federal document.
</P>
<P>
   ''A young woman's right to choose, to personal dignity and
autonomy, is imbedded in the liberties found on the constitutions
of the United States and of this state,'' Poritz said.
</P>
<P>
   And even in his dissent, Verniero said he also would vote to
strike down a law ''that infringed on the reproductive rights of
women to any significant degree.'' He just did not agree this law
posed such an infringement.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 10, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After going 3&AMP;frac12; months without a victory,
David Cone has won twice in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (3-10), given a four-run lead before he even throwing his
first pitch, threw five strong innings as the New York Yankees beat
the Texas Rangers 10-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice, Scott Brosius and Paul O'Neill all hit long
two-run homers for the Yankees, who have won 10 straight games
against the Rangers, including three in last year's playoffs. New
York has won 39 of the last 50 games between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Just six days after winning for the first time since April 28 --
ending a 15-start span that saw his go 0-8 -- Cone shut out Texas on
three hits for the first four innings. The Yankees, meanwhile, were
building a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Texas finally broke through when Rusty Greer and Rafael Palmeiro
hit consecutive RBI singles in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was replaced by Dwight Gooden to start the sixth, but like
he did against Oakland last week, Cone left the game with the
Yankees well ahead. New York led 12-2 when he left after six
innings Thursday in a 12-6 victory over Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out three, walked one and allowed just seven hits.
He is 11-3 in 20 career appearances against Texas with a 2.65 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden finished with four shutout innings for his second career
save, his first since 1989 with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   With Boston's 3-1 loss to Tampa Bay on Tuesday night, the
Yankees stretched their lead in the AL East to five games, matching
their largest this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees started the game with three consecutive singles, the
third by O'Neill snapping his 0-for-15 slump and driving in the
first run. After Bernie Williams grounded into a double play, Jose
Canseco's bloop single to right drove in a run and Justice hit a
443-foot homer.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's shot hit midway in the second deck of the right-field
stands, the longest ever hit to that part of The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius celebrated his 34th birthday with a 374-foot homer to
left in the third inning that made it 7-0. Before that, Jose
Canseco had a leadoff walk, Justice doubled and Chris Turner had an
RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada had an RBI double in the fourth, becoming the last
of the New York starters to get a hit. O'Neill's 408-foot homer to
right-center came an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Doug Davis (4-4) after 2 2-3 innings, allowing
seven runs on 10 hits. Davis, who has split time between the
starting rotation and the bullpen for the Rangers this season, is
1-3 with a 11.70 ERA in his five starts.
</P>
<P>
   His early departure upset the Rangers' pitching plans for
Wednesday when they had to bring Jonathan Johnson in for early
relief. Johnson had been slated to start the series finale in place
of Ryan Glynn, who is on the disabled list for tests to determine
why he passed out in the dugout during a game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is now likely headed back to Triple A Oklahoma, and
Brian Sikorski will be called up to make his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Gabe Kapler extended his hitting streak to 28 games, the
longest in the majors this season, when he bounced a single up the
middle against Gooden in the eighth. He was 0-for-3 with three
flyouts until then.
</P>
<P>
Notes: O'Neill broke had just two hits his previous 30 at-bats
before going 2-for-5. ... Justice was a triple shy of the cycle.
... At 54-63, the Rangers are nine games below .500 for the first
time since Sept. 27, 1997. They have been below .500 since July 4.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 7, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Ryan Dempster allowed three hits in eight innings
and Luis Castillo had three hits to help the Florida Marlins beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter F.P. Santangelo broke up Dempster's shutout bid
with his first homer of the year on the first pitch of the eighth.
It was the first run given up by Dempster in 14 career innings
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster (11-8) struck out eight, walked two and retired 15 of
16 batters during one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Braden Looper gave up a two-run double to Chad Kreuter in the
ninth before Antonio Alfonseca retired the final three batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who jumped on Kevin Brown for nine runs in the
first two innings of Monday's 11-2 victory, raced to a 5-0 lead
after three innings against rookie Matt Herges (8-2).
</P>
<P>
   Castillo finished 3-for-4 with a walk, raising his average to
.355. Henry Rodriguez and Preston Wilson each had two hits and two
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers slugger Gary Sheffield was ejected in the eighth inning
by rookie umpire Dan Iassogna. Sheffield was called out on strikes,
then ejected then he drew a line in the dirt with his bat,
indicating he thought the pitch was wide.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took advantage of sloppy fielding by second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek to score four runs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster led off with an infield single and Castillo walked.
Mark Kotsay hit a routine grounder to Grudzielanek, whose soft toss
to first sailed wild for an error, scoring one run. Rodriguez hit
another grounder off Grudzielanek's glove for a two-run single, and
after Wilson singled, Derrek Lee singled home another run.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's sacrifice fly gave Florida a 1-0 lead in the first. He
doubled home a run in the seventh, then scored on a fielder's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Herges, making his second major league start, pitched six
innings and allowed five runs, four earned.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster pitched around two errors by shortstop Andy Fox in the
first. Fox speared a sharp grounder by Eric Karros with a lunging
stop to end the inning and save a run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start was delayed by rain for the second consecutive
night, this time by 43 minutes. ... Dempster shut out the Dodgers
over seven innings in his only other appearance against them on
Sept. 7, 1999. ... Castillo's infield hit in the first inning was
his 44th, most in the major leagues. The three-hit game was his
10th this year. ... Neat feat: The Dodgers are just two games above
.500 but have a winning record both at home and on the road. ...
Herges lost on the road for the first time in seven decisions.

<HEADLINE> Mets Beat Rockies in Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd Helton went 4-for-8 with three doubles and
a homer to inch closer to .400, but Todd Zeile's tiebreaking homer
in eighth inning helped the New York Mets sweep a doubleheader from
the Colorado Rockies, 7-5 and 4-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets drew eight walks -- including two with the bases loaded
in the seventh inning -- and broke a tie on a run-scoring wild pitch
to win the opener 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won 18 of 22 games to move within two games of
Atlanta in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is hitting .396 -- the highest anyone has been this late
in the season since George Brett was batting over .400 in September
1980 before finishing at .390. Ted Williams, who hit .406 in 1941,
is the last major leaguer to hit .400 over a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who is 17-for-24 in the first seven games of Colorado's
road trip, has raised his average 26 points in the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   He had an RBI double in the second inning and doubled and scored
in the fourth as the Rockies broke out to a 4-2 lead in the opener.
He added an RBI double in the first inning of the nightcap and a
solo homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The triple crown isn't out of the question, either. Helton has
30 homers and 104 RBIs, trailing Sammy Sosa by eight and three,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great hitter,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He
covers all pitches and all speeds. He uses all fields. He has great
balance. He's mechanically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, whose error in the seventh helped Colorado tie the game
at 3, hit a 3-2 pitch from Bobby Chouinard (1-2) down the
left-field line just over the glove of a leaping Todd Hollandsworth
to give the Mets the lead with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball cleared the fence, Hollandsworth slumped against the
wall and Zeile triumphantly rounded the bases for his 16th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had tied it in the seventh. Hollandsworth reached
second when Zeile misplayed his grounder to first for an error and
right fielder Bubba Trammell slipped while fielding the ball for
another error. After a sacrifice, Todd Walker hit an RBI groundout
that Zeile bobbled, leaving him only a play at first.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (8-5) had little trouble with anyone other than
Helton in the Colorado lineup, allowing three runs -- two earned --
and four hits in eight innings. He has won four straight starts and
is 7-2 with a 2.87 ERA since returning from a demotion to the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth inning of both games, giving
him 31 saves in 35 chances. He did allow an RBI single to Larry
Walker in the opener, ending a streak of 21 innings without
allowing an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, the Mets rallied from a 4-2 deficit with four
runs in the seventh. Todd Pratt, who went 3-for-4 and scored three
times, led off with a double and went to third on Lenny Harris'
pinch-hit single.
</P>
<P>
   The next five batters didn't put the ball in play, but the Mets
took the lead thanks to four walks. Craig House (1-1) walked
Edgardo Alfonzo with the bases loaded and Mike Myers did the same
to Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo scored the go-ahead run on Jose Jimenez's wild pitch,
and Jay Payton added an RBI groundout. Two throwing errors by
Jimenez and another run-scoring wild pitch helped the Mets add a
run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook (6-2) got one out for the win.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Helton leads the league in batting, slugging, on-base
percentage, runs scored, hits, doubles, and total bases. ...
Rockies rookie OF Juan Pierre has hit safely in all 10 games he's
batted in. He also made a diving catch to rob Bubba Trammell of
extra bases in the fourth inning of Game 2. Trammell ended up with
a sacrifice fly. ... Rockies pitcher John Wasdin singled in his
second career at-bat, while Jones went 0-for-2 and is hitless in 30
at-bats this season. He was robbed of a hit in the fifth inning
when SS Neifi Perez made a leaping grab. ... The crowd of 29,724
pushed the Mets past 2 million in attendance in their 58th home
date.

<HEADLINE> Pedro Confident Shoulder OK  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox are in a playoff race as tight
as Pedro Martinez's shoulder. At a time when his team can't afford
to lose him, he says he doesn't expect to miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see why not,'' he said Tuesday night when asked if he
could take his regular turn in the rotation Saturday against Texas.
Then he was checked by team physician Dr. William Morgan, watched
his team lose to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3-1 and pronounced
himself improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling better,'' he said after the game. ''I'm supposed
to throw (Wednesday). Hopefully, everything will go all right. ...
I'm optimistic everything is going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pulled himself out of Monday night's 7-3 win over the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays with a stiff shoulder in the fourth inning,
his shortest start of the season. He already has had one stint on
the disabled list this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm normally pretty stubborn about staying out there but I'm
at the stage where I can't afford to go on the disabled list
again,'' he said. ''The team needs me, so I decided to play it
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL strikeout leader didn't have the usual pop on his
fastball. Baseball's ERA leader even gave up a three-run homer to
Miguel Cairo, who hadn't homered all season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Red Sox, who have struggled at the plate recently,
needed a grand slam by Rico Brogna in the bottom of the ninth to
pull out the victory that left them 1&AMP;frac12; games behind Oakland and
one-half game behind Cleveland in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's game, Martinez appeared cheerful as he
awaited an examination on his stiff right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's OK. He's a player,'' he said of the light-hitting
Cairo's homer. ''I can give them up just like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he felt fine throwing between starts in Texas,
where Boston wrapped up a three-game series Sunday. So he was
surprised when the shoulder felt stiff as he stretched before
Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave one inning, two innings,'' he said. ''The third inning
it got a little tighter and then the fourth inning I couldn't even
throw the ball. So I just said, 'No, I'm coming out.' It was my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Hipolito Pichardo, Rod Beck and Derek Lowe shut down
the Devil Rays the rest of the way, but even Boston's outstanding
bullpen can't carry the team the way Martinez can.
</P>
<P>
   He's 13-4 with a 1.59 ERA and 210 strikeouts, 62 more than
Cleveland's Bartolo Colon, who is second in the AL. Opponents'
batting average of .170 against last year's Cy Young award winner
is the lowest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has no intention of returning to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of the picture. Disabled list and stuff like that, missing
a start's out of the picture. Hopefully,'' he said. ''I know my
body and I know I was just stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitched only four innings in Game 1 of Boston's
first-round playoff series last year against Cleveland before
leaving with shoulder stiffness, but he returned to throw six
no-hit innings of relief as Boston won the decisive fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted just 3 2-3 innings on July 18, 1999, against the
Florida Marlins, allowing nine runs -- seven earned -- and 12 hits.
He went on the disabled list after that game.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he struck out five batters in two innings
before Cairo homered in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was perfectly fine in Texas,'' he said. ''After traveling
it's so uncomfortable, pulling your bag around and, I guess,
sleeping uncomfortably I think made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox in the middle of a 10-game homestand that ends
next Wednesday, Martinez can sleep in his own bed and, he hopes,
pitch from his own mound on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> SI: Romanowskis' Friend Got Pills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski and
his wife directed a friend to obtain more than 500 appetite
suppressant pills -- more than five times the amount that would have
been prescribed on a standard diet plan, according to law
enforcement documents obtained by Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reported in this week's edition that the
Romanowskis directed Lori Johnson to obtain the large quantities of
Phentermine, a controlled substance, from September 1998 to January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski was indicted last week on four felony counts accusing
him of using the diet drug, which some doctors believe helps
athletes by speeding up their metabolisms. He is due to appear in
court Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Romanowski faces eight counts of fraudulently obtaining a
controlled substance and conspiracy. Her scheduled arraignment was
postponed until Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Dr. Randall Snook were accused of participating.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to illegally
obtain a prescription drug. Snook pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
and received 18 months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's lawyer told the magazine that on numerous occasions,
at the Romanowskis' request, Johnson obtained Phentermine and
prescription-strength ephedrine and delivered both to the
Romanowskis' house.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources close to the case, SI said former
Bronco Martin Harrison provided a written statement to prosecutors
detailing Romanowski's alleged offers of pregame stimulants. One
white player told the grand jury that Romanowski suggested the
substances would allow him and Romanowski to compete on a level
field with African-American players, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Douglas County, Colo., sheriff's department,
which was involved in the investigation, said Tuesday night the
sheriff's office wasn't aware of the allegations and couldn't
comment on the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   SI said Romanowski's lawyer Jeff Springer acknowledged that the
grand jury looked at the possibility his client was providing drugs
to players, but, Springer said: ''The jurors obviously rejected
that theory.'' He also denied Romanowski said anything about black
players.
</P>
<P>
   Springer and Romanowski's other attorney, Harvey Steinberg, did
not return phone messages Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   KCNC-TV in Denver reported that Romanowski's attorneys planned a
news conference Wednesday to discuss the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 9, Mariners 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Knuckleballer Steve Sparks held Seattle hitless
until the sixth inning and pitched his first major league shutout,
leading the Detroit Tigers over the Mariners 9-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The AL West-leading Mariners lost their season-high fourth in a
row. Dean Palmer and Juan Gonzalez homered as Detroit won for the
fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks finished with a five-hitter in his first complete game in
the majors since May 24, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (3-2), who spent most of the season at Triple-A Toledo,
struck out six and walked one. He faced only 30 batters, and just
two runners reached second base.
</P>
<P>
   Making his sixth start for the Tigers, Sparks did not give up a
hit until Carlos Guillen's double with two outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks pitched for Anaheim last season and was signed by the
Tigers as a minor league free agent March 26 after being released
by Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer drove in four runs for the fourth time this season with a
two-run homer, his team-leading 23rd, and a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who had a season-high four hits, hit a two-run homer
in the eighth. The Tigers finished with 17 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (13-7) surrendered six runs on 11 hits and a walk in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit opened the game with consecutive doubles by Rich Becker
and Juan Encarnacion to take a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Bobby Higginson singled and Gonzalez doubled
before Palmer singled them in.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hit a 396-foot homer into the center-field stands after
Gonzalez opened the fifth with a single.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Higginson had an RBI double before Gonzalez's
19th homer and second in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of a three-game series, the Tigers have
outscored Seattle 24-4 and outhit the Mariners 35-14. The Tigers
had 18 hits in a 15-4 win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Notes: LF Rickey Henderson was out of the Mariners' lineup for the
second day in a row because of a sore right leg. ''He'll probably
be better tomorrow,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ''If not tomorrow,
Friday.'' The Mariners are off Thursday and open a six-game road
trip Friday night in Cleveland. ... Palmer had three hits in a game
for the seventh time this season. ... The Tigers are 48-18 when
they score four runs or more. ... The Mariners were shut out for
the fifth time, while the Tigers had their fourth shutout.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 5, Indians 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ben Grieve homered and drove in two runs
as the Oakland Athletics defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs also drove in two runs as the A's won for the third
time in four games following a season high six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mulder (7-8) won for just the second time since June 25, a
span of nine starts. He went six innings, allowing two runs on five
hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen, who had two blown saves and a loss in his
previous three outings, recorded his 26th save in 33 opportunities
by pitching a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba (10-5) lost for the first time in six starts after
allowing four runs -- two earned -- on four hits and four walks. He
struck out eight in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The A's beat the Indians for the second straight night and moved
two games ahead of them in the wild-card race. Cleveland lost for
just the fourth time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder survived a shaky first inning in which he walked the
bases loaded with one out, but then induced David Segui to ground
into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Burba walked the bases loaded in the first with two outs, and
the A's capitalized when Stairs doubled home two runs. Burba issued
four walks in the opening inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians responded with a run in the second. Wil Cordero
singled and eventually scored on Jolbert Cabrera's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The A's added a pair of unearned runs in the second. With one
out, Randy Velarde was safe on second baseman Roberto Alomar's
fielding error. Miguel Tejada followed with a run-scoring double
and after Jason Giambi struck out, Grieve doubled home Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve hit his 22nd home run of the season, a solo shot off
Justin Speier with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Segui scored Cleveland's second run on Einar Diaz's groundout in
the fourth. Manny Ramirez singled home Kenny Lofton in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Segui, who has hit safely in 14 of the 15 games he's played
for the Indians, has not made an error in 45 games at first base.
... A's OF Terrence Long didn't start the game because of a rib
contusion on his right side, but did enter the game as a defensive
replacement. ... Burba has a 3.41 ERA since his last loss on July
6. ... All seven walks recorded by the starting pitchers came in
the first inning. ... Oakland has now scored first in three of its
last four games after not doing so in its previous 10 contests. ...
Lofton snapped an 0-for-14 streak with a single in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Still no significant progress to resolve phone strike  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Scant progress is being reported in contract
talks to return thousands of striking phone technicians and
operators for Verizon Communications to work.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by 87,000 employees for Verizon, the nation's largest
local phone company, entered its 11th day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 managers have been filling in for striking
employees. To alleviate some of the pressure on managers, several
hundreds retired workers have agreed to help out.
</P>
<P>
   Talks adjourned late Tuesday with very limited success, union
and company spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been exchanging proposals back and forth,'' said Jeff
Miller, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America. ''So
far we cannot report a great deal of progress, but our negotiators
are in constant touch and are working hard on the major issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
wish to scale back a provision for mandatory overtime, which can
amount to up to 15 extra hours a week. Union officials said the
clause was intended to give the company flexibility during
emergencies, but is used too liberally.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it is an answer to the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone
company, was formed from the summer merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said the company is working to
complete 80,000 to 90,000 pending repairs. He said 200 to 300
retired workers have agreed to join thousands of managers filling
in for the striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by about 87,200 members of the two unions affects
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Light Rail Train Crashes at Airport  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL CUSICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A light rail train carrying passengers to
Baltimore-Washington International Airport slammed into a steel
safety barrier outside the airport's International Pier on Tuesday,
injuring 22 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 7:15 a.m. accident was the second this year involving a
light rail train approaching the stop at the busy airport.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not know how many passengers were on the train,
but said most of the 22 injured were in the front car with the
operator, identified as Dentis David Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were treated mainly for bruises, back and neck pain
and contusions.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has driven light-rail trains since 1994, told police
that he ''blacked out'' while pulling into the station, according
to a police report. He was treated for minor injuries and submitted
to drug and alcohol tests immediately after the accident, officials
said. Results of those tests were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck left the front of the train crushed and ridden up onto
the abutment at the end of the line, damaging the roof of the
terminal, Mass Transit Administration spokesman Frank Fulton said.
Investigators had not ruled out mechanical failure as the cause of
the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Allen, chief of the airport fire and rescue department,
said when firefighters arrived, there were people both inside and
outside the train, with some lying on the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Davis, a passenger who injured his shoulder, said he had
to manually open a door on the train to leave the car after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train started to slow down, I got up to get off, and it
sped back up,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 26-year veteran of the MTA, has had his driving record
come under scrutiny after three minor accidents in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Transit Administrator Ronald Freeman said Thomas was
cleared in two of the incidents where motor vehicles ran into his
train at rail crossings. But in July 1999, Thomas was suspended for
three days after a car he was driving derailed in a railyard.
</P>
<P>
   A similar light-rail crash at the BWI terminal in February
injured 24, and led to the firing of the train's driver, who was
accused of using prescription and illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line connects the airport and Baltimore's Penn Station.
The first leg of the light rail system, which also serves other
points, opened in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lowers Capsule To Sunken Sub  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Racing against time, Russian Navy rescuers began
lowering a piloted escape capsule Wednesday to a crippled nuclear
submarine in a new attempt to save the 116 sailors trapped inside,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bid came after two earlier attempts during the night
to lower a bell-shaped rescue capsule to the submarine Kursk failed
because they ran out of air and poor visibility made it impossible
to connect with the submarine. Oxygen for the vessel's 116 crewmen
was expected to last just two more days, Russia's navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
   A second rescue capsule also was being prepared in case it was
needed to assist to bring survivors to the surface, navy officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to connect with the submarine during the night were
frustrated by strong currents and swirling sand that made it very
difficult to see, the navy said. A rescue capsule was forced back
to the surface during the night after running out of air, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sunken submarine, which U.S. officials said might have gone
down following an explosion, was lying motionless 354 feet below
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The navy chief, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said the situation was
''extremely grave'' with oxygen inside the craft expected to run
out Friday. Navy officials said water appeared to be leaking into
the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov described what appeared to be extensive damage. He
said the submarine's periscope was up but its navigation room was
damaged, the railing was dented and the protective cover of two
missile tubes on the vessel's right side was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. government officials said Tuesday in Washington that a
Navy submarine in the area detected the sound of an explosion and
it was the ''working assumption'' that the noise was related to the
sinking of the Kursk. The officials, who spoke to The Associated
Press on condition they not be named, said the sound was not a
missile being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said earlier Tuesday that there appeared to have been
an explosion in the torpedo compartment in the nose of the
submarine, sending it crashing to the sea bottom. He said earlier
that the Kursk had likely collided with something and it wasn't
clear why he had changed his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the crew wasn't clear. Kuroyedov said the sailors
were sending out signals, apparently referring to the sounds that
officials have described as possible pounding on the submarine's
hull. But other Navy officials said there had been no communication
since it went down over the weekend during a military exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Navy said visibility near the Kursk submarine was
only 6 to 15 feet and there were strong currents, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue operation faced severe difficulties. The bell-shaped
capsule must latch on to a cargo hatch on the submarine, a
precision maneuver made even more challenging because the Kursk was
reportedly leaning at a sharp angle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bell-shape capsule had successfully docked with the
sub and sailors entered it, the capsule can hold only 20 people at
a time and officials say bringing it to the surface could take up
to seven hours. The slow rise is necessary to prevent decompression
sickness -- the potentially crippling or fatal condition known as
''the bends.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a laborious and nerve-fraying process under the best
of circumstances, and weather forecasts indicated conditions in the
disaster area would be rough for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Russia refused offers from the United States and Britain to send
trained rescue personnel and equipment even though the Russian navy
lacks sophisticated rescue gear. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo
said coordinating the rescue with other countries would take too
much time and ''we cannot afford to waste it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a group of Russian military officers went to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday night to see what
kind of assistance the alliance could offer, NATO said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said Tuesday that the sound of the explosion
was detected Saturday. The Russian government has said the accident
that brought down the Kursk happened Sunday during military
exercises. The discrepancy could not be explained.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley declined to say what,
if anything, U.S. vessels may have heard from their position ''a
couple of hundred'' miles away from the place the sub went down.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion inside the submarine's torpedo chamber, which
contains warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties,
analysts said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ''ruled
out,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   While immediate concerns focused on the crew, there was also
worry over whether the accident would result in a leak of
radioactive material. The prospects of such a leak were difficult
to assess because it is not known what befell the Kursk, one of the
Russian navy's most modern ships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the Kursk's two nuclear reactors had been
switched off and it was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said. Submarines are divided into compartments that can
be sealed in case of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something extraordinary beyond the imagination of an
engineer'' had happened, the chief designer of the submarine, Igor
Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past. The U.S.
Navy said Monday it had a monitoring ship in the area, but Quigley
said there was no evidence that any U.S. vessel was involved in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.

<HEADLINE> What Will Speech Do For Ford?  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee hit
the big time Tuesday night with the nationally televised keynote
speech at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did great. He was smooth and made no mistakes, and he
looked good,'' said Tennessee Sen. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, who lost
to Ford in the congressman's 1996 race for the seat held 22 years
by his father, Harold Ford Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Now what's the 30-year-old Ford Jr. going to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Democrats -- including his mother Dorothy -- speculate
that Ford's ultimate ambition is to become the nation's first black
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've heard of the sticky floor and glass ceiling, but for
him the sky is the limit. He's made for politics,'' she said,
beaming with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week about his political future, Ford lifted his arm
to the sky and said, ''If this is the trajectory I'm on, I like
where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   He flirted this year with the idea of challenging U.S. Sen. Bill
Frist, a rising star among Republicans, but decided against it
because the deep-pocketed former surgeon is considered virtually
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford considered it, he gave anti-Frist speeches throughout
the state, introducing himself to key Democratic activists and
priming the pump for a possible run down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got the advantage of a race without having to make a
race,'' said Marcus Pohlmann, chairman of the political science
department at Rhodes College in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Ford's charisma, centrist leanings and political
savvy, winning a statewide race would be tough, Pohlmann said.
</P>
<P>
   First, the state is now heavily Republican. The governor, both
senators and five of nine congressmen belong to the GOP. Second,
getting statewide Democratic support from a base in Memphis, in the
state's southwest corner, is tough. Third, no black politician has
ever been elected to a statewide office in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether the party or the state have come far enough to elect
an African-American, I don't know. It certainly will be an issue
and a hurdle,'' Pohlmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Tennessee Democrats say privately that Ford's biggest
liability in winning statewide office is his family, which for
decades has operated a major political machine in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is his father Harold Ford Sr., the first black
Tennessee congressman, who defeated a well-entrenched white
Republican in 1974. Ford Sr. has been perceived as racially
divisive; he once referred to backers of a black Republican
opponent as ''white devils.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His father has really sunk into the background. I think that
is purposeful for Harold Jr.'s advantage,'' Pohlmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Ford's uncles, state Sen. John Ford, could pose a
real problem for his nephew, depending on the outcome of state and
federal investigations into an alleged kickback scheme involving
government payments to childcare centers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of risking his safe congressional seat for a Senate
race, Ford could move up in the leadership's ranks and position
himself for higher office that way. Or perhaps there's a Cabinet
post with his name on it in an Al Gore administration.

<HEADLINE> 75 DNC Protesters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Several dozen protesters were arrested
Tuesday during demonstrations on the second day of the Democratic
National Convention, mostly from an animal-rights protest and a
rolling rally by bicyclists. At least 75 people were taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five people were arrested as animal rights activists
opposed to the fur trade banged on the windows of businesses,
including a fur shop.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 to 50 people were taken into custody from a bicycle
rally, but it was unclear whether they would be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates and reporters leaving the convention were met by
hecklers shouting ''Shame, Shame, Shame'' and chanting anti-death
penalty slogans as they walked to shuttle buses and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I don't have a problem with that. I think it's
healthy,'' said Indiana state Rep. Sheila Klinker. A colleague of
hers from the state delegation disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really ironic is that this whole convention probably
supports the protesters rights and they are infringing on our
rights,'' said Sue Wanzer, of Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Most protests Tuesday were smaller than demonstrations Monday
that culminated in a clash between police and a crowd at a free
concert in the protest zone outside the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Police met the animal rights protesters about eight blocks from
arena, and kept the public and the media out of a two-block area
around a bank while they made arrests.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people gathered on the periphery, clapping, banging
drums and shouting for the streets to be re-opened before police
ordered them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were peaceful demonstrators. It was a lawful assembly. This
is an unlawful arrest,'' Geoff Kerns said as he and others were
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   At Edward Borovay Furs, where protesters banged on the windows,
workers quickly moved to hide the shop's name by spray-painting an
awning and removing a sign.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were charged with conspiracy to commit a felony
based on items found in their backpacks, including flammable
liquids and small fireworks, said Cmdr. David Kalish, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 bicyclists snarled downtown traffic during the
evening rush in a ''critical mass protest'' seeking more bike lanes
and other facilities for cyclists. The string of bike riders and
police trailing them stretched the length of a city block. Cyclists
wove through cars, rang bike bells and waved signs that said ''End
slavery to the oil and automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing them to ride around the city for more than an
hour, police detained more than 30 people near the convention
center, including an Associated Press reporter who was following
the demonstrators on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Pasquariello, a police spokesman, said not all of
those detained had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In other events:
</P>
<P>
   -- The American Civil Liberties Union said it would sue the Los
Angeles Police Department for its treatment of the media during
Monday night's clash, accusing police of specifically targeting
reporters to keep them from doing their jobs. Police had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   -- As dusk fell Tuesday, about 500 demonstrators, including gay
activists, marched from Pershing Square, a hub for protest
activity, to a cluster of government buildings about eight blocks
away. They fell silent in front of one of the buildings, leaving
only the whirring sounds of police helicopters hovering overhead.
Police eventually let the group return to the square.
</P>
<P>
   -- Demonstrators carrying dove puppets made of shredded white
cloth marched from the abandoned $170 million Belmont Learning
Center to the nearby office of Gov. Gray Davis. Some chanted,
''Schools not jails!'' The school project was abandoned after it
was learned it was being built on contaminated land.
</P>
<P>
   -- Protesters supporting unions and women's rights moved from
Pershing Square to a downtown federal building where two lines of
U.S. marshals and police in riot helmets blocked them from
entering. ''LAPD, go away! Racist, sexist, anti-gay!'' a crowd of
hundreds chanted.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming May Worsen Allergies  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allergy sufferers, beware: Global warming
could bring more hay fever, according to government research that
shows ragweed produces significantly more pollen as carbon dioxide
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous weed makes nearly twice as much pollen now as it
did 100 years ago and will likely double its production again over
the coming century with predicted increases in carbon dioxide
levels, the Agriculture Department study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ''This research may help us better understand the troubling
impact of high carbon dioxide levels on our environment and our
health,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent to 20 percent of the population has hay fever --
or allergic reactions to plant pollen, dust and other airborne
particles -- and ragweed is the major cause of the problem in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is found all over the country and is particularly
prevalent in the Northeast and Midwest. The pollen grains are so
small that they can travel many miles.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory study done by USDA in 1998 and 1999 found that
ragweed pollen counts went from 5.5 grams per plant at
carbon-dioxide levels that existed in 1900 to 10 grams at current
levels. At predicted CO2 levels in the year 2100, the pollen count
would reach 20 grams per plant.
</P>
<P>
   Results of USDA's lab study are to be published in an upcoming
issue of World Resource Review, a journal of climate-change issues.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Harvard University are doing similar research this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pretty good first sign'' that climate change will be
a problem for allergy sufferers, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior
scientist at Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe a warming of the Earth has been under
way for a century and has accelerated over the past 20 years. The
warming has been linked to a ''greenhouse effect'' caused by
manmade pollution and increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   While that could be good for farmers, because higher levels of
carbon dioxide would increase some crop yields, it also could
aggravate weed problems, and the effects on allergies and other
health concerns have not been studied sufficiently, Rosenzweig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Plants, which use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, react to
the gas differently. An earlier study found that trees exposed to
increased CO2 grow 25 percent faster than those without it.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA researchers expanded their ragweed study this summer by
planting the weed in controlled conditions outdoors in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Plants that were set out in Baltimore, where it is hotter and
carbon-dioxide levels are higher than outside the city, are growing
significantly faster than at a rural site, said Lewis Ziska, a
plant physiologist who is leading the research.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones that are growing in the city are bigger and have more
pollen, on the order of a third bigger,'' Ziska said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if pollen production does grow as CO2 levels increase,
it remains to be seen how that will affect individual allergy
sufferers, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitivity levels vary among people who are allergic to
ragweed, said Robert Bush, an allergy specialist at the University
of Wisconsin medical school.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are highly sensitive, ''once you reach a certain
threshold, adding more pollen to those people isn't going to make a
lot of difference,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Consider Research Finance Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A new era of biotechnology economics that
promises some scientists great wealth may cause conflicts of
interest that affect patient safety and undermine medical research,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   At a National Institutes of Health conference Tuesday, speakers
said that researchers who have a financial interest in drug
companies may bias medical findings, put patients at risk and erode
public trust in the integrity of health science.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a crisis in confidence develops, if research subjects no
longer feel safe, then medical research will grind to a halt,''
said Jane Henney, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials called the conference to gather information
that may later be used to write new federal regulations controlling
oversight of conflict of interest in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Henney said the death last September of 18-year-old Jesse
Gelsinger, a test subject in a gene therapy trial, caused the
government and research institutions to take a close look at highly
profitable arrangements that some researchers enjoy with companies
that are financing their research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Questions were raised about financial interests of
investigators and whether these interests clouded their judgment in
decisions that were made,'' said Henney.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger died in an experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania's gene therapy program led by Dr. James Wilson. It
later was learned that a company founded by Wilson funded part of
the Penn research. The company, Genovo Inc., later was sold to a
bigger company and Wilson got a reported $13.5 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's gene therapy research has been suspended by the FDA, in
part because the agency found that researchers did not report two
other serious reactions from it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has not commented publicly on violations cited by FDA,
but will have an opportunity to challenge the agency's findings. He
did say of Gelsinger: ''We may have activated his immune system
very early.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed that there was a swift rise of immune system
proteins, just as there were with other patients who had been
involved in the therapy. But for Gelsinger, the proteins never
receded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, a clinical professor at the University
of California, San Francisco, said financial conflict of interest
among researchers can ''impact the practice of tens of thousands of
physicians'' who are guided by the research in treating millions of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investigators who allow bias or error to infect their work are
practicing scientific misconduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer said such bias includes reporting only good results
in a drug trial, making claims not justified by the evidence and
''outright fraud with fabrication of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most drug trials are paid for by pharmaceutical
firms creates a great risk of bias and inaccurate results.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, said Bodenheimer, an analysis of 70 studies on the
safety of a heart drug found that 96 percent of authors who had
drug company ties found the drugs to be safe, while among experts
with no drug company connections only 37 percent said the drugs
were safe.
</P>
<P>
   When drug companies pay for research into the effectiveness of
their own pain relievers, said Bodenheimer, 100 percent find their
drug superior to a competitor's.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of company-funded studies published in peer-reviewed
journals found that results of the studies favored the company's
products 98 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples of conflict of interest cited by
Bodenheimer:
</P>
<P>
   --Private physicians may be paid $1,000 to $5,000 for each
patient recruited for a drug trial, leading doctors to enroll
patients who don't belong in the drug trials or who don't have the
disease being studied.
</P>
<P>
   --Trials excluding older people can make it appear that a drug
works better than it really does. Up to 75 percent of people
recruited for cancer studies are younger than 65 because older
people respond more poorly to chemotherapy, though 63 percent of
cancer patients in the United States are over 65.
</P>
<P>
   --Drug companies own the data from drug trials and may manipulate
its publication.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out Wiretapping Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The telecommunications industry and privacy
groups are applauding a court decision throwing out new phone
surveillance capabilities required by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by a federal appeals court Tuesday dealt law
enforcement authorities a setback in their efforts to keep
criminals from using such telephone features as conference calls
and call-forwarding to thwart surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could also have implications for the FBI's new
''Carnivore'' system, which can monitor e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The court threw out portions of rules adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission last year, including one provision that
required phone carriers to provide to law enforcement agents all
numbers dialed after the subject of a wiretap order connects a
call. That was intended to ensure authorities could get the actual
number being called, even if a suspect first used a 1-800 number or
a calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups had argued that the provision could give
authorities access to information beyond the scope of the wiretap
such as credit card or bank account numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia agreed and sent that back to the commission.
Another provision struck down would have given investigators
information about parties to a conference call, even if some are
put on hold and are no longer talking to the target of the legal
wiretap. Authorities also could have determined when someone was
using call-forwarding, three-way calling or other features or when
that person placed a call even if it was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and industry groups welcomed the court action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court told the FCC that it was wrong to give in to the
FBI's surveillance demands at the cost of privacy,'' said James X.
Dempsey, Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, head of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association called the rules ''nothing more than a massive power
grab, going well beyond current law without the consent of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   And the United States Telecom Association warned that the
provisions thrown out by the court could have raised phone rates
for residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's rules, set in place nearly a year ago, helped to
implement a 1994 law, after the Justice Department, FBI and the
telecommunications industry failed to agree on a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials expressed hope that the court's concerns can
be addressed to keep the rules in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, we're seeing now folks engaged in criminal
activity using those types of technology to thwart law
enforcement,'' said Stephen Colgate, assistant attorney general at
the Justice Department. He cited calling cards as one way to
frustrate investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling upheld provisions that require
telecommunication carriers to provide information on so-called
digital packet-switched communications. In these types of
communications, calls are broken up into a number of data packets
carrying both identifying information and content. These packets
travel different routes on the network and are reassembled at their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates had argued that because the content and the
information identifying the caller cannot be separated, the
government would get more than a simple trace order allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The court did stipulate in its decision that law enforcement
agencies still need lawful authorization to intercept content. That
typically would require officials to meet a higher legal standard
to obtain a search warrant, rather than just a ''pen register''
trace order.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups said the court's assertion could have
implications for Carnivore, the FBI's court-approved system for
monitoring people's e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has clarified the legal standards that law
enforcement must meet before monitoring new modes of
communications. The decision calls into question the legality of
the FBI's controversial Carnivore system,'' said David Sobel,
general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate said the Justice Department will take into account the
court's decision as part of its ongoing review of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   The court also left intact a provision that allowed police, with
a judge's permission, to track cellular phone users by their
location at the beginning and end of a call.

<P>
   The seasonally adjusted increases in both the overall Consumer
Price Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, and its core
rate matched many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation performance could help persuade Federal Reserve
policy-makers to leave interest rates unchanged at their meeting
next Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 24.91 at 11,042.09.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.45 at 1,487.88, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 35.84 at 3,887.50.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $3.625 to $50.124, and Wal Mart was down $2.187 to
$49.563.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   A government report showed that consumer prices rose a mild 0.2
percent last month, as the cost of gasoline and natural gas eased
after soaring in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose just 0.2
percent, for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that most other
prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their plan is working, interest rates will
likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates. However, a slower economy also creates
less robust expectations for corporate profits, especially in the
retail sector,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and chief
investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher. Internet portal
companies Yahoo!, up $2.625 to $134.938, and Lycos, up $2.312 to
$60.25, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 300.7 million shares,
up from Tuesday's early pace.

<HEADLINE> Waters Aims at Mainstream Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
By BEN NUCKOLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- John Waters may not be mellowing, but this cult
purveyor of bad-taste flicks has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The trash poet of Baltimore -- and the man responsible for some
of the most repulsive scenes ever depicted on film -- admits that
his days as the ratings board's worst nightmare are over.
</P>
<P>
   At 54, Waters, who made a scandalous splash with 1972's ''Pink
Flamingos,'' has put most of his trashiness behind him. His recent
films include the kinder, gentler comedies ''Hairspray,'' ''Serial
Mom'' and ''Pecker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to make people laugh,'' he said in an interview
before last weekend's opening of ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' the story
of a guerrilla filmmaker and his followers who are willing to die --
and kill -- if that's what it takes to finish shooting a scene.
</P>
<P>
   According to studio estimates Sunday, Waters' madcap assault on
Hollywood fillmmaking scored an impressive opening. ''Cecil B.
DeMented'' took in $130,000 at nine theaters for a $14,444
per-screen average.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said the film is a response to an age when shock value is
blase and not an attempt to relive his earlier career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm making fun of myself in this movie by asking, 'What is an
edge anymore? Do you have to die? Is that the only thing left, now
that everyone's hip, every critic is hip, and everything I used to
do 20 years ago is on TV?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil B. DeMented (Stephen Dorff) is a cinematic terrorist who
abducts spoiled Hollywood star Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith)
during a film premiere in Baltimore, forcing her to star in his
shoot-and-run film. Waters wrote the script several years ago. Even
then, he wanted Dorff (''City of Industry,'' ''Blade''), now 27, to
star.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he could play it without camping it up, without
winking to the audience,'' Waters said. ''If he was bringing some
kind of shtick to it, it wouldn't have worked. But I think you
really believe him. He looks like he really is that insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil and his Sprocket Holes crew terrorize the audience at
''Patch Adams: The Director's Cut'' and take over the set of the
sequel to ''Forrest Gump'' starring Kevin Nealon.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Waters' style, it comes off as very funny when you play
it straight,'' Dorff said. ''I don't know how to do it any other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, 43, whose films include 1988's ''Working Girl,'' was
also his first choice. She is ''very close to the humor about what
a 40-year-old woman has to do to reinvent herself, to be a movie
star today,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't make any movies that star a 40-year-old woman. They
usually don't even make movies with women anymore. It's usually
digital effects and Harrison Ford, or another male movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of movie ''Cecil B. DeMented'' skewers,
and it's the kind of movie that's invading Baltimore, Waters'
native city and the setting for all his films.
</P>
<P>
   Long accustomed to sharing the city only with Barry Levinson,
Waters has seen a booming film industry spring up around him --
thanks to the efforts of the Maryland Film Commission. Big-budget
productions ''Runaway Bride'' and ''The Replacements,'' which also
opened last weekend, are among the films that have been shot in
Maryland in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' Waters satirizes the film commission
as a collection of raw-oyster-slurping fat cats who cravenly court
and promote vapid films, but said it was all in fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm making a joke of it because Cecil would be against them,''
Waters said. ''The Maryland Film Commission's job is not to decide
the quality of films that come here. Cecil would think they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Film Commission co-director Mike Styer proved that he
was in on the joke by presenting Waters with a painting of the
Apex, the city's venerable porn theater, at the film's world
premiere in Baltimore. He also expressed his gratitude to Waters
for making Maryland an attractive film location.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are coming to do movies here because of all the
wonderful people who started with John and have worked with him
over the years,'' Styer said.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere was as raucous as expected, with laughs at every
familiar face and inside joke. Waters has so many recurring cast
members, stylistic hallmarks and similar themes running through his
movies that part of the fun is trying to spot everything.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Waters puts a character with an addiction in every
film. In this case, Adrian Grenier (''The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole'') plays an equal-opportunity drug addict who is always
sniffing, snorting or smoking something. In a hilarious, throwaway
moment, he offers crack to Griffith's character, and even this bit
was taken from the director's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I smoked crack once, accidentally, last year,'' Waters said.
''This sort of disreputable friend of mine was smoking a pipe and I
thought it was pot. It was quite an experience. I thought, 'Oh, no,
I'm going to get addicted, I'm going to spend the whole budget, I'm
going to rob my parents! A crack addict at 54! How undignified!'''
</P>
<P>
   Former kidnap victim Patricia Hearst, who is a member of Waters'
informal repertory company, has a small role in the new film.
</P>
<P>
   ''People really like that Patty Hearst did this movie,
especially. They're sort of stunned that she would be in a kidnap
comedy,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   For Hearst, the explanation is simple: ''I love his scripts, I
love his sense of humor, I just love his style.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too difficult to understand why. However outrageous the
subject matter, his recent films have been more inspired than the
gross-out comedies currently dominating the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Waters knows what it would take to top his previous
forays into shock cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it would be witty if -- as my last movie -- I just
jumped in front of the camera and committed hara-kiri. That would
shock people, and it would cement my reputation, wouldn't it? But
I've always said the only thing I don't want to be ironic is my
death.''

<HEADLINE> Bellow Biographer Sums Up Writer  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- This fall, something highly unusual will happen
in the world of literature.
</P>
<P>
   A major biography of a celebrated writer will be published in
October. More than 600 pages, it's a deeply researched book that
took more than a decade to complete. It includes private
correspondence, interviews with friends and family members and some
highly intimate personal details.
</P>
<P>
   But those kinds of books come out all the time. What's unusual
now is that the subject, Saul Bellow, is still living.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bellow'' is James Atlas' long-awaited biography on the Nobel
Prize winner, who turned 85 in July. While the book was not
''authorized,'' Bellow did agree to let Atlas view private papers,
met frequently with him and didn't stop others from doing the same.
Atlas corresponded with all three of Bellow's sons, one of his
ex-wives and friends and fellow writers such as Martin Amis, Philip
Roth and the late Allan Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars and politicians often live to see their stories told
in full, but the rules are more delicate with writers. They're
rarely thought of as public figures, individuals whose private
lives are accountable -- or even interesting -- to a general
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Typically, a biography like that comes 10 years after the
author's death. You get a great, lumbering masterwork like Joseph
Blotner's book about Faulkner or Richard Ellmann's biography of
Joyce,'' said author and critic Jay Parini, who also contributed
material for Atlas' book.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more common for a biographer to agree that the book will
come out after the subject has died, most famously with Boswell and
Dr. Johnson,'' said Richard Holmes, an award-winning biographer of
the English poet Samuel Coleridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think it impossibly difficult to write a book like
that on a subject who's still living. If you're writing about the
living you run into the issues of respect and privacy. There's the
old saying from Voltaire, 'To the living you owe respect but to the
dead you owe nothing less than the truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas first contacted Bellow in 1987, when the author already
was in his 70s, but said he never considered withholding the book
until Bellow died. For a biographer, it was an ideal situation.
Atlas had cooperation from Bellow, but because they had no official
relationship Atlas could publish as he pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bellow's never been the kind of person to make arrangements.
He just lets things happen. It's very much in keeping with how he's
always lived,'' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth was among those who suggested that Atlas write the Bellow
biography. Atlas grew up in Chicago, the setting for some of
Bellow's greatest work, and the two had some mutual acquaintances.
In addition, Atlas had previously written an acclaimed biography of
the poet Delmore Schwartz, an old friend of Bellow's and the model
for the title character of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,
''Humboldt's Gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas said he did leave out some information from his new
biography, but ''Bellow'' does not read like a work that's been
softened.
</P>
<P>
   The book is both journalism and commentary. Atlas chronicles
Bellow's rise from young immigrant in Chicago to elder statesman in
the literary world. He notes the strong similarities between
Bellow's work and the author's life. He also describes a man as
complex in person as he is on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of countless literary awards, Bellow hasn't always
conducted himself like a ''distinguished'' writer. He has married
five times, using his domestic life as material in such novels as
''Herzog'' and ''Humboldt's Gift.'' His comments about blacks and
women have often been criticized and he has offered more than a few
uncomplimentary remarks about fellow writers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow is an opinionated man and Atlas has written an
opinionated book. Feminists, he writes, were ''justifiably''
offended by Bellow's presentation of women in his novels. He also
finds Bellow guilty of ''general disparagement of blacks,''
especially in the novels ''Henderson the Rain King'' and ''Mr.
Sammler's Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Having an opinion is one of the cardinal requirements of
biographies,'' said Atlas, founding editor for the popular Penguin
Lives series of short biographies. ''I think one of the reasons the
Penguin books are so successful is their strong points of view. As
titillating as some of the information may be, you need some kind
of vision to bring it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas both analyzes and psychoanalyzes his subject. Bellow, he
writes, ''lacked the reserves of self-esteem needed to engage in
rigorous self-criticism.'' He believes Bellow favored ''subservient
women in order to serve his own shaky self-image.'' He finds ''an
element of snobbery in Bellow's reluctance to affiliate himself
with (fellow) Jewish writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas also assesses Bellow's sex life, citing unfavorable
comments about his performance in bed, and the observation from one
woman that Bellow ''had a biblical Old World morality, but his fly
was entirely unzipped at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow's work is highly praised, but with reservations. Atlas
faults the author for ''a tendency in his novels to push his plots
so far that they verge on farce.'' He says that at times Bellow's
''philosophizing got in the way of his natural ebullience'' and
comments elsewhere that the author is not ''a complex thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow has long been compared to the narrators of his novels and
the man Atlas presents suggests an ideal Bellovian character, rich
in contradictions: cerebral but high-strung, boyish but
old-fashioned, attached to the past but unpredictable as a friend,
terrified of commitment yet fatally eager to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conflictedness is part of the essence of human nature,'' Atlas
said. ''I didn't want to fall into the trap of antagonism; I felt a
profound emotional and biographical affinity that never flagged
during all the years I worked on this book. But on the other hand,
I certainly didn't want to write a work of hagiography.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow now teaches at Boston University, and his assistant said
he would neither read the book nor comment on it. The author, who
threatened legal action against a previous biographer, apparently
has a morbid view of the whole genre. He once called biography ''a
specter viewed by a specter'' and labeled biographers ''the shadow
of the tombstone falling across the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas himself has mixed feelings. In the book's acknowledgments,
he remembers with great excitement ''the ever-widening circle of
family, friends, and associates'' of Bellow, whose life he
describes as a ''peripatetic and dazzling passage through the
world.'' But he also noted the difficulty of writing about a man he
knows so well.
</P>
<P>
   ''(I) immersed myself in his life more deeply than I ever did in
(Delmore) Schwartz's,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the earlier work, I was a historian, a chronicler, an
archivist, putting together a portrait largely from hearsay. Here,
my proximity to the life I was writing was so close (so
suffocating, Bellow might have said) that it recalled the scene in
his early novel, 'The Victim,' where Leventhal, the beleaguered
hero, is forced to carry his double, his tormentor, Allbee, on his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were moments,'' Atlas added, ''when I wondered if I was
living my own life at all.''

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw Reconginzed With 'Best of'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After 19 years, 10 albums and countless nights
on stage, the songwriting craft of critical fave Marshall Crenshaw
was finally recognized with a ''Best Of'' collection.
</P>
<P>
   Its title: ''This is Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw appreciates the irony, but says credit for the name
belongs to the folks at Rhino Records. And it's appropriate in one
way: Putting the collection together was easier than the career
that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   For Crenshaw, it began when the phone rang in his Brooklyn
kitchen earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was minding my own business one evening when Gary Stewart at
the label called and announced he wanted to do this,'' Crenshaw
recalls. ''I thought, 'Great. Yeah, that would be cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   And it is. ''This Is Easy: The Best of Marshall Crenshaw''
assembles some of the finest pop tunes ever recorded, from his 1981
debut Shake Records single ''Something's Gonna Happen'' through
1996's irresistibly catchy ''What Do You Dream Of?''
</P>
<P>
   The collection chronicles Crenshaw's growth as a
singer-songwriter as well as his ever-evolving musical styles.
Rhino is simultaneously re-releasing his first album, ''Marshall
Crenshaw,'' with 10 bonus tracks that include covers of Buddy
Holly's ''Rave On'' and the Parliaments' ''Look at What I Almost
Missed.'' Both albums were released this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that Crenshaw is most proud of -- his
commitment to making different music -- is one of the things that
caused him career woes. He's been dumped by two labels, nearly quit
recording in the late '80s, and never achieved the mainstream
success once predicted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's only hit single -- ''Till I Hear It from You'' -- was
co-written with members of the Gin Blossoms, who rode the song into
the Top 40. He's never done a version of the song himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit native first signed in 1982 with Warner Brothers,
where his first album received a rave Rolling Stone review.
</P>
<P>
   But the somewhat spare sound of album No. 1 shared little with
the Steve Lillywhite-produced thump of his second album, ''Field
Day,'' which in turn sounded nothing like the laid-back third
album, ''Downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of risk-taking going on,'' Crenshaw reflects.
''The sound kind of varies from one album to the next -- a lot of
diversity in sounds and approaches. ... That's something I'm really
proud of, that I always had the nerve to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The label's response when Crenshaw delivered ''Field Day'' in
1983? ''I did catch a ton of garbage for that second album,'' he
recalled. ''I threw people a major curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he followed up with ''Downtown'' in 1985? ''I guess,''
he reflects, ''further mystification.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, in a phone interview from home, speaks in a painfully
scratchy voice: A cold complicated by a couple of weekend gigs has
laid him low. But he grows animated when talking about the first
time he sat in a studio surrounded by the tapes of his first seven
studio albums.
</P>
<P>
   ''You make a record, you pour yourself into it, and then the
tapes get carted off to a storage locker in a crater in the San
Joaquin Valley,'' he says. ''But seeing it all in one place, and
listening to it again, it's like I reclaimed it all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The process brought back memories, good and bad, from across two
decades -- his eight-year stay at Warner, his one-shot ''Life's Too
Short'' for MCA Records, his eventual landing at New York
independent label Razor &AMP; Tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each album has its own really vivid memories,'' Crenshaw
reflects. ''Each captures a place in time, and a certain place in
my life. I can hear echoes of what music I was listening to then,
what I was discovering or intrigued by.''
</P>
<P>
   Every album shows Crenshaw's penchant for penning incredible
hooks; the collection title track, ''This Is Easy,'' from his 1987
''Mary Jean &AMP; Nine Others,'' is a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   The final choice of tunes on the 22-song collection belonged to
the record company, and Crenshaw acknowledges there were ''two or
three which I might have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which ones?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't wanna say,'' Crenshaw avers.
</P>
<P>
   He does say that plans to do music for a Disney animation
project have fallen through: ''It just kind of went away.'' He
fared better on another project, writing an original score for a
PBS documentary, ''Yogi Berra: Deja Vu All Over Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Crenshaw has earned incessant critical kudos
and a loyal (if small) audience. So who does he expect to pick up
''This Is Easy''?
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential audience is anybody who likes rock 'n' roll,''
Crenshaw says. ''There's stuff on there that's as good as rock
music can get. I was so surprised and pleased about the way it
turned out.''

<HEADLINE> Jean Smart Is Back on Broadway  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As Jean Smart darts about her dressing room and
its mirror-lined walls, making herbal tea for a visitor and
answering the constantly ringing telephone, she appears to have you
surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn, she's there.
</P>
<P>
   And that seems to be true of her career, too.
</P>
<P>
   She's back on Broadway -- in a revival of Moss Hart and George S.
Kaufman's 1939 comedy ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' -- for the
first time since her 1981 debut in ''Piaf.'' She also can been seen
at cineplexes nationwide in ''Disney's The Kid.'' And she maintains
a strong presence on television, recently receiving an Emmy
nomination for a guest appearance on ''Frasier,'' and living on as
Charlene in reruns of the sitcom that made her famous, ''Designing
Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the tea finishes steeping and the phone stops ringing, she
talks about the personal reasons that kept her away from Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in Los Angeles, and my son goes to school in Los
Angeles. To decide to do a play out here is an enormous, enormous
undertaking and a big decision for the whole family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But now that her son Connor is 10&AMP;frac12;, the decision was a little
easier. Plus he was starting summer vacation and her husband, actor
Richard Gilliland, was working in the East, too.
</P>
<P>
   The convenient timing on the home front and the chance to work
with two Tony winners -- actor Nathan Lane, who stars as Sheridan
Whiteside, and director Jerry Zaks -- made Smart decide to play
vampy, predatory diva Lorraine Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what I'm going to do come September when my son
starts school,'' she says. ''I'm in total denial about that. I'm
just pretending it's not happening. I'm good at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the 47-year-old Smart is having fun playing an actress
who can't cry. Zaks came up with the idea of Sheldon's
no-more-tears blather, Smart says, adding: ''He let me just sort of
take that idea and run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Smart's Sheldon hilariously tries to squirt tears,
but her wincing lids come up dry.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic since she was almost 13, Smart doesn't have to do
anything special while performing in ''The Man Who Came to Dinner''
except make sure that her blood sugar level is right before the
curtain goes up and again at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   She takes the disease in stride now. ''I used to stash candy all
over the sets when I was doing plays,'' she says, knowing that she
couldn't stop like in a movie or TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Smart has filled a broad range of roles since leaving
''Designing Women'' in 1991. She played Rhett Butler's
stogie-smoking friend in the CBS miniseries ''Scarlett'' and
starred in made-for-TV movies as a retarded woman fighting for
custody of her kids and as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos. She's
also had two sitcoms of her own since 1995, but they quickly were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, she received rave notices as the bitter mother of
a girl who has a May-December relationship with a photographer in
the independent film ''Guinevere.''
</P>
<P>
   She feels fortunate to have snagged such varied roles, since
versatility is often seen as a liability by the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to be able to plug you into a certain slot, and they
really don't have the time or the inclination to try to figure out
how to use you, unless you're a mega-box-office star,'' says Smart,
whose film credits include ''Mistress,'' ''The Brady Bunch Movie''
and ''Snow Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I was stunned when I came to L.A. (at the) number of
actors I met who had never done theater. I actually didn't know
that such people existed. I really didn't,'' she says. ''I didn't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle native has been continually working on stage since
she graduated from the University of Washington. She began at the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival before moving onto regional theater in
Hartford, Conn., Pittsburgh, Seattle and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   More recently she starred in a Los Angeles production of
''Marvin's Room'' and off-Broadway in ''Fit to Be Tied.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of me thinks, 'If you had known then what you know now,
you'd have gone straight to Hollywood when you were still young.'
But I can't regret that because it gave me not only great times and
great experience but an enormous amount of self-confidence,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Smart hopes to reprise her role on ''Frasier,''
as Kelsey Grammer's paramour who turns out to be quite different
from his longheld fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   And she jokes that the reason she received an Emmy nod this time
around was because she didn't vote (her mail was not forwarded to
New York).
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe that's why I didn't get nominated before -- I voted for
myself,'' she says. ''Piggy little actress.''

<HEADLINE> Out of the Red and Into the Ring  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- How it came about could be the makings
of an opera itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Opera, lately rescued from bankruptcy, has plunged
into a production of Richard Wagner's epic ''Ring of the
Nibelungs'' cycle, the most expensive, demanding work it could
possibly tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't done the cycle for nearly 30 years, and the
Aug. 21 premiere will be at the renowned Edinburgh Festival, which
has never staged the work in all its 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   The four-opera cycle, running a total of 15 hours, is a saga of
gods and earthlings, giants and dwarves, treasure, a curse and the
triumph of love, based on Teutonic-Norse mythology. It can be so
endlessly interpreted that critics and addicts everywhere are keen
to know what's new in the latest production, wherever it takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   It makes news both when a producer does it traditionally --
although you are unlikely to see the horned helmets and bearskins
of Wagner's day -- or conceptually, with singers in suits, tuxedos,
evening gowns or hotpants.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Scottish company began rehearsals of
''Rhinegold,'' the first of the four-part cycle, at its Glasgow
base, to perform in the Edinburgh festival.
</P>
<P>
   The other three parts -- ''Valkyrie,'' ''Siegfried'' and
''Twilight of the Gods'' (''Gotterdammerung'') -- will be staged one
by one over the next three years, with the full cycle at the
Edinburgh festival in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The company could only start the four-year project with
financial backing from the festival and the Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spreading it over four years will ease the burden,'' said
Richard Armstrong, the company's music director and a renowned
Wagnerian who is in charge of the whole proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must seem curious when we are stretched financially, but
the collaboration with the festival and the bank and doing it part
by part puts the scale into a different perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company won't say what the production is costing, but
Armstrong raised an eyebrow when told the Seattle Opera had just
invested $10 million in a new ''Ring,'' implying his version will
cost much less.
</P>
<P>
   He said doing the ''Ring'' was the idea of Brian McMaster, the
Edinburgh Festival's director, with whom he worked for 10 years at
the Welsh National Opera. McMaster has said that Wagner's epic
stirs more excitement than any other work of art and that everyone
should have the opportunity to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the arts world, art has to lead,'' Armstrong said. ''If you
wait for the money nothing would happen, although the balance sheet
must balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has assembled a singing cast of 14 from seven
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to work with people freshly on the scene who haven't
sung their roles before,'' he said. ''The first reason is financial
-- we don't pay large international fees, but we do provide a
first-class environment for preparation which singers find very,
very important when they undertake a first-time role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Second is that my preferred way of working is to do it in
great detail in terms of how a role is sung, making the connection
between the music and drama, and that's best when grooming someone
from the start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bass-baritone role of Wotan, ruler of the gods, has gone to
Matthew Best, a 43-year-old British conductor-singer who studied
music at Cambridge University and has sung in Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my first Wotan and is immensely demanding, like a voyage
of discovery, but I've had my eye on it for at least 10 years,''
Best said.
</P>
<P>
   He has sung other Wagnerian roles -- Kurwenal in ''Tristan and
Isolde,'' Amfortas in ''Parsifal'' and the title role in ''The
Flying Dutchman'' -- but Wotan ''is a much bigger fish altogether,''
Best said.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Opera is Scotland's flagship arts ensemble, but it was
only 48 hours from closure in November when the Scottish government
provided emergency funding of more than $3 million to save it. That
reportedly was the 11th time since the company was founded in 1962
that it had been rescued from insolvency. It has a reputation for
artistic excellence, but has been chronically underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   Its current annual income is $16.5 million from box office and
government and local authority subsidies, along with commercial and
private sponsors. But uncertainty over next year's funding means it
hasn't been able to confirm its program for the post-Christmas
second half of the new season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to the day when it's not the money difficulties
that make the headlines but the work we do -- and the people of
Scotland are hungry for our work,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Rhinegold'' will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival
Theater Aug. 21, 23, 26 and 28, and at the Theater Royal, Glasgow,
Sept. 7, 9, 13 and 16.

<HEADLINE> Uncovering a Bit of Broadway History  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Back in the Dark Ages, when Broadway show tunes
were still the stuff of popular music, composers such as Richard
Rodgers, Frank Loesser, Jule Styne and others would produce demo
recordings of their new musicals in hopes major artists would
record the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the shows went into rehearsal, these talented
songwriters would gather a small group of singers and musicians in
a studio to get down on discs their latest efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Sent off to record company executives and the likes of Perry
Como, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis and
other stars, these recordings were considered expendable sales
tools that would help sell the music to a wider audience. Most were
destroyed, but a few survived.
</P>
<P>
   Now a bit of Broadway history has been uncovered with the
release of ''Broadway First Take,'' which celebrates these original
demos by putting some of them out on compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   Volume 1, released on the Slider Music label, features demos of
songs from ''Gigi,'' ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying'' and ''Hello, Dolly!'' Volume 2, due in late September,
celebrates ''Flower Drum Song'' (with Richard Rodgers himself at
the piano), ''Promises, Promises'' (including three songs cut from
the show) and ''La Cage aux folles.'' More volumes are to come.
</P>
<P>
   Showcased on these discs is a select group of singers, unknown
outside the business, but accomplished artists in their own right.
And in the center, with most of the choice female solos and duets,
is a distinctive singer named Rose Marie Jun.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1950s into the 1980s, Jun made more than 70 demos.
From hits like ''West Side Story'' and ''The Sound of Music'' to
forgotten flops like ''Copper and Brass'' and the prophetically
named ''Nowhere to Go But Up,'' she sang much of what Broadway had
to offer -- usually before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Today, sitting in an Upper West Side apartment she shares with a
solid, sweet-faced gray cat named Molly, Jun is almost apologetic
about her unique place in musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the business I set out to be in,'' says Jun, who
came here from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the 1950s after studying
classical music at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, the University of
Michigan and the Opera House in Rome. ''I came here thinking to set
the world on fire and just somehow didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She did just fine, though, doing jingles on radio and
television. Her first? Singing a jingle for Nestea -- in Yiddish.
But from Chiquita banana to Winston cigarettes to ''Wouldn't you
really rather have a Buick?'' -- she paid the rent. Other studio
work, plus appearances on Perry Como's television show helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jingles opened doors at Chappell Music, the big music publishing
company. From Chappell, Jun got an introduction to Richard Rodgers
and other composers who were looking for singers to do demos of
their new theater scores.
</P>
<P>
   If the commercials were done in big studios with full
orchestras, Jun recalls, the theater demos more often were not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just a trio or maybe a quartet was used because the composers
wanted the songs to stand on their own -- to be heard without all
the trappings you put on songs when you really record them,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Jun was not a highly stylized singer, a quality composers liked.
Plus she was a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could read music really fast and didn't waste an entire day
doing take after take after take. If you did two or three takes
that already was too much for these recordings,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a big range at the time. I had been a lyric soprano when
I was studying, but I had this chest register, too, that sounded
pop. So I could do anything they wanted me to do,'' she adds. She
sits surrounded by a room filled with memories of music. There are
photos of her with such legends as Sinatra and Como, a piano, of
course, and a lot of phonograph records and sheet music against one
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Often Jun was there at the birth of a major hit -- ''How to
Succeed,'' ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''
''Hello, Dolly!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we realized it at the time. We were kids. And
some of the composers were, too. Jerry Herman was still a kid,''
she explains.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't always know what they exactly wanted either. So
they would say, 'Well, what do you think?' And we would work out
something and if they liked it, fine, go ahead and do it ... if
they didn't like it, they would say, 'No, I don't think so.'''
</P>
<P>
   The established masters were more particular.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Richard Rodgers showed you the music, you had to sing it
exactly the way he wrote it. No leeway. But he was usually right.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jule Styne was tough and very much a stickler for how he
wanted things done. He was a great piano player and could play
anything, in any key.
</P>
<P>
   ''Others, like Jerry Herman, gave you a lot more freedom to
interpret, if you could. Some of them kind of liked that because
this was one of the first times they had heard their own stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet connections with these great men didn't get Jun roles in
their shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seemed to draw a line between having us do these demos
and appearing on stage,'' she says. ''It was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she ever would have said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a stage performer and never really pretended to be.
Besides I get terrible stage fright. I think I would have been very
nervous on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she did one show -- ''Peg,'' Peggy Lee's short-lived
autobiographical musical in 1983. Jun appeared on stage with a
group of singers and a band. It ran five performances.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you come down to it, I had a pretty good niche as a
studio singer,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Homemaker Snags 'Sopranos' Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Marie Donato beat out 28,000 would-be actors
vying to appear in ''The Sopranos,'' and she doesn't even have any
acting experience.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, a 50-year-old homemaker and grandmother of three, tagged
along with a friend to the auditions that created a, well, mob
scene last month in Harrison, N.J. She mainly hoped to get a
glimpse of one of the cast members from the popular HBO series
about a fictional New Jersey Mafia family.
</P>
<P>
   The cast wasn't there and Donato never had an interview, but she
did throw her photograph into a box, HBO said. About a week later,
she received a call back from the casting company and went to New
York to meet the show's executive producer, David Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Her lack of experience -- unless you count an elementary school
Christmas play -- didn't stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an Italian-looking person,'' Donato said. ''Honest and
sincere. Very straightforward. If anybody knows me, they know I'll
say what I think, right off.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato shot one episode of the show last week, and had some
dialogue. She may appear on more episodes, depending on how future
scripts are written, according to HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with the show, Donato wasn't allowed to say
what character she portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   HBO said Donato was the first person from the New Jersey casting
call to get a role, but she probably won't be the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still in shock,'' Donato said. ''I feel I'm just Marie and
always will be Marie. I'm not the kind of person who's a dreamer.
This was a miracle.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 38; Nasdaq Adds 32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 38.10 at 11,028.90.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.69 at 1,488.12, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 31.50 at 3,883.16.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $3.812 to $49.938, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $1.875
to $49.875.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   A government report showed that consumer prices rose a mild 0.2
percent last month, as the cost of gasoline and natural gas eased
after soaring in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose just 0.2
percent, for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that most other
prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another that the economy is cooling, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3 percent in
July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was the third
straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher. Internet portal
companies Yahoo!, up $3.625 to $135.938, and Lycos, up $2.875 to
$60.813, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 432.16 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.18 at 512.11.

<HEADLINE> Airline Fuel Tanks Deemed Safe  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A three-year study launched in the wake of the
crash of TWA Flight 800 has concluded that airline fuel tanks are
safe, industry trade groups said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world's commercial aircraft fleet continues to be safe and
that includes the fuel systems,'' said Robert Peel, director of air
worthiness and technical standards of the Air Transport
Association, the airline industry trade association.
</P>
<P>
   He said more than 100,000 work hours were spent inspecting 990
aircraft operated by 160 airlines as part of the program launched
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the safety of airline fuel tanks had been raised
during the investigation of the crash of TWA Flight 800, which
exploded on July 17, 1996, crashing into the ocean off the coast of
New York's Long Island. All 230 aboard the Boeing 747 bound from
New York to Paris were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the disaster remains unsolved four years later and
the National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to hold a
meeting next week to discuss that question.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have determined that the plane's center fuel tank
exploded but have so far not reported the cause of that blast.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation focused on a variety of possibilities including
static electricity, faulty wiring and vapor in the tank, so the ATA
and the Aerospace Industries Association launched their study to
assess the fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   Their report concludes that the fuel tank systems are soundly
designed and do not degrade over time.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all of this work, we did not discover any major safety
problems,'' Peel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report did note that there had been suggestions
that the use of metal conduits to carry wiring through tanks might
result in ''degradation'' of the wiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''This finding was confirmed during the inspection program and
is being addressed accordingly,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The group issued some suggestions for improvements, including
better maintenance instructions, periodic inspections for fuel
quantity measurement wiring, periodic inspection of fuel pumps and
their wiring, fuel lines and fittings and a review of the use of
metal conduits in fuel tanks.

<HEADLINE> 'Classic' Godzilla Making Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Guy in a lizard suit stomps on a building.
Ahh, the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla's back, the original, blue-blood Godzilla of almost two
dozen cheesy Japanese movies, not the pumped-up, digitized dinosaur
created for the monster-budget Hollywood version of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Godzilla 2000,'' opening Friday, is the first of the Japanese
reptile flicks to play American theaters in 15 years. Distributor
Sony is launching the movie in about 2,000 theaters, hoping
nostalgia for one of moviedom's favorite behemoths and interest in
Japanese creations such as ''Pokemon'' will help fill seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has acquired recent ''Godzilla'' movies for video release
in the United States. The idea to return the low-tech lizard to
cinemas came when Sony distribution chief Jeff Blake visited Japan
last year and saw huge lines for the movie at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the Godzilla myth is downright beloved in Japan,''
Blake said. ''People here certainly have a lot of recognition for
Godzilla. There's some affection for him among baby boomers, and
kids may take to it because things like 'Pokemon' have them
interested in Japanese product.''
</P>
<P>
   The monster's first screen appearance came in 1954. Godzilla's
name in his home country, Gojira, combines the Japanese words for
gorilla and whale. The first ''Godzilla'' movie released in the
United States was re-edited and added Raymond Burr as a news
reporter to give it American flavor.
</P>
<P>
   A string of sequels followed, including ''Godzilla vs. the
Thing,'' ''Godzilla's Revenge'' and ''Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Godzilla supposedly evolved because of manmade radiation,
some intellectualized the monster as a cautionary tale about
nuclear power and weapons. Others simply found the movies goofy
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Toho Studios, current producer of the movies, had killed off the
monster in 1995's ''Godzilla vs. Destoroyah'' in anticipation of
the coming Hollywood version. Though Hollywood's ''Godzilla,''
starring Matthew Broderick, grossed a healthy $380 million
worldwide, many fans felt it failed to capture the spirit of the
giant reptile, who generally tries to protect humanity despite his
destructiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For ''Godzilla 2000,'' Toho simply picked up the story as if the
monster had never died. This time, Godzilla battles a
60-million-year-old meteorite that transforms into a UFO and later
another gigantic creature.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was kind of a rebirth movie,'' said Michael Schlesinger,
a Sony executive who supervised the U.S. version of ''Godzilla
2000.'' ''It was such a spectacular success in Japan, we decided it
was worth taking a shot, maybe the time was right for Godzilla to
come back to theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical release of ''Godzilla 2000'' is not a huge risk
for Sony. The studio acquired the U.S. rights, re-edited the movie
and dubbed it into English for less than $1 million. Film prints
and advertising run an estimated $10 million to $12 million, modest
by Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous Japanese takes on ''Godzilla,'' the title
character is played by a stuntman inside a costume. Instead of
computer-animated effects when Godzilla takes Manhattan in the
Hollywood version, the creature in ''Godzilla 2000'' runs amok on
miniature sets.
</P>
<P>
   The effects are a notch above previous ''Godzilla'' movies but
still primitive. The movie also features the wretched dialogue
audiences love to giggle over, part of the campy charm of a
''Godzilla'' picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine a life form that could survive 60 million
years,'' utters one character. ''Good lord, let's just hope it's
friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla himself is played more seriously. In past films, there
was the time a monster buried Godzilla alive and did a Highland
fling in triumph. Or the scene where Godzilla and another monster
played catch with a rock. Or the moment in ''Son of Godzilla''
where papa reptile tries to teach his boy to breathe fire, but the
tyke coughs up only a smoke ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost everyone has seen at least one Godzilla movie,'' said
Bill Warren, who writes books about science-fiction movies. ''They
tend to be pretty childlike and childish, like Roy Rogers movies.
They're pictures made for kids, but made by sophisticated people,
so the movies start getting weird in interesting ways.''

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Breakthrough Identified  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have identified a key trick that tuberculosis
bacteria use to lie low in the body for years before going on the
attack -- a discovery that could open a whole new approach to
fighting a disease that kills more than 2 million people around the
world each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of public health, there is a long way to go. This is
an important step in the right direction,'' said Dr. William
Bishai, professor of international health and medicine at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Rockefeller University, Washington University
School of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Texas
A&AMP;M University reported their findings in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis infects a third of the world's population,
according to the World Health Organization, and is getting more
deadly as drug-resistant varieties evolve. Though drugs exist to
cure TB, they must be given in a complicated regimen over six
months to a year, and many people drop out too soon. That enables
drug-resistant strains to develop.
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of TB is that after people inhale the bacteria and
their lungs become infected, the immune system walls it off but
cannot kill it. The germs can live in a person for years without
developing into the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that the microbes hide out in white blood cells
called macrophages, which normally seek out and destroy invading
bacteria. When something weakens the immune system -- such as AIDS --
the bacteria go wild, bringing on the full-blown disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new work showed that when TB bacteria go into hiding, a
phase known as persistence, the immune system triggers a change in
the bacteria that lets the germs shift from feeding on
carbohydrates to fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's that switch in metabolism that is required for the
bacterium to maintain the infection,'' said David G. Russell, a
researcher at Cornell University who was at Washington University
when he participated in the work.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more closely at this switch in metabolism, the U.S.
researchers found that an enzyme called isocitrate lyase, or ICL,
is key to the process.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers developed a strain of TB bacteria that lacked
the gene to make ICL. When they infected mice with the bacteria,
the immune system was able to kill bacteria in the persistence
phase.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the drug company Glaxo Wellcome Inc. is trying to
develop compounds that lock onto the enzyme and stop it from
working, making hidden TB bacteria vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''A drug that targeted persistence would be quite different from
conventional TB drugs, which target processes required for
bacterial growth,'' said John D. McKinney of Rockefeller
University, who initiated the research. He said blocking ICL would
have no harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Such a drug could be used in conjunction with other TB
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hope is if we can add a drug against ICL to the existing
drug regimens, the two of them together will work better than
either of them alone and give us a faster cure,'' McKinney said.
''If we can cut it down to a month or less, this will really have
an enormous impact.''

Iraqi Weapons Issue Under Wraps   
An AP News Analysis
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's policy toward
Iraq has taken on a hush-hush quality these days. While Iraq
remains a high priority, the administration seems to think the less
said about the country's weapons programs, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The United States once was all too willing to let the world know
how menacing it thought Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was.
</P>
<P>
   Early in President Clinton's second term, after Saddam expelled
U.N. inspectors, Clinton said: ''It is essential that those
inspectors go back to work. The safety of the children of the world
depends upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the weapons inspectors have not been allowed in Iraq for 20
months and the Iraqis are saying they will not cooperate with a
revised inspection program that should be ready in the next two to
three weeks. None of this has elicited a stern U.S. response,
although officials say the issue is getting a lot of attention
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq last refused to allow the inspectors' return, in
December 1998, the United States and Britain bombed military sites
in Iraq for three days to punish Saddam for his defiance.
</P>
<P>
   What the Iraqis have been up to since is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will not say to what extent the Iraqis have
been trying to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction. Many of
these armaments were destroyed by the 1998 bombings or by U.N.
sleuths who for seven years sought out the forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is ready to talk about Iraqi human rights
violations, or the 600 Kuwaiti prisoners Iraq took during the
1990-91 Gulf crisis and has refused to release, or the numerous
palaces Saddam has built for himself despite widespread deprivation
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also contends Iraqi ''obstructionism'' has
prevented the Iraqis from reaping the full benefit of a
U.N.-sponsored humanitarian aid program.
</P>
<P>
   State Department briefers discussed Iraq for an hour on Aug. 2,
the 10th anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, without
mentioning the administration's thinking about the status of Iraq's
military arsenal since Saddam banished the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's rationale seems to be that public
discussion could produce demands for a tough response. By avoiding
the subject, the administration is able to keep its options open,
no small consideration in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no international consensus for renewing
military hostilities against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   France, China and Russia, all permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, are opposed. In December, none supported the
replacement of UNSCOM, the previous U.N. inspection system. But
rather than veto, all three abstained, so the revised inspection
program will begin with a weak international mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also are divided over what Saddam has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''So you thought Saddam Hussein was out of your life?''
Australian Richard Butler, a former UNSCOM chairman, asked in an
opinion piece last month. ''Sorry -- he's back, manufacturing
weapons of mass destruction.'' Butler says Saddam is a global
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Ekeus, a Swede who preceded Butler at UNSCOM, is more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that we felt that in all areas we have eliminated
Iraq's capabilities fundamentally,'' Ekeus said in a May speech.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than have U.N. inspectors try to track down whatever
weapons remain, Ekeus believes the focus should be on preventing
Iraq from engaging in a new weapons buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Blix, the Swede picked to head the new U.N. inspection
program, told Arms Control Today magazine that he did not believe
Iraq has been trying to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis themselves appear unchastened by the pounding they
took from the U.S.-led coalition that liberated Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Jumhouriya, an Iraqi daily that speaks for the regime, said
recently that Kuwait was directly responsible for the continuing
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any one who kills any Iraqi should not sleep, let alone those
(the Kuwaiti rulers) who have killed more than 1 million Iraqi
children and adults,'' the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 64; Nasdaq Adds 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 63.74 at 11,004.00.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.39 at 1,483.04, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 10.59 at 3,862.25.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $3.562 to $50.188, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $2.062
to $49.688.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   A government report showed that consumer prices rose a mild 0.2
percent last month, as the cost of gasoline and natural gas eased
after soaring in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose just 0.2
percent, for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that most other
prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another that the economy is cooling, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3 percent in
July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was the third
straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher. Internet portal
companies Yahoo!, up $3.187 to $135.50, and Lycos, up $2.875 to
$60.813, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 627.46 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.69 at 511.62.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia asked for help from the West on Wednesday
as its own rescuers desperately struggled through swirling sand and
strong currents, trying to reach 116 sailors trapped in a crippled
Russian nuclear submarine on the sea bottom.
</P>
<P>
   After days of frustrated attempts to lower a rescue capsule to
the submarine, Russia, which had refused foreign help, relented and
turned to Britain and Norway, the countries' foreign ministries
said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain had already flown a mini-submarine to Norway in
preparation to assist in a rescue effort. Norway sent a ship with
around a dozen civilian divers, but it could take up to two days to
get to the site of the submarine, the Norwegian foreign ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sign of life from the submarine, the Kursk,
since Saturday. Russian rescuers trying to lower the capsule have
had to battle worsening weather in the Barents Sea and high winds
and waves that buffeted rescue ships, said navy Capt. Igor Babenko.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to latch on to one of the cargo hatches of the
submarine were being frustrated because the current was rocking the
capsule, making it difficult to steer, Babenko said. Rescuers were
only able to see a few inches through the muddy water even though
they had searchlights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the submarine is lying at a sharp angle, making any
latching operation more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue capsule was almost lost during an earlier attempt
because of the strong currents, said navy spokesman Igor Dygalo,
who gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Wednesday there was no
sign of life aboard the submarine, but that this did not mean that
there were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin said the situation was critical, and
everything was being done to try to reach the Kursk. In a telephone
conversation with Putin on Wednesday, President Clinton renewed
U.S. offers for help, said David Stockwell, a spokesman for the
National Security Council. There was no indication Putin asked for
help.
</P>
<P>
   The British LR5 mini-submarine was flown to Vaernes Airport near
Trondheim, Norway, is operated by a three-person crew and is
capable of holding 16 passengers. It has enough life support to
allow crew members to stay submerged for 4&AMP;frac12; days.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-submarine may be able to connect to the Kursk's hatch
via a ring on the underside of the LR5's casing, but it was not
known whether its hatches would be compatible with the Russian
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine suffered extensive damage after an explosion in
the torpedo compartment at the front of the vessel, but the cause
was not clear, the navy said. The submarine's conning tower was
damaged and protective covers of two missile tubes on the vessel's
right side were missing, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the
Kursk went missing Saturday, despite official statements that it
was lost Sunday. The alarm was sounded after the Kursk failed to
make a scheduled radio contact Saturday and it was found Sunday,
said the officials, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy submarine monitoring Russian naval exercises in the
area heard an explosion Saturday that appeared linked to the Kursk,
U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rescue attempt involved a larger, more powerful
capsule called the Bester, and it was hoped it would be able to
better handle the swift currents on the sea floor, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller rescue capsule that tried four times during the night
to reach the submarine was forced back to the surface after running
out of oxygen, navy officials said. Its batteries were being
recharged and the two capsules would work in turns, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Wednesday
that he was more confident about the chances of success and said
rescue operations would continue until at least Friday. He had
earlier warned that air in the vessel was expected to run out
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I am feeling more confidence that the operation to rescue
the Kursk's crew will yield a result,'' he told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuroyedov said nothing had been heard from inside the Kursk
despite earlier reports of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is necessary to take account of the psychology of
submariners -- when they know that rescue capsules are hovering
above them, they keep silent,'' he was quoted as saying by
ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the capsules successfully dock with the sub and sailors
can enter it and find survivors, the craft can hold only 20 people
at a time. Officials say bringing it to the surface could take up
to seven hours, a slow rise required to prevent the potentially
crippling or fatal decompression sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers could also try to raise the submarine using giant
pontoons, Kuroyedov said -- a seemingly impossible prospect because
the flooded craft weighs some 20,000 tons. Another proposal called
for raising the submarine to a vertical position so part of it
protruded from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Kursk's two nuclear reactors had been
switched off and it was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The Navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.

<HEADLINE> Stamp To Honor Late Rep. Pepper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The late Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, a
champion of the elderly during a long career in Congress, will be
memorialized on a new postage stamp next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service said it will issue the 33-cent stamp on Sept.
7, one day before the 100th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Claude Pepper stamp is a fitting tribute to one of this
country's finest leaders and is an enduring reminder of his
lifelong effort on behalf of our nation's elderly citizens,'' said
Deborah K. Willhite, postal senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp will be officially dedicated at a 10 a.m. ceremony in
the Cannon House Office Building, with several members of Congress
taking part.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, a Democrat from Florida, served in the Senate from 1936
through 1951 and in the House from 1963 until his death on May 30,
1989. He was chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging where
he crusaded against involuntary retirement and battled to improve
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepper stamp is the second stamp to be issued in the new
Distinguished Americans series, joining the Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell
stamp, being issued Aug. 24 in Providence, R.I.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Kashmir Violence  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Indian artillery killed four people in
the Pakistani-held part of Kashmir, Pakistan said Wednesday, while
three Kashmiri militants died in a gunfight with Indian police
during violence on India's independence day.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani army said Indian shells rained down on the
Pakistani-held sector of Kashmir Tuesday, killing four people and
injuring eight others. Indian shells destroyed 10 houses and
damaged two mosques, Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Indian-held Kashmir, three militants died in different
shootouts Tuesday night in the frontier town of Kupwara, 55 miles
north of Srinagar, Indian police said. Shells from the Pakistani
side injured a girl and damaged a house in Uri sector on the Indian
side.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, both of which
claim it in its entirety. The province is the seat of an Islamic
insurgency that has left 25,000 people dead in the past 11 years.
Islamic militants want independence for Kashmir or its unification
with Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Kashmiri militants hurled a grenade at a security
patrol in Bijbehara town, 20 miles south of Srinagar, Indian police
said. The grenade exploded in the busy market area nearby, injuring
12 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   India celebrated its the 53rd anniversary of independence from
Britain on Tuesday, a day after Pakistan held its own celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed Kashmir region has been the flashpoint of two wars
between Pakistan and India. There is concern that another
confrontation could result in the use of nuclear weapons, which
both sides have tested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, separatists in another part of India, the
northeastern state of Meghalaya, killed a policeman and injured two
others Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police chief B.K. Dey Sawian blamed militants from the
Hyntteriep National Liberation Council. Federal troops enforced a
curfew in the capital, Shillong, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   India's northeast, which has been rocked by violence for more
than half a century, is home to more than 200 ethnic groups. Many
of them accuse the federal government of exploiting the region's
resources while neglecting the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 48; Nasdaq Gains 20  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 48.35 at 11,018.65. Broader stock indicators were
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.52 at 1,481.91, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 19.46 at 3,871.12
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $3.562 to $50.188, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $2.062
to $49.688.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   A government report showed that consumer prices rose a mild 0.2
percent last month, as the cost of gasoline eased after soaring in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose just 0.2
percent, for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that most other
prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another that the economy is cooling, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3 percent in
July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was the third
straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher. Internet portal
companies Yahoo!, up $3.187 to $135.50, and Lycos, up $2.875 to
$60.813, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 627.46 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.69 at 511.62.

<HEADLINE> China Church Downplays Rome Split  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's official Roman Catholic church has
informal contacts with the Vatican, but won't consider official
ties until the Holy See breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan,
the head of the Chinese church said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Bishop Fu Tieshan were unusually conciliatory
amid a crackdown on unofficial religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders ordered Chinese Catholics in 1951 to break
with Rome and declare allegiance to the state church. Believers who
remain loyal to the pope in an underground church face harassment
and arrest. An underground priest was sentenced to six years in
prison in May for printing unauthorized bibles.
</P>
<P>
   But Fu, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association,
said priests of the state church occasionally meet informally with
Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some contacts between friends and individuals,'' Fu
said. ''For instance, the head of the church in Rome and the head
of the church in China have some personal contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop spoke in a rare interview before he and other Chinese
religious leaders leave for the U.N. Millennium World Peace Summit
to be held in New York on Aug. 28-31.
</P>
<P>
   Fu said the Chinese church won't consider formal contact with
the Vatican while it still has diplomatic relations with rival
Taiwan. China regards Taiwan, which has been ruled separately since
1949, as a rebel province, and refuses to have contact with
governments that recognize the island's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vatican first has to break relations with Taiwan,'' Fu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials have criticized China's ordination of bishops
without papal approval, calling it an obstacle to formal ties.
China ordained five bishops in February on the same day the pope
elevated 12 men to the same rank.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to avoid the appearance of a religious schism,
Fu insisted that his group was only an association, not a separate
church.
</P>
<P>
   He also played down differences with the underground church,
saying some of its members had emerged to join the state-sanctioned
church. One became a bishop, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the U.N. conference are leaders of China's
official Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim and Protestant clergies.
</P>
<P>
   Conference organizers omitted the Dalai Lama, leader of Tibetan
Buddhists, from the invitation list for fear of offending China.
The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since a failed 1959
uprising against communist rule, and Beijing accuses him of
agitating for independence.

<HEADLINE> Relief Flights Resume to Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Two planes took off Wednesday to drop
food to war-torn southern Sudan, ending an eight-day suspension of
the U.N.-sponsored aid flights.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said in New York
on Tuesday that the United Nations had resumed the flights after
receiving guarantees from Sudan that the aid workers would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased that we have been able to resume relief
flights in full agreement with the government,'' Masood Hyder,
acting U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Sudan, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-sponsored relief flights by Operation Lifeline Sudan were
suspended because of bombings of relief agency compounds, which
rebels blame on the government. Sudanese officials deny the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   One flight took off from El Obeid, 500 miles west of Khartoum
and another from Lokichokio, Kenya, near the Sudanese border.
</P>
<P>
   The planes carried food for both government- and rebel-held
areas in the south, according to the U.N. office in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government has accused relief organizations in the
south of giving military assistance to the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has fought since 1983 for autonomy for the
largely Christian and animist south. Sudan's north is predominantly
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million people have died in Sudan's war and related
famines.

looking at the pictures and I thought Loretta Young was the
prettiest. So, I named you Loretta.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said she loves the name.

<HEADLINE> Pig-to-Human Transplants Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mice that got experimental transplants of pig cells became
infected with a pig virus, providing new evidence about the
possible risks of transplanting animal tissue into people,
researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   The mice remained healthy and the virus apparently replicated
only a couple of times before going dormant, a preliminary but
hopeful indication, said study author Dr. Daniel R. Salomon of the
Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment ... the risk here is unclear. It doesn't appear
to be very great,'' Salomon said. With further research, ''there's
every possibility ... that we will demonstrate this virus is
nothing to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   He did the federally funded study with colleagues at Scripps and
elsewhere. It was released Wednesday by the journal Nature, which
said a date for its publication has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in pig-to-human transplants as a way
to relieve the shortage of human organs and tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But that promise has long been shadowed by concerns over
''endogenous'' viruses in pigs. Eons ago, these viruses infected
the ancestors of modern pigs. The viruses' DNA mingled with the
animals' own genes and is now simply inherited along with pig
genes.
</P>
<P>
   The concern has been that if pig tissues are transplanted to
people, this viral DNA might make viruses that will infect people.
That might unleash an infectious disease previously unknown in
people.
</P>
<P>
   The new study involved transplanting pig islet cells to mice,
because such transplants are being discussed for treating diabetes.
The researchers later found DNA evidence that some mouse tissue had
been infected with endogenous pig virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Fishman of Harvard Medical School, who did not
participate in the study, called the work important. But he
cautioned it would take further experiments to prove the mouse
tissue truly became infected.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Benefits in Natural Crop  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese farmers who abandoned the modern practice of planting a
single type of rice in their paddies and adopted the more natural
course of mixing varieties were rewarded with bigger harvests, and
they no longer had to spray expensive fungicides.
</P>
<P>
   While the benefits of genetic diversity were known to Darwin,
the study serves as an important reminder at a time when
agriculture is increasingly looking to high-tech solutions, said
Martin S. Wolfe of Wakelyns Agroforestry in Pressingfield, England.
</P>
<P>
   ''This deceptively simple experiment deserves wide attention,
partly because of the principle that it illustrates, and partly
because it may never be repeated on such a scale,'' Wolfe wrote in
a commentary on the study, published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State University plant pathologist Christ Mundt and
colleagues organized farmers in five townships in China's Yunnan
Province in 1998 to switch from planting a single variety of sticky
rice -- a practice known as monoculture -- to alternating rows of
sticky rice with hybrid varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing their neighbors getting bigger harvests and saving money
on fungicide, farmers in 10 townships joined the experiment in
1999, bringing the total area of farms switching to diverse
planting to 8,255 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sticky rice brings a higher price, it is susceptible
to a fungus known as rice blast, which reduces yields and is
generally controlled by spraying with expensive chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Planting different varieties of rice in the same field cut the
incidence of rice blast in the sticky rice by 94 percent and
increased yields by 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though more research is needed to pinpoint why, it appears that
the alternating rows of different varieties thwarted the spread of
rice blast, Mundt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One way of thinking about this monoculture would be kind of
like a field of dry grass: Drop a match in it. There is nothing to
stop the fire from moving through it,'' Mundt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A mixed population is like a field of dry grass and wet grass.
Drop a match one there and it is going to be slowed down. It will
burn up a dry grass patch, then hit a wet one.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon wheat farmers already plant a mix of varieties in their
fields, but rice farmers tend toward monoculture, because planting,
harvesting and selling the crop are easier with one variety.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our goal should be to fool with Mother Nature as
little as possible,'' Mundt said. ''Sometimes there is a simple
fundamental fix that makes a whole lot more sense than going for a
real high-tech system.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Official's Home Fired Upon  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- A rebel mine exploded under a Russian jeep
and armored personnel carrier in the Chechen capital Wednesday,
underlining the insurgents' capacity to mount attacks in
Russian-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which injured one soldier, occurred near a telephone
station, where many people had gathered to make calls. After the
explosion, Russian soldiers opened fire, hitting a civilian woman
of about 18. Her wounds appeared severe.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also fired at the home of a candidate for Russia's
parliament from Chechnya, military officials said Wednesday, days
ahead of the vote in the warring republic.
</P>
<P>
   No casualties were reported in the overnight attack on the house
of Ibragim Huseinov, who is also mayor of the town of Meskety in
eastern Chechnya, said an official with the Russian administration
in Chechnya. The gunmen escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a remote-controlled mine hit the home of the mayor of
nearby Alleroi overnight, the official said on condition of
anonymity. No casualties were reported. Alleroi and Meskety are
near the border with the Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came after Russia's Interior Minister Vladimir
Rushailo and the chief of Russia's electoral commission flew to
Chechnya on Tuesday to oversee final preparations for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo said rebels were planning attacks timed to the
election, which is set for Aug. 20. Early voting has started in
some areas, including those where Russian troops are based.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will choose among 13 candidates to fill one seat in
Russia's 450-member lower house of parliament, the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary elections took place in the rest of Russia last
December, when federal forces and rebels were engaged in fierce
fighting. Even though Russia still doesn't control all of Chechnya,
officials had promised that a legislator would be elected this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been tightened ahead of the vote, with extra troops
sent to checkpoints and polling places. Yet federal forces have
been unable to keep small groups of rebels from sneaking into areas
the Russian forces claim to control and planting mines or staging
ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   A truck carrying servicemen was attacked on the outskirts of the
capital, Grozny, overnight, and at least three soldiers were
wounded, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a
1994-96 war, then moved back in last September to end Chechnya's de
facto independence. The campaign came after a series of
cross-border raids by Islamic militants based in Chechnya last
August and subsequent bombings in Russia that Moscow blamed on the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Oust Hard-Liner  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Reformist lawmakers ousted a hard-line
legislator Wednesday and made public a threat by a vigilante group
to put a bullet into the ''traitorous heads'' of those seeking
change.
</P>
<P>
   The two moves showed a new resolve by the reformers in their
struggle with conservatives led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has
the last say in all state matters.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Shirzad, a reformist legislator from southern city of
Isfahan, told the Majlis, or parliament, that a vigilante group --
claiming to be supporters of Khamenei -- had issued a statement
threatening reformists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the bullet is not already in your traitorous heads, it is
only because of the (restraint) ordered by the supreme leader,''
said the statement read by Shirzad and broadcast live on Tehran
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists in parliament showed their strength Wednesday by
voting to oust Mottahar Kazemi, a cleric and Islamic hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Kazemi had been appointed to his seat after the Guardian Council
canceled the election of a pro-reform candidate. The Guardian
Council, which oversees elections and other legislative matters, is
controlled by hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 238 lawmakers at Wednesday's session, 138 voted to expel
Kazemi. Each lawmaker must be endorsed by more than half of his
peers before he can take a seat in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The seat will be decided in a new runoff vote; no date has been
set for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists suffered a setback earlier this month when
Khamenei ordered a halt to debate in parliament on easing a harsh
press law that the hard-line judiciary has used to close more than
20 pro-reform newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But the reformers, who support President Mohammad Khatami's
campaign for liberalization, presented a new bill on Tuesday aimed
at blocking the judiciary from closing reformist newspapers --
another sign of the reformers new willingness to confront their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The reform movement aims to end the strict Islamic rules that
govern the day-to-day lives of Iranians. The hard-liners oppose
open debates that target the foundations of their rule.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers won control of the Majlis from hard-liners in
February elections for the first time since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives cling to power, using the judiciary to close
newspapers and arrest prominent reformists.

<HEADLINE> Health official sees no quick end to West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) - One health official said spraying to kill
mosquitoes might help a little in controlling the spread of the
West Nile virus, but predicted the virus would be a problem for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we spray we're not going to eradicate anything,'' Niagara
County Public Health Director David Wertman told the County
Legislature Tuesday. ''We're reducing the risk ... (The virus) will
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertman said even winter's cold weather would not put an end to
the spread, since mosquitoes spend the winter in sheltered places,
like sewers, and would take the virus with them when they re-emerge
next year.
</P>
<P>
   One crow in North Tonawanda has been confirmed to have died from
the virus, which is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
County Environmental Health Director James Devald said test results
were pending on 35 other dead birds from elsewhere in the county.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile symptoms include high fever, gastrointestinal
problems, muscle ache, headache and mental confusion. In the most
serious instances - usually among children, the elderly, or others
with weaker immune systems - the virus can cause a deadly swelling
of the brain known as encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Wertman said the county does not have the equipment for aerial
spraying but could consider ground spraying if adjoining Erie
County also sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would have to be a concurrence between Erie and
Niagara,'' he said. ''We'd have to feel the benefits outweigh the
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the public would be notified 24 hours before spraying,
which would be done at night.

<P>
	   PITTSFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - In his 83 years, Roy Chamberlin has been
a Navy chaplain, a minister, and an activist for peace and the
environment. Now he wants to add the title of state senator to his
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin, nominated in June by the Green Party, will oppose
incumbent Republican James Seward, who represents the 50th
district. The district includes Cortland, Otsego and Schoharie
counties and parts of Chenango, Herkimer and Tompkins counties.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin, who attended the caucus at the last minute without
any thought of running, said he actually nominated a few other
people for the job, but they all declined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then they decided to nominate me,'' he said.
</P>

   Seward is chairman of the Senate's standing Committee on
Insurance and also sits on several other committees.

<HEADLINE> Commission says Verizon rates will be cut more than expected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Verizon New York must reduce its rates for
residential and business customers by $50 million starting Sept. 1,
not the $25 million the company formerly known as Bell Atlantic-New
York had been directed to in 1995 by the state Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the additional reductions - $22.7 million - is
coming as the result of a ruling this summer by the state's highest
court that the former Bell Atlantic's customers should share in the
profits of the sale of Bell Communications Research. The PSC had
ruled that the ratepayers should benefit by the sale because for
years they had been charged for the Bell laboratory's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC said the benefits of the sale would become a permanent
reduction in Verizon's rate base and not be given consumers as a
one-time credit.
</P>
<P>
   The savings to customers under the PSC's order will amount to
about 44 cents per line per month, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a schedule decreed by the PSC in 1995, Verizon was already
bound to reduce rates by $25 million starting next month. That was
part of a plan to deregulate the state's telephone industry, giving
other companies access to Bell Atlantic's local customers and Bell
Atlantic the right to become an interstate, long distance carrier.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 82; Nasdaq Gains 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 82.05 at 10,984.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.35 at 1,479.08, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.13 at 3,852.79
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $3.562 to $50.188, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $2.375
to $49.375.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   A government report showed that consumer prices rose a mild 0.2
percent last month, as the cost of gasoline eased after soaring in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose just 0.2
percent, for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that most other
prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another that the economy is cooling, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3 percent in
July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was the third
straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher. Internet portal
companies Yahoo!, up $3.187 to $135.50, and Lycos, up $2.875 to
$60.813, led the way. Online auctioneer eBay jumped $7 to $59.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 740.87 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.22 at 511.15.

<HEADLINE> Rich and Famous Miss Concorde  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The grounding of the Concorde left a hole at the
top end of the travel market, reducing the rich and famous to the
same subsonic pace as the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, for people who used it, it's a disaster in two
areas: It got you there quickly, and it got you there more
interestingly,'' British film director Michael Winner said
Wednesday. ''And you met a better class of people in the lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by British and French authorities to suspend
certification of the supersonic plane leaves executives,
celebrities and the merely wealthy with no alternative for cutting
the time of a trans-Atlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately
after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people. British
Airways, which has seven Concordes, persisted until crash
investigators discovered that the failure of a tire was the primary
cause of the disaster -- and could threaten other flights.
</P>
<P>
   Opera singer Placido Domingo said he has taken the Concorde many
times and ''always appreciated the fact that it got me to my
destination in a miraculously short time and safely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appreciating it doubly now that they have taken the
precaution of grounding the planes until they know all the
pertinent facts about this terrible tragedy,'' said Domingo, who is
in Austria at the Salzburg festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tragedy and a shattering blow for this country if it
is the end of Concorde,'' noted food critic Egon Ronay told The
Times of London. ''It is such a prestigious brand and something
Britain was known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents already are hearing from customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have only one couple -- a very big philanthropist -- they are
very upset that they have to go on subsonic flight,'' said Rina
Anoussi, owner of The Travel Business in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Grounding Concorde ''will affect a lot of people because of the
extraordinary savings of time. I have a lot of people who love the
London Concorde for the time, for the prestige,'' Anoussi said.
</P>
<P>
   And people love the Concorde for the chance to sit near a
celebrity -- whether it be Michael Jackson, Madonna, Paul McCartney,
Margaret Thatcher or Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, however, are a small slice of the Concorde market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's mainly businessmen, average age around 40 -- sort of
bankers, that sort of thing,'' said Steve Miller of Air News, a
news agency based at Heathrow airport. ''And you get a very small
percentage of people who have saved up their money for a
once-in-a-lifetime treat. You get cruise passengers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways promised Wednesday to seek urgent meetings with
the plane's makers and regulators to get the supersonic jets back
in the air. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority stripped the
airline's Concordes of permission to fly after investigators said a
burst tire probably caused the deadly crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Air France Concordes were already grounded; French aviation
officials also suspended their flight certification Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   British aviation authority chairman Sir Malcolm Field said the
Concorde's certificate of airworthiness would remain suspended
until ''appropriate measures'' had been taken to ensure the safety
of the aircraft's tires.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crash and the actions of French and British
officials, Concorde retained its allure for many flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd get on it in a minute,'' said American film director John
Waters, who confessed he never flew the Concorde. ''What will be
will be,'' Water said from Baltimore. ''I'm scared of cars, not
planes.''

<HEADLINE> Families Await Submarine News  </HEADLINE>
By MAXIM MARMUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURSK, Russia (AP) -- At the moment when she heard that her son's
submarine was trapped on the sea floor, Valentina Staroseltseva was
preparing a package to send to 20-year-old Dmitry.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before, she had received a letter from him full of
excitement that he would soon put out to sea on the Kursk, one of
Russia's most modern vessels.
</P>
<P>
   She heard the grim news not from officials but from the
television playing in her tiny apartment, which is decorated with
pictures of her son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sat down and have remained sitting here since,'' the
51-year-old Staroseltseva said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot bring myself to do anything, just sit and wait. My
family is big and we are all very concerned,'' she said. Her face
was drawn and she had bags under her eyes from fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other relatives of the 116 men on the Kursk,
Staroseltseva watches television around the clock for news of the
struggling rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives live in this small industrial city in central
Russia, about 285 miles south of Moscow. The stricken boat bears
the city's name and by tradition many of its crew are recruited
from local high schools. The navy has not released a list of the
sailors on board, but dozens are thought to come from Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The navy established a hotline for relatives, many of whom flew
Wednesday to the submarine's base on the Arctic Ocean. They were
quartered on a boat that will put to sea to greet the sailors -- if
any are rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine sank Saturday, according to navy sources, but the
accident wasn't made known until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Staroseltseva's eyes never left the television screen as she sat
on a threadbare couch and talked of her son.
</P>
<P>
   A newscaster described how a rescue capsule slid off the sub's
hull, failing to dock with a cargo hold in the rear of the Kursk.
The navy says there has been no communication with the submarine
and the situation inside the vessel is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she showed visitors snapshots of Dmitry. In one
picture, he wears a sailor's striped shirt, smiles broadly and
holds a guitar while standing next to his best friend Alexei. His
friend, who is also in the navy, is likely to be aboard the Kursk.
In the background is a poster of a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Another picture shows Dmitry and his mother in thick coats and
fur hats, smiling and posing by an ice-shrouded sea in Murmansk,
the ship's base, during a family visit.
</P>
<P>
   Staroseltseva was proud that her son was selected for the navy
posting, not least because she thought the duty was far safer than
the regular army.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean, I always have been glad that he wasn't drafted to go
to Chechnya,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Fleet harkens back to Soviet pride in defending the
motherland on vessels that were at the forefront of marine
technology. The navy is now hampered by funding shortages and low
morale but still sails some of the world's fastest, biggest and
deepest-diving submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still believe that everything will be all right,''
Staroseltseva said. ''I haven't lost hope.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals court upholds 30-year sentence  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the
30-year prison term given the white police officer who claimed he
was driven by ''animal rage'' to sodomize a black prisoner with a
broken broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
also said it had ''no particular reason'' to believe former police
officer Justin Volpe when he said a fellow officer, Charles
Schwarz, was not with him during the assault. Schwarz denies he was
involved and has appealed his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 9, 1997, attack occurred in a Brooklyn police station
bathroom. Volpe had arrested Abner Louima when he mistook him for
someone who punched his head as police broke up an unruly crowd
outside a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe pleaded guilty in May 1999 to conspiracy to deprive a
person of his civil rights, deprivation of civil rights and witness
tampering. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to
pay $281,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   On appeal, Volpe's lawyers argued that Judge Eugene Nickerson in
Brooklyn unfairly penalized his client multiple times for the same
offenses and failed to credit him for naming the other officer in
the bathroom during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   They also said he should be given a lesser sentence because he
pleaded guilty, accepting responsibility for the attack on the
handcuffed Louima in one of the worst police scandals in city
history.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals panel noted that his plea came late in the
trial, after he had forced prosecutors to show most of its
extensive case against him.
</P>
<P>
   It recalled that Nickerson had concluded that Volpe showed a
lack of remorse and a failure to accept fully the wrongfulness of
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both before and during the trial,'' the appeals court said,
''Volpe advanced the theory that Louima had sustained his injuries
during a consensual sexual encounter with another man.''
</P>
<P>
   At trials in Brooklyn, other police officers had testified that
Volpe waved around a feces-covered stick and even boasted that he
''broke a man down.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a defense psychologist, Volpe denied ever
bragging about the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense of accomplishment - nothing like that,'' he
said. ''It was like an animal rage.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel declined to give Volpe credit for saying
Officer Thomas Wiese - not Schwarz - was in the bathroom with him
at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no particular reason to believe Volpe was being
truthful in naming Wiese as his co-assailant in the bathroom,'' the
judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the assertion was never tested by
cross-examination, Schwarz did not call him as a witness and the
jury ultimately decided to convict only Schwarz, not Wiese, of
assisting Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was sentenced in June to 15&AMP;frac12; years for his role in the
attack. Wiese received a five-year sentence for lying to the FBI
about Schwarz's role. In all, four officers have been convicted in
three trials and two have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyers have said they had hoped to shave half of
Volpe's prison term with appeal judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kornberg, one lawyer, said a further appeal was certain
but it had not been decided whether to ask the full appeals court
to hear the arguments or to seek relief from Nickerson or the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to do everything within our power to see to
it that the sentence of Mr. Volpe is reduced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad said prosecutors were very
happy with the appeals court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Coin shortage hitting East Coast stores, banks  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A coin shortage has some East Coast
stores asking customers: ''Can you spare a dime? Or a quarter? Or
some pennies?''
</P>
<P>
   Some stores are asking customers for exact change, and banks are
shuffling coins around to fill orders.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is being blamed on free-spending vacationers and on
people who are collecting the new state commemorative quarters
instead of spending them.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is showing up around the country but is
particularly noticeable on the East Coast, according to the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Bank, which has branches from Maine to New Jersey,
notified customers about a shortage of coins, especially pennies,
starting in mid-July. There was a paucity of pennies and other
coins last summer, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it's the large number of people traveling and on
vacation, making a large number of smaller transactions and getting
change,'' Fleet spokesman Dennis Schain said. ''It's a recent
seasonal phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the commemorative quarters, the coins are being issued in
the order that the states joined the Union, so the first ones all
have featured East Coast states. The U.S. Mint estimates 100
million to 160 million people will collect the special-edition
quarters, which will have a different design for each of the 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is working to ease the coin crunch on a
case-by-case basis. The peak season for coins will probably
continue until Labor Day, said Thomas Lavelle, a Fed spokesman in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an ebb and flow like this that comes from time to time
and we do our best to manage it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has advised business customers to keep coins in
circulation in their stores instead of depositing them. The bank
also has warned customers not to order additional coins to
compensate for the shortage because increased orders may make the
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   For some shoppers around East Haven, the shortage was no big
deal. They said cashiers had been asking them for change for a few
weeks now, and many were happy to get rid of coins weighing down
their pockets and purses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked me for pennies at Xpect Discounts. The bill came to
$26.13, so I gave them 13 pennies,'' said Jo Consolatore, joking
that 13 might be her lucky number. ''I should have played the
number that day.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 59; Nasdaq Is Up 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday, as investors
digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought about by a
cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 58.61 at 11,008.39,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.33 at 1,477.10, and the Nasdaq composite index
finished up 1.13 at 3,852.79.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $2.50 to $51.25, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $2.187 to
$49.563.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, a widely watched
barometer for inflation, showed that consumer prices rose a mild
0.2 percent last month, as the cost of gasoline eased after soaring
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The CPI's core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy
sectors, also rose just 0.2 percent, for a fourth consecutive
month, suggesting that most other prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is cooling, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3
percent in July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was
the third straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The markets have lacked a clear direction for weeks ahead of the
Fed meeting, fluctuating from day to day based on earnings reports
or economic data.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are pretty complacent right now. There's no reason
for them to make a decision one way or the other. Why ruffle any
feathers?'' said Sal Calabrese, managing director of U.S. listed
equities at Dresdner Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of technology stocks helped keep the Nasdaq in
positive territory. Internet portal companies Yahoo!, up $1.687 to
$134, and Lycos, up $3.125 to $61.063, led Nasdaq gainers. Online
auctioneer eBay jumped $5.625 to $57.50.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 926.79 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.68 at 510.61.

<HEADLINE> State maintaining vigil over dams in flooded region  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos XNR101-102
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - Five earthen dams in Sparta remained under
scrutiny Wednesday, several days after four similar dams in the
region broke under the strain of elevated lake levels.
</P>
<P>
   A State police helicopter ferried inspectors from the Army Corps
of Engineers and the state Department of Environmental Protection
over the five on Tuesday, and expect to do so daily until water
levels recede, said Trooper Sgt. Al Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest concern was the Morris Lake dam, classified by state
and federal regulators as a ''high hazard,'' meaning that failure
poses the greatest risk to life and property.
</P>
<P>
   Also under watch on Wednesday were dams at Arapaho Lake, Glen
Lake, Saginaw Lake and Sunset Lake.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Wednesday, ''No new problems have arisen,'' Della Fave
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dam on Seneca Lake in Sparta burst over the weekend,
emptying it and leaving a 25-acre patch of mud. Its contents flowed
in Lake Tomahawk in Byram, bursting its dam.
</P>
<P>
   Other dams that have failed include those at Edison Pond in
Sparta and Furnace Pond in Stanhope, state officials said. Dams at
Hawthorne Lake in Sparta and at the Musconetcong River in Stanhope
were damaged, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 state inspection of Seneca Lake dam determined it needed
repairs, which were not done by its private owners, state officials
told The New York Times in Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The 140-member Seneca Lake Association does not know who would
pay for repairs or whether the lake can be restored, a member of
the association's board, Tammy Crimando, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just hoping it can be fixed, but there's a dispute about
who owns the lake, and there's a matter of determining who is
responsible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crimando could not be immediately be reached on Wednesday. No
home listing could be found for her.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge S. Roukema, R-Ridgewood, who represents part of the
area, said she would seek federal aid for lake owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many private lakes were built in the early 1900s by developers
seeking to offer beachfront property. Their owners are responsible
for hiring inspectors, John H. Moyle, chief of the DEP's dam safety
section, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation since then makes it virtually impossible to build
private dams, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP had no immediate response Wednesday to a request to
interview Moyle.

<HEADLINE> Brain Scan May Detect Alzheimer's  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The brains of people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's have to
work harder than normal to perform simple memory tasks long before
any outward symptoms of the disease develop, a study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that the measuring technique used in the
study could develop into a kind of mental stress test for early
detection of Alzheimer's, much like treadmill tests for heart
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Zaven Khachaturian, former director of the Alzheimer's Research
Office at the National Institutes of Health, said the study is
exciting because it bolsters hope of identifying patients who could
benefit from early drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something wrong already, but you can't see it
clinically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by scientists at the University of
California at Los Angeles and was published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine. They recruited 30 people ages 47 to
82, all of whom had tested normal on conventional memory tests.
</P>
<P>
   They were checked for APOE E4 allele, a gene variant already
known to be associated with Alzheimer's. Then, their brains were
scanned with magnetic resonance imaging while they recalled words
memorized from a list.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the Alzheimer's gene produced scan signals that were
about twice as strong and more widespread than those of other
participants. The magnetic signals indicate greater blood flow --
and thus greater mental effort -- in regions of the brain near the
temple and forehead, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research had implicated those areas in Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have pinpointed metabolic brain
deficiencies and other early markers that may foretell Alzheimer's.
This study, though, is the first time that researchers have
identified brain differences in at-risk people while they perform
assigned mental tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brains appeared to be compensating. The brains of people
with the genetic risk have to work harder,'' said UCLA psychiatrist
Dr. Gary Small, who led the research.
</P>
<P>
   In its early results, his team tested 14 of the same people two
years later. None was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, but those with
the strongest signals two years earlier tended to lose the most
memory ability.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the potential to be a diagnostic tool,'' said Dr. Reisa
Sperling, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists cautioned that patients must be studied for
longer to be sure the test is picking up on early Alzheimer's, not
just the normal effects of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-inflammatory and other drugs are now being tested to delay
the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Scientists said early detection
could be combined with such drug treatment, perhaps within several
years.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million Americans, or about one in 10 people over age
65, struggle with the memory loss and other indignities of the
mind-destroying disease. Former President Reagan has Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs can now relieve symptoms but not cure the disease.

<HEADLINE> Women Health Research Effort Studied  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government has had mixed success in its 15-year push to
enroll more women in heart studies, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The effort grew out of a recognition that women were
underrepresented in studies of new drugs, new procedures and risk
factors for heart disease and stroke. Researchers realized that
women tend to get sick about 10 years later in life but live
longer, so that their lifetime risk of heart disease is about the
same as men's.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, researchers led by University of Wisconsin-Madison
cardiologist Pamela Douglas looked at 121 clinical trials on
cardiovascular disease funded between 1965 and 1998 by the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The three lowest years for female participation were for tests
beginning in 1972, 1973 and 1981 -- all less than 5 percent. The
three highest years -- all above 80 percent -- were 1991, 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the 33-year period, women accounted for 54 percent of all
test subjects, though they represent just 49 percent of heart
patients nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas was disappointed to find that women were just 38
percent of participants in mixed-sex studies. Also, much of the
overall progress stemmed from two women-only studies each with tens
of thousands of patients in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Women represented just 26 percent of participants in the total
of six studies of congestive heart failure. Most of the studies
focused instead on high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million Americans suffer from some kind of
cardiovascular illness, which leads all diseases in killing about
950,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say male scientists have been more interested in
treating the health problems of men. Others say that pregnancies
and the childbearing potential of women legitimately keep many from
participating in studies.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the heart institute said they want to look at what
is behind the relative scarcity of women in heart failure studies.
They added that the small number of tests in that area may be
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look overall and at some of the major categories,
we're doing very well,'' said Dr. Larry Friedman, a special
assistant at the institute.

<HEADLINE> West Point Cadet Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- A second West Point cadet has been
sentenced to prison for breaking into a store at the academy and
stealing nearly $25,000 worth of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Bender, 20, was sentenced to 15 months at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., dismissed from the Army and stripped of all pay
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't stop this feeling of eternal shame,'' Bender said as
he sobbed during Tuesday's sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Capt. Lisa Vigna, said the break-in has been a
blemish on West Point, where cadets get 19 hours of instruction in
the bedrock honor code that says they don't lie, cheat or steal or
tolerate those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Bender's lawyers argued that severe depression caused by earlier
discipline made him break into the department store Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal with prosecutors, Bender pleaded guilty to smashing a
window in the store with Cadet John B. Taylor IV. They filled
several duffel bags with watches, leather jackets, video cameras
and jewelry valued at about $24,821.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was sentenced to 18 months in June.

<HEADLINE> Who will be NYPD's next top cop? AP Photos </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It's the biggest guessing game - at least within
the confines of Police Headquarters and City Hall - since ''Who
shot J.R.?'' Who will Mayor Rudolph Giuliani name to succeed Howard
Safir as the city's police commissioner?
</P>
<P>
   Three names have emerged as contenders: Chief of Department
Joseph Dunne; Corrections Commissioner Bernard Kerik; and Dennison
Young Jr., a close friend of Giuliani's for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   All three men are deemed good choices, but all have flaws as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound that Dunne, 52, is the leading candidate. He is
the highest ranking uniformed officer in the NYPD, having worked
his way up from his days on the beat. The 30-year veteran is
well-liked and respected among the rank-and-file and is known for
having a rapport with minority groups, something the Safir
administration lacked.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunne has not known Giuliani long, and his longevity in the
department may suggest more loyalty to his officers than to the
mayor, said two police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't proved his loyalty to the mayor yet,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunne apparently won over Safir, who appointed him chief of
department last year. Safir, a longtime friend of Giuliani's, has
reportedly recommended that Dunne replace him after Safir leaves to
take a job in a private firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, 44, has known Giuliani for a long time and has been
praised by the mayor for work at the Corrections Department
reducing violence among inmates. He's a former cop, having served
as an NYPD narcotics detective for most of his eight years on the
force.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's only roadblock is that he does not have a college
degree, a prerequisite to being police commissioner. He would have
to get a waiver from City Hall to bypass the requirement. A high
school dropout with an equivalency diploma, Kerik has been taking
courses through Empire State College and needs 24 more credits for
his bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Young's long relationship with the mayor could be his greatest
asset. Currently Giuliani's counsel, he is considered by City Hall
insiders to be one of the mayor's closest advisers. The 56-year-old
has been Giuliani's point person with the NYPD since the mayor took
office in 1994, and knows the department's inner workings
intimately.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the candidates, there's really no one more
qualified than Denny Young and no one that would have that instant
comfort level with the mayor,'' said an ex-police official
knowledgeable about the department and who spoke on the condition
of anonymity
</P>
<P>
   But Young is not a police officer, which could rankle cops who
never warmed to Safir, a longtime federal official.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Palestinian Man Killed  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURDA, West Bank (AP) -- An elderly Palestinian-American who
thought robbers were breaking into his house Wednesday fired his
pistol, prompting Israeli soldiers patrolling the area to fire
back, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which some Israeli media described as a botched
military operation, drew a stiff rebuke from the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinian Authority considers the killing of the
Palestinian citizen Mahmoud Abdullah as a crime,'' cabinet
secretary general Ahmed Abdel Rachman said in a press release. The
Authority called on the Israeli government to prosecute those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Abdullah, 70, opened fire from the roof of his house
before dawn as Israeli soldiers passed by. He apparently thought
the intruders were burglars. His house had been robbed several
weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers fired back, hitting Abdullah in the head and
mortally wounding him. The Israelis took his sons for questioning
and released them a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the incident, an Israeli television news reporter
called it a series of mistakes by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's son Hisham, a journalist with the Agence
France-Presse news agency, said Israeli army officers kept medics
away from the house for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really a nightmare,'' Hisham Abdullah said. ''They
(Israeli troops) prevented anyone from reaching the house. For them
it was war. I tried to talk to them but they wouldn't stop
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Abdullah, who had lived in the U.S. Virgin Islands for
20 years, died in an ambulance on the way to a hospital, relatives
said. U.S. officials said he was a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gal Hirsch, the Israeli army commander in the area, said
his forces had to make sure no gunmen were hiding in the area
before allowing medics into the Abdullah home. The Israelis said
the Abdullah home was not the object of their sweep through the
village, but they would not say what their mission was.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred around 3 a.m. in this village north of the
West Bank city of Ramallah. The village is in a part of the West
Bank where Palestinians and Israelis share control.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the front of the house was riddled with bullets,
including nine that struck the front door. On the roof, reporters
saw a large pool of blood. Soldiers searched the house and found
the pistol Abdullah had used.
</P>
<P>
   In tears after he and his brothers were questioned, Hisham
Abdullah said he was asked about matters that had nothing to do
with the shooting, such as whether he had acquaintances in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Transportation watchdog group calls for governor to expand truck ban </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A transportation watchdog group Wednesday
called on the state to strengthen a law that bans big rigs from
local roads by allowing municipal police to enforce the law and by
expanding the types of trucks included under it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tri-State Transportation Group, a New York-based coalition
of various activist organizations, held a news conference that
featured mayors of several New Jersey towns, as well as victims of
accidents involving tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law enacted last year, only state troopers are
permitted to stop trucks, inspect them for various violations and
cite them. Members of the watchdog group said local police also had
been allowed to inspect trucks until 1993, when State Police took
over the work entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local police did it in the past; they can do it again,'' said
Les Hamilton, mayor of East Amwell.
</P>
<P>
   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said the agency assumed sole
responsibility for truck inspections to accommodate federal rules
passed at that time.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal rules were passed ''so that interstate
commerce would not be hampered by unwarranted stops by police
agencies throughout a state.'' If multiple agencies were allowed to
conduct the inspections, Hagerty said, ''the truck would never get
through a state.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Clancy, 29, of Lambertville, said her car was struck
head-on last year on Route 31 in East Amwell after a trucker lost
control of the vehicle and careened into her. She said she is still
undergoing treatment for injuries she suffered in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tractor-trailers are not meant to be on local roads,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Stegman witnessed a May tractor-trailer accident that
ended when the runaway truck slammed into a Lambertville video
store, killing the clerk inside.
</P>
<P>
   Stegman said in many cases, local police know better than state
troopers whether a vehicle belongs on their roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know our roads,'' he said. ''We know who is supposed to be
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said
state officials are looking into the possibility of allowing local
police to enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general's office is researching the whole issue
right now,'' O'Connor said. ''The governor is aware that we need to
be mindful not to do anything that would prevent the delivery of
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog group also requested that the state ban trucks
narrower than 102 inches. O'Connor said that, too, would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty, the State Police spokesman, said since May 20 troopers
have issued 175 summonses to trucks for violating the ban on local
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Associations, an industry trade group
based in Alexandria, Va., has filed a federal lawsuit challenging
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unsafe, unfair and unconstitutional,'' said Mike Russell,
a spokesman for the group, which claims the ban violates the
Interstate Commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That case is expected to be heard in September.

<HEADLINE> Pit Bull Owner Going to Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUEN, France (AP) -- A French court on Wednesday convicted a man
of unleashing his pit bull on four people, including a police
officer, and sentenced him to spend six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The court in the northern city of Rouen found Jeremie Acquemin,
20, guilty of having his dog attack three people who refused to
give him change, which he was panhandling from passers-by. He also
was convicted of prodding the dog to attack a police officer who
tried to question him. The victims were hospitalized with dog
bites.
</P>
<P>
   The court gave Acquemin a two-year sentence with 18 months
suspended. It also ordered him to serve two years probation, seek
help for alcoholism and drug problems, pay $7,000 to the victims
and turn the dog over to authorities to be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   A series of brutal pit bull attacks has shocked France, and the
government has taken measures against the breed. France now
requires that pit bulls be castrated, registered and periodically
checked, and has outlawed their import and sale.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Acquemin admitted that he removed the dog's
muzzle and ordered it to attack.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed since the attacks last month. The court
refused to release him after a prosecutor said that he was
''dangerous for having used his dog like a weapon.''

   AMITYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - When Sharon McKnight arrived home this
summer after a year of visiting relatives in Jamaica, she
anticipated warm embraces from her mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, immigration agents at John F. Kennedy International
Airport accused her of using a faked passport, shackled her hand
and foot, detained her overnight and sent her back to Jamaica the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, who is 35 and mentally handicapped, unable to read or
write, could not convince the agent at the window that the passport
picture was hers and that she was a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Lady, this not you,''' McKnight recalls, ''and I
said, 'It's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   More agents questioned her, but none believed her pleas.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight was sent back to Jamaica, much like thousands of people
sent away each month after being nabbed by immigration agents at
U.S. airports. But in this case, she was indeed a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Now she and her family are suing federal officials for $8
million. Their attorney, Mitchell Zwaik, says the 1996 law that
allowed her deportation ended up splitting a family and humiliating
a U.S. citizen who only wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   A provision of the law, known as ''expedited removal,'' allows
agents to quickly deport people whom they determine are trying to
enter the country fraudulently, without allowing them an appeal
before judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law has to be changed,'' Zwaik says. ''You have
immigration people making snap decisions at local airports.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Zwaik and U.S. Rep. Michael Forbes, D-N.Y., the
woman's family eventually convinced authorities at the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service that McKnight was a citizen,
and she returned home to Amityville, in New York's suburban Long
Island, on June 18, seven days after she was deported.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said the quick deportation process
is used only when there is ''clear evidence'' someone is trying to
enter the country fraudulently. He declined to speak specifically
about McKnight's case because of the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, however, INS officials have asserted that McKnight
told agents the passport was not hers, said she had been born in
Jamaica and gave the name of a cousin from Jamaica rather than her
own.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight disagrees with their account but acknowledges she was
confused by the rapid questioning. Born on Long Island but raised
much of her childhood in Jamaica, her mother's homeland, McKnight
speaks with a Jamaican accent.
</P>
<P>
   Led into an airport room for further questioning, McKnight
recalls the agent asking her, ''Where did you get this passport?''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I said, 'My cousin. My mother left it with my cousin to
give to me when I'm coming up.' And they said I'm lying.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight's mother, Eunice Benloss-Harris, confirmed later that
she had given the passport to her niece, Hilda Brown, for
safekeeping until McKnight's return to New York.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight says the agents repeatedly asked her name, and she told
them she was Sharon Rose McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'That's not your name,''' McKnight recalls. ''I
said, 'How are you telling me it's not my name? And I know my own
name.'''
</P>
<P>
   The agents were convinced she wasn't the person pictured in the
passport, so they took her to a room full of other detainees. She
was shackled at her ankles and wrists, with both sets of restraints
chained to a leather belt. She sat hunched over for hours,
shivering in the over-airconditioned room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent the night there, nothing to eat,'' she says. She said
she was refused permission to use a restroom. ''I peed right on
myself,'' she says
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the airport, meanwhile, family members who had come
to meet McKnight were frantically calling the INS from a pay phone,
trying to convince officials the woman they were holding was indeed
Sharon McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and sister arrived around midnight with a birth
certificate, but agents deemed it a fake. The family was not
allowed to see McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, June 11, two agents led McKnight, still
handcuffed, to a plane. She landed in Kingston without money or
food.
</P>
<P>
   An airport skycap who recognized McKnight gave her the
equivalent of $12 and put her on a bus to downtown Kingston, where
she could catch another bus to Manchester, the small town where her
cousin lives. She arrived that night minus her two bags, apparently
stolen along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, McKnight's mother and sister arrived in
Kingston. McKnight was waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw her, I was in tears,'' her mother says. A
photographer from the Long Island newspaper, Newsday, alerted by
Zwaik to the woman's plight, captured their embrace. Forbes
contacted U.S. authorities in Jamaica to help clear up the
misunderstanding and got Air Jamaica to cover return airfare.
</P>
<P>
   When McKnight got off the plane in New York and spotted two
uniformed immigration officers at the doorway, she turned to her
mother and said, ''Don't let them take me again.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigration official apologized to the family, but they
decided to sue. They are seeking compensatory damages of $7.5
million and $500,000 in punitive damages, which are limited against
federal agencies. Among other criticisms, the lawsuit alleges
inadequate training of immigration agents.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight says she has nightmares of being handcuffed again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was mean and nasty. They treated me like an animal,'' she
says. ''I won't forget about this. It's still in me.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Even Davy Crockett found New York City
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I would rather risque myself in an Indian fight than
venture among these creatures after night,'' the legendary
frontiersman wrote after an 1835 visit.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers of the day agreed and clamored for safe streets. So
a night watch of moonlighting citizens began to patrol the city
and, in 1845, the first official police force was formed.
</P>
<P>
   The rich history of how the police grew from a ragtag bunch of
cigar-smoking men with no weapons to today's 40,000-strong force is
told in a book published this month, ''NYPD: A City And Its
Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors Thomas Reppetto and James Lardner have taken a broad
view they hope will give citizens - and officers - a true picture
of the nation's largest police force.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, too much attention has been paid to the repeated
charges of police corruption, said Lardner, a former Washington,
D.C., policeman and now a senior writer for U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you only see the corruption, you miss so much of the
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 368-page book touches on the scandals but also offers little
known details - from the tidbit on Davy Crockett to the career of
William Bratton, the innovative police commissioner of the
mid-1990s known for his high-tech tactics against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main characters are: the Presbyterian minister who
instigated the first efforts to reform the department; the first
black officer on the force; an Italian-American cop who made a
fatal, top-secret mission to Italy; two forgotten detectives with
an uncanny ability to catch crooks; and the commissioner deemed the
most effective by the authors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book aimed to bring these characters to life,'' said
Reppetto, president of the city's Citizen Crime Commission and a
former Chicago police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The book, with its long view of history, does not concentrate on
the incidents that set off racial tension in recent years: the
police torture of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, and the police
killings of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo and
Haitian-American Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of let our history come to an end with Bratton,''
Lardner said. The Louima, Diallo and Dorismond cases happened under
Bratton's successor, Howard Safir, who is leaving the department
after four years.
</P>
<P>
   Readers learn how the Rev. Charles Parkhurst was ridiculed for
blaming the police for ''making New York a very hotbed of knavery,
debauchery, and bestiality.'' Determined to prove himself right,
Parkhurst went undercover in 1892 and exposed houses of ill-repute
rife with gambling and nude women.
</P>
<P>
   It was the NYPD's first - but certainly not last - big scandal.
Indeed, the book outlines a saga of scandal and reform that has
rocked the city at 20-year intervals since. It also covers a wide
range of tragedies and triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, one of the force's first Italian-American cops was sent
on a secret mission to Italy to investigate the Mafia. A
publicity-seeking police commissioner blabbed the details to the
press, blowing Lt. Joseph Petrosino's cover and leading to his
murder on the streets of Palermo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Sam Battle became New York's first black policeman. He
was ignored by white colleagues but became a tourist attraction as
hansom cab drivers took fares past his beat near Central Park to
see him.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter called ''The Great Detective'' tells how Thomas Byrnes
organized the detective bureau into a real crimefighting squad in
the late 1800s, instituting the practice of photographing and
keeping files on criminals and allowing his men to branch off into
specialties, such as homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on ''Celebrity Cops,'' Detective Johnny Cordes from
the 1920s is shown as a character Hollywood would love today. Since
he hated to carry a gun, he often had to disarm suspects before
arresting them. He once managed to disarm two burglars after being
shot - then was shot twice more by a drunken sergeant who stumbled
on the scene. He survived and returned to duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cordes certainly seemed to have had a kind of cult of admirers
inside the force because people were just bowled over by his
doggedness,'' Lardner said.
</P>
<P>
   While Byrnes and Cordes were famous in their day, Lewis
Valentine toiled in anonymity as a ''shoofly,'' police slang in the
early 1900s for an internal affairs cop. Valentine was taunted for
years by fellow officers until Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia - admiring
his pursuit of bad cops - appointed him commissioner in 1934. He
went on to serve 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took over the force just as prohibition ended, when the
force was thoroughly corrupt,'' Reppetto said. ''He managed to end
a lot of the corruption so probably of all of them, he was the most
effective commissioner in the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Among modern-day commissioners, Bratton is given an entire
chapter focusing on his introducing new concepts such as COMPSTAT,
a computerized tracking of crime statistics credited for helping
bring down crime rates to new lows.
</P>
<P>
   Reppetto said the little space given to Howard Safir's term was
not meant as a slight. Safir ''never quite got the credit for
keeping the crime reductions going,'' he said. ''He tried to move
toward the community with his CPR (courtesy, professionalism,
respect) program, but everytime something happened - Louima, then
Diallo, then Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with an observation by Zachary Carter, a former
federal prosecutor who told a symposium on race relations: ''The
relationship between the police and inner-city residents is a love
affair waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reppetto and Lardner said Carter, a black man, is right.
Reppetto added that police in the past had difficulties with newly
arrived minorities - such as Irish and Italians - who eventually
became strong supporters of the police as their own members joined
the force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect that will be the story in the early 21st century,
that the minority community will come to strongly support the
police,'' Reppetto said. ''The history of the NYPD suggests that
will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Artists step into the fray in effort to resolve MoMA strike  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Strikers at the Museum of Modern Art this week
drew the support of the luminaries of the art world, including
artists Robert Rauschenberg and Art Spiegelman, filmmakers Steven
Spielberg and Martin Scorsese and performers Laurie Anderson and
David Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   The first strike in 27 years by museum employees - including
archivists, conservators, curators, librarians and other
professionals - has dragged on for more than three months. It's the
longest strike in the museum's history, yet neither side seems
willing to budge and each accuses the other of bargaining in bad
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Points of contention include salaries as well as union demands
for compulsory membership of professional staff.
</P>
<P>
   The artists' names were listed under a brief open letter
published in The Village Voice and Time Out New York this week
asking the public to respect the picket line in front of the museum
and expressing concern with what they called MoMA's refusal to
negotiate. A total of 131 names appear in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Union concerns ''deserve to be addressed in good-faith
bargaining sessions without further delay,'' said the letter in ad
space funded by the union.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone on Wednesday, Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker
illustrator Art Spiegelman said he had signed the letter partly
because a work of his would soon go on display at MoMA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very upset. I'm going to feel very awkward if I have to
cross a picket line to see my work,'' he said. ''I did it for very
narcissistic reasons. I can't really in good conscience walk past
workers who are so cornered in a sense. ... I'd just like to see
this whole situation resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signers include filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, performing
artist Bill T. Jones, writers John Ashbery and Susan Sontag,
filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Bertrand Tavernier and jazz
musician John Zorn.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the union did not immediately return calls
Wednesday seeking comment, but MoMA lawyer Robert Batterman said
the letter stems from a false assumption that the museum has
refused to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has happened is that the museum and the union have been
unable to reach an agreement. But there were nine months of
negotiations before the strike began and numerous conversations
through the mediators. I think signing such an open letter based on
the unilateral representation of the union is inappropriate and
will be recognized as such for people of good faith who read it
carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional and Administrative Staff Association, Local
2110 of the United Auto Workers union, started the strike on April
28 after working for six months without a contract. There have been
no face-to-face negotiations since April 27 and none are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 255 of the 650 museum employees,
says that museum salaries are too low, starting at $17,000, with a
median salary of $29,000. Another major complaint is job security:
The museum plans staff reductions during its expansion project, set
to begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman has said the museum's latest contract offer amounts to
a 3 percent increase in wages and minimum salary each year for the
next three years, a better pension and dental plan, and a severance
package for any employees laid off during the expansion. MoMA's
wages are comparable to those at other museums across the country,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Aerial spraying in battle against West Nile  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Health officials, calling the next few weeks
critical in preventing human infection, are escalating the battle
against the West Nile virus with a one-two punch of ground spraying
and the season's first aerial spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ''It behooves us to really knock down the mosquito population,''
city Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said, noting that last year,
most of the seven victims who died were infected in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next two weeks up until Labor Day will certainly be very
critical for transmission,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   After another round of ground spraying on Wednesday evening, the
first aerial assault, with the pesticide Anvil, is scheduled for
Thursday night on Staten Island and in the Canarsie section of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Three New Yorkers, all on Staten Island, have tested positive
for the virus and are undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of the city's 36 virus-infected birds were found on
Staten Island. In Canarsie, a dead bird was confirmed to have West
Nile earlier this week. The neighborhood borders on tracts of empty
land and beaches where mosquitoes are likely to breed.
</P>
<P>
   At the Staten Island Zoo, a snowy-white owl died July 31 after
contracting the virus. His female cagemate died two weeks later,
but zoo officials have not yet received results of the lab tests on
the second bird.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ground-based spraying was planned for Brooklyn's
Prospect Park and Greenwood Cemetery on Friday and Saturday nights.
Five live birds collected at the cemetery have tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   The virus apparently survived the winter in hibernating insects.
But many of the mosquitoes and their larvae were destroyed in an
early campaign to eliminate breeding sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hundreds of birds and tens of thousands of
mosquitoes were tested, while insect repellant was sprayed last
month from trucks around the city, the northern suburbs and Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the mosquito population rises tenfold every two
weeks and was expected to peak this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in addition to the seven New Yorkers who died, 62
were treated for West Nile. The most severe infections may result
in encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an

<HEADLINE> White House Supports Local Gay Law  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unprecedented move, the Clinton
administration is in court supporting a local government's attempt
to protect gays from employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers are urging a federal trial judge in
Louisville, Ky., to reject a challenge to that city's anti-bias
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The government's friend-of-the-court brief was filed Tuesday.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman confirmed that the
administration had not previously filed a pro-gay-rights brief in
any similar dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The city enacted the ordinance last year, and Dr. J. Barrett
Hyman, a Louisville physician, quickly sued to have it overturned.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Baptist, Hyman argues that his religious beliefs
prevent him from hiring gays and therefore the ordinance violates
his constitutionally protected freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   If Hyman wins, the Justice Department brief said, ''other
employers could claim that being required to employ individuals of
a particular race, sex, national origin or religion violates their
First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion or free
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Others could claim that ''engaging in discriminatory advertising
for employment is protected by the First Amendment,'' the brief
contended.
</P>
<P>
   The government brief also says Hyman lacks the legal standing to
sue because he has not actually fired or refused to hire anyone on
the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's lawyer, Francis Manion, said the ordinance ''would
require him to in effect support or condone that lifestyle. He
believes that requires him to violate his religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Manion is with the American Center for Law and Justice, a
conservative advocacy group founded by religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing
gay-rights groups in the case, applauded the government's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''All federal civil rights laws would be in danger'' if the law
cannot be enforced, said ACLU attorney Leslie Cooper. ''There can
be a religious basis for all sorts of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Manion disagreed, adding that there is a national consensus that
discrimination based on race or gender is wrong. ''There's no such
consensus on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the Justice Department's decision to get involved.
''I'm kind of offended quite frankly,'' Manion said. ''Its primary
concern ought to be protecting the religious rights of people in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral arguments in the case are expected to take place sometime
after Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Gloucester Township teacher charged with fondling students  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Gloucester Township teacher was indicted
Wednesday on charges that he fondled female students, the Camden
County Prosecutor's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Higginson, 44, of Clayton, a teacher at the Ann Mullen
School in Gloucester Township, was indicted by a grand jury on 23
counts, including sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual
contact, endangering the welfare of a child and official
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Lee Solomon said seven girls, ranging in age from 12
to 14, were victimized.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said from the 1998-1999 school year through the
1999-2000 school year, Higginson inappropriately touched the
students, mostly on their buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson was arrested May 11 in connection with an alleged
incident that involved a 13-year-old student a week earlier on
school property, Solomon said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson is free on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Reinert, spokesman for the Prosecutor's Office, said the
incidents occurred in the school during school hours.

<HEADLINE> FTC charges company over attention disorder supplement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission charged a New
York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its
dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Organics Inc., of Melville, N.Y., claims in advertising
that its Pedi-Active A.D.D. supplement can alleviate symptoms of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and improve the attention
span of children who have difficulty focusing on schoolwork, the
FTC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned
about it should talk to their children's doctors about appropriate
treatment,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Consumer Protection. She asserted that the company's ads prey on
parents seeking alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the
most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million
school-age children in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Organics did not immediately return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which does business as ''Nature's Plus,'' markets
and sells a variety of dietary supplements through independent
retail stores. Sixty tablets of Pedi-Active A.D.D. sell for $12.56.
</P>
<P>
   This is the FTC's fifth action involving products marketed to
treat ADHD. While the commission's complaint begins a legal process
seeking to stop future unsupported claims, it doesn't mean any laws
have been broken.

<HEADLINE> After detailing allegations of abuse, judge waits for decision  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The one-time Family Court judge was herself
a witness Wednesday, spilling out allegations of infidelities and
abuse in an attempt to keep her job.
</P>
<P>
   Now state Superior Court Judge Rosemarie Williams must wait for
word from a disciplinary committee on the penalty for her public
dispute with a former boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, admitted it was a mistake to confront Alfred
''Wes'' Bridges, 27, and his female companion at a restaurant on
April 14. The judge said she erred again by following the couple to
a Trenton bar.
</P>
<P>
   Her hindsight comes from counseling she sought after the final
confrontation of their two-year relationship, Williams testified.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's first public hearing for a Superior Court judge
ended Wednesday with testimony from Williams, who offered sometimes
graphic details about alleged abuse. The state says her conduct
April 14 was a violation of judicial ethics and it could mean
removal from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier domestic dispute with Bridges cost Williams a chance
at tenure, the judge revealed Wednesday. She was also chastised by
her superiors and reassigned to Somerset County to keep her away
from Bridges, who worked as a sheriff's officer in the Mercer
County courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Williams claimed she helped Bridges get into law school. She
paid for entrance exams, prep classes and later wrote letters of
recommendation, Williams said. Once enrolled, Williams said she
aided with his homework.
</P>
<P>
   Williams repeatedly denied that she shouted profanities the
night of April 14. The accusation that she posed as a police
officer in a later telephone call was a misunderstanding, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said something to the effect of I'm calling from the
Hopewell police,'' Williams said, telling the panel she was using
her cell phone while in the police station's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she did call Bridges' answering machine that night
and made several negative comments about companion Tami DeVitas'
appearance. Saying she was a ''skinny, scrawny little girlfriend''
was her attempt to attack Bridge's vanity, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge claimed her former paramour would only date
''brilliant, gorgeous'' women.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also admitted saying something to DeVitas at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be a wise guy,'' Williams said. ''I said she was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge steadfastly denied using a vulgar term to describe
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I basically had a moment of clarity, bit the side of my cheek
and said something to myself,'' Williams said. ''At that moment, I
looked around and said 'What am I doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, the lawyer for the Advisory Committee on
Judicial Conduct asked Williams why she just didn't get up and
leave when she spotted Bridges come into the restaurant
</P>
<P>
   ''Basic human decency was I was here first,'' she said. ''I just
thought the decent thing for him to do was to leave. He didn't have
reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee, headed by retired Supreme Court Associate Justice
Alan Handler, peppered Williams with questions. Many wanted to know
if Williams found any potential conflict in her romantic
relationship with a law enforcement officer while she handled
criminal or juvenile cases.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she saw no problem and said she thought her
judicial superiors were of the same mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sheriff's officers, in my mind, are not the same as Trenton
police,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Shuts Widows' Bakeries  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Saying Islam completely forbids women
from working, Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban on Wednesday shut
down bakeries run by widows, who are among the poorest of the poor
here.
</P>
<P>
   The bakeries were started by the United Nations' World Food
Program and allowed widows to be paid salaries to make bread which
was sold at a subsidized price to other women -- also widows. The
order left 350 widows without jobs, said Peter Goossens, country
director for the WFP.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women and children who benefit from this program are among
the poorest and most vulnerable people in Afghanistan,'' U.N.
deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said in New York. ''The
loss of support will result in increased poverty and possibly loss
of life and health for women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which rules roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan,
espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law and have imposed strict
controls on women since taking control of the capital, Kabul, in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   When they took over, the Taliban ordered all girls' schools
closed and all women out of the work force. But they later made
concessions in the areas of education and health, and women began
to return to work for foreign aid organizations, wearing the
all-encompassing burqa that covers them from head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the Taliban issued an order barring Afghan women
from working for international organizations, with the exception of
the health sector. The United Nations had hoped the bakeries would
also be exempt, but on Wednesday the Taliban closed the doors and
told the women to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan are clear and
they have been ignoring the rules,'' said Maulvi Syed Mohammed
Haqqani, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan. ''We do not allow
women to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator
Carolyn McAskie criticized the development, saying it adds to the
discrimination and suffering of women in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Women who had been working at the bakeries were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   From within one bakery in the war-ruined capital women screamed
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give me poison and give my five children poison then we will
die fast instead of a slow death from starving and shame,'' one
woman yelled.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations there are an estimated 28,000
widows in Kabul. They are among the poorest in a city of 750,000
people, most of whom rely on international aid to survive,
according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the widows in Afghanistan lost their husbands during the
rule of President Burhanuddin Rabbani when rival Islamic factions
waged a bitter and bloody war that ruined much of Kabul and killed
an estimated 50,000 people, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Taliban toppled Rabbani's government there have been
an increasing number of women on the roads begging and children
scavenging through the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Taliban's edicts have been directed against women.
However, the Taliban also have outlawed most forms of light
entertainment, require men to wear beards and attend the mosque for
prayers.

<HEADLINE> An analysis of Lazio ad stressing his legislative work  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the new Lazio campaign ad regarding
Republican
Senate candidate Rick Lazio's Congressional record:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Effective.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Upstate New York markets Wednesday, statewide on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: (Read by a male announcer) ''The Quality Housing Act to
dramatically improve public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Empowering Our Educators Act to get better trained
teachers into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to help
low-income women get treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are all signed pieces of legislation that have passed
the U.S. Congress. Who is the Congressman behind all this
legislation? Rick Lazio - 8 very effective years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio - from New York, for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Black background, white letters with the title of each
act appearing as it's read. The titles of several other acts
sponsored or supported by Lazio also appear on the screen. As the
announcer poses his final question, video of Lazio marching in an
upstate New York Fourth of July parade appears.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: Patrick McCarthy, a campaign spokesman, says the ad is
intended to contrast Lazio's voting record with his opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is a stark, serious, issue-oriented piece intended to set
the record straight on some of the Clinton campaign's allegations
about Lazio's record. It also strikes Lazio's continuing theme of a
homegrown New York candidate versus an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Dunn responded by saying the
spot attempts to obscure Lazio's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio is taking credit for one bill that hasn't passed,
one bill he stole, and one bill he delayed for three years,'' she
said, referring respectively to the education bill, the Breast and
Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, and the housing legislation.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Madonna and her son are fine, a spokeswoman
said Wednesday, disputing tabloid reports that the newborn has a
serious respiratory problem possibly caused by premature birth.
</P>
<P>
   The pop singer and her baby, Rocco Ritchie, ''are home and
they're well,'' spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg said from New York.

   She declined to discuss specifics of the child's health.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was born at an undisclosed hospital on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were never in any life-threatening situation,'' Rosenberg
said. ''The baby was released a couple of days ago (from the
hospital) and everyone is well and thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror of London, citing unidentified hospital sources,
reported Tuesday that the child had respiratory distress syndrome
and was being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for complications with his lungs,
kidney and liver.
</P>
<P>
   The complications were consistent with the boy's birth three
weeks early, the tabloid said.

   The boy's father is British film director Guy Ritchie.

<HEADLINE> Fired BET Exec Makes Accusation  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former financial officer for Black
Entertainment Television sued the network and its top executives
Wednesday, accusing them of firing him because he wouldn't
participate in illegal financial dealings, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Crawford, BET's chief financial officer for a year until
January 2000, is seeking $21 million in damages for financial loss
and emotional distress, said Debra Katz, Crawford's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's lawsuit, filed in District of Columbia Superior
Court, includes charges that BET officials conspired to withhold
benefits from employees and evaded paying federal taxes. The suit
also accuses BET Chairman Robert Johnson and its president, Debra
Lee, of using corporate funds and credit cards for personal
purchases written off as business expenses, including sponsoring
the competitive horseback riding activities of Johnson's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Byron F. Marchant, general counsel for BET, said in a statement
the lawsuit was ''frivolous and totally without merit.'' He said
the network couldn't respond to specific allegations because it has
not received official notice or a copy of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''For several months, BET has been aware of the threat of a
lawsuit by Mr. Crawford due to the inability to agree upon
financial terms associated with his resignation from the company,''
Marchant said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that Crawford complained about the financial
dealings and that when he told Johnson and Lee he wouldn't go
along, they demanded his resignation. He said BET fired him when he
refused to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend to hold BET accountable for firing me for my
adherence to professional and ethical accounting standards,''
Crawford said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Crawford was a senior vice president and
treasurer with the Discovery Channel before joining BET.

<HEADLINE> Bird-biting mosquitoes found in Norwalk, but health officials have no plans to spray </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Bird-biting mosquitoes infected with the
West Nile virus have been found in Norwalk, but state officials
said Wednesday they do not plan any new pesticide spraying as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes, of the culex restuans variety, were collected
Aug. 7 at Cranbury Park, in the northern section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The finding ''does not represent a direct threat to people,''
said state epidemiologist Dr. James Hadler. There have been no
human cases reported in Connecticut this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''we might be closer to the day when the human-biting
mosquitoes become infected,'' Hadler said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will not spray pesticide in Norwalk because the virus
is now too widespread, and the spraying would be inaffective, said
Joxel Garcia, commissioner of the Department of Public Health. Last
month, the DEP sprayed a two-mile radius of Stamford, Darien and
New Canaan with insecticide when the virus was found in the same
type of mosquito in a Stamford park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on Wednesday also announced the discovery of three
additional crows infected with the virus - two in Norwalk and one
in Milford. To date, a total of 39 crows with the virus have been
found in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The virus first surfaced in the region last year, killing seven
people - all of whom were over 75 - and sickening 62 others in New
York. It also killed hundreds of birds in Connecticut, New York and
New Jersey. There have been three human cases reported in New York
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms and never realize they have been exposed to the virus. The
virus can lead to a potentially fatal form of encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued to encourage state residents to protect
themselves against mosquito bites by using repellant, covering up
with long shirts and pants and avoiding outdoor activities during
peak mosquito hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes,'' Garcia said.
''We have to do the prevention part.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 59; Nasdaq Is Up 10  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed Wednesday, as
investors digested the dual effects of modest inflation brought
about by a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 58.61 at 11,008.39.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.58 at 1,479.85, and the Nasdaq composite index
finished up 9.54 at 3,861.20.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks helped drag down the Dow index. Home
Depot fell $2.375 to $51.375, and Wal-Mart Stores was down $1.875
to $49.875.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold retail stocks in the fear that second-half
profits could fall short of expectations if consumer spending eases
in step with the Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the
economy to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released Wednesday provided further evidence that
the Fed's strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have slowing economic growth, there are two effects.
First, there is reduced pressure for the Federal Reserve Board to
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist and
chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, a slower economy also creates less robust
expectations for corporate profits, especially in the retail
sector,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, a widely watched
barometer for inflation, showed that consumer prices rose a mild
0.2 percent last month, as the cost of gasoline eased after soaring
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The CPI's core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy
sectors, also rose just 0.2 percent, for a fourth consecutive
month, suggesting that most other prices remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is cooling, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3
percent in July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was
the third straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed, which has raised interest rates six times in the
past 14 months, feels their economic tightening plan is working,
interest rates will likely be left unchanged at the Fed's next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The markets have lacked a clear direction for weeks ahead of the
Fed meeting, fluctuating from day to day based on earnings reports
or economic data.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are pretty complacent right now. There's no reason
for them to make a decision one way or the other. Why ruffle any
feathers?'' said Sal Calabrese, managing director of U.S. listed
equities at Dresdner Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Profit taking in the financial services sector left those stocks
down across the board.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of technology stocks helped keep the Nasdaq in
positive territory. Online auctioneer eBay led Nasdaq gainers,

<HEADLINE> Chavez Promotes Venezuela on Tour  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Wednesday
concluded a foreign tour that solidified his position as a force
within the OPEC cartel -- and angered Washington with his defiant
visit to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez gave a memorable performance on the world stage, taking a
spin through Baghdad with a car driven by Saddam and giving Libya's
Moammar Ghadafi a bear hug. He irked the United States by becoming
the first world leader to call on Saddam since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate consequences of his tour remain uncertain. It's
doubtful the trip will set off a stream of heads of states to
Saddam's doors. It's also unclear whether Chavez will achieve a
goal more dear to him: cementing unity within the fractious,
11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez, increasing Venezuela's international profile was a
satisfying enough coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a recuperation of Venezuela's leadership in OPEC,''
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Wednesday. ''The trip
opened up space for Venezuela in international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said Chavez established himself as a peacemaker within
OPEC -- a goal more important, he said, than persuading the group's
members to adopt Venezuela's vision of fair oil prices and adequate
production volume.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel played down the friction that emerged between the United
States and Venezuela over Chavez's visit to Iraq, saying the
dispute was a normal bump in otherwise smooth relations between two
allies.
</P>
<P>
   But for some Venezuelans, seeing their leader in a car with
Saddam was an embarrassment. Jeopardizing relations with the United
States, the critics say, is a high price to pay for promoting OPEC
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am angry that the president of Venezuela hangs out with the
greatest tyrants in the world,'' said Venezuelan oil expert Jose
Luis Cordeiro. ''Venezuela's interest is in its relations with its
(oil) consumers, who are the United States, Europe and Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez says strengthening OPEC as a global force is in
Venezuela's economic interests. The president sought to persuade
fellow OPEC heads of state to stand up to U.S.-led pressure to
lower prices, which are hovering at 10-year highs of nearly $30 a
barrel. A crash in the price of oil would be ''a death sentence''
for countries like Venezuela, Chavez said during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on whether Venezuela has sufficient weight
within the cartel to persuade its members to comply with their
production quotas or to adopt Chavez's band mechanism designed to
keep prices within in a set range. Chavez's pleas had little impact
on oil prices, an indication that traders and analysts are
skeptical about the Venezuelan leader's influence on OPEC
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hailed the trip as a triumph, pointing out that he
persuaded the leaders of Iran, Indonesia, Nigeria, Algeria and
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to travel to Caracas for a
September heads of State OPEC summit -- only the second of its kind
in the cartel's 41-year history. He also claimed to have rallied
support for the price band mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's goal of ending Iraq's isolation may be elusive,
although Indonesia said it agreed with Chavez's calls for an end to
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chavez likes to see himself as a leader in the global scene
but I'm not sure other countries see him that way. There's still
strong advocacy for isolating Iraq,'' said Michael Shifter, a Latin
America analyst with Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the opening of a new Congress overshadowed the
controversial trip. Although jaws dropped around the world at the
sight of the South American leader dining with Saddam, the trip was
no shock to Venezuelans, long accustomed to their leader's
irreverent ways.
</P>
<P>
   And opposition politicians stayed out of the controversy -- too
timid to personally attack the freshly re-elected popular
president, who entered Venezuela's national scene eight years ago
by staging a failed military coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition doesn't want to take on Chavez personally right
now. It would be political suicide,'' said local pollster Luis
Vicente Leon.

<HEADLINE> Public Service Commission gives OK for NiMo rate reduction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. got the OK on
Wednesday from state officials to reduce delivery prices of
electricity for most of its customers, the utility announced.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, which will begin in September, will amount to
nearly $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk chairman William E. Davis said the new pricing
plan was ''an important step toward properly aligning prices with
actual costs so customers can make informed decisions in the
competitive marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the pricing plan approved by the New York State
Public Service Commission, residential and small commercial
customers will see average electricity delivery price reductions of
about 1.5 percent, while the utility's largest industrial customers
will receive reductions of about 1.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> New York delegates are wined and dined at Democratic Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - It was hard to miss the lobster tails at the
New York convention party at Spago. The blonde woman in full
mermaid dress hired to lounge on a nearby fountain was a dead
giveaway that the lavish buffet of lobster, mussels, shrimp and
sushi was nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At the bar, New York's real-life politicos mingled with the
actors who play politicos on the television drama ''The West
Wing.'' Champagne glasses were kept full by an attentive fleet of
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the scene at the bash thrown by financial news mogul
Michael Bloomberg, who flew several burly New York City cops to Los
Angeles to keep all but the invited guests out on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for
New York City mayor next year, reportedly spent over $100,000 on
the soiree.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, New York delegates are being wined and dined
in style at the Democratic National Convention, where a host of
corporations and interest groups seem to be gambling that the best
way to delegates hearts is through their stomachs. Companies such
as Kodak, Pfizer and Global Crossing are among those picking up the
tab.
</P>
<P>
   Some have strong New York ties.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone giant Worldcom, which co-sponsored a buffet breakfast
for the delegation, has concerns about Bell Atlantic's plan to
begin offering long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak is New York's largest employer. It is also under close
scrutiny from the state as one of its largest corporate polluters.
Still, the film giant footed the bill for New York's opening night
reception where guests could get their picture taken against a
backdrop that simulated the Oval Office or with a real White House
resident - U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   New York's events are not illegal. Nor are they unique.
Corporate sponsors are pouring money into large numbers of events
for delegates from across the nation. But as a large state that is
the hub of the financial services industry, New York is being
treated particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is entirely unseemly,'' said Rachel Leon, of the New York
chapter of Common Cause. ''It appears that both these conventions
are being bought and run by corporations and what happened to the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver brushed aside the
criticism and said the sponsors were just being ''good corporate
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives these corporations the opportunity to put their name
forward so people can see it at a relatively small price,'' said
Silver, who is leading the New York delegation.
</P>
<P>
   For the price of omelets, danishes, coffee and juice for several
hundred, Global Crossing Chief Executive Gary Winneck was given
time to address the New York delegation just before former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and the Rev. Jesse Jackson on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Winneck spoke for so long about his New York roots and the
success of his telecommunications upstart company, that Jackson -
waiting in the audience as the featured speaker - gathered his
aides to leave. Sen. Charles Schumer hustled to the back of the
room and persuaded Jackson to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Individual politicians have also benefited from corporate
largesse at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who is looking to run for
governor in 2002, was supposed to have his reception sponsored by
Verizon. The strike scuttled those plans for the union-friendly
Democrat. Instead another utility, Keyspan stepped in and paid the
tab. Keyspan was created by the merger of Long Island Lighting
Company and Brooklyn Union Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey's women and government event was paid for by
Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who won his seat by
attacking the ethics of his GOP opponent Dennis Vacco, paused
thoughtfully on Wednesday before volunteering his thoughts on the
heavy corporate imprint on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that is being done is meticulously in compliance
not only with the rules that are there but with the spirit so I
have no problem with it on that level,'' Spitzer said. But Spitzer,
a millionaire who bankrolled much of his own campaign, said as the
state's top lawyer he had chosen to forego corporate sponsorship
for any of his own events.
</P>
<P>
   'In my case particularly I would feel some sense of
discomfort,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONROE TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A sky diver making his first solo
jump got blown two miles off course Wednesday and had to be rescued
from treetops, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Pavic, 27, of Roslyn, Pa., was one of two student
parachutists making their first solo jump. They left Free Fall
Adventures in Williamstown at about 8 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Winds carried both divers about two miles east of their intended
landing zone. One student landed safely in a field, but Pavic
descended in a heavily wooded area near the border of Winslow
Township.
</P>
<P>
   His parachute got stuck in the top of two 75-foot-tall oak
trees, and Pavic was dangling and stuck on branches, said Sgt. Tony
Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Two volunteer firefighters climbed to near the tops of the trees
to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only difficult moments took place when a news helicopter
flew so near as to drown out the rescuers' shouted instructions to
the dangling parachutist,'' Pace said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavic was lowered to the ground about two hours after landing in
the tree tops.

<HEADLINE> Man accused of stealing 120 weapons from Va. gunmaker he worked for </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A Newark native who had managed a Virginia
warehouse for a firearms maker was in federal court Wednesday,
accused of stealing 120 handguns from his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Guzman Jr. apparently mailed two packages containing some
of the high-powered weapons from the Heckler &AMP; Koch warehouse in
Sterling, Va., to Newark in late March, one to a friend and one to
his mother's home, according to charges filed by the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco &AMP; Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman ''unexpectedly'' resigned from H&AMP;K in April, days after
ATF advised the company that two weapons the company believed were
in the warehouse had been found in Newark, the ATF charges said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight more of the guns have been recovered in connection with
crimes this spring in northern New Jersey, including two attempted
murders, ATF Special Agent Joseph G. Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents searching the Belleville home where Guzman had been
staying with an aunt did not uncover the missing weapons, but did
find two empty H&AMP;K magazines and two bulletproof vests, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of our top priorities, to recover those 110
handguns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was arrested Tuesday afternoon at the home without
incident, ATF said.
</P>
<P>
   The .40-caliber and 9mm semiautomatic weapons are
''high-quality, well-made firearms'' that sell for at least $700
and have fetched $1,000 in undercover street sales, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, 27, was ordered held on $100,000 bail by U.S. Magistrate
Susan D. Davis. If he makes bail, Guzman must stay with his mother
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Valentin said Guzman has six
lawfully obtained weapons, which Davis ordered Guzman to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman faces a single charge of trafficking in stolen firearms,
which carries up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's aunt, Vivian Sosa, is a Newark police officer, Valentin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Newark police said Sosa, 32, has cooperated with the
investigation and has not been implicated at this time. Sosa will
remain on full duty while the department's internal affairs office
investigates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said, ''At this point, we don't think she had anything to
do with this operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman did not speak during the 10-minute bail hearing, aside to
acknowledge he had a lawyer, John D. Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso said Guzman has no prior arrests and intends to plead
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's mother declined to speak with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A request for comment from H&AMP;K was not immediately returned
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After H&AMP;K told ATF that weapons found in Newark appeared to be
in its warehouse, ATF asked the company to conduct an inventory,
which revealed three missing boxes, each containing 40 weapons,
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The packages Guzman sent weighed 19.6 pounds and 34.2 pounds,
ATF court papers said. Since each handgun weighs about 5 pounds,
''Those two packages sent didn't represent all of the missing
firearms,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman began working for H&AMP;K in January 1996 and was promoted to
warehouse manager in November 1999, according to the ATF charges.

<HEADLINE> Government To Pay Down Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government plans to pay down $17.7 billion
on the federal debt next week by selling two-year notes, the
Treasury Department announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The notes, to be sold next Wednesday, will be available in
minimum denominations of $1,000 and will mature on Aug. 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced early this month that the government
will pay down $221 billion of publicly-held debt this year,
bringing to $360 billion the amount of public debt reduced over the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department is reducing the debt in two ways. In one
of them, it is for the first time in decades actually buying back
debt held by the public. Officials hope to trim the debt by $30
billion this year through buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   The other method is through Treasury's more conventional
refinancing operations, in which it sells new debt at auctions such
as next week's to redeem securities coming due on a regular basis.
The amount of new securities sold is smaller than the amount of
securities coming due, thereby reducing the total debt held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the government's reduced borrowing needs at a
time of big government surpluses, Treasury officials have said they
are continuing to study the possibility of eliminating sales of the
one-year T-bill.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury has already cut back sales of the one-year bill from
once a month to once every three months, and before that it
eliminated sales of three-year notes completely.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, while good for taxpayers because they mean lower
interest payments on the national debt, pose challenges for
investors because they shrink the supply of Treasury securities,
considered the world's safest investment.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday that even with
a huge budget surplus, tax-cutting restraint still is needed and
the government should continue whittling the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a different economy ... and that's why it's so important
that we keep paying down our debt. ... It has never been more
important to maintain our fiscal discipline,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget calls for eliminating the $3.6
trillion of debt held by the public by 2012. The total national
debt is $5.6 trillion, which includes not only the publicly-held
debt but also debt held by government trust funds, including Social
Security.

<HEADLINE> Experts Detail Submarine Conditions  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as dark as the inside of a blindfold. Your breathing slips
into shallow panting as precious oxygen ebbs. It's so cold that the
sweat and tears of your terrified shipmates turns to slick frost on
bare metal.
</P>
<P>
   After five days sitting 354 feet below the churning Barents Sea,
the crippled Russian submarine Kursk rapidly is becoming a steel
coffin for its crew of 116, if they haven't already perished,
veteran submariners say.
</P>
<P>
   The deep is unforgiving. That's what submariners -- some of whom
have survived accidents dating back to World War II -- know as they
await the fate of the Russians sailors who until recently were
their foes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be terrifically damp, dark and cold,'' said Steve
Collier of Bath, Ohio, a retired U.S. Navy master chief petty
officer who served on three submarines from 1973-93.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is lying awkwardly on its side in strong currents and
swirling muck, frustrating repeated rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say the bow probably was damaged by an
explosion, perhaps in a torpedo bay. Several compartments flooded
with sea water, sending the sub to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans submariners say the sailors in the Kursk's bow almost
certainly are dead. Survivors are more likely to have been
stationed in the rear of the vessel. Watertight bulkheads probably
have split the crew into small groups, adding to their sense of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every submariner knows that tomorrow it could happen to him,''
said retired Russian Capt. Valerei Zelichonok, who commanded
submarines before moving to Israel in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For Dan Persico of Amsterdam, N.Y., the Russian ordeal recalls
the 48 harrowing hours he spent trapped aboard the USS Squalus,
which sunk in 240 feet of water off New Hampshire in 1939.
Twenty-six men died. Persico was among 33 survivors who rode to the
surface in a nine-ton diving bell lowered by a rescue ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Squalus disaster began when a mechanical failure during a
training exercise flooded the submarine's engine rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Persico, now 80, was a 20-year-old sailor in the forward torpedo
room. He and the other sailors laid on the floor of the tilted sub
in silence for nearly 24 hours. The rescue took another day to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, the Squalus crew had advantages the Russians in
this case don't have, Persico said. ''We were in radio contact,''
he said. ''We knew the rescue ship was on its way.''
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for help, the Kursk's sailors might be lying still
in the pitch-black of their bunks or hunkered at their
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't count on anyone from the outside, but you hope
somebody will get lucky,'' Collier said. ''You've known in the back
of your mind that this was possible. But the more you do, the more
oxygen you use. So you sit tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Failed rescue attempts by a mini-sub that cannot latch onto the
Kursk's hatches probably are draining the crew's hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've heard the submersibles. They probably don't have much
heart,'' said retired U.S. Navy Capt. Don Walsh, who shares the
record for the deepest dive -- 32,748 feet into the Marianas Trench
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Modern subs are high-tech marvels that can circumnavigate the
globe without surfacing, from the polar ice caps to trenches deeper
than the Grand Canyon. At 14,000 tons, the nuclear-powered Kursk is
one of 11 Oscar II-class submarines and one of the more capable in
the Russian fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But when disaster strikes, modern subs are not much better than
their cramped predecessors during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, veterans say: drill, drill, drill. But few American
submariners have faced circumstances as grim as those aboard the
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Collier, now an environmental engineer at a former nuclear
weapons plant, supervised emergency training on the USS Baton
Rouge. He operated nuclear propulsion systems on two others. He
served several tours in the Barents Sea playing cat-and-mouse games
against the Russians, isolated for six months at a stretch ''with
no sunlight, no women, no fresh milk after the third day.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier devised disaster simulations during underwater missions.
For smoke, he would make the crew operate the sub blindfolded or
wearing hoods. For explosions, he pulsed water through the torpedo
tubes to rock the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Zelichonok, the former Russian sub commander, said Russian crews
practice in the dark, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''You switch off the lights and you do it again,'' he said.
''Submariners are like iron. I'm sure every man knew what he had to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is no drill.
</P>
<P>
   It's sea-floor dark. Russian officials say the sub's nuclear
reactors were turned off or failed after the accident. The sub's
large batteries would be drained within two or three days. Electric
lanterns and flashlights probably have dimmed, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's cold. The surrounding water temperature is well below
freezing. Residual heat in the sub's pipes has long since
dissipated, making it little more than a metal can in an icy bath.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors might be wrapped in blankets. But in the mechanical
areas to the rear of the sub, they probably have no extra clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity, even from the men's breathing, turns to ice on exposed
metal.
</P>
<P>
   And it's suffocating. The Russian sub may have an oxygen-making
system, but it would rely on electricity, too. Oxygen tanks may
have been damaged in the wreck and they're probably depleting now.
</P>
<P>
   Such claustrophobia haunts every submariner -- or ''bubblehead''
in their jargon. Even under normal conditions, the slightest change
in air quality sends a ripple of quiet panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would get upset when the fire in my cigarette would go
out,'' Collier recalled. ''Some crewman had allowed the oxygen
concentration to drop a bit low. But the Kursk crew would be happy
with that oxygen level compared to what they have now.''

   The government also will establish a nationwide hotline people
can use to alert police to ''drunken skinheads'' on the streets,
and has set up a $4.7 million fund to help victims of neo-Nazi
violence, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Ministry said the money would support projects that
try to integrate young people into careers and society and combat
right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short-term, one-time actions aren't enough,'' said Edith
Niehuis, a top ministry official. ''We have to help build up
structures and networks to have a long-term bulwark against
right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although alienated young men often are the ones involved in
attacks on foreigner and Jews, Niehuis said it was wrong to lay all
the blame for neo-Nazi violence on youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can act that way only because they meet with agreement or
approval or people look away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, an administrative court in Berlin upheld the
city's decision to deny a parade permit to a neo-Nazi who wanted to
mark this week's anniversary of the death of Adolf Hitler's deputy,
Rudolf Hess.
</P>
<P>
   The court said such a march would be ''unbearable'' for the
general public, especially considering recent violence against
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Too dry, too wet, too hot: The nation is divided by its weather woes </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Forget revenue sharing. What America needs this
summer is weather sharing.
</P>
<P>
   While fires devour Western forests at a record pace, and the
South endures devastating drought and deadly heat waves, the
Northeast muddles through one of the coolest, soggiest summers in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen inches of rain fell on a New Jersey township in a
half-day last weekend. In the parched West, more than 80 major
wildfires rage across 13 states; the summer-long inferno has killed
eight firefighters and burned more than 4.5 million acres of forest
and rangeland.
</P>
<P>
   New York City had its coolest July since 1914, while
triple-digit heat has killed scores of people in Texas and the Deep
South. Large sections of the Southeast are beset by a prolonged
drought, projected to be the costliest ever for Georgia farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do live in an interesting place,'' said Jim Laver, deputy
director of the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction
Center. ''The U.S. covers enough longitude, enough time zones, it
has some of the most unusual and severe weather types of anywhere
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the extremes were anticipated, to a degree.
Meteorologists had predicted another in a series of dry summers in
the South as a spinoff from La Nina, the pool of unusually cool
water that has dominated the Pacific Ocean for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Laver said the Northeast's sustained, cool dreariness - one
year after severe drought afflicted the region - is more puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talk about it every day, asking why this is happening,'' he
said. ''We'll figure it out eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Northeasterners don't mind. Big-city commuters can jostle
their way through August rush hours without breaking a sweat.
Tanning-salon owners have savored the cloud cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eight straight days with no sun will do it,'' said James
Young, general manager of Sun Capsule salon in South Windsor, Conn.
''People need their sun.''
</P>
<P>
   But tourism throughout New England has suffered. Business is
down at water parks, at kayak-rental shops and on the beaches of
Cape Cod, New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's average monthly temperature in July was 72.3
degrees, the fourth-coolest on record. Both Boston and New York
went through July without the temperature reaching 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jackson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in
Taunton, Mass., said the cool, wet weather is likely to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God it isn't winter because an awful lot of people would
probably be under a foot of snow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What a contrast with Georgia, suffering its third straight
summer of severe drought, with rainfall since May 1998 at least 20
inches below normal. Homeowners have been ordered to curtail lawn
watering. The loss to farmers, including higher irrigation costs
and ravaged crops, is projected at $740 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most summers, thousands of Atlantans escape to Lake Lanier on
weekends. This year, the lake is down nine feet and many beaches
and coves have been closed.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Alabama are equally parched - Henry County's rainfall
deficit for this year is 24 inches. In Tuscaloosa County, welfare
officials blame a lingering heat wave for an upsurge in abuse and
neglect cases, and used-car salesman Pat Thompson said customers
are reluctant to venture onto his lot's steamy pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Svoboda of the National Drought Mitigation Center in
Lincoln, Neb., said the Southeast is experiencing ''a real doozy of
a drought'' that might be broken only by a spate of tropical
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drought is really the forgotten disaster,'' he said. ''You
don't see houses washed away. But when you add it up in the end, it
can have more economic loss than any natural disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, more than 40 people have died since May from
heat-related causes, and a state of disaster was declared for 195
drought-stricken counties. Last week, seeking to ensure that Texans
don't lose their air conditioning, the Public Service Commission
ordered utility companies to keep residential customers' power on
all summer even if their payments are overdue.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, baked by triple-digit heat for 25 straight days,
landscaper Carlos Lopez hasn't cut back his outdoor labors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you get dizzy and don't feel well,'' he said. ''But
we drink a lot of water and sometimes we take breaks. ... I need
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Montana also have suffered summer
drought, but much of the West is normally dry this season. The
widespread wildfires, Laver suggested, are due to a combination of
factors, including growth patterns in some of the forests and
instances of ''dry lightning'' - when an electrical storm triggers
a fire without any accompanying rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an average year, 1.5 million acres of forest are burned,
and we're well over 4 million now,'' Laver said. ''That's the
puzzlement - why is so much more burning this year?''

<HEADLINE> State creates harness racing monitoring panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two weeks after a harness driver was
sentenced to probation for his part in a conspiracy to fix races,
the New Jersey Racing Commission created a task force to review
racing practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a regulatory body, we have an obligation to enhance racing
integrity. We equally have an obligation to maintain and foster
public confidence in the sport of harness racing,'' commission
Chairman Noel Love Gross said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the state's racing commissioners will be joined by staff
members and others with racing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will evaluate racing trends ''to determine if they
fall within the appropriate parameters,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   Task force members will also evaluate industry concerns on drug
testing, licensing and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Meadowlands Race Track, Garden State Park and
Freehold Raceway support the initiative, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, a Superior Court judge sentenced driver Richard
Wojcio to five years probation and fined him $7,500. Wojcio also
was ordered to perform 500 hours of community service, which he has
already completed.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcio won 405 races and more than $2.4 million in purse money
in 1995, the year before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators accused him of conspiring with drivers before
three races in which he had bet. They claimed he helped other
drivers place second or third in two of those races.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Wojcio in 1998 of conspiring to fix races at
Freehold Raceway. He was cleared of charges of fixing races.

<HEADLINE> State says it doesn't closely monitor dam repairs  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - As owners of burst dams that drained lakes
and washed out roads in torrential flooding struggle to repair
them, a state official acknowledged that New Jersey has not
aggressively regulated most of its dams over the years to make sure
they get fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't keep such a close eye on them,'' State Department of
Environmental Protection spokesman Peter Page said Wednesday of the
more than 1,400 dams in the state considered to not pose a
life-threatening danger if they break.
</P>
<P>
   The dams are inspected every two to four years, he said, but
when it comes to making sure the dams get repaired, ''it's much
more of an honor system.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials, dam owners and residents near the destructive
floods in northwestern New Jersey all believe that vigilant repairs
couldn't have prevented four Sussex County dams from breaking last
Saturday, when more than a foot of rain fell on some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just an act of God,'' said Katherine Bakka, whose home
sits across from a muddy, 25-acre hole in the ground that was once
Seneca Lake. ''That water is powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Water pushed through Seneca Lake's earthen dam Saturday night,
draining it in about an hour. The water rushed downstream to
Tomahawk Lake and broke through its dam, emptying the lake that was
part of a private water park.
</P>
<P>
   Also destroyed were the Edison Pond dam in Sparta and the
Furnace Pond dam in Stanhope. Five other earthen dams in Sparta
remained under heavy scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pietranowicz, treasurer of the 150-member Seneca Lake
Association, said the association was hoping for government aid to
spend about $200,000 to repair the dam. Residents who jointly own
the 50-year-old lake pay $180 annual dues to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   Pietranowicz said the association had repaired the dam over the
years, removing brush, restoring erosion and inspecting a spillway
for cracks. But in the five years he has been treasurer, he says
the state has not notified him of any problems with the dam.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Moyle, chief of the DEP's dam safety section, told The
New York Times and The Record of Hackensack that the dam had
problems in 1991 that were never repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Pietranowicz said he has since found a 1981 state inspection
report noting problems with the dam's spillway, and a 1994 letter
from Moyle asking for a required permit to complete dam repairs
that are not specified. Pietranowicz was unaware of the letters
before the dam broke on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still going through boxes trying to find out the history
of all this,'' Pietranowicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Page said only 187 of the 1,600 dams in the state are classified
as ''high hazard,'' meaning they would pose a life-threatening
danger if they burst. Those dams are inspected every two years and
when owners don't complete repairs on time, they are mailed letters
and orders and, as a last resort, sued by the state Attorney
General's Office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is less vigilant about the dams classified as low or
significant hazard, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Lake dam was considered a significant hazard because it
threatened property damage if it burst, and gets inspected every
two years, Page said. The other three dams that burst were
considered low hazards, and are inspected every four years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for repairs lies with private owners, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For residents of Seneca Lake, who lost an ecosystem where
osprey, beavers and otters fed on other wildlife, it doesn't matter
whose fault it is that the dam broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is the lake is emptied out. There's an ecosystem
here that's going to be destroyed,'' said Gordon Bonker, a resident
for 37 years. ''I want to see water back in here.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Has Lunch With Canadians  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- They had just finished the best lunch of their young
lives, but no one could remember exactly what they ate. Hey, when
the pope's your host, who notices what's on the menu?
</P>
<P>
   For three T-shirt-wearing pilgrims from Canada, Wednesday was
something to shout home about: a two-hour lunch, with lots of
singing, joking, even a little jock talk with Pope John Paul II in
his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo in the hills outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff is putting the Canadians and a dozen other youths up
for the week at the Castel Gandolfo home. After he sent them and
the others off with hugs and a couple of mischievous twirls of his
cane, the Canadians hopped a train to Rome to share their
experience with some of the 700,000 other young Catholics in the
Italian capital this week for the Vatican's World Youth Day events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave him a hockey jersey from the Toronto Maple Leafs with
'Pope John Paul II' on the back,'' said Roger Gudino, 26, from that
team's town. ''He said: '60 years ago I played hockey.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really human,'' said Gudino in an interview with The
Associated Press. ''There's no way you'll feel uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Radziminski, who decided not to wear his Pink Floyd
T-shirt for the luncheon but who kept on his not-exactly spanking
clean running shoes for the occasion, made no bones about it: He
was dazzled by the pope's energy at 80.
</P>
<P>
   ''He twirled the cane like Charlie Chaplin. He did it twice at
the end,'' said Radziminski, 24, from Vancouver. ''He's switching
languages like this,'' said Radziminski, snapping his fingers.
''French, Spanish and Portuguese and Polish.'' Plus English and
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sharp as a stick, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada is expected to be the site of a future World Youth Day, a
tradition started by the pope and held every other year.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, the current host, was represented at Castel Gandolfo by
three young men from Pisa, including one who worried that maybe he
should wash the orange and black stripes out of his hair before
sitting down for a meal with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian, identified only as Alessandro, need not have
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, I like your hair,'' Radziminiski said the pope told
Alessandro, who, like the others, were selected by organizers for
the papal lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, after a late vigil of prayer and song with
the pope on the grounds of a Rome university, the young people will
stretch out in sleeping bags under the stars with perhaps 1 million
of their comrades. They will await John Paul's return to the campus
Sunday morning to conclude events he hopes will strengthen the
faith of this generation of Catholics kicking off the church's
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out with young people helps keep the pope young, said
the third Canadian, Alana Cormier of Halifax. And so many young
people flock to him because ''this guy has so much wisdom,'' Gudino
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the chatting and singing, did anybody eat much of
that that memorable lunch?
</P>
<P>
   ''He blessed it so we had to eat it all,'' Gudino said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Tanzania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will visit Tanzania this
month to show U.S. support for the Burundi peace process being
mediated by former South African President Nelson Mandela, the
White House announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela invited Clinton to join him Aug. 28 in Arusha, where
they will meet with Benjamin Mkapa, president of the southeastern
African nation situated on the Indian Ocean. The White House did
not disclose any other details about Clinton's trip, but Aug. 28 is
the deadline Mandela set for the signing of a peace agreement to
end an ethnic war in neighboring Burundi between the Tutsis, who
control the government, and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, Mandela began to broker negotiations between
Burundi officials and opposition leaders to end the seven-year
conflict that has claimed the lives of at least 200,000 people,
most of them civilians, and displaced 1.2 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Tanzania, Clinton is scheduled to be on the
west-central coast of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 25 to 27, he is to meet with Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo. The two, who met at the White House last
October, plan to discuss U.S. support for democratic transformation
in Nigeria under Obasanjo, who pledged to curb corruption and
stabilize democratic rule when he took office last year.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Wash Up On Rio's Beaches  </HEADLINE>
By MARCELO BALLVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- It was a strange end to the
penguin's long journey from frigid Patagonia -- catching a wave and
crash-landing on Brazil's balmy Ipanema Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Blinking at the palm trees and bikini-clad beachgoers, the
penguin gaped, flapped its wings and hopelessly tried to get a
webbed foothold in the sand. But as odd as the tropical
surroundings must have seemed to the visitor from the southern tip
of South America, the beachgoers took it largely in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's hungry,'' 8-year-old Gabriela Barbosa said.
Surfers tried to hold the bird still and a kindly stranger bought a
cold bottle of mineral water to pour over its head.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual number of penguins have been washing up lost and
confused on Rio de Janeiro's beaches this year. So far, 120 birds
have arrived, biologists say, more than double the number that
turned up last year.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Monsores, a biologist with the Rio de Janeiro Zoo, says
it's because of unusually strong cold fronts during the winter,
which is just coming to an end in Brazil and the rest of the
Southern Hemisphere. The record-low temperatures have resulted in
colder and stronger ocean currents, which improve the chances of a
penguin surviving the journey thousands of miles toward the
equator.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins that wash up are usually young birds separated from
their parents while hunting for fish and squid at sea, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its proximity to Antarctic currents that flow past
southern Argentina, Rio de Janeiro is a common destination for
castaway penguins. The seabirds may spend weeks at sea before
coming to shore, where they are usually picked up by beach patrols
and rushed to Rio's zoo in what has already become an established
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''They arrive after receiving a lot of rough treatment in the
sea,'' Monsores said. ''Some of them die after they arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Paulo Fedullo, a zoo veterinarian, said only 40 of the 120
penguins recovered this year have survived.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins arrive exhausted, half-starved and must first be
isolated in a medical ward because of the diseases and parasites
they often carry. But once nursed back to health, they join the
zoo's penguin display, where they can gulp down sardines next to an
ample swimming pool and cool off from the tropical heat in a
special air conditioned pen.
</P>
<P>
   Fedullo says the zoo cannot afford to welcome all the new
arrivals and is asking other zoos to help out. Returning them to
their home far to the south, however, is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to them is a process of natural selection,''
Fedullo said. ''Nature decided to bring them here and my opinion is
that we shouldn't interfere. We should just take care of them.''

<HEADLINE> Flood evacuees returning to their homes  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKETTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Some 200 Byram residents returned home
Wednesday morning after the rising Musconetcong River forced their
evacuations two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Downpours on Monday and Saturday damaged thousands of homes,
wiped out dozens of bridges, roads and dams, and forced hundreds of
people to flee the rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials said the river is receding.
</P>
<P>
   Byram Township Patrolman John D'Onofrio said the river has
receded 2 feet within the last two days. ''We're in pretty good
shape,'' D'Onofrio said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, emergency officials resumed the search for a
kayaker who went out on the swollen Musconetcong River. Crews were
searching the river between Holland Township in Hunterdon County
and Pohatcong in Warren County, according to the Hunterdon County
dispatch center.
</P>
<P>
   Holland Township police said the search ended Wednesday night
and was scheduled to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An official said the area being searched is near where the
Musconetcong goes into the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified the missing man as Charles Weaver, 58, of
Riegelsville.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state is awaiting word from the Clinton
administration on Gov. Christie Whitman's request to declare Morris
and Sussex counties federal disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman put both counties under a state of emergency, allowing
the state to order evacuations and activate New Jersey National
Guard units to help residents.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Warren County also were inundated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli on Tuesday asked President
Clinton to support the governor's request.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she spoke with Federal Emergency Management Agency
Director James Lee Witt Wednesday morning. Damage in the two
counties is significant, and the federal agency has all necessary
paperwork from New Jersey, Witt told Whitman, according to a
statement from the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witt is aware of the situation confronting residents of the
areas affected by the flooding, and he assured me that FEMA would
act on our request for a federal disaster declaration as soon as
possible,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor expects ''a decision from Washington in the next
several days,'' said Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman from Whitman's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Otterbourg said if Sussex and Morris counties are declared
federal disaster areas, a Federal Emergency Management Agency
office would be set up in the area to assist residents.
</P>
<P>
   The damage cost will surpass $100 million, Whitman spokesman
Peter McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   An early estimate of flood-related damage in Morris County was
about $12 million, said Rick Loock, county deputy emergency
management coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Eskil ''Skip'' Danielson, Sussex County emergency management
coordinator, said $166 million is an accurate damage estimate. That
figure includes property that would be covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County officials said there was no structural damage
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters in Jefferson Township have receded, authorities
there said. Police Chief John Palko put flood damages at $7 million
to $10 million, with $380,000 in damage to bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Two roads, including the busy Dover-Milton Road, in Jefferson
remain closed Wednesday afternoon. In addition, 20 homes have been
left uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokeswoman Cathy Derechailo said at least 400 homes
in Jefferson Township had some flood-related damage.
</P>
<P>
   State police spokesman John Hagerty said 2,700 residences and
businesses in Sussex and Morris counties reported flood-related
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said about 1,000 homes in Sussex County were
evacuated since Saturday and 500 residents were evacuated at some
point.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 homes in Sparta had some flood damage, township manager
Henry Underhill said Tuesday. At least three of the homes are
probably total losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency workers said 11 bridges in Sussex County
remained closed Tuesday due to water damage, flooding and erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex County officials said Wednesday they plan to erect four
temporary bridges - three in Sparta and one in Ogdensburg - in
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said they are distributing cleanup kits that
include mops and cleansers to kill mold, which one official called
''a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It evolves into black mold which is very serious and can be
harmful to your health,'' Derechailo said.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Exhort Albright on Files  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright promised Wednesday to do what she can to push for
declassification of U.S. files about past South American
dictatorships accused of cracking down on dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States wants to be as cooperative and helpful as
possible in trying to understand better what happened in a series
of tragic situations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's comments came after a morning meeting with relatives
of people who disappeared during Argentina's 1976-83 ''Dirty War.''
During the meeting, the leaders of two Argentine human rights
groups asked Albright to declassify the files.
</P>
<P>
   Estela Carlotto -- a leader of Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
a human rights group that has pressed for information about
relatives who disappeared under Argentina's former military rulers
-- told reporters that Washington must open up more classified files
from the era.
</P>
<P>
   She said human rights groups especially want information about
the so-called Operation Condor in which past military governments --
Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay among them -- are accused of
cooperating in a cross-border hunt for leftist foes in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference alongside Argentine Foreign
Minister Rodriguez Giavarini, Albright said the United States had
already begun opening its files on Chile. She said more documents
were expected to released in September at the request of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has asked all the agencies to be as forthcoming
as possible ... in releasing documents, and I believe we are living
up to that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has acknowledged that some 9,000 people disappeared
under the former dictatorship, but human rights groups claim as
many as 30,000 died or disappeared during the ''dirty war''
crackdown on leftist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is one of Washington's strongest allies in the
hemisphere. With only a few months remaining in the Clinton
administration, Albright's visit was rich with symbolism, including
a wreath-laying Wednesday before the statue of an Argentine
independence hero.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Albright was to visit a new Jewish community center
built on the site of a 1994 terrorist bombing that killed 86
people. The United States has thrown its support behind renewed
Argentine efforts to prosecute the masterminds of that bombing and
of the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's five-day, five-nation South American tour began
Tuesday in Brazil, where she underscored commitments to strengthen
democracy and free trade across the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of a particular need to bolster democratic reform in
Peru and in ''precarious'' Haiti. She also said she sought regional
support from Argentina for a U.S. plan to help Colombia fight drug
production.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems of Colombia are not just of Colombia, but for the
region,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Canada PM Gets 'Pie' in the Face  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island (AP) -- A protester pushed a
paper plate full of whipped cream into the face of Prime Minister
Jean Chretien on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien, 66, had just arrived at a convention center in
Charlottetown and was greeting supporters when the man walked up
and shoved the plate of whipped cream in his face.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister bowed his head and removed the plate, his
face covered in cream. Looking angry, Chretien was led to a
washroom to clean up. He continued his visit a few minutes later,
refusing to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, who identified himself as Evan Brown, was grabbed
by Royal Canadian Mounted Police escorting Chretien. While being
led away, he described himself as a member of a group called the
Prince Edward Island Pie Brigade and said he was protesting the
government's policies on trade and other social issues, such as
welfare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time the government was made accountable,'' said the
23-year-old, who was later charged with assault and released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred on Prince Edward Island, a Canadian
province off the eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien, who has been prime minister since 1993, says he
intends to run again in federal elections expected to be held in
the next 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing pies at political figures and others has become a
sporadic form of protest in recent years. Other targets have
included actor Sylvester Stallone, former Quebec Premier Jacques
Parizeau, Montreal Mayor Pierre Bourque and International Trade
Minister Pierre Pettigrew.
</P>
<P>
   A Montreal-based group that has been responsible for previous
pie attacks says it targets people who take themselves too
seriously.

<HEADLINE> Clinton spokesman seeks encounter with Rep. Rick Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)- You never know who you're going to meet on the
streets of New York - especially during a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On a Harlem street Wednesday, Rep. Rick Lazio brushed off an
encounter with Hillary Rodham Clinton's press spokesman, who
arrived waving a copy of the Clintons' property tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks earlier, Lazio had halted his bus and jumped out to
greet influential Harlem minister Calvin Butts, who shook hands
with the congressman but insisted that he has not endorsed and may
not endorse either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the Clinton campaign's top spokesman, was
rebuffed in his effort to meet Lazio face to face after the Long
Island Republican spoke at a ''Harlem Week 2000 Senior Jubilee'' at
the National Black Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh well,'' Wolfson said after Lazio - accompanied by a cadre
of supporters, staffers, police officers and others - was whisked
past Wolfson on the sidewalk outside the theater and into his
''Mainstream Express'' motor coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was starting his third cross-state bus tour since entering
the U.S. Senate contest against Clinton in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressman Lazio said yesterday that he would release his
taxes in 15 minutes if we could show what Mrs. Clinton had paid in
New York taxes,'' Wolfson said. ''I was just here to try and hand
Congressman Lazio Mrs. Clinton and the president's property tax
returns. Security prevented me from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been criticized by Democrats for not releasing copies
of his income tax returns -- something he has promised to do by the
end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday at an appearance in Queens, Lazio was asked about the
tax returns and quipped that he'd ''be willing to release, in the
next 15 minutes, all of my New York state tax returns if she's
willing to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was meant as a jab at Clinton, who only moved to the
state earlier this year and has not paid New York income taxes yet.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson's appearance -- with property tax receipts from the
Clinton home in Chappaqua -- was the Clinton campaign's answer to
the Lazio remark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Howard must have gotten tired distorting Congressman Lazio's
record from behind his desk and decided to take his act on the
road,'' said Lazio campaign spokesman Patrick McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio received a polite, albeit reserved, welcome in his speech
to the Harlem senior citizens event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harlem is not traditionally known as a bastion of
Republicanism,'' he said afterward. ''But it's important for me to
be here and for me to make the case. I feel most comfortable in the
areas where Republicans are not often present. I want to make sure
that every community feels ... that I am reaching out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts, the pastor of the Abbyssinian Baptist Church, spotted
Lazio's bus en route to the event. Lazio stopped and greeted the
pastor, who also serves as president of the State University of New
York at Old Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect his relationship with a great many of the
constituents out in Suffolk County,'' Butts said. ''I've had the
occasion of speaking before a prayer breakfast that he's held and
some of the leading African-Americans out there, as well as others,
have spoken very highly of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Butts said he has not endorsed either Lazio or Clinton and
may not.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lazio toured a community center in Nanuet in Rockland
County. He later attended the Delaware County Agricultural Fair in
Walton on Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> US Issues Mideast Travel Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department on Wednesday warned
Americans in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of ''an
increased possibility for terrorist attacks'' in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   The department said in a statement that there is no reason to
believe that there is a specific threat directed against Americans,
but that all Americans there should be more careful about security.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suggest travelers be more alert to their surroundings
and report suspicious activity to the police. Also, they should
avoid public buses and exercise caution in the vicinity of bus
stops and crowded areas.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly Palestinian-American man was killed by Israeli
soldiers on Wednesday after the man fired his pistol, thinking that
robbers were breaking into his house.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority called the incident a ''crime,'' and
the commander of the Israeli soldiers on patrol said the man's home
was not the target of their sweep, but would not disclose their
mission.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that the State Department warning was
related to Wednesday's incident.

<HEADLINE> Federal and state groups to test Hudson PCBs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLBROOK, N.Y. (AP) - State and federal agencies want to find
out the extent of PCB contamination in the Hudson and compensate
the public for its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River Natural Resource Damage Assessment trustees are
representatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   They met Tuesday with a group of county soil and water districts
from New York City to Albany to begin to identify, measure and -
eventually - restore natural resources damaged by polychlorinated
biphenyls.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission complements that of the Environmental Protection
Agency, which is focused on cleaning up or containing the 200,000
or more pounds of PCBs released legally from two General Electric
facilities in the upper Hudson River estuary until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs have been linked to cancer and are a known health concern
because they last in the environment for decades and accumulate in
living things like mammals, fish and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have debated whether removing the PCBs by dredging the
Hudson will do more harm than good by stirring up PCBs or help rid
the river of the contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees will examine lost uses of the Hudson like
recreational and commercial fishing and look at things like habitat
improvements, reduction of pollutant loads, enhancing fish
populations, developing nature trails and acquiring land for river
access.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees plan to release a report this fall.

<HEADLINE> Boxing promoter hopes his mistake serves as lesson  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Promoter Bob Arum said he's learned his lesson.
And he hopes the rest of the boxing world takes note.
</P>
<P>
   It will be six months before Arum enters a ring at a fight in
Nevada. He will also pay a $125,000 fine for offering a payoff for
the IBF to sanction a George Foreman fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lessons can be learned, not only by us, but by the commission
and everyone in boxing,'' Arum said Wednesday after the Nevada
Athletic Commission imposed the penalties as part of a negotiated
agreement of allegations involving the boxing promoter.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement between Arum's Top Rank company and the state,
Arum admitted he used poor judgment when he made an improper
$100,000 payment to IBF founder Robert W. Lee to sanction the April
22, 1995, fight between Foreman, then the heavyweight champion, and
Axel Schulz. Foreman won the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum is banned for six months from attending weigh-ins and
entering dressing rooms and boxing rings at fights in Nevada. Arum
said those are only ''symbolic things.'' He can continue to direct
Top Rank and promote fights.
</P>
<P>
   He must pay the fine and Top Rank will open its books to the
Nevada Athletic Commission. The Las Vegas-based company must share
all communications with sanctioning organizations and provide
evidence on payments of any sanctioning fees during the six-month
probationary period.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy Attorney General Kirk Hendrick told the commission
that Arum brought discredit to the sport of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state will not tolerate such behavior,'' said Hendrick,
who helped negotiate the settlement. ''This agreement is a victory
for the state of Nevada and for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum's attorney, Judd Burstein of New York, said the payoff is
just one blemish in Arum's extraordinary 35-year career in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a mistake made in a misguided effort to help a fighter
with whom he had a relationship with,'' Burstein said. ''This is a
strong penalty, but it is an appropriate penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Burstein noted that Arum volunteered the information about the
payoff and has cooperated with federal authorities in their case
against Lee and his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Athletic Commission filed a complaint against Arum in
July after he testified at Lee's racketeering trial in New Jersey.
Testifying without immunity, Arum admitted during four days on the
stand that he paid Lee $100,000 above the standard sanctioning fee
to win the IBF's blessing for the little-known Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings and sanctions granted by the IBF, as one of the
world's three major sanctioning bodies, play a big role in what
fights and purses a boxer gets. The groups now get 3 percent of a
boxer's title fight purse in return for their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Arum also will donate $50,000 to a boxing or sports program in
Nevada. That was not part of the agreement, but something Arum
volunteered. The commission and Arum will discuss which
organization will receive the money.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Glenn Carano asked Arum what he thought could be
done to improve the integrity of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Arum suggested that sanctioning bodies be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think something should come out of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another commissioner, Dr. Flip Homansky, said: ''Why we're here
is that managers and promoters and ratings organizations are not
going to be able to conduct business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from Hendrick and Arum, the commission, acting as
a judicial body, accepted the settlement. The panel amended one
part of the agreement to say that any boxing organization, not just
Top Rank, must report improper or unusual requests for payment by
sanctioning bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very hard coming before your neighbors and
citizens and having them judge you for something I did wrong,''
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his son, Robert Jr., 38, are the only defendants on
trial in a case that alleges IBF officials took $338,000 to rig
rankings and grant favors. They face multiyear prison terms if
convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   The jury has deliberated 14 days and will resume deliberations
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> India Govt Removes Charges on Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRAS, India (AP) -- An Indian state government withdrew
criminal charges Wednesday against five members of an extremist
organization -- a demand put forward by an elusive bandit who
kidnapped a veteran Indian movie star three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapper, Veerappan, had demanded that the five members of
the secessionist Tamil National Liberation Army be freed. The Tamil
Nadu state government dropped charges against the five, but said it
will only release them after Veerappan frees some of his hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, 56, who goes by only one name, kidnapped actor
Rajkumar and three companions from Rajkumar's vacation home last
month. A special emissary negotiating with Veerappan for the
government left Wednesday for the bandit's jungle hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is significant since the state government has rejected
some of the bandit's demands, including making Tamil the only
language of instruction in Tamil Nadu State and referring a water
dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Rajkumar is expected to take some time.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan is wanted for killing at least 130 policemen,
slaughtering elephants and felling thousands of sandalwood trees.
He has long eluded capture.

<HEADLINE> Top Cuban Players Head to Japan  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Superstars Omar Linares, Orestes Kindelan and Jose
Ariel Contreras were among a group of Cuban baseball players who
left for Japan on Wednesday to continue training for next month's
Sydney Olympics and adjust to the time difference.
</P>
<P>
   The official Prensa Latina news service said the final 24-man
Olympic roster would come from the 29-member group that will
compete against Japanese teams, and possibly one from South Korea,
on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has been an Olympic medal sport since 1992, when Cuba
crushed the amateur field. The Caribbean nation, which has
dominated international baseball for decades, also won the gold
medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sydney Games will mark the first time professional
players are eligible. Cuba banned professional sports shortly after
the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power 41 years ago and
opposes the participation of professional athletes in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns also are high about defections -- especially with the
communist island's celebrated baseball players. Cuba recently
launched a campaign decrying attempts by sports agents to woo the
country's top athletes with large cash offers.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players are among the most likely Cuban athletes to
defect, in large part because the financial offers are attractive.
American professional baseball teams have long been admired on the
island and are followed as closely here as the national teams.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Morales, who hit a decisive homer for Cuba last year
against the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards, earlier this summer
emigrated illegally to the United States by boat in hopes of
hooking up with a major league team.
</P>
<P>
   Linares, a third baseman considered the best amateur player in
the world, says he once turned down $40 million to join the a major
league organization.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, who struck out 13 in a victory at the Pan American
Games last year, said he has also turned down multi-million dollar
offers to defect.

<P>
	   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A 58-year-old man has been charged with
enticing four children into his house with baked treats then
refusing to let them leave, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Henkel is accused of inviting the children - ages 4 to
10 - into his home with a promise of cookies and pie Monday night.
Police said he fed the kids the goodies then became angry with them
and refused to let them leave for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who heard the crying knocked on the apartment door
and was pushed away and cursed by Henkel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Henkel eventually let the children go unharmed but refused to
let police into his apartment for several minutes. After
surrendering, he refused to be photographed or fingerprinted and
has not spoken to police.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed without bail, he faces charges of unlawful imprisonment
and endangering the welfare of a child.

<HEADLINE> Four-Team Deal Completed in NBA  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The first four-team trade in NBA history was
completed Wednesday when nine players switched teams, with Howard
Eisley going to Dallas, Danny Fortson to Golden State, Donyell
Marshall to Utah and Robert Pack to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics also get center John ''Hot Rod'' Williams from
Dallas, Utah's first-round pick in 2001 and a ''substantial amount
of cash,'' general manager Chris Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston also sent guard Dana Barros to Dallas. Utah gets center
Bruno Sundov from Dallas, the Mavericks get forward Bill Curley
from Golden State and the Jazz sent forward Adam Keefe to the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very complicated trade,'' Wallace said. ''The largest
one I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was in the works all week, but the teams had to make
sure they remained within the NBA's salary cap rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a deal that was in again out again. It kept getting
closer and then one piece would fall out,'' Jazz vice president
Kevin O'Connor said. ''We feel we've won. Dallas feels they've won.
When you shake the deal down everyone got what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors felt the deal solidified their roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going into training camp, we have redefined what we have in
our backcourt and frontcourt, along with what we feel is a young
core group that will be able to learn and grow together,''
assistant general manager Gary Fitzsimmons said. ''We have added a
good group of players that will attack what we felt were our
weaknesses on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortson was a free agent who was considering signing a one-year
deal with the Knicks. The Warriors, however, were able to promise
him something New York could not: A spot in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not want to see Danny Fortson in a Knick uniform
without getting any compensation,'' Wallace said. ''And that's what
was going to happen if we did not get this deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisley, who was the primary backup to John Stockton in Utah,
passed on a five-year, $20 million contract last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's common knowledge we were not going to be able to re-sign
Howard,'' O'Connor said. ''In order for it to be a good deal for us
we wanted to make sure we acquired somebody that could help our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisley's departure clears the way for Jacque Vaughn to back up
Stockton. Eisley will be given a chance to start with the
Mavericks, who have been active on the trade market in Mark Cuban's
first offseason as owner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception has changed about the Mavericks. Before, you
used to look at Dallas and know you were going to get a win. Now
that has changed,'' Eisley said. ''Utah was great for me. I
couldn't have asked for a better team to learn from. Now I'm ready
to move forward and test the waters a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall averaged 14.2 points and a career-high 10 rebounds for
Golden State last season. He is a small forward who can also play
power forward and provide reserve help behind Karl Malone and Bryon
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Sundov, a 7-foot-2 center, was used sparingly by Dallas. Curley
also has played for Detroit, Minnesota and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pack and Williams are in the final year of their contracts,
which could give the Celtics some salary cap flexibility next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics recently acquired Randy Brown to back up Kenny
Anderson at point guard. Pack, who averaged 8.9 points and 5.8
assists last year, will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we needed three point guards. With the addition
of Randy and now Robert Pack, that makes us the deepest we've been
at that position,'' coach Rick Pitino said. ''There's always the
possibility that more trades could happen at point guard. So we're
not going to get too comfortable right now.''

<P>
   Williams, who missed all of last season with a back injury, was
included in the deal to make it work under cap rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''In all probability, he will not play,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the Celtics the potential for three first-round
picks in the next draft. They have the rights to Denver's
first-rounder as long as it is not among the top five picks; if it
is, they will get the Nuggets' pick in a future draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intention here today was to hoard more draft picks, which
was an important thing for us as an over-the-cap team,'' Wallace
said.

<HEADLINE> Jack Nicklaus' Mother Dies  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus was on the fourth hole when
he got the grim news. He had been expecting it since Monday, when
his mother told him she was ready to die after a lengthy illness.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 90, Helen Nicklaus had one last wish -- that her
death not interfere with a big moment in her son's career.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said Wednesday he would respect his mother's desires
and play in the PGA Championship, the final major in the final
season he plans to play all four of golf's major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her greatest fear in the last year or so was that she would
pass away during one of golf's major events,'' Nicklaus said ''I
know her wish would be for me to stay here and play. I certainly
would not want to not fulfill her last wishes, so I have decided to
remain here and play in the PGA Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus walked off the course Wednesday after being informed of
his mother's death following a two-year illness. He went into the
clubhouse and received condolences, while trying to gather his
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he skipped a previously scheduled press conference but
sent word through Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the PGA of
America, that he not only would play Thursday but would attend a
PGA dinner Wednesday night to receive the organization's
Distinguished Service Award.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was her wish, for me to be here tonight and to stay and
play here tomorrow,'' Nicklaus said. ''It will be a big day for
both of us. ... I'll have her in my thoughts. Maybe it will inspire
me to play a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said in a statement that he planned to fly to Columbus,
Ohio, after Thursday's round to be with family members, and return
to Louisville before his Friday afternoon round.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus visited his mother in Columbus on Monday, and she told
him that she was prepared for death.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of death, and the nature of Helen Nicklaus'
illness, were not released. She would have been 91 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her heart just wore out,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's death came as Nicklaus was preparing for his last
PGA Championship, on a course he designed.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has said this will be the last year he plays all four
majors. He has played 159 major pro championships, winning a record
18.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to tee off at 9:13 a.m. Thursday with Tiger
Woods and Vijay Singh. His Friday tee time is at 1:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was a normal golf tournament, he would have pulled out
without thinking about it,'' Singh said. ''It is a difficult choice
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els said he wouldn't have blamed Nicklaus had he pulled
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done his duty to himself, and his time is his time,'' Els
said. ''If he wants to play, he plays. If he doesn't, he doesn't
have to prove a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price said that the final wish of Helen Nicklaus ''shows
how tight his family is and that his mother knew all along how much
golf meant to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for Helen Nicklaus will be held at 10:30 a.m.
Monday at the Mill Run branch of the Upper Arlington Lutheran
Church. Viewing will be Sunday at Schoedinger Funeral Service in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' father, Charley, died in 1970. Besides her son, Helen
Nicklaus is survived by a daughter, Marilyn.

<HEADLINE> Another community misidentified in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - There's been another geographic gaff about
upstate New York in the U.S. Senate campaign, this time by
Republican Rick Lazio's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign on Tuesday put out a tentative itinerary for
Lazio's latest campaign swing on his bus, which is dubbed the
''Mainstream Express.'' The press advisory had him appearing
Thursday in ''Oswego, Broome County.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island congressman, in fact, is scheduled Thursday to
be in Owego, which is in Tioga County near Binghamton on the New
York-Pennsylvania line. Oswego is about 150 miles to the north in
Oswego County on Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans of Democratic Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
were quick to jump on the gaff.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're representative of the whole state, you at least have
to know that Owego is in Tioga County and Oswego is in Oswego
County,'' said former state Democratic Chairman John Sullivan, who
used to be mayor in Oswego. ''If you don't know that at this stage
of the campaign, then one would question the bonafides of your
candidacy, at least from an upstate perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first geographical error by the Lazio campaign on
the latest swing. Reporters accompanying the congressmen got mock
press credentials for the journey listing Lazio's itinerary on
which Cortland was misspelled ''Courtland'' and Canandaigua
''Canadaigua.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have made much of their opponents'
misidentification of upstate communities during the campaign. Since
neither has ever lived upstate, which is considered a crucial
battleground in the election, each has tried to appear more
knowledgeable than the other about the region and its problems.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was still
in the race, he was criticized for confusing Monroe in the Catskill
Mountains with Monroe County, surrounding Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   An ad by the Washington, D.C.-based Republican Leadership
Council blasting Clinton for appearing on an Erie, Pa., radio
station interview believing she was talking to listeners in Erie
County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Patrick McCarthy dismissed the
Owego-Oswego error as a ''typo.'' He said a press advisory had
gotten ''Owego'' right twice earlier in the day but that the last
version had it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously know the difference between Owego and Oswego,''
McCarthy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the mock press cards which got the spellings of Cortland and
Canandaigua wrong, McCarthy joked, ''We may have contracted them
out to a company from Erie, Pennsylvania.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Glynn To Resume Workouts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers pitcher Ryan Glynn is
expected to resume workouts Saturday after medical tests determined
the cause of his sudden fainting and that he had no lingering
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hunter, the Rangers' internist, said Wednesday that
Glynn could be more susceptible to fainting again under certain
conditions, but there is nothing wrong with the pitcher's heart.
Glynn had never experienced such a problem before.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn suddenly passed out after being taken out in the fifth
inning of Friday night's game against Boston. He had thrown 95
pitches in a game that started in 98-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said dehydration is a condition that could have provoked
the fainting.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher was hospitalized overnight and put through an
initial series of tests after passing out in the dugout. He was
later placed on the 15-day disabled list effective Saturday as more
tests were done to determine the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said Glynn, 25, would have to clear a final physical
examination Friday before being cleared to pitch again.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Kurt Warner is getting a lot of rest this week due to
a sore
arm, although the St. Louis Rams' MVP quarterback doesn't appear
concerned.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''As many times as we throw in camp and as many reps as I've
taken, it's normal to get some type of soreness,'' Warner said
Wednesday. ''We're just trying to attack it while the problem is
small so it feels good come Monday night in the opener.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner didn't practice Tuesday or Wednesday and was hopeful of
getting on the field on Thursday, although coach Mike Martz talked
earlier this week of shutting him down until Saturday's exhibition
game against the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   He's played sparingly in the preseason, and won't get more than
one quarter of work against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that,'' Martz said. ''If you're not careful, he's going to
have a dead arm the rest of the season. He's at the point where his
arm is extremely tired, and this is when you get problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Warner isn't worried is that he had a sore
arm the last half of last season. He never mentioned it during the
Rams' drive to their Super Bowl victory over the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, I had the same type of stiffness and soreness for
probably the last eight weeks of the season and into the playoffs,
and it was just something we treated every day,'' Warner said.
''But it never became a problem and it's something I can definitely
play with.''
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   Jim Druckenmiller, a former first-round draft pick, was waived
Wednesday after losing a battle with journeyman Mike Quinn for a
job as the team's third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller, 27, hasn't thrown a pass in a regular-season game
since 1997, his rookie season with San Francisco. He was taken with
the 26th pick in the draft that year by the 49ers, then traded in
September 1999 to Miami for a seventh-round pick in this year's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I don't believe that Jim could challenge for
the starting job,'' coach Dave Wannstedt said in a statement. ''So
I wanted to make this move to give Jim a chance to explore other
options in the league.''
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   With lingering tendinitis in his throwing arm, Brett Favre said
he ''easily could be'' out of the Packers' lineup for their last
two preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who hasn't practiced in a week, said it was too soon to
tell whether his streak of 125 consecutive regular-season starts --
longest in NFL history by a quarterback -- is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've played a long time, and I've been fortunate not to have
injuries,'' the three-time MVP said. ''This isn't something I'm
used to, but it's part of the game. I'd much rather be out
practicing with the teammates, but I guess it had to come some
time. I'm just trying to deal with it.''
Browns:
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Ty Detmer was officially placed on injured
reserve Wednesday, making him ineligible to return this season.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer injured his Achilles' tendon during Saturday's preseason
game against Chicago. He had surgery Monday and will need up to
eight months for injury rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Jeremy McKinney also was placed on injured
reserve.
Falcons:
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive end Brady Smith will not play in Friday
night's preseason game against the San Diego Chargers because of a
groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, injured Tuesday during a pass rush drill, was still being
evaluated Wednesday by team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Falcons are out due to injury: tackle Ryan
Johanningmeir (back), tackle Ephraim Salaam (knee) and linebacker
Jon Hesse (neck). In addition, linebacker Brian Smith has been
placed on the reserve/non-football injury list. Smith dislocated
his knee this spring while playing for the Scottish Claymores of
NFL Europe.
Jaguars:
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville acquired guard Brenden Stai from Kansas City for an
undisclosed draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brenden Stai is a guy we have great experience with,'' Jaguars
coach Tom Coughlin said Wednesday. ''We played against him when he
was in Pittsburgh, and we know him as an outstanding blocker, a
tough guy and an outstanding tempo guy on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 312-pounder from Nebraska started 59 of 68 games
he played since 1995, when he was selected in the third round of
the NFL draft by the Steelers.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Second-year halfback Sean Bennett has a problem with his right
knee that will sideline him a week or two, jeopardizing his
availability for the season-opener against Arizona on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett had an MRI on the knee Tuesday and coach Jim Fassel said
Wednesday that he still needed more information from the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are concerned a few extra things are going on,'' Fassel
said. ''But they are still telling me it will probably be another
week or two. He needs to strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also has been bothered by an injury to the thigh just
above the knee.
49ers:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young visited training camp and chatted briefly with his
successor, Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Young casually walked on to the 49ers' practice field at the
University of the Pacific, and it wasn't long before the small
crowd that was gathered noticed and started yelling ''Steve!''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time Pro Bowl selection, who took the 49ers to a Super
Bowl title in 1995, retired in June after missing most of last
season with his fourth concussion in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in camp, Garcia had suggested to reporters that Young
was not very helpful to him last season. The local media seized on
the comments, and Garcia countered that his words had been blown
out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia later left phone messages with Young to explain himself
and clear the air. Young called the situation a ''non-issue.''

<HEADLINE> Documentary Identifies Fairbanks Jr  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The rakishly handsome Hollywood actor Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. had long been suspected of being the ''headless man''
photographed in a series of explicit sexual poses with the Duchess
of Argyll more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But a British documentary program last week offered fresh
evidence that not only did Fairbanks star in the compromising 1956
photos, but that the Conservative government of Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan conspired to suppress the pictures, fearing an
even wider sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The sensational Polaroid pictures of society beauty Margaret
were discovered by the Duke of Argyll in his wife's desk drawer and
used against her in a raucous four-year divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the sex scandal was a handwritten, captioned
photo of the so-called ''headless man.'' In it the duchess, wearing
only pearls, was shown performing a sexual act on a naked man in
the bathroom of her Mayfair apartment. The man was shown only from
the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   The Duchess steadfastly refused to reveal her partner. Fairbanks
headed the list of 88 possible lovers submitted to the court by her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Duncan Sandys, then Britain's defense secretary, was also
named as a possible paramour. Transport Minister Ernest Marples and
Baron Sigismund von Braun, the diplomat brother of the German
rocket scientist Werner von Braun, were among the many suspects.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Channel 4 documentary, a court inquiry led by
Lord Denning invited five suspects to the treasury office for
questioning. Each guest signed the visitors' book, allowing a
graphologist to compare their handwriting to the captions inscribed
on the pictures. Fairbanks' signature was an obvious match.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary alleged that the inquiry's findings were hushed
up by Macmillan's government because of worries that Sandys may
have also been involved with the Duchess.
</P>
<P>
   Sandys, who was also Sir Winston Churchill's son-in-law, offered
to resign during a cabinet meeting, Channel 4 said. But the thought
of a sex scandal alarmed the government. Only three weeks earlier,
War Minister John Profumo had left the government in disgrace after
publicly lying about his involvement with a call-girl ring.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jay, a treasury official who assisted Denning in his
inquiry, told the documentary program that although Fairbanks was
identified, his name was not released in the inquiry's report.
</P>
<P>
   Sandys, who died in 1987, admitted nothing, although he once
referred to the duchess by saying: ''There's safety in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The duchess, who died in 1993 at age 80, always refused to
reveal her partners' names. Fairbanks, who died in May at age 90,
maintained his innocence until the end.

<HEADLINE> Clues scarce in crash that forced Broward grandmother into swamp  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Investigators have few clues in the
hit-and-run accident that forced an 83-year-old woman off a 40-foot
bridge and into a swamp, where she survived for three days before
her rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives scraped paint chips from the trunk of Tillie Tooter's
Toyota and collected headlight glass from Interstate 595, hoping to
match it to a suspect's car if one is found, said Florida Highway
Patrol Lt. John Bagnardi.
</P>
<P>
   The FHP received several calls with possible leads since Tooter
was discovered Tuesday inside her car, which was suspended in trees
a foot above the water. So far, none have panned out, Bagnardi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking for a needle in a haystack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tooter remained in serious condition Wednesday at
Broward General Medical Center recovering from dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Guarneri said kidney problems caused by Tooter's
dehydration have been corrected and her blood chemistry is almost
back to normal. He is also treating the hundreds of ant and
mosquito bites the Pembroke Pines widow suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simms, Tooter's daughter, and Lori Simms, her
granddaughter, said Tooter's strength continues to amaze them.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's laughing. She is starting to get back into her
spirits,'' said Lori Simms, a Marlboro, N.J. resident.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simms, also from Marlboro, said her mother is angry that
the other driver didn't stop to help her or call police.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could anybody be so cruel as to hit somebody and then run
away?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter, a former hairstylist, electrologist, bookkeeper and
garment worker, was struck from behind and forced off the bridge
early Saturday as she drove to Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood
International Airport to pick up her Lori Simms and Simms'
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   A thicket of mangrove and willow trees cushioned her fall and
kept the car suspended about a foot above the alligator- and
snake-infested swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an extensive search, she remained missing until
15-year-old Justin Vannelli, who was cleaning the highway for his
dad's company, noticed an indentation in the trees, looked over the
bridge and saw Tooter's car.

<HEADLINE> Torres Gets a Win at Swim Trials  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With Jenny Thompson no longer around, Dara
Torres finally got that long-awaited victory at the U.S. Olympic
swim trials.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, made sure she'll have a busy schedule in Sydney by
beating defending Olympic champion Amy Van Dyken in the 50-meter
freestyle Wednesday night, a victory tainted just a bit by the
woman who wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, saying she had a full schedule for Sydney, scratched
from the 50 after edging Torres in both the 100 free and 100
butterfly. Minus her chief rival, Torres ensured her third
individual race at the Olympics by finishing in 24.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to be able to go faster,'' said Torres, who finished
short of her American record and more than a half-second off Inge
de Bruijn's world record of 24.39. ''The times I swam here won't
compete in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final event of the eight-day trials, Erik Vendt of North
Easton, Mass., became the first American to go under 15 minutes in
the 1,500 free. He broke George DiCarlo's 16-year-old national
record in swimming's version of the marathon at 14:59.11.
</P>
<P>
   Vendt, who already earned a spot on the team in the 400
individual medley, ripped off his goggles and searched for the
scoreboard as soon as he touched. When he saw the time, breaking
DiCarlo's record of 15:01.51, the 19-year-old pumped his weary arms
in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great to win and get an American record in the same
race,'' Vendt said. ''It's been my goal ever since I started
swimming the mile at age 12. At the 1,100 mark, I could hear the
crowd going crazy and I knew I was on pace for something -- I
figured the American record.''
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the grueling race, Vendt pulled away from
favored Chris Thompson, who won a bronze medal at the 1999 Pan
Pacific Championships. The 21-year-old native of Roseburg, Ore.,
took the second Olympic spot in 15:09.16.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, the oldest woman ever to make the U.S. swim team, showed
the wear and tear of her busy schedule. She'll be the first
American swimmer ever to compete in four Olympics, having been in
1984, '88 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   ''My legs are sore,'' said Torres, who will probably swim two
relays in Sydney as well. ''I'm upset with my time but glad to
finally get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, who became the first American woman to win four gold
medals in one Games four years ago, spit in Torres' adjoining lane
before the race -- a tactic that has been known to intimidate her
chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always spit in Dara's lane,'' Van Dyken said. ''It's nothing
against her. I think she got upset the first time because she
hadn't swum against me before. I told her, 'I've got nothing but
love for you if I spit in your lane.'''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work, but Van Dyken gets a chance to repeat as the 50
champion after claiming the other spot on the American team in
24.99.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 50 free is my baby and I'm excited to swim it,'' she said.
''I would like to have won it. But at this meet, second is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   For both women, the race was another chapter in their comeback
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Torres left swimming after the 1992 Barcelona Games, spending
the next seven years dabbling in modeling and infomercials. But she
returned last year and has been swimming even better than she did
in her previous life.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken underwent shoulder surgery in 1998 and a similar
operation in January. She didn't resume training until March,
arriving at the trials merely hoping to earn a spot on the relay
teams. She wound up challenging her winning time from the Atlanta
Games, 24.87.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go under 25 seconds is so exciting,'' she said. ''I have a
lot more room for improvement. You'll see a lot faster than I was
in Atlanta. The more I rest, the better I get.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the U.S. men's team is younger than the
women. No world records were broken at the trials, but Vendt's
performance was the ninth American mark.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Disrupt Chilean Senate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chanting slogans in support of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, protesters on Wednesday interrupted a Chilean
Senate session devoted to discussing the embattled former
dictator's 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Police ordered the Pinochet backers to leave a debate on the
causes and consequences of Pinochet's 1973 coup and the human
rights abuses committed by his regime. The demonstrators left
peacefully, still chanting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Supreme Court stripped Pinochet of his
legislative immunity from prosecution, clearing the way for a trial
on human rights charges. According to a government report, 3,197
people were killed or disappeared for political reasons under
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's senate session was called by right-wing senators to
discuss the coup, in which Pinochet overthrew elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour debate was seen as the beginning of a right-wing
campaign to promote political support for the legally embattled
former dictator. As expected, it developed along the lines that
have divided Chile for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Many on the right insist the coup prevented Allende's
Marxist-dominated coalition from establishing a totalitarian,
Cuban-style regime. Under Allende's three-year government, Chile
plunged into political and economic crisis with often violent
political conflict, acute shortages and 500 percent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist politicians say the Allende government was responsible
for errors, but that the Pinochet regime was guilty of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist jailed
under Pinochet, stayed away from Wednesday's debate, warning that
it would only promote more division. The debate, which may resume
Thursday, is not expected to reach any conclusion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 35th homer and Mark Gardner
pitched seven strong innings to lead the San Francisco Giants to a
4-1 win over the Montreal Expos on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win allowed the NL West-leading Giants to remain one game
ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who beat Philadelphia 5-1
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is 0-6 on its current homestand. The Expos have won
just once in their last 12 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit his 27th career homer at Olympic Stadium with two outs
in the fifth off Dustin Hermanson (8-11). Bonds passed Hall of
Famer Mike Schmidt for the most home runs by a visiting player
since the Expos began playing in the stadium in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (8-6) scattered six hits and didn't allow a walk. He
struck out four. Geoff Blum's two-out homer in the seventh
accounted for Montreal's only run.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 30th save in 35 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller hit a one-out double in the first and Bonds drew
his first of three walks. Both runners advanced on catcher Michael
Barrett's passed ball and Mueller scored on Jeff Kent's bloop
single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants went ahead 2-0 on J.T. Snow's sacrifice fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' homer made it 3-0 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, who hit his eighth homer, was the only Expo to reach third
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia's RBI single in the eighth drove in the Giants'
fourth run and chased Hermanson.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, 0-4 in his last five starts, allowed four runs and
seven hits in 7 2-3 innings. He is 3-8 in 14 starts since rejoining
the starting rotation on June 5 after a brief stint as the team's
closer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Schmidt hit a total of 32 homers in Montreal, six at Jarry
Park. ... John Johnstone allowed one run and two hits in one inning
Tuesday night in his first rehab appearance for Single-A San Jose.
He threw 14 of 20 pitches for strikes, striking out two. ... Lee
Stevens signed a two-year contract extension with the Expos before
the game. Stevens was eligible to become a free agent following the
season. ... Hermanson has allowed 20 homers this season, the most
by an Expos pitcher this season, one more than Javier Vazquez.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russian Arms Negotiators Meet  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Top U.S. and Russian arms negotiators met
Wednesday, seeking to build on a commitment by Presidents Bill
Clinton and Vladimir Putin to improve safeguards against the
accidental launch of a nuclear war, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials refused to reveal the location of the three-day
meeting between teams led by John Holum, the Clinton
administration's chief arms negotiator, and Yuri Kapralov, head of
the Russian arms control directorate. Russian officials, however,
said it was taking place in the Russian diplomatic mission to U.N.
offices in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the U.S. mission said the meeting was
''following up on the joint statement of President Clinton and
President Putin in Okinawa on cooperation on strategic stability.''
The statement said the negotiators would continue a year-old series
of talks aimed at writing a new treaty to reduce long-range nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the G-8 summit in Okinawa, Japan, last
month, Clinton and Putin issued a statement saying they planned to
set up a joint U.S.-Russia center for exchange of data from systems
that provide early warning in the event of a missile launch. The
negotiators have to work out implementation.
</P>
<P>
   A second project, proposed by the Clinton administration, would
involve ways for each side to warn the other that a test missile or
a space rocket has been launched. The objective is to allay
misunderstandings and avert a dangerous response.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the table for consideration at Geneva is a joint
U.S.-Russian project known as RAMOS -- for Russian American
Observation Satellite -- designed to improve sensors in early
warning satellites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United States is seeking Russian agreement
to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that it can
deploy a shield to guard against a missile attack from nations like
North Korea or Iraq. Russia -- with the backing of China and even
U.S. allies -- is strongly opposed to any change in the ABM treaty
on the grounds that it could undermine international arms-control
treaties and spark a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has proposed working on parts of a text
for a third Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START III, to
reduce U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The START II treaty, concluded in January 1993, reduced warheads
to 3,000-3,500 on each side. Ratified by the U.S. Senate and
finally, this year, by the Russian parliament, it has yet to take
effect.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seek Crime Victims' Kin  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Families of some prominent recent crime
victims were pressed into service Wednesday to showcase Al Gore as
a fighter for gun controls and hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the need to attack hate crimes, the Democratic
National Convention called on Judy and Dennis Shepard, parents of a
gay University of Wyoming student who was beaten and left to die on
a fence. Ross Byrd and Rene Mullins, the children of a black man
who was chained to a truck and dragged to his death in Texas, also
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hate crimes must die but my father's legacy must live on,''
Mullins told the crowd. ''America has a choice in November.'' Texas
delegates chanted as she finished: ''Never again in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men convicted in the killing of James Byrd Jr. were
sentenced to death; a third, to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Anna, the mother of Lauren Townsend, who was killed in the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, was among those
enlisted to speak about how crime and guns have upended their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''When our voices are heard, and we create a safe haven for our
children, Lauren's memory will be honored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of activists who are pressing for hate-crime
legislation said the presence of Matthew Shepard's parents and
Byrd's children helped drive home a contrast between Gore, who
supports giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing
hate-crime charges, and his Republican presidential opponent,
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, says ''all crime is hate crime'' and
declined to support legislation in his state last year, inspired by
Byrd's death, to expand hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of hate-crime laws say the sentences of death and life
in prison in the Byrd and Shepard cases show there is no need for
special categories of prosecution based on race or sexual
orientation. Two men convicted in Shepard's death received two life
terms each.
</P>
<P>
   In even tones, Dennis Shepard told the delegates ''everybody has
the right to be different'' but his son was not given that right.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a gay rights issue,'' he said. ''This is a human
rights issue.''
</P>
<P>
   From the floor, Puerto Rican delegate Andrew L. Praschak held up
a rainbow flag signifying gay unity as the Shepards were on stage.
He said that because of his party's support for hate crime
legislation, ''at least I feel that somebody cares about me.''

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Tim Hudson OKs New A's Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics signed All-Star
right-hander Tim Hudson to a four-year contract extension worth $9
million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, 25, is fourth in the AL with 13 wins, and has a 4.79 ERA
in 23 starts for Oakland this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to know he's going to be around for a while,'' A's
manager Art Howe said. ''He's special. He's proven his mettle for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is 24-6 in 44 career starts, and his .800 winning
percentage is the best in Oakland history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I'm very happy. The organization has given me the
opportunity and had the confidence in me to work something out,''
Hudson said. ''Hopefully I can help this team out for years to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks began at the end of spring training, and heated
up once the A's signed third baseman Eric Chavez to a four-year
deal earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to wait my turn,'' Hudson said. ''We all signed
four-year deals, so we know we'll be together for a while. That
gives us a chance to build some chemistry between us.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal extends Hudson's contract through the 2004 season, when
he will be eligible for free agency. The A's have 10 players signed
beyond the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is the fourth player to sign a four-year extension with
Oakland this season. In addition to Chavez, shortstop Miguel Tejada
and outfielder Ben Grieve signed deals earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Rethinking Congo Mission  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A year ago, the United Nations was talking
about a major peacekeeping operation in Congo with a minimum of
25,000 soldiers. Now, it's reevaluating plans to send 5,500
observers to the central African nation because there is no peace
to keep.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council on Wednesday,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he wants to examine what role
U.N. military observers can play when a year-old cease-fire is
crumbling and U.N. staff in Congo are vilified and face severe
restrictions on their freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the 15-member council to extend the mandate of the U.N.
mission, known as MONUC, which is due to expire on Aug. 31, for one
month until Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the extension will give him time to undertake a
''substantial reevaluation'' and consider the implications of
recent developments. Among other things, he singled out this week's
summit of African leaders in Zambia, which failed to agree on
measures to revive the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Congo began two years ago. Rebel forces backed by
Rwanda and Uganda have been trying to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, who has received support from Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe. The Rwanda-Uganda alliance later fell apart, with each
country backing rival rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   When the warring parties signed a cease-fire in Lusaka, Zambia,
last summer, U.N. officials envisioned an eventual peacekeeping
operation with a minimum of 25,000 soldiers. That would be the
largest U.N. peacekeeping mission in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, the Security Council agreed to send 500
military observers backed by 5,037 U.N. troops to monitor the
cease-fire and lay the groundwork for a possible full-fledged
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   But deployment was conditioned on security guarantees for the
troops. So far, only 264 military observers and about 15
international staff have been sent to Congo because of heavy
fighting and security problems.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general and the United States blame the Congolese
government for stonewalling on implementation of the cease-fire.
Annan noted the ''adverse climate'' which is still preventing
deployment of the U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is characterized by persistent large-scale
fighting in many parts of the country, severe restrictions imposed
by the government and other parties on the mission's freedom of
movement, the refusal of the government to permit the deployment of
United Nations armed troops,'' he said in the letter. He also noted
''a sustained campaign of vilification conducted against MONUC and
individual members of its staff, which has created a significant
risk to their security.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Grumbling About Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prominent Democrats at the party's national
convention are grumbling about President Clinton's personal
mistakes and their impact and urging him to cede the spotlight to
likely nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left town after offering the convention a triumphant
review of his accomplishments Monday night. On the same day Clinton
addressed the convention, Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware
talked to Iowa delegates outside the hall about the effect of the
president's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been so cowered as a party by a guy I love, Bill
Clinton's incredible indiscretions,'' Biden said. ''I think we
should make this election about integrity, I think we should make
this election about honesty ... not shy away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts,
emphasized the need for Clinton to cede the spotlight to Gore now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may need to get the Jaws of Life to pry him free from the
thing -- but we've got to pry him free,'' Kerry said Wednesday of
Clinton. ''The fact is ... he is a vastly talented, enormously
engaged political person, but he has to step back now. And I think
he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senator, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said Tuesday that
Clinton's failure to cede the political spotlight could be critical
for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't, it will be very difficult for Al Gore to win,''
said Kerrey, who has clashed with Clinton in the past. ''He's not
only got to get off the stage, he's got to allow the vice president
to say 'I'm a different person and I am going to do things
differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter said Clinton's ''escapades'' are Gore's
''biggest handicap'' and the vice president must distance himself
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think anyone who believes that he's responsible for what
Bill Clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is
absolutely stupid and ridiculous,'' Carter told Georgia delegates
Tuesday. ''Somewhere in the American people's minds, he has to
convince them of that absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> Els Tries Not To Think About Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Ernie Els knows better than anyone what
it's like to finish second behind Tiger Woods. Twice in the last
two majors by 23 strokes. Five times in Woods' last nine victories.
</P>
<P>
   He also knows there is a difference between finishing second and
getting beat.
</P>
<P>
   All Els wants out of himself in the PGA Championship is four
good rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to think about how I'm going to beat Tiger, or
how the field is going to beat Tiger,'' he said. ''As I've said,
he's probably going to win it. But let's see if I can do my thing,
and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened so far is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Woods shattered scoring records in becoming the
youngest player to complete the Grand Slam, but Els has carved his
own niche in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, no one had ever finished second in three straight
majors. The only other player to be runner-up in the majors three
times in a single year was Jack Nicklaus in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ''On paper, it is unbelievable,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   On the course, it has been a different story. The only
legitimate chance he had to win was the Masters, where he missed
three medium-range birdie putts on the last three holes and
finished three strokes back of Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   He trailed Woods by 10 strokes after the third round of the U.S.
Open and wound up 15 strokes behind. He was eight strokes behind
going into Sunday at St. Andrews and that was the final deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were good finishes,'' Els said. ''But obviously, they
weren't as good as what it is made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Els knows what a good finish really is -- even if the result was
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, Els flew halfway around the world to Hawaii
with his health good, his game sharp and his hopes high. Over four
days, he matched Woods shot for shot in the Mercedes Championship,
following him into the 18th hole with an eagle to force a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Els wound up in a spot that has become all too familiar --
second place -- when Woods rolled in a double-breaking putt from 40
feet on the second extra hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''His ability to do what he does at the right time ... that's
the genius he is,'' Els said. ''But when I'm on, I can play with
the guy. That's what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been able to do that this summer in the majors. Now,
Woods goes into the PGA Championship with a chance to become the
first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in a year,
and the first player in 73 years to repeat as PGA champion.
</P>
<P>
   Woods began his final preparations at 6:45 a.m., as a light fog
dusted the thick, Kentucky bluegrass that frames every fairway at
Valhalla. His mood was light, his shirt soaked in sweat before the
sun could even rise over the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the heat is on.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure is just as great on Els, Phil Mickelson, Colin
Montgomerie and Hal Sutton, who are seen as the chief challengers
to Woods making more history. It is not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ''It Tiger plays like he is capable of playing, he is tough to
beat. He's proven that,'' said Mark Brooks, who won at Valhalla
four years ago. ''If the guy is stronger, faster, smarter, all the
other things, he usually wins. Right now, I think he is right
there. I hope he's peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to believe Els can get into contention -- a lot
different than simply being on the leaderboard -- when Sunday rolls
around. In his last four tournaments, he has won twice and finished
second twice.
</P>
<P>
   The victories came over Tom Lehman and Montgomerie at Loch
Lomond, and over Mickelson and Greg Norman at The International.
The second-place finishes were in the majors, to Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ernie has got to be taking positives from this because he beat
the other 150-whatever guys in the field,'' said Nick Faldo, who in
1988 finished second, third and fourth in the last three majors.
''Tiger is just in a class by himself. Ernie has got his three
silver medals. He's just got to put four good rounds together.''
</P>
<P>
   Els has been getting closer. He has reached a level in the last
month where he no longer thinks about anything but taking back the
most graceful swing in golf and letting it rip.
</P>
<P>
   All he lacks is all he wants -- four good rounds.
</P>
<P>
   He played only one solid round at Pebble Beach, and fell from
contention at St. Andrews when he followed his opening-round 66
with an even-par 72. From there, he faced the hopeless task of
trying to catch Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you can play some really good golf and somebody else
just plays better,'' said Tom Lehman, the only man to play in the
final group of the U.S. Open four straight times without winning.
''Tiger has played really phenomenal. There's not much you can do
about that. When the top players are hitting on all cylinders, they
can really distance themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when Ernie plays his best, Ernie is going to win.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Yankees 0  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Brian Sikorski pitched into the eighth
inning in his major league debut as the Texas Rangers snapped their
10-game losing streak to the New York Yankees with a 5-0 victory
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas was able to snap its losing streak to New York,
Rangers' center fielder Gabe Kapler was unable to extend his
28-game hitting streak. He was 0-for-4, ending the longest hitting
streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski, called up from Triple-A Oklahoma to make the spot
start, limited the Yankees to just four hits before he was pulled
from the game after walking Derek Jeter to lead off the eighth.
Mike Venafro finished the four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer had a two-run triple and Rafael Palmeiro hit his
first homer in 12 days for Texas, which avoided being swept at home
by the Yankees for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   New York's 10-game winning streak over the Rangers had included
the seven previous games this year and three in last year's
playoffs. The Yankees have still won 39 of the last 51 games
between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski, who was 10-9 at Oklahoma and leads the Pacific Coast
League with five complete games, struck out five and walked four in
his 108-pitch effort.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeter led off the Yankees' third inning with a double,
Sikorski retired 13 straight batters before walking Jorge Posada in
the seventh. He then gave up a pinch-hit single to Jose Canseco,
but both runners were left stranded when Luis Polonia flew out to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski's biggest jam came in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice's sharp single to right and a double into the
right-field corner by Tino Martinez started the Yankees' second.
Sikorski then had two straight strikeouts, and after walking No. 9
hitter Jose Vizcaino to load the bases, got Polonia on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez (8-10) lost his fourth
straight start, and third since coming off the disabled list
because of back spasms and a sore elbow. He allowed five runs and
eight hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski was starting in place of Ryan Glynn, who was placed on
the 15-day disabled list after he suddenly passed out in the dugout
during a game last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had initially planned to use Jonathan Johnson in the
series finale, but he was forced into early relief and went 4 1-3
innings for his longest career appearance as a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's two-run triple came in the fifth on a ball that Polonia
misplayed in left. Polonia charged in on the fast-falling liner,
but the ball short-hopped in front of him, glanced off his glove
and rolled toward the wall as the Rangers went ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's solo homer, a 391-foot shot to right in the fourth,
was his 30th of the season. Luis Alicea added an RBI single. Frank
Catalanotto had an RBI groundout in the seventh for Texas.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro's homer was the 391st of his career, and moved him
past Graig Nettles on the career list. He's now five shy of Joe
Carter, who is 34th on the list. ... The Yankees missed a chance to
sweep a season series at Texas for the first time in their history.
They won the first five there this season.

<HEADLINE> Montana Gov. Declares Disaster Area  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- The governor declared the entire state of
Montana a disaster area Wednesday as authorities issued a new
evacuation order for part of the burned, smoke-choked Bitterroot
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster order from Gov. Marc Racicot allows him to tap
state resources and the National Guard to battle wildfires. It was
scheduled to take effect at midnight Wednesday, said Anastasia
Burton, spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The order primarily allows use of the National Guard anywhere in
the state, officials said. Previous orders by Racicot allowed use
of guard units only in specified areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million acres of forest, brush and grass had been
blackened by the 86 large wildland fires burning Wednesday in 13
Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center
in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's 25 largest active fires accounted for nearly half of
that total acreage, the agency said. So far this year, more than
2,000 fires have burned 457,000 acres statewide.
</P>
<P>
   A deadline of Thursday night was set for people to move out of a
fire-threatened area south of where other Bitterroot Valley
residents had been allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evacuations were in a large area some 50 miles south
of Hamilton, almost in Idaho, and covered about 100 homes, said Jim
Chinn of the Ravalli County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   While residents of some 900 houses have been allowed to return
home, hundreds of others remained out of their homes for a second
week as fires burned on.
</P>
<P>
   A fire south of Helena also triggered evacuations and burned
some land owned by media magnate Ted Turner, who owns four bison
ranches in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Federal land managers are closing the Salmon River and the 2.4
million-acre Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho to
public use effective Thursday. Fires were burning over 182,000
acres in the protected area.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, 55 people had been evacuated from the southern Black
Hills, south of Hot Springs, S.D., where a 7,000-acre blaze was 60
percent contained. It is unlikely that they will be allowed to
return home before the fire is fully contained, which is expected
on Friday, said Forest Service spokesman Terry Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, a wildfire that forced hundreds to evacuate a lodge
and a campground continued spreading and prompted officials to
close Yellowstone National Park's south entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The fire danger extended to Alaska, where the National Weather
Service on Tuesday issued a ''red flag warning,'' its most severe
fire warning, for the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity in the area was only about 17 percent, significantly
lower than the usual 50 percent, and state fire managers were
concerned because many of their crews were battling fires in the
Lower 48 states.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Kapler Ends Hitting Streak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas' Gabe Kapler failed to extend his
28-game hitting streak when he was 0-for-4 against the New York
Yankees on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The streak was the longest in the majors this season, but still
only halfway to Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game streak from 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In his last chance to extend the streak, Kapler struck out in
the eighth inning against Randy Choate. He also flew out to right
and grounded out twice, one of those a backhanded stab by Yankees
shortstop Derek Jeter in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler had extended the hitting streak three times in his final
at-bat, including Tuesday night with a single in the eighth inning
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kapler failed to extend his hitting streak, the
Rangers snapped their 10-game losing streak to the Yankees with a
5-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   During the 28-game streak, a Rangers franchise record, Kapler
batted .375 (42-for-112) with six homers and 21 RBI. He had had a
hit in every game since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The best previous hitting streak in Texas/Washington franchise
history was a 24-game hitting streak by Mickey Rivers from Aug. 14
through Sept. 9, 1980.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 7, Mets 5  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Brian Bohanon shut down his former team until
the eighth inning and Todd Helton was in the middle of two late
bursts that led the Colorado Rockies over the New York Mets 7-5
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Helton went 1-for-4, dropping his major league-leading average
one point to .395. He was hit by a pitch in the sixth, setting up a
three-run inning, and doubled during a three-run eighth that made
it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds drove in three runs, Larry Walker hit a two-run
single and Neifi Perez homered as Colorado bounced back a day after
being swept in a doubleheader by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo and Kurt Abbott homered to finish Bohanon (7-8)
in the eighth, and Todd Zeile hit an RBI double off Mike DeJean to
pull the Mets within 7-5. Gabe White got four outs for his fourth
save.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo drove in three runs as New York lost for the second time
in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies third baseman Jeff Cirillo left in the sixth because of
a strained right forearm. He was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, who pitched for the Mets from 1997-98, beat them for
the first time in four career decisions. He held the Mets to one
unearned run and four singles through seven innings, and also hit
an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch (8-10), like Bohanon, was crisp early. The first
five innings took only 61 minutes as both starters avoided too much
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who hit a solo homer in the first, singled with one out
in the sixth. With two outs, the left-handed Rusch dropped down
sidearm on the lefty-hitting Helton and plunked him near the right
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds followed with an RBI single for a 2-1 lead and Walker
delivered a two-run single. Hammonds, one of the few Rockies ever
to face Rusch, is 7-for-14 lifetime against him.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shumpert, who took Cirillo's place, hit a leadoff single
in the eighth and Helton doubled just inside the left-field line.
Rick White relieved and gave up Hammonds' two-run single and
Bohanon's RBI single for a 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott homered to start the Mets eighth and Alfonzo hit a
two-run shot with two outs, bringing DeJean from the bullpen. Mike
Piazza singled and hustled home on Zeile's double, but Gabe White
struck out Robin Ventura to end the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani reached on second baseman Jeff Frye's two-base
fielding error to lead off the Mets first, Derek Bell walked and
Alfonzo hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets reserve Matt Franco cleared waivers and was sent
outright to Triple-A Norfolk. Franco, hitting .231 with seven RBIs
in 80 games, was designated for assignment last week. ... Colorado
holds a 39-37 edge over the Mets in the all-time series. ... Walker
and Piazza both hit foul balls that broke off pieces of the
dome-shaped microphone on top of the backstop. ... Bohanon homered
and doubled in his last start against Montreal.

<HEADLINE> County Responds To Columbine Brief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jefferson County commissioners and the sheriff's
office cannot be held responsible for massacre at Columbine High
School, the county said Wednesday in its latest effort to avoid
litigation by victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   County lawyers contend the families of students wounded in the
1999 rampage have failed to support their arguments for suing the
county.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-page document filed in U.S. District Court is a response
to Columbine families' arguments for their lawsuit to proceed. The
county earlier asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the families of Valeen Schnurr, Evan Todd and
Jeanna Park claimed authorities mishandled the response to the
April 19, 1999, shooting rampage that left 15 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   A botched response violated the victims' constitutional rights,
the families contended. They defended the claim by arguing a
special relationship existed between law-enforcement officials and
the people in the school as the emergency response unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The families also asserted a special relationship existed,
increasing the county's responsibility, because police dispatchers
told a teacher and students under fire in the library to stay
there. Most of the 13 people shot by gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold were shot in the library.
</P>
<P>
   The county responded the families have failed to support the
claim the wounded students' constitutional rights were violated.
Their lawsuit ignores case law on the state statute shielding
governments from litigation in most circumstances, county lawyers
said.

<HEADLINE> Plane Hijacked, Robbed in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Armed men hijacked a Brazilian
airliner with 72 people aboard on Wednesday and forced the pilot to
land at an isolated airstrip in southern Brazil, then fled with at
least $3.3 million in stolen cash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 66 passengers were tourists from Italy, France and
Japan returning from the famous Iguacu Falls on the border with
Argentina, police and airline officials said. They and the six crew
members on the Vasp Airline jet were all unharmed, said Federal
Police officer Roberto Viana dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the passengers were not released.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the hijackers pointed a pistol at the head of the pilot
and forced him to land. He also fired a shot in the cabin to scare
the pilot,'' dos Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports as to where the hijackers got the
money. Officers said some was stolen from an armored car in the
southern city of Foz do Iguacu, where the flight originated.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports, however, said the money was stolen from the
plane's cargo hold. The money was being transported for local
banks.
</P>
<P>
   At least five men armed with handguns boarded the Boeing 737
bound from Foz do Iguacu to Curitiba, both cities in southern
Parana state, dos Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   The men boarded as passengers. It was not clear how they got on
the plane carrying weapons, but police were investigating airport
employees for possible involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers told the pilot to land at a runway surrounded by
nothing but cattle ranches and sugar cane plantations in an
isolated part of Parana state, about 400 miles southwest of Rio,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane landed, the hijackers jumped into a Ford Ranger
that was waiting for them at the edge of the paved landing strip.
They then sped away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hijackers were gone, the pilot flew the plane to the
nearest airport at the city of Londrina, 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still searching for the hijackers on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no clue regarding the identity of the robbers,''
Parana state police captain Sergio Dalbem said.

Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm proud to be here representing the great state of New York
and I'm proud to be here as the Democratic chair of the
Congressional Women's Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, our caucus is the face of America. We don't
have to talk inclusion, we are inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   We are over 40 strong with more to come. But we realize we stand
on the shoulders of the giants who served before us, great
Democratic congresswomen - Barbara Jordan, Patricia Schroeder,
Shirley Chisholm, Liz Holtzman, Bella Abzug and, of course, from
the last time our party broke through a barrier that stood for too
long, Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the doors of opportunity for America's women. We are
doing our best to follow in that great tradition. We remember when
women could not get credit in their own names, when women could not
serve on juries, when equal pay for equal work wasn't even a
slogan. And we remember all too well when being pregnant was
grounds for dismissal. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way, especially over the last eight years.
I've worked with Al Gore. I've gotten to know him. I believe in
him. Women of America, Al Gore stands with us.
</P>
<P>
   From the Family and Medical Leave Act to the Violence Against
Women Act, from doubling breast cancer research to casting the
deciding vote to get guns off the streets, Al Gore stands with us.
Al Gore stands with America's women.
</P>
<P>
   But many of our battles still are not won. Democratic women will
help Al Gore win these battles.
</P>
<P>
   But let me underscore one issue, protecting a woman's right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Mark my words. Choice hangs by a single vote on the Supreme
Court. If the other side wins, women will lose their right to
choose. It's not that we might lose; we will lose. Women of
America, Democrats, Republicans, independents, we cannot let that
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And in the words of another New York woman, Eleanor Roosevelt,
it's up to the women. Women make a difference. We've always made a
difference. Let's elect Al Gore. When Al Gore wins, we win, women
win, America wins.
</P>
<P>
   And now, I'm proud to introduce the vice-chair of the
Congressional Women's Caucus for women from the great state of
California, Juanita Millender-McDonald.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Rock for Prez? Don't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation champion, in an encore to his
appearance at the GOP convention in Philadelphia, told an audience
at the Democratic National Convention that he might consider a run
for office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesse Ventura has made that jump and done fairly well,'' he
said, although he added that his political aspirations would reach
beyond the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect to Jesse, I would say The Rock has to be
synonymous with, say, president,'' he told a cheering crowd at an
event to promote the WWF's ''Smackdown Your Vote!'' campaign to
register 14 million new voters.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking wrestler even got a suggestion for a running mate:
woman wrestler Chyna, who appeared with him.

   Just when you thought it was safe to swim the political waters,
Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss warned California Democrats on
Wednesday that Republicans can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Jaws'' star listed Social Security, education, abortion
and health care as issues too important to trust to the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush doesn't get them and Dick Cheney doesn't like
them,'' said Dreyfuss, known for his roles in ''American Graffiti''
and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' and star of the
soon-to-be released movie ''The Crew.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged cheering Democratic National Convention delegates to
''go get 'em'' by keeping control of the White House and picking up
seven seats to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans in the House of Representatives are the only
obstacles, the only stop signs that are keeping America from its
own future,'' Dreyfuss said at the California delegation's
breakfast at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel.

   Politics aside, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wants to terminate
problems faced by inner-city youth.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Republican and founder of the Inner-City Games
Foundation took a tour Wednesday of the first of 14 cities that now
host his program by visiting Los Angeles' Hollenbeck Youth Center.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the city is crawling with Democrats for the
party's national convention. Schwarzenegger said the program is
about helping kids do the right thing after school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forget the Democrats,'' he said. ''It's not a Republican
issue. It's not a Democrat issue. It's an issue facing America.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger was joined by seven mayors from across the
country, his NBC-reporter wife Maria Shriver and other political
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the center's gymnasium, Schwarzenegger leapt back into his
role as the undercover teacher in the movie ''Kindergarten Cop'' to
cheer on a group of girls on the balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beau-ti-ful,'' he said with some claps.
</P>
<P>
   In a weight room with a 12-foot likeness of him painted on the
wall, Schwarzenegger filled in as weight trainer: ''No cheating
here -- all the way down to the legs!''
</P>
<P>
   And he promised the youngsters: ''I'll be back.''

   Actor Sean Penn was among hundreds of supporters greeting Al
Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman as the vice president
arrived for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd cheered the arrival Air Force Two on Wednesday
afternoon, Penn, wearing a rumpled black suit and cowboy boots,
stood in front with his arms crossed.
</P>
<P>
   A member of California Gov. Gray Davis' staff escorted Penn to a
red-carpet receiving area to greet the Democratic presidential
ticket, jokingly advising him: ''You are standing with the
Lieberman family, so try to look like one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No 'Dead Man Walking' jokes,'' a Democratic activist mumbled,
referring to Gore's wooden reputation and one of Penn's starring
roles.

   Stevie Wonder had a packed convention hall swaying and clapping
along when he opened Wednesday evening's convention session with a
medley version of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he told the audience, ''We at the end of the 20th century
are about to cast our final vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''History tonight reminds us we must redeem the dream of (Martin
Luther) King,'' Wonder said, drawing a huge cheer from the
delegates. He spoke of an ''innervision, a new millennium
democracy, a vision of who we are and what America has come to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us keep moving forward ever, backwards never,'' Wonder
said, and raised his harmonica to begin the national anthem.
Accompanied by a gospel choir, the medley closed with the lines
''we see an America, a united America.''

   Rocker David Crosby nearly upstaged Andrew Cuomo during a
Creative Coalition ceremony honoring the U.S. housing secretary for
his public service.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, the singer and songwriter from Crosby, Stills and Nash,
posed for pictures and handed out autographs to star-struck
celebrities, delegates and media.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo encouraged the celebrity-filled reception, which included
actress Sharon Lawrence, actors Harry Hamlin and Daniel Stern, and
Bianca Jagger, at the Los Angeles Public Library to use their star
status to help curb homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby agreed, but said celebrities had to take responsibility
for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have the ability to focus media attention on the
issues because of who we are,'' he said. ''But that ability
requires us to ... do our part, to take responsibility for how we
get the word out.''

<HEADLINE> LA Protesters Decry Cop Brutality  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police clashed with bottle-throwing
protesters Wednesday outside the Democratic National Convention
after 2,500 demonstrators marched to the site denouncing police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   An altercation broke out as officers tried to get a truck
through an intersection the protesters had blocked. The protesters
began throwing bottles and other objects at the police, who then
charged with batons. Several rubber bullets were fired.
</P>
<P>
   A few delegates arriving for the convention's evening speakers
were escorted through the crowd. Others walked around to other
gates through the security fence surrounding the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whose streets? Our streets!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   After a standoff, many of the protesters moved north, and there
was another brief scuffle. A California Highway Patrol officer was
struck in the chest by a bottle filled with an unidentified liquid
that splashed on his face. He was taken to a hospital, a patrol
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have been marching for various causes here since last
weekend, mostly peacefully, watched by hundreds of law enforcement
officers. In fact, during Wednesday evening's standoff speakers on
the official protest stage nearby continued, denouncing the federal
case against Wen Ho Lee, the Asian-born Los Alamos scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The convention city arrest total was near 200 through Wednesday,
but significant violence was limited to a clash after a rock
concert at the protest site Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's demonstration, started as a march to police
headquarters, then proceeded to the convention site. On the way,
helmeted officers carrying batons stood two-deep as activists
shouting in bullhorns and holding banners in Spanish and English
moved across downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, officers arrested about 30 activists staging
a sit-in at a police station west of downtown.

   ''No justice, no peace, no racist police,'' protesters shouted
there.

<P>
   Protesters wearing white gags sat in front of the station's
entrance, going limp as they were arrested and charged with
blocking a public building. They were carried into the station.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at that earlier rally urged the crowd to stay peaceful.
One activist wore a Darth Vader suit, wandering through the
protesters with a baton and making threats of mock arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending was state Sen. Tom Hayden, a member of the
Chicago 7, the group accused of conspiring to disrupt the 1968
Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Democratic convention week, police have been
everywhere in downtown Los Angeles, and it was no different
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's confrontations included an animal-rights demonstration
in which animal rights activists banged on the windows of downtown
businesses. Police contended some of the protesters planned to
attack a McDonald's restaurant and other businesses, and officers
later displayed photographs of weapons and other devices they said
the group carried, including lighter fluid, pepper spray,
fireworks, gas masks, flak vests and gas-filled plastic eggs with
fuses.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 50 activists were arrested a few hours later
Tuesday when more than 100 bicyclists tied up rush-hour traffic
across downtown as they demanded more bike lanes and other
facilities.

FBI To Release E-mail Documents

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has 3,000 pages of documents about its

the public in about 45 days, the Justice Department said today. Additional
releases should follow every 45 days. The Carnivore, which has caused an uproar
among civil libertarians and in Congress, has software that scans and captures
''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet traffic, as they travel through an
internet service provider's network. ''The proposed schedule is far too
open-ended,'' complained David Sobel, general counsel of the private Electronic

<HEADLINE> Tucker Seeks To Void Conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker said
Wednesday that his Whitewater-related conviction and sentence
should be voided because prosecutors concealed information his
lawyers had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has already served an 18-month sentence in home detention
after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy in 1996 along with
President Clinton's former business partners, James and Susan
McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have agreed not to retry him on the charges if the
initial conviction is thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing in federal court, Tucker lawyer Jeff Rosenzweig said
prosecutors for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office deceived
the court by not disclosing connections between star witness David
Hale and Clinton opponents funded by a conservative billionaire and
other individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The independent counsel went to extraordinary length ... to
keep the subsidies to Hale and his connections with political
opponents of Tucker and Clinton from emerging at trial,'' the
filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also argues that Starr had conflicts of interest that
should have barred him from serving as a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge will make a decision on Tucker's appeal. The 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis is considering a
separate appeal to overturn the conviction, claiming bias by a
juror.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backers Plot Connecticut Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Amid the hoopla surrounding
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman's elevation to the national
Democratic stage, Connecticut Republicans countered with a message
of their own Wednesday night: Don't count us out.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting hours before Lieberman accepted his party's
nomination for vice president, undaunted state Republicans said
they are not conceding the Nutmeg State to Lieberman and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans held a strategy meeting designed to unite supporters
of former rivals George W. Bush and John McCain and find ways to
counteract the bounce Democrats expect from Lieberman's presence
atop the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Malcynsky, Bush's Connecticut coordinator, conceded that
Lieberman will ''energize'' local Democrats and almost certainly
will increase turnout in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the presence of Lieberman alone does not guarantee
that Connecticut will go into the Democrats' column this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Polls released before Lieberman was chosen as Gore's running
mate, showed Gore and Bush in a virtual dead heat in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, Joe Lieberman doesn't save Al Gore,''
Malcynsky told about 30 Republicans gathered at Bush's Connecticut
headquarters in New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in attendance supported McCain during the
sometimes bitter GOP primary, and the differences between the two
camps were apparent Wednesday night. Several McCain supporters
complained about a recently approved rule change allowing state
party leaders to choose delegates to the next national Republican
convention, instead of apportioning them on a ''winner take all''
basis as before.
</P>
<P>
   ''By changing the rules, you sent me out the door,'' said Neal
Yates, a McCain supporter from New Hartford. ''I don't see where
the Republican party wants me involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malcynsky said the Bush campaign is actively courting
McCain's supporters, hoping to tap into the grass-roots
organization that helped the Arizona senator beat Bush in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really see this as the best opportunity in a long time to
bring new people into the tent and revitalize the party
organization in the state,'' said Malcynsky, a lobbyist and
longtime party stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent McCain supporters agreed.
</P>
<P>
   '' I thought it was a good meeting,'' said Ben Davol, one of
three McCain coordinators in the state. ''I think we're moving
forward in unifying the party to elect George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Davol and other GOP leaders called the dustup over the rules
change a minor issue that will be resolved long before the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-6th District, called the rules
change ''ridiculous,'' but said it had little to do with the
purpose of the meeting: delivering Connecticut for George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can win this on substance,'' Johnson said, criticizing
Lieberman for backtracking on some long-held views since being
named as Gore's running mate. Specifically, she accused Lieberman
of flip-flopping on Social Security, affirmative action, school
vouchers and even his signature issue: the ''moral degradation'' of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting bogged down in procedural arguments or
internal disputes, Republicans should focus on a simple message,
Johnson said: ''Lieberman is a fine guy, but too bad he's changed
his stripes.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks for Help Rescuing Sub  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Increasingly desperate to reach 116 sailors
trapped in a doomed submarine, Russia relented Wednesday and asked
for Western aid after its rescue teams were driven back by strong
currents on the pitch-black sea bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But help may come too late for the crew of the Kursk, cut off
from the world under the Barents Sea, with air likely dwindling and
possibly without light or heat. A Norwegian ship with a team of
divers and a British rescue mini-sub headed for the site but will
take days to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Russian rescue capsules repeatedly descended through the stormy
waters Wednesday but, whipped about by currents, could not latch
onto the submarine, lying at a sharp list 354 feet deep beneath the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   After insisting for days that Western aid was inferior and was
not needed, the Russian government asked Britain and Norway to send
equipment and divers.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout apparently came after President Vladimir Putin
spoke with President Clinton on Wednesday and ordered his navy to
seek help.
</P>
<P>
   The navy said it had no idea of conditions inside the Kursk,
including whether any of the crew were alive.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine sank after an apparent explosion Saturday.
Throughout the nerve-flaying disaster, Russian officials have
repeatedly given contradictory reports of whether rescuers had
detected any signs of life from within the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no clear picture of how much air may remain aboard
or whether backup systems were working on the boat, which is at
least partially flooded.
</P>
<P>
   If survivors are trying to husband oxygen by reducing its flow
from reserve tanks, they could be lightheaded, confused or
unconscious. If power systems are not operating, the inside of the
Kursk would be pitch-black and very cold.
</P>
<P>
   Britain on Wednesday flew a LR5 mini-submarine to the Norwegian
port city of Trondheim for shipping to the disaster site. Some 15
people were working under bright lights in the early morning hours
Thursday loading the mini-sub onto a red Norwegian ship in
Trondheim, 280 miles north of the capital, Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   The trip would take about 52 hours, getting the rescue craft to
the scene by Saturday, Norwegian officials said. The LR5 can hold
16 passengers and may be able to connect to the Kursk's hatch,
though it was not sure the hatches will match.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the British team or the Norwegian divers
did not fly to any of the Russian military bases located much
closer to where the Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
   The developments suggested Russia was still halfhearted about
accepting Western help, especially from members of NATO, which
Moscow sees as a threat despite the end of the Cold War. But
British Defense Ministry officials said they factored in the
distance and the type of ship needed in choosing the Norwegian ship
for transporting the safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Norway option provided the quickest and safest way of
getting our equipment to the scene,'' a ministry spokesman in
London said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian ship with a dozen civilian divers, which was
diverted Wednesday from an offshore oil field, will take up to two
days to get to the site where the Kursk went down, Norway's Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vessel is starting to move north,'' Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland said in a television interview. ''These are
professional divers who can contribute in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Arctic waters of the Barents, the 20-ship Russian navy
operation was battered by strong winds and surging waves.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater, currents jarred the delicate maneuvers of the rescue
capsules, and muddy maters reduced visibility to mere inches even
under spotlights, said navy spokesman Capt. Igor Babenko.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rescue attempts involved a capsule called the Bester,
a 50-ton vehicle with a crew of two or three and able to take up to
20 evacuees. Officials said they hoped the Bester would be better
able to fight the heavy currents than a smaller, lighter capsule
that had been used earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Wednesday he
was more confident about the chances of success and that rescue
operations would continue until at least Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I am feeling more confidence that the operation to rescue
the Kursk's crew will yield a result,'' he told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said nothing had been heard from inside the Kursk, but
the navy's deputy chief of staff, Vice Admiral Vladislav Ilyin,
maintained there had been contact, although he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday
that they lost contact with the Kursk on Saturday, despite earlier
statements that contact was lost Sunday. The submarine suffered
extensive damage after an explosion in the torpedo compartment at
the front of the vessel, but the cause was not clear, the navy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, ITAR-Tass quoted an unnamed Pentagon official as
saying U.S. submarines following the ill-fated exercise detected
two explosions at the site of the disaster, with the second one
even more powerful than the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Navy's press service said in response that top
commanders would not confirm such information. It added that a
government investigative commission would determine the cause of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing any survivors to the surface could take hours, with a
slow ascent needed to prevent the potentially crippling or fatal
decompression sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were also considering using giant pontoons to float the
vessel. Another proposal called for raising the submarine to a
vertical position so part of it protruded from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Kursk's two nuclear reactors had been
switched off and it was not carrying nuclear weapons. Norway said
there was no sign of a radiation leak in the area.

<HEADLINE> Two Workers Ordered Out of Tibet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Two European aid workers were expelled from Tibet
after their work restoring traditional Tibetan homes and Buddhist
temples ran afoul of Chinese authorities, German and Portuguese
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Alexander, the German founder of the Tibet Heritage Fund,
and a Portuguese colleague, Pimpim de Azevedo, were ordered out
after a ''misunderstanding'' over the nature of their work, a
German Foreign Ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are lobbying their Chinese counterparts to let
Alexander and de Azevedo, who flew to Beijing on Sunday, return to
Tibet, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say China has stepped up a campaign to
undermine Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader, who fled after troops crushed a popular uprising against
Chinese rule in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibet Heritage Fund employs about 270 local craftsmen and
workers to build and repair houses and temples using traditional
materials in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. The German government
donates about $230,000 a year to the Tibet Heritage Fund. Other
backers reportedly include the French government and Britain's
Prince Charles.

<HEADLINE> John McCain Diagnosed With Melanoma  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has been diagnosed
with a second bout of melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin
cancer, and expects to undergo surgery, aides said Wednesday. He
immediately curtailed his campaigning for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''During a routine examination, two unrelated spots were
discovered on Senator John McCain. One on his left temple, the
other on his left arm. The spots were confirmed to be melanomas,''
said a statement issued Wednesday by his office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who waged a spirited contest for the Republican
nomination against George W. Bush, planned a news conference Friday
to discuss his medical condition, advisers said. They added that
the senator doesn't know whether the cancer has spread, but will
see doctors Thursday and Friday to review his treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser said McCain expects to undergo surgery because
that is the traditional treatment for melanoma. He had surgery in
1993 when he first had skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This adviser said McCain has canceled several campaign
appearances, but will be in Ohio on Sunday to help Sen. Mike
DeWine. Republican officials said the Arizona senator had scrubbed
10 or 12 other planned appearances over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his cancer comes just a few days after he toured the
Northwest with Bush. McCain's office released the statement after
the diagnosis began filtering out to the media by Republican
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the senator, who spent more than five years in a POW
camp, said Wednesday he was feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said that during a telephone
conversation he had with McCain's wife, Cindy, she said her
63-year-old husband was ''upbeat, in great spirits. He has talked
to lots of doctors, he has a very good sense of where he stands --
or at least he thinks he does.'' Kerry spoke Wednesday night on the
''Larry King Live'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you he's in wonderful spirits. Beyond that, I
can't tell you anything,'' said Deb Gullett, a former McCain
staffer and longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wished McCain ''a complete and speedy recovery,'' and said
in a statement: ''John is a good man and a fighter. He is in our
prayers as he battles this illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said of McCain, ''He is so courageous he will ... just
face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate and McCain's senate
colleague, issued a statement, calling McCain ''a dear friend'' and
saying he was ''in our thoughts and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   During his presidential campaign, McCain released hundreds of
pages of medical records that detailed the lingering effects of
injuries suffered in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp. The records
also showed that in December 1993, McCain had a cancerous mole
removed from his shoulder that proved to be melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   John Eckstein, McCain's longtime personal physician in Arizona,
said at the time that McCain was cured of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The records said McCain regularly has suspicious skin lesions or
moles removed -- often basal cell carcinoma, the least aggressive
and most common type of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. When
discovered early, it is highly curable. But it is a very aggressive
kind of cancer -- tumors can double in size every month -- and it can
spread quickly to other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, once melanoma returns in a patient already treated,
treatment is more difficult. Finding melanoma in two different
places, such as in McCain's case, suggests the possibility of a
more advanced stage of the disease. Those patients often turn to
clinical trials of experimental therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates 47,700 Americans will be
diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 7,700 will die.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCain has had close medical scrutiny since his first
bout with melanoma, the disease probably was caught early enough to
be treatable, said Dr. Charles McDonald, past president of the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably just has another melanoma,'' McDonald said.
''Anybody who's had one, you have to keep very close eye on them.
Nine times out of 10, they're going to develop another.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the melanoma has spread, then the prognosis is poor
because chemotherapy and radiation do very little to help this
particular form of cancer, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be how thick each of McCain's tumors is, something
his physicians have not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ambrose, a POW center doctor made available by the
McCain campaign in December 1999, said the type of cancer McCain
suffered before is usually due to sun exposure from years ago. He
said McCain and his fellow prisoners were kept in the Vietnamese
sun for long periods, though it is impossible to link the cancer to
his POW exposure.
</P>
<P>
   McCain left the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia
on Aug. 2 to return to Washington, and had a spot of skin on the
left side of his forehead removed at Bethesda Naval Hospital,
spokesman Todd Harris said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that he had left the convention to
avoid joining Bush on the platform at the closing session, although
he had warmly endorsed the nominee in his own speech. Invited back
by the Bush people, McCain returned to Philadelphia on Thursday,
with a bandage covering the spot.

Mussina and the Baltimore Orioles 7-3 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a three-run shot in the second inning to put the
White Sox up 6-0. He has two homers and eight RBIs in his last two
games and ranks second in the AL with 111 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Parque (10-4) allowed three runs, five hits and two walks in
six-plus innings. The left-hander was 0-2 in five starts since July
15, including three straight games without a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Simas retired all six batters he faced and Keith Foulke
worked the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (7-13) gave up six runs and seven hits in only four
innings, his shortest stint of the season. The right-hander, who
finished second in the Cy Young voting last year, has lost three
straight and six of his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   He retired eight of the last nine batters he faced, struck out
six and threw only 65 pitches, but the early word from the Orioles'
bench was that Mussina was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce homered for Baltimore, his fifth since being
traded from the White Sox in the July 29 trade that sent Charles
Johnson and Harold Baines to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina was in trouble from the outset. Ray Durham led off the
first inning with the first of his three singles, Thomas walked and
Magglio Ordonez got an infield hit to load the bases before Herbert
Perry hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin singled in a run in the second before Thomas hit a
1-2 pitch an estimated 415 feet to dead center. Although he flied
out in the fourth, Thomas is 25-for-62 (.403) with eight homers and
17 RBIs lifetime against Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles closed to 6-2 in the third when Melvin Mora tripled
in a run and scored on a balk. Fordyce chased Parque with his 10th
homer of the season leading off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went up 7-3 in the eighth on a single by Ordonez and a
double by Paul Konerko.
Notes: Ordonez went 2-for-4 and is on a 19-for-34 tear over his
last eight games. ... Baltimore has lost five of seven. ... Thomas
is just four homers short of matching his career high. ... The
Orioles have allowed four runs or more in an inning 61 times this
season.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Sen. Lieberman's Speech  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts of remarks by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the
Democratic
vice presidential candidate, to the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Remarks are as prepared for delivery:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Is America a great country or what? As every faith teaches us,
we must, as Americans, try to see our nation not just through our
own eyes, but through the eyes of others. In my life I have seen
the goodness of this country through many sets of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My father lived in an orphanage when he was a child. He went
on to drive a bakery truck and own a package store in Stamford,
Connecticut. He taught us the importance of work and
responsibility. With my mother by his side, he saw me become the
first person in my family to graduate from college.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric, but I wish they
would also change their policies. As my friend John McCain might
say, let me do some straight talking about their record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And, I think it's a good thing that our opponent talks about
education. Schools need to be held to the highest standards of
performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan does
not provide the resources our schools need to meet those high
standards. I've read their plan. To me, it seems like their idea of
school modernization means buying a new calendar for every
building.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known Al Gore for 15 years. I know his record and I know
his heart. I know him as a public servant and I know what it is
like to sit with him around the dining room table. We have
discussed -- sometimes even debated -- policy issues. And we have
shared private moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty years ago we came to this city and crossed a new
frontier. Today we return with prosperity at home, and freedom
throughout the world that John F. Kennedy could have only dreamed
about. We may wonder where the next frontier really is. I believe
that the next frontier isn't just in front of us, but inside of us
-- to overcome the differences that are still between us, to break
down the barriers that remain; and to help every American claim the
limitless possibilities of our own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck. About this time, he'd be getting ready for the
all-night run. I know that somewhere in America right now, there is
another father loading a bakery truck, or a young woman programming
a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for their
daughter or their son. If we keep the faith, then 40 years from now
one of their children will stand before a gathering like this, with
a chance to serve and lead this country that we love.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Counterfeiters Captured  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian authorities working with the
U.S. Secret Service have captured 10 leaders of a counterfeiting
ring that exported millions in fake currency from Colombia to the
United States, the country's secret police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here say the arrests shut down what had been the
world's largest U.S.-dollar counterfeiting ring, sending more than
$40 million in fake bills to the United States over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came late Tuesday. More than 100 uncover agents in
four cities in drug-producing southern Colombia arrested the men,
thought to be the group's ringleaders, Colombia's Administrative
Department of Security announced in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were the culmination of almost two years of
investigation. The case began when Secret Service agents asked
authorities here to look into a disproportionate amount of cash
arriving in the United States from Colombia, said Miguel Evan Cure,
director of the Cali office of the secret police force, known as
DAS.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an investigation that could not have succeeded without
the help of the Secret Service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cure said the counterfeiters began producing bogus $100 bills
and exporting them to Miami, New York and other U.S. cities in late
1998. They are believed to have earned more than $11 million in
profits selling and distributing the bills in the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''This group was extremely well-connected and efficient,'' Cure
said. ''Their bills arrived in the U.S. and blended so well with
regular currency there and in Europe that they became very hard to
trace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cure said five of the men were arrested in Cali, Colombia's
third-largest city and the former headquarters of this Andean
nation's powerful cocaine cartels of the 1980s and early 1990s. The
men are not believed to have had anything to do with the sale or
trafficking of cocaine or heroin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the raids, officers closed two Cali-area counterfeiting
dens and recovered two metal printing presses equipped with metal
stamps forming the impression of U.S. $100 bills. They seized
almost a ton of paper similar to that used by mints in the United
States, Cure said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We estimate in those two labs alone they would have been able
to produce another $3 million in hundreds in the next two months,''
Cure said. ''And these were not the only counterfeit factories they
operated.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Boy Found; American Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Rescuers found a 15-year-old Mexican boy
missing for over a week on a mountain-climbing trip, but the boy
told them the American man who was with him had fallen into a
ravine, Mexico's government news agency Notimex reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Romero was found Tuesday suffering from hypothermia and
dehydration, Notimex said. The boy told authorities that Rony Jasse
of Chicago fell into a deep ravine during a light rain shortly
after the two began their climb Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. volunteers and Mexican police were searching for Jasse, who
set out with Romero, his wife's cousin, to climb 14,330-foot Nevada
de Colima mountain near Mexico's southern Pacific Coast.

<HEADLINE> Haiti's Election Results Official  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- President Rene Preval made the
results of Haiti's parliamentary elections official by publishing
them Wednesday, despite criticism from an international community
that deems the results questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The totals printed in the official government publication Le
Moniteur confirmed an overwhelming victory by the Lavalas Family
party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The party won 18
of 19 seats in the upper house and 72 of 82 in the lower house in
May, June, and July balloting, according to official results.
</P>
<P>
   The Lavalas Family also won about 80 percent of Haiti's 133 city
halls and a majority of urban and rural local assemblies. Aristide
is favored to win presidential elections on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, the United States and Canada have questioned
the formula used to calculate winners of races in the first round
in May. They have threatened to withhold aid if the results are not
revised.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States, which monitored the
elections, has said it believes some seats won in the first round
of voting should have gone to a run-off vote. OAS Secretary-General
Cesar Gaviria is to arrive in Haiti on Thursday to meet with local
officials about the results.
</P>
<P>
   Eight more senators' seats will be up for election in November.
An election for one seat in the 83-seat lower house was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a legislature since January 1999, when
Preval locked lawmakers out of parliament, ending an 18-month power
struggle with the former majority party over tainted April 1997
elections.

DNC Delegates Welcome Liberman
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Embarking on a ''miraculous journey,'' vice presidential
candidate Joseph Lieberman beckoned Democratic convention delegates Wednesday
night to send Al Gore to the White House, hailing him as a man of ''values and
vision'' who would extend the nation's current prosperity. Of Republicans who
are challenging to retake the White House, he said, simply, ''They will squander
it.'' Making his national political debut, Lieberman was greeted by Democratic
delegates waving a sea of red signs emblazened with his name. ''Go Joe go,'' the
delegates chanted.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police faced off with about 2,500 demonstrators outside
the Democratic National Convention today after the protesters, chanting of
police brutality, marched from police headquarters to the convention site.

Sen. John McCain Has Melanoma

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has been diagnosed with a second
bout of melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. McCain, who waged a
spirited contest for the Republican nomination against George W. Bush, has
canceled a number of campaign appearances and expects to undergo surgery, aides
said. ''During a routine examination two unrelated spots were discovered on Sen.
John McCain. One on his left temple, the other on his left arm. The spots were
confirmed to be melanomas,'' said a statement issued today by his office.

Gephardt: Democrats Must Win Congress
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Calling Republicans ''intolerant of other views,'' House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said today that Democrats must win control of
Congress if a Democratic White House's policies are to have a chance to become
law. ''We can pass laws that help people, or we can continue to frustrate the
hopes and dreams of working families,'' Gephardt told delegates to the
Democratic National Convention. The Missouri lawmaker, likely to become speaker
if his party wins a House majority in November, called Vice President Al Gore
''a good man'' who cares about his family and country.

Russia Asks for Help Saving Sub Crew

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia relented Wednesday and asked for Western aid to reach
116 sailors trapped in a doomed submarine -- the crew of the Kursk, cut off from
the world under the Barents Sea, with air likely dwindling and possibly without
light or heat. A Norwegian ship with a team of divers and a British rescue
mini-sub headed for the site but will take days to get there. Russian rescue
capsules repeatedly descended through the stormy waters Wednesday but, whipped
about by currents, could not latch onto the submarine, lying at a sharp list 354
feet beneath the surface.

FBI To Release E-mail Documents
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has 3,000 pages of documents about its
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system and expects to begin releasing some to
the public in about 45 days, the Justice Department said today. Additional
releases should follow every 45 days. The Carnivore, which has caused an uproar
among civil libertarians and in Congress, has software that scans and captures
''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet traffic, as they travel through an
internet service provider's network. ''The proposed schedule is far too
open-ended,'' complained David Sobel, general counsel of the private Electronic
Privacy Information Center, which sued under the Freedom of Information Act to
get all the FBI's documents describing the system.
