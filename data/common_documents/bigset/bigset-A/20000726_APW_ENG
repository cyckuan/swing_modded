<HEADLINE> House Approves Anti-Corruption Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to make fighting
corruption a principal goal of U.S. foreign aid, saying
anti-corruption efforts will both promote democracy in developing
countries and level the playing field for American business.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved by a voice vote, requires the U.S.
Agency for International Development to establish anti-corruption
programs in countries that are major recipients of American aid and
that have persistent problems with corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department is also required to emphasize
anti-corruption measures as part of technical assistance it offers
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., the ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee and sponsor of the measure, cited
Commerce Department estimates that over the past five years U.S.
firms lost some $26 billion worth of contracts to foreign
competitors offering bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bribery impedes trade and hurts our economic interests by
providing an unfair advantage to those countries which tolerate
bribery of foreign officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said that the stress on combating
corruption was important because, while the United States for years
has taken the lead in promoting democracy around the world, ''too
many places in the world continue to be held in the grip of
corruption and cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires the president to submit an annual report
to Congress on efforts to fight corruption abroad and allows the
Agriculture Department and other agencies to use foreign assistance
funds to root out corruption. It has yet to be considered by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4697.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Recess  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What Democrats are fond of calling the
''do-nothing Congress'' did something Tuesday, with the House
passing 36 bills. Some of them even have a chance of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ranged from a major bill pushed jointly by
President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert to help out
poorer communities to a trade bill that included a ban on dog and
cat fur imports.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, well after dinnertime, it approved a
resolution on the importance of families eating together.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of legislating came in the final week before Congress
leaves for the presidential conventions and the monthlong summer
recess. Most of Tuesday's bills were noncontroversial, brought up
under a procedure that limits debate time, does not allow
amendments and requires a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   With the election approaching, Democrats have denounced the
failure of the GOP-led Congress to move on such issues as patients
rights, prescription drugs for seniors, gun control and the minimum
wage. Republicans say its been a ''workhorse'' Congress that has
passed major tax cuts in defiance of threatened presidential
vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the House-passed bills have a real chance of
affecting American lives. The Community Renewal Act, promoted by
Clinton and Hastert, provides tax breaks and regulatory relief to
40 urban and rural communities left behind by the economic boom.
Veterans are helped by several bills improving disability benefits
and making it easier to file claims and people with disabilities
could see their service systems improved.
</P>
<P>
   Another reauthorizes the Ryan White CARE Act that provides
federal funds for AIDS prevention and treatment. The trade bill
suspends or lowers duties on imports of AIDS and cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One highly political bill jumped on Vice President Al Gore's
hesitation in answering a question about executing pregnant women
on death row. Republicans hastily drew up and passed the measure
making such executions unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Others were nonbinding and truly noncontroversial. In addition
to urging families to eat together, the House praised Mexico for
its recent elections and recognized the importance of children in
America. It commemorated the 10th anniversary of the calling up of
the National Guard before the Gulf War and the 210th anniversary of
the Coast Guard. Federal buildings were named, park trails were
designated and an underground railroad center in Cincinnati was
funded.
</P>
<P>
   On the crime front, the House voted for a mandatory life
sentence for a second sex offense against a child, set up a
procedure for trying military employees or dependents accused of
crimes committed outside the United States and created a commission
to coordinate federal anti-terrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Guam got breaks on federal land disposal, taxes
and betel nut sales, while another bill makes it easier for
American victims of terrorism to collect claims from
terrorism-supporting nations. Conservation efforts for great apes
were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The only bill defeated during the day was a measure to extend a
program reimbursing fishermen whose vessels are seized by foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate moves at a more leisurely and cautious pace and many
of the House-passed bills will never make it to the president's
desk. On Tuesday the Senate, entangled in one of its frequent
disputes over how to proceed, talked a lot but passed nothing.

<HEADLINE> Peacemaker Role Eludes Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For nearly eight years, President Clinton has
tried to forge peace out of some of the world's most intractable
conflicts, from the Middle East to Northern Ireland and the
Balkans. With less than six months left in office, Clinton has
little to show but partial victories -- no crowning peacemaking
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's collapse of delicate peace talks between Israel and
the Palestinians represents the latest, and probably the bitterest,
near miss. It is an achievement to have brought both sides to Camp
David at all, better yet to keep them talking for two weeks, but
ultimately a failure to walk away without a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to put a funny gloss on this,'' an exhausted
Clinton said at the end Tuesday. ''They couldn't get there. That's
the truth. They couldn't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say the talks position Israel and the Palestinians
to finally ''get there'' and end a half-century of war and
hostility. But his disappointment was plain.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting peace between Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland may be closer at hand, but the joint government envisioned
with soaring hopes after the 1998 Good Friday Accords faltered this
year, and new peace efforts are on a slower track.
</P>
<P>
   The United States helped broker or bomb an end to ethnic
bloodshed and reprisals in Bosnia and Kosovo, and Clinton counts
American involvement in the Balkans as a success. But five years
after the Dayton peace accords ended the Bosnia conflict, the
nominally multiethnic nation is still under U.S. peacekeepers'
guard. In Kosovo, a fresher wound, the year-old peace is testy and
uneven. U.S. peacekeepers are there too, although in much smaller
numbers than in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, another trouble spot, still is plagued by corruption,
violence and poverty despite the commitment of 20,000 American
troops and billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd give him very high marks for his work on Ireland and
Middle East peace. Not quite a Nobel Prize, but certainly an A+ for
effort,'' said Jonathan Paris, a fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. Paris gives Clinton an overall B for his
management of Balkans crises.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton persistently nudged the Palestinians and Israelis, from
the historic Oslo peace accords, shepherded by Norway in 1993, his
first year in office, through 1998 peace talks at Wye River, Md.,
and Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   He was less successful with Syria's late president Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped get Israeli-Syrian peace talks restarted after a
four-year lull last year, but the discussions at Shepherdstown,
W.Va., produced little. Clinton made a special detour at the close
of a foreign trip this spring to meet face to face with the ailing
Assad, but again came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's son and successor has not yet reached out to the United
States for peacemaking help.
</P>
<P>
   The low moment of Clinton's foreign interventions was probably
in Somalia during Clinton's first term when he converted an ongoing
famine-relief operation into a peacekeeping effort that ended in
death or humiliation of U.S. troops. The White House learned then
that peace is only possible with willing, politically stable
partners, current and former administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan have looked
for foreign policy achievements as they near the end of their terms
and begin to weigh their places in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began this final year especially eager for a foreign
policy victory -- after losing a Senate battle for a nuclear test
ban treaty, and the cold shoulder his trade agenda received at the
chaotic World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   A pragmatist, Clinton likely realizes he has far less chance now
of winning a Middle East peace deal before his year is out,
although aides expect him to try. He may go to Ireland to put a
personal imprimatur on the tenuous peace there. And he has said he
would like to visit Vietnam, where he has sent the first U.S.
ambassador since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ''People that are mired in conflict, whether that is ethnic or
religious or tribal or other, will fall further behind'' in the new
global economy, said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the White House
National Security Council. ''That's why the president feels so
earnestly about resolving conflicts that have plagued various parts
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Any future peace brokered between Israel and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will build on Clinton's work, but that payoff may
come long after Clinton has left office, said Gideon Rose, a former
Clinton foreign policy aide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's unfair to judge foreign policy efforts solely
by their results,'' Rose said. ''At best you can help history along
on the margins.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Extension in Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton has requested a
30-day extension to respond to a lawsuit seeking his disbarment
over his deceptive testimony about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has until Aug. 1 to respond. In court papers filed
Tuesday, his lawyers argued that he deserves an extension until
Aug. 31 because his work at the Middle East peace talks and his
trip to Japan have not left him enough time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct
wants a judge to rule the president is unfit to be a lawyer because
of his testimony about the former White House intern. The testimony
was offered in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also said they have been traveling and have
been able to spend only limited time on the case.

<HEADLINE> Opera Star Hans Sotin Quits Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) -- Veteran opera star Hans Sotin,
scheduled to play Gurnemanz in Richard Wagner's ''Parsifal,'' quit
in a huff just a day before the start of the renowned Wagner music
festival in Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   Sotin, in a phone call Monday to the Nordbayerischer Kurier
newspaper, cited ''irreconcilable differences'' with the director.
There were no immediate specifics on the spat.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner, the 81-year-old grandson of Richard Wagner and
festival chief, said he regretted Sotin's decision, but didn't want
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   This year's annual Richard Wagner Festival, the 89th, has been
clouded by a feud between Wagner's descendants over how the
festival he founded should be run.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has pitted Wolfgang Wagner, who has run the festival
for nearly 50 years, against other descendants who want to breathe
fresh air into the production.
</P>
<P>
   The festival runs from Tuesday evening through Aug. 28.

<HEADLINE> Patriot System To Be Tested in MD.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, Md. (AP) -- The Pentagon plans to test radar and a
missile defense system at the Ocean City airport next month,
despite concerns by residents that it will harm people and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department told municipal officials that they would
be installing radar at the Ocean City Municipal Airport for testing
between Aug. 10-18. Radar will also be installed at the U.S. Navy
base on Wallop's Island, south of Ocean City.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials promised during a recent public hearing that
no missiles would be part of the tests of the Patriot Defense
System. It instead will track high-flying military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also insisted that the high-powered radar was
relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has less effect than speaking on a cell phone,'' said Col.
Samuel Harris of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot missiles were considered a key element of the 1991 Gulf
War against Iraq. The missiles were used to destroy Scud missiles
threatening U.S. bases and Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ocean City residents who fought in the war wrote to city
officials to support using the city's airport as a testing site.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they objected because of concerns over the effect of
radiation on their families and wildlife living along the Maryland
and Virginia coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to some was the potential for harm to the
bird population of Assateague Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather take the chance of someone attacking us than the
radar,'' said Rocky Bucholtz of Ocean City.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said only those within 400 feet of the radar
installations would be at risk. He said no people or animals would
be that close.

<HEADLINE> Anna Nicole Smith Urges Fast Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith
urged a federal judge to hurry in ruling on her claim to her
billionaire husband's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in October that her
late husband's son, E. Pierce Marshall, defrauded her of between
$556 million and $820 million from the Texas oilman's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in court with her attorney Tuesday to ask Judge Samuel
Bufford to issue a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm approaching my 51st birthday and I'm starting to worry
about my own mortality ... and your honor's mortality,'' said her
attorney Philip Boesch Jr., laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are in line, sir, and very near the front,'' Bufford
replied, but did not indicate when he would issue his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   J. Howard Marshall II died in August 1995 at age 90. His son
claimed that over 15 years the father had transferred his holdings
to avoid inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith claims her husband intended she would receive half of his
estimated $1.6 billion estate. She was 26 when she married Marshall
in 1994. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy about what I heard in court today,'' Smith
said. ''I'm trying to get this thing done so I can get back to
acting and my career.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Fiji Rebel Speight Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebel leader George Speight, two of his
advisers and a bodyguard were arrested Wednesday by Fijian military
forces following allegations that Speight's men had threatened
Fiji's president, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired before the arrests at a military checkpoint
close to Speight's camp, but there were no immediate reports of
injuries. Witnesses told local radio that one of Speight's men was
beaten as he was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on whether Speight would be charged. Earlier
Wednesday, a military official said Speight was arrested for a
curfew violation, and the army said Speight would be held
responsible for any crimes committed by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations also involved ''the carriage of arms in and
around Suva by George Speight and his bodyguards,'' Lt. Col. Filipo
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's supporters had no immediate reaction, but his arrest
was sure to enflame tensions in a country already torn apart by
civil unrest, attacks against ethnic Indians, economic paralysis
and international censure following Speight's May 19 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his supporters had been granted amnesty in exchange
for releasing the last of the hostages seized after they stormed
Parliament. Speight claimed that they aimed to return power to
indigenous Fijians from the ethnic Indians who dominate commerce
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Tarakinikini said amnesty was conditional on rebels turning
in all their arms, which they had not done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight goes around with armed bodyguards -- that is
illegal. We can't have private militias operating around the
country,'' Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, his legal adviser Tevita Bukaru, spokesman Jo Nata and
a bodyguard were being held at Suva's main military barracks,
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All week there were reports of Speight's men leaving their base
at a school where they have set up camp to steal food from local
residents. Speight supporters, including hundreds camped outside
the school with a handful of stolen guns, also control a military
barracks and Fiji's main hydroelectric plant outside Suva, Fiji's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The military ''will, from now on, hold George Speight
responsible for any unlawful acts'' committed in a corridor of land
either side of the main road linking Suva with the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The military posted extra troops across the Pacific island
nation and at the checkpoint outside the school Wednesday in
preparation for any violence, military spokesman Lt. Ro Alipate
Mataitini said.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Josefa Iloilo has settled on a Cabinet lineup and
was to announce it Thursday, presidential aide Suliasi Turagabeci
said, according to Radio FM96.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has warned of renewed unrest unless the new government
is stacked with his candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He stormed out of a meeting with Iloilo on Tuesday after just a
few minutes, apparently angry that the president had refused to
appoint his choice for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels want Adi Samanunu Cakobau, Fiji's top diplomat to
Malaysia whose grandfather was one of the nation's most powerful
chiefs. Iloilo and the military back Laisenia Qarase, who is acting
as caretaker prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The military had agreed to replace the government of Mahendra
Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian leader, scrap the multiracial
constitution and grant the rebels immunity from prosecution in
exchange for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Indians, who first arrived in Fiji in the late 1870s as
indentured laborers, make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of
814,000 and now dominate commerce and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji has faced international censure following Speight's coup.

<HEADLINE> Panel Advises Library of Congress  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The world's biggest library could turn into just a
''museum of books'' unless it gets started this year on long-range
plans to collect and secure the rising flood of digital
information, a federal advisory panel warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any questions about the right of the Library of
Congress to collect material from American Web sites, the National
Research Council said in a thick report, it should try to get the
law changed to make clear that it has the right.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Library) serves no narrow set of interests but the
broadest public purposes of a powerful nation,'' the report said.
''It represents the commitment of the governing bodies of that
nation to a strategy of preserving the heritage of the past and
making it useful for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council advises the federal government,
the public and the country's scientists and engineers. A committee
prepared the report under the leadership of James J. O'Donnell,
chief information officer and vice provost of the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The library is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. It
has more than 9 million books, 11 million films and photos and more
than 53 million manuscripts. Each year it puts about 1 million
largely historical items -- such as the papers of Presidents
Washington and Lincoln -- on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee's purpose ... is to encourage readers of this
report to take a deep breath and to look out to the horizon,'' it
said. ''With the Library and its friends focused on a common
vision, it will be easier to take the steps -- some small, some
large -- that need to be taken.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Al Fayed Citizenship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed lost his appeal for
British citizenship Wednesday as a senior judge ruled the
government was right to question whether he had a ''general defect
in his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed, the Egyptian-born owner of the famed department store,
applied for a British passport in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy legal battle, his application was turned down by
Home Secretary Jack Straw in May 1999 after allegations that Al
Fayed paid British lawmakers to ask parliamentary questions and
that he rifled through safe-deposit boxes rented to Harrods
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed argued that Straw had prejudged the citizenship
application and did not act with an open mind. The Court of Appeal,
however, found no proof that Straw was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Martin Nourse, one of three judges who heard the
appeal, said Straw regarded the break-ins as ''more than a minor
blemish'' and ''was indicative of a general defect in his
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In my judgment, it is plain that that was a view which could
reasonably be taken in the circumstances and, once taken, that that
in itself was enough to justify the Home Secretary's inability to
be satisfied that Mr. Al Fayed was of good character,'' Nourse
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges refused permission to appeal the case to the House of
Lords. Al Fayed spokesman Alexander Hitchen said the department
store owner was reviewing his legal options.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I'm disappointed with the decision I'm not surprised.
The establishment and judiciary have long shown bias against me
unlike the majority of the great British public who have been
nothing but supportive,'' Al Fayed said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the August 1997 Paris car crash
that also killed Princess Diana, is a controversial figure in
Britain. Although he has donated generously to charities, he has
also been accused of electronically eavesdropping on employees and
firing minority workers without cause.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed has lived in Britain since 1964 and has indefinite
leave to remain. His four children and brother, Ali, are British
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Republican Blasts Census Methods  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in completed forms from areas
underrepresented in the last census came too close to the deadline
to be credible, Republicans say, and they are demanding recounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said Tuesday he had serious doubts the
census left enough time to count households that didn't respond to
the mailed forms, and cited evidence of rushed surveys in 15 areas
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The information, he said, was obtained by members of the census
subcommittee staff in consultation with the congressional members
of a Census Monitoring Board and two former senior Census Bureau
officials, whom Miller did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said the committee and Office of Inspector
General at the Commerce Department were getting calls from
concerned Census Bureau managers, enumerators, and other employees
questioning the quality of the data. Miller called that
disappointing in light of the nearly $6.5 billion the government
has invested in the national head count.
</P>
<P>
   The panel named these areas as questionable: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas, Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas; Rapid City, S.D.; East Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; northeast New York City;
Newcastle, Del.; north Philadelphia, and Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials had acknowledged previously that they are
reviewing some 150,000 households because of questions about
certain enumerating practices. But Tuesday, they accused Miller of
overstating the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have told the subcommittee not to misrepresent the data
because they are not easily interpretable to the public,'' Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt said in a conference call with reporters.
''But obviously they have not done so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., in whose district one of the
questioned census offices operates, said she takes the charges
''very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While I am concerned about these allegations, I am also
concerned with the way they have been made,'' she said in a
statement. ''To allege that procedures have been violated is one
thing,'' the congresswoman said. ''To make allegations of fraud is
quite another, and after reviewing the documents provided
carefully, I have seen no evidence of widespread fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about the 15 locations are based on problems the
bureau has had in South Florida and Chicago. Despite these
problems, the bureau said it still believes the count was efficient
and thorough.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Census Bureau had ordered a recount of thousands
of households in Chicago because of suspicions that workers cut
corners to boost the number of completed questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some doubt about the quality'' of the count, bureau
spokesman Steve Jost said in confirming Chicago's recount earlier
this month. Similar problems were found in Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The largest recount to date is in Florida, where suspected
corner-cutting led census officials to go back and review
information gathered from more than 71,000 households.

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Causes of Air Delays  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This summer's most common blame game -- Whose
fault is the airline delay mess? -- has made its way to a Senate
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to getting to the bottom of delays, the air is
thicker with accusations than with aircraft,'' Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., said Tuesday as his Appropriations transportation
subcommittee took on the question.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been marked by record delays, with planeloads of
people forced to sit for hours on runways while others find
themselves stranded, their flights canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines blame the air traffic control system. The Federal
Aviation Administration blames bad weather and equipment problems.
Air traffic controllers blame the airlines for scheduling too many
flights at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passengers just know the simple truth that air travel is
costly, unpleasant and less reliable than they would like it,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA figures show 50,114 delayed flights in June, a month of
repeated heavy thunderstorms in the Midwest. That was up from
41,602 delays in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the half of it, said Kenneth Mead, inspector
general of the Transportation Department. The statistics aren't
reliable, he contended, because delays are far more numerous than
reported.
</P>
<P>
   If an airplane leaves its gate within 15 minutes of the
scheduled time, that counts as leaving on time ''even if it then
sits on the runway for three hours,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   And those long waits on the runway aren't always the fault of
weather or air traffic controller delays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines schedule more planes for popular takeoff times than
can be accommodated, knowing there will be a wait, he complained.
Then, to get listed as on-time, they pull away from the terminal,
get in line and sit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mead said airlines have changed their anticipated
flight times -- for example, listing one that used to take 90
minutes as now taking two hours -- to reduce the number of late
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   If the airlines were using scheduled flight times they used in
1988, late arrivals would be 25 percent higher than they are now,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's witness list originally included Carol
Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, which
represents the nation's major airlines. The ATA said Hallett was
out of town and could not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ATA spokesman Dave Fuscus, in a later telephone interview,
pressed the industry view that the delays are largely the fault of
an antiquated air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   He said the airlines lengthened their scheduled air times to
reflect the reality of a system that cannot move traffic faster. As
to leaving the gate when they know there is a wait to take off, he
said: ''If there is a line to take off, you want to get in line as
soon as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said while bad weather is the most
common cause of delays, other reasons include inoperable runways,
airport capacity limits, aircraft maintenance and crew problems, as
well as air traffic equipment problems and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delays will never be eliminated,'' she said, but the goal is
to minimize them.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kragh, an air traffic controller from Newark, N.J.,
contended that ''airlines have embarked on a well-financed campaign
of misinformation blaming air traffic control for their delays.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the airlines continue to overbook runways,
especially during peak hours, air traffic delays will continue and
passengers will wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby condemned the ''hurry up and wait'' mentality that
pervades air travel:
</P>
<P>
   ''We're told to get to the airport at least an hour before
flight time -- only to wait in line to be processed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're told to be at the gate at least 20 minutes before flight
time or our seat will be forfeited -- only to wait in line to be
herded on the plane like domesticated animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're told to be belted in our seats five minutes before the
scheduled departure -- only to pull away from the gate and be held
hostage until the airlines' real schedule or the system can
accommodate us.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks traded sharply lower in early trading

   Investors pounded the technology sector following announcements

</P>
<P>
   LSI Logic was down $7.937 at $33.063, and BMC Software fell
$1.437 at $17.063.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reaction to weaker-than-expected earnings reports -- a
characteristic of the markets in recent sessions -- is simply
investors reversing course from a rally that followed the broad
selloff in technology stocks earlier this year, said Richard Hoey,
chief economist and chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of companies are beating Wall Street's

<HEADLINE> Experts: Concorde Engines in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PAM SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French investigators focused Wednesday on the Air
France Concorde's powerful Rolls Royce engines -- one of which was
repaired just before Tuesday's doomed flight -- as the possible
cause of the first-ever Concorde crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Air France said the ''engine reverse thruster''
of engine 2 of the doomed plane was inoperative on its return from
New York on Monday. Such thrusters are used to slow the plane upon
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the required piece was not available, Flight AF4590 was
cleared for departure because of a technical level of tolerance
allowed by the manufacturer, Air France said. However, the pilot,
taking into account that the plane was full, ordered the
replacement of the inoperative part, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers made the repair using a part from a backup Concorde, the
airline said. It did not indicate whether the last-minute repair
could have been related to the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic jet crashed into a hotel outside Paris on
Tuesday, killing 113 people. Aviation specialists havge identified
insufficient thrust, the configuration of the engines and even the
plane's supersonic design as possible causes of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, an investigator said the pilot reported
engine trouble soon after takeoff as the tail began to be engulfed
by flames.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot responded that he could not stop the flight and was
trying to reach Le Bourget, a nearby airport. ''It is during this
looping maneuver that the aircraft crashed on the hotel in
Gonesse,'' France 2 television quoted investigator Elizabeth Senot
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also noted that the crash came at a time when airplanes
are most vulnerable -- in the air for only a short time, moving
slowing and loaded with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''For any airplane, the absolute worst time you can have
something come unstuck is after takeoff,'' said William Waldock of
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators must determine whether the fire was a symptom or
cause, Waldock said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''An engine failure by itself should not destroy the airplane's
ability to fly,'' he said. ''Usually it has to come together with
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Turcat, the pilot who flew the first test flight of the
Concorde in 1969, said Wednesday he believed the cause of the
accident was ''much more serious'' than just a malfunctioning
engine. He said that mere engine failure could not have caused the
plane to go down.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the wreckage, officials will search for anything that could
have come apart or even if birds flew into the jet. They will try
to piece together whether fuel or hydraulic lines were severed by
pieces from an engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be a problem with insufficient thrust, which
usually means a problem with the engines,'' said Michael Barr,
director of the aviation safety program at the University of
Southern California. ''It appears the airplane stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   A stall occurs when there is insufficient airspeed over the
wings to create the lift that sustains an aircraft's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Concorde flies higher and faster than passenger
jetliners, its four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines do not differ
greatly from slower and lower-flying models on other commercial
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is the only commercial jetliner to use
afterburners, which provide extra thrust. Afterburners, which are
typically found on fighters, mix warm air and fuel in the tailpipe
of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   At supersonic speeds, air entering the Concorde's engines is
slowed down before it is combined with fuel and combusted for
thrust, like in other commercial jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Concordes take off at subsonic speeds and do not break the speed
of sound until they are over the ocean. Because of their unique
design, they take off faster and steeper than other jets -- a fact
some aviation experts pointed out after Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you build a wing that works well low-speed, it doesn't work
well at high-speed and vice versa,'' Waldock said. ''Some airplane
designs like the F-14, it's a very fast airplane, but to be able to
fly it at low speeds, you have to move the wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Concorde pilot David Brister, who flew the aircraft from
1976 to 1982, said other aspects of its design may have made it
vulnerable to engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde is unusual in that the two engines on each wing are
very close together. Any four-engined aircraft can cope perfectly
well with losing one engine but if two go on the same side you can
be in for a difficult time,'' he said. ''But with Concorde the
engines are so close that it is possible one could affect the other
and then you have a much more serious situation.''

<HEADLINE> Town Hails Concorde Pilot As Hero  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- Seconds before the doomed Air France
Concorde slammed into a small hotel in Gonesse and engulfed it in
flames, the pilot veered the plane away from the town center, the
mayor and other residents said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the pilot, whose name has not been released,
was trying to turn so he could make an emergency landing. But the
people of Gonesse hailed the pilot as a hero who spared their town
of 23,000 from a disaster even greater than that caused by
Tuesday's crash, which killed all 109 people aboard the Concorde
and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear, according to witnesses ... that at the last
moment, when the plane was about to fly over the hospital and the
town, the pilot directed the craft over the field,'' Mayor
Jean-Pierre Blazy said at a news conference. ''We avoided
catastrophe thanks to the pilot's presence of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Claude Porcheron, a priest at the St. Peter St. Paul
parish, said he believed the pilot was a hero for his desperate,
last-gasp effort to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the most beautiful act in the world,'' he said, tears
welling up in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But alongside relief that more people had not been killed in the
disaster, a sense of outrage was also simmering in Gonesse -- fueled
by a long-standing feud over the nearby Charles de Gaulle airport
and its rapidly growing air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wonder how many people have to die before the government
decides to construct a new airport in a less sensitive area,'' said
Claude Carpentier, head of a local group that has lobbied to
protect the area from noise, traffic and other problems caused by
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live about 500 meters (yards) from the crash. For us, it's
a nightmare,'' said Laurent Vadel, a 29-year-old teacher.
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot told France-2
television Wednesday that the decision on whether to build a third
airport in the greater Paris area would be made by the end of the
summer. Such a move had been requested by Gonesse residents to
lessen pressure on the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport on Wednesday, volunteers and psychologists
struggled to find the words to help families shattered by the
crash. The first family members arrived at the airport late
Wednesday morning after flights from Germany, where most of the
victims lived.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to understand that it was their loved ones,''
said Virginie Lermoyez, a high-ranking official of the Paris civil
protection service. ''There were couples on that plane. There are
children who have lost their parents after seeing them off on their
dream trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray skies and a constant drizzle underscored the sadness that
engulfed the sprawling airport best known as the gateway for
millions of tourists on their way to carefree vacations in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities erected barriers and stationed a line of
police to keep the family members away from the news media and
curiosity-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 psychologists were at the airport to greet the
families, who were being escorted to counseling sessions by
officials, health workers and priests.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Declares War Missing Dead  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Ending a seven-month investigation into
the fate of thousands of Lebanese who disappeared during their
country's 15-year civil war, a government commission on Wednesday
asked relatives to accept the painful reality that their loved ones
are probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a condensed version of its findings, the commission, which
investigated the fate of an estimated 17,000 Lebanese who went
missing during the 1975-1990 war, called on families to begin the
paperwork to obtain death certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission considers that all the kidnapped and missing
who have disappeared for four years or more and whose bodies have
not been found are to be considered deceased,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
   In its investigation, the commission inspected sites of
disappearances, unearthed graves and looked into the fate of
hundreds of Lebanese believed held in Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said identification of many corpses was
impossible as the bodies had deteriorated after being thrown into
mass graves or dumped into the sea. The commission also said it
found just 17 Lebanese jailed in Israel and none in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the missing refused to accept the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still looking for him,'' Zahira Burji said, referring to
her brother Kazem Burji, who was kidnapped in the Bekaa Valley in
1976 at the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   Burji was one of two dozen relatives who staged a sit-in at
Parliament in downtown Beirut to protest the findings. The
relatives, most of them veiled Muslim women, cried as they held
pictures of their missing loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been weeping for 25 years. Enough. We want the
truth,'' said Wadad Halwani, who heads a group of relatives of the
missing. She demanded that the government release full details of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   During the civil war, Christian and Muslim militias kidnapped
people from different sects for revenge killings -- euphemistically
called ''bilateral physical liquidations'' -- or to trade in
prisoner exchanges. The conflict killed about 150,000 people and
displaced a half million more in this country of 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss expressed sympathy ''and understanding
for the painful echo the results of the study'' will have on the
families. ''I see no way but to admit the truth and accept it, no
matter how bitter it is,'' he said in a statement issued late
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Doubts 2005 Missile Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may no longer be realistic to expect the
Pentagon to build a sufficiently reliable system of national
missile defense by 2005, Defense Secretary William Cohen told a
Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday, Cohen said two consecutive failures to shoot down a mock
warhead in space with a land-based interceptor have raised doubts
about the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps it has called into question the realism of the date,''
Cohen said, noting that this was the view of retired Gen. Larry
Welch, head of a panel that is advising the Pentagon on its
national missile defense project.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen repeatedly stressed, however, that both he and Welch
believe the 2005 target date is ''the date we ought to continue to
focus on,'' even if it eventually slips.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is due to make a recommendation to President Clinton --
probably in mid-August -- on whether to proceed toward a system of
20 missile interceptors and a new high-powered X-band radar ready
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Cohen would recommend moving the start-up
date to 2006 or later. He gave no indication in his Senate
testimony that he thinks this is necessary, although he pointedly
left open that possibility by conceding under questioning that
testing thus far has failed to show the system is technically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The 2005 date is important because, according to U.S.
intelligence estimates, by then North Korea could have a missile
capable of reaching the United States. The Pentagon says it would
take at least five years to complete an anti-missile shield capable
of defending all 50 states against a limited attack of ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters Wednesday in his Pentagon office, Cohen
said Clinton's main choice is whether to keep the Pentagon on track
toward the 2005 target date, or to foreclose that option. One
potential problem with sticking to the 2005 timetable, Cohen said,
is that it would put time pressure on Clinton's successor to
determine shortly after taking office whether he wanted to continue
on the same schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''A consideration will have to be, by President Clinton, whether
or not this puts any undue pressure on his successor'' to decide
whether to go forward with initial construction of the anti-missile
system, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does not give the go-ahead this fall to begin
groundbreaking work next year at the X-band radar site on Shemya
Island, Alaska, the entire project will be set back by at least one
year, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments Wednesday, Cohen raised the possibility that the
next flight test of the missile interceptor would be delayed from
October or November, as currently planned, to December. He said no
decision on that had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that it might be possible for Clinton to approve
awarding the construction contracts this fall, with the stipulation
that a separate decision would be made next year to actually
execute the contracts. Because of the harsh weather conditions on
Shemya, work can only be done during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a law last year requiring the Pentagon to deploy
a national missile defense as soon as technologically possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said that in his view this law amounted to a national
decision to go ahead with missile defense. The only question is how
soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said, however, that determining when missile defense is
technologically possible is a more complicated question involving
such things as its affordability and the implications for broader
U.S. national security concerns, such as arms control agreements
with Russia, relations with China and European concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not simple. It's complicated,'' Cohen said. ''But that's
part of the work of diplomacy and persuasion, and that's what we've
been seeking to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee,
told Cohen he believes Clinton should put off a decision on moving
ahead with deployment, in light of the January and July flight test
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to acknowledge that the 2005 deployment goal
is no longer realistic, and should be adjusted,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., made a similar point. ''It's clear to
me that we're nowhere near ready to make a decision to deploy,'' he
said. ''It would be a huge mistake'' to commit now to a system that
has yet to be shown technically feasible, let alone sufficiently
reliable in an actual missile attack, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks' Future Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The collapse of the Camp David summit
leaves Israel and the Palestinians facing a round of tough new
decisions about when -- or whether -- to return to the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is left with the clock running out on his time
in office and a disappointingly diminished chance of leaving a
Mideast peace legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, meanwhile, faces renewed
political infighting at home and a drive by his right-wing
opponents to force early elections -- a move that could put
peacemaking on the back burner for months.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Israel on Wednesday, he told ministers and family
members that he had gone to Camp David knowing there could never be
''peace at any price, but also no peace without paying a certain
price -- a price that is heart-rending and difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say in anguish that we have not yet succeeded,''
Barak said, ''because we did not find a partner that was prepared
for hard decisions on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks drew an immediate retort from Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat, who told CNN: ''Mr. Barak knows very well that we have
come a long way. Assigning blame will not serve any purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was heading into consultations
with other Arab leaders, trying to forge a consensus on whether
Palestinians should consider accepting some form of control in Arab
neighborhoods of east Jerusalem. That is more than Israel has ever
offered before, but falls short of Palestinians' long-standing
sovereignty demands.
</P>
<P>
   As he returned home to the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, thousands of
Palestinians gave him a hero's welcome, praising him for his tough
stand on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat is no longer just a Palestinian leader,'' said Selim
Hashen. ''He is a leader of all the Arabs and all the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Peaceful marches in support of Arafat were held in the West Bank
cities of Ramallah and Jennin, and in the divided city of Hebron,
stores were closed during a two-hour commercial strike in support
of the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week summit punctuated by moments of high drama,
repeated walkout threats by both sides and a premature U.S.
declaration last week that the summit was dead and finished, the
ending was both sudden and somber.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't get there; that's the truth,'' Clinton said
simply, announcing that the two sides could not come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   The chief cause of the breakdown, all sides said, was Jerusalem,
which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they both remain committed to peace,'' the president
said of his summit partners, Barak and Arafat. ''I think they both
will find a way to get there if they don't let time run away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said there might be an attempt by the
parties to regroup sometime in August. Barak, though, told
reporters that ''I cannot know whether there will be another summit
before September.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry said ''the
fact that the sides for the first time directly discussed all
aspects of the final status'' and agreed to continue efforts to
find agreement was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The summit-goers did not leave completely empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations said in a statement they intended ''to continue
their efforts to conclude an agreement on all permanent status
issues as soon as possible.'' But no timetable was set; Barak said
it was important for both his own team and the Palestinians to go
home and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations also said they understood the importance of
avoiding unilateral actions -- seen as an implicit pledge by Arafat
not to declare a Palestinian state outside of negotiations with
Israel. That helps defuse what had been a potential showdown on
Sept. 13, when a deadline set by the two sides for reaching an
accord expires.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit, the Palestinians said they would declare
statehood then, treaty or no treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if the Palestinians intended to go ahead and
declare a state on that date, Erekat said, ''We hope by that time
we have reached an agreement with the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture to Arafat, the statement said the only path to
peace was resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council after
Middle East wars in 1967 and 1973. These call for Israel to
relinquish territory won from the Arabs in exchange for secure
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top Arafat aide, blamed Barak for the
failure, saying he entered the talks with an inflexible list of
''no's.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli position was the cause of failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, though, put the blame squarely on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's painful to realize the other side is not ripe for
peace,'' he told reporters before flying back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credited both sides with seeking a compromise on the
future of Jerusalem, but suggested Barak took bolder steps than
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians changed their position, they moved forward,''
Clinton said, slightly lifting the secrecy he had imposed on the
details of the negotiations. ''The Israelis moved more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he understood the tremendous domestic pressures
that both Barak and Arafat faced. Hard-liners on both sides have
made veiled threats of violence if they perceived their leaders had
conceded too much.
</P>
<P>
   While not making a firm commitment to new talks, the president --
who has less than six months left in office -- strongly hinted he
hoped they could occur. Barak said he understood the American
mediation effort would resume with a senior U.S. official's visit
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that we have the elements here to keep this process
going. ... I think it can happen,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Gets a Hero's Welcome  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Yasser Arafat returned home to the
Gaza Strip on Wednesday to a hero's welcome, greeting thousands of
chanting Palestinians with a promise that Jerusalem would one day
be the capital of their independent state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the real and honest expression of the Palestinian
people,'' Arafat told a cheering crowd at his headquarters after a
triumphant ride from Gaza's airport. ''I thank them for this
national stand.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his people would stand ''together until Jerusalem is the
capital of the Palestinians' independent state. Whether they like
it or not, whether they want it or not, and if they don't like it,
they can go to Sea of Gaza and drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made sure to thank President Clinton for his ''maximum
efforts'' during the marathon Israeli-Palestinian peace summit at
Camp David that collapsed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes that peace in Palestine is so important, not only
for Palestinians, but for all the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak landed to what
will surely be a much more difficult re-entry. He told gathered
ministers and family members that he had gone to Camp David knowing
there could never be ''peace at any price, but also no peace
without paying a certain price -- a price that is heart-rending and
difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say in anguish that we have not yet succeeded,''
Barak said, ''because we did not find a partner that was prepared
for hard decisions on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks drew an immediate retort from Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat, who told CNN: ''Mr. Barak knows very well that we (the
Palestinians) have come a long way. Assigning blame will not serve
any purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Arafat arrived, thousands of Palestinians lined the
streets of Gaza City, some dancing and singing nationalist songs,
all in praise of Arafat for not having traded away his people's
claim to Jerusalem. Peaceful marches were also held in several West
Bank cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat is no longer just a Palestinian leader,'' said
21-year-old Selim Hashem, who carried a pistol at his side. ''He is
a leader of all the Arabs and all the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arafat landed in Gaza, a young girl put flowers around his
neck. Thousands lined the streets leading to his headquarters, many
of them wearing black T-shirts and khaki green military trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of his Fatah group rode around in vans with
loudspeakers, calling on residents to turn out to receive ''the
Saladin of this generation'' -- a reference to the 12th-century
Muslim general who defeated the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are following Arafat on the way to Jerusalem,'' read
banners along the streets. ''The Palestinian state is a sacred
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators chanted: ''We are ready to give our soul and
our blood to our great hero!''
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving in Gaza, Arafat met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria, Egypt, where he was greeted by a
cheering crowd. Despite the failed summit, the door to more talks
is still open, Arafat said after meeting Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ''As President Clinton said yesterday, it is possible to go back
one more time next month to Washington or to any other place he
himself chooses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more details of Israel's reported offer to the
Palestinians at Camp David emerged while Barak was traveling home.
Israel army radio, quoting a senior official on his plane, reported
that Barak had offered the Palestinians a capital in east
Jerusalem, to be called Al-Quds, the Arabic name for the city,
which would include some Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem and
other neighborhoods now outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered free passage for Arafat to the Temple Mount, one
of Islam's holiest sites, and religious freedom there. The word
''sovereignty'' was avoided, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army chief of staff, Shaul Mofaz, said he would be
meeting the commanders of Palestinian security forces with the aim
of avoiding outbreaks of Palestinian violence following the failure
of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said forces in the West
Bank had not been beefed up, a move that would be perceived as a
provocation. ''We will do everything in our power to prevent any
explosion of this kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers in the West Bank have expressed fears that their
settlements might be attacked. However, Sneh assured them that the
government was committed to their defense and the army prepared to
deal with any emergency.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 settlers who had been on hunger strike throughout the
Camp David summit ended their fast Wednesday, expressing relief
that the negotiations had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Shlonim, the organizer, said the summit had ''endangered the
Zionist idea and the existence of the Jewish state.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks traded sharply lower Wednesday on another
batch of disappointing earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 109.16 at 10,590.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 14.01 at 1,460.46, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 90.23 at 3,939.34.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pounded the technology sector following announcements
by LSI Logic Corp. and BMC Software Inc. after regular trading
closed Tuesday that second-quarter earnings were below analysts'
expectations. LSI Logic was down $7.75 at $33.25, and BMC Software
fell $1.375 at $17.125.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies were among the hardest hit within the broad
technology sector. Vignette Corp. was down $6.687 at $36.938,
Rambus shares were down $11.25 at $73.75 and Akamai Technologies
was down $4.50 to $80.50.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were also down across-the-board.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reaction to weaker-than-expected earnings reports -- a
characteristic of the markets in recent sessions -- is simply
investors reversing course from a rally that followed the broad
selloff in technology stocks earlier this year, said Richard Hoey,
chief economist and chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of companies are beating Wall Street's
expectations, Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little conviction in the market for days and
investors seemed poised to pounce on any news to provide them with
direction -- one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, stocks rose after AT&AMP;T and Texas Instruments beat
Wall Street earnings forecasts, giving a boost to the technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the trend should continue until more detailed
economic data is released later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 492.43 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 8.75 at 505.58.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Congressman Joins GOP  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California Democratic congressman who blamed
party leaders for his sound defeat in the primary this year has
joined the Republican Party. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matthew ''Marty'' Martinez said he told House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., about his decision a week ago. He sent a
voter registration card to Los Angeles County on Wednesday to
officially change parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the Democratic Party left me. I didn't leave the
Democratic Party,'' Martinez said at a news conference with
Hastert. ''I don't think bitter is the right word. The proper word
is disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 71, lost in a landslide in March to state Sen. Hilda
Solis, who accused him of neglecting the district and criticized
his opposition to gun control and abortion. Martinez said he felt
abandoned by Democratic leaders, who remained neutral during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are hypocrites,'' he said. ''They are not people
of their word. They say one thing and do something else. I'm
getting tired of being a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who compiled a generally liberal voting record during
18 years in the House, has been siding with Republicans since his
defeat. He was among five Democrats who voted last month to offer
prescription drug benefits as part of Medicare. The bill, which
fell short of Democratic proposals, passed by three votes.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's defection gives Republicans a 223-210 advantage over
Democrats. There also are two independents.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said every vote will help in
the closing months of the session, particularly in crafting rules
for how legislation is debated.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP desperately wants to maintain control of the House after
the fall elections, but it's highly unlikely Martinez can help.
Republicans did not field a candidate in his Southern California
district, which is heavily Hispanic and solidly Democratic, though
Martinez said he might attempt a write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Martinez has left the Democratic Party.
He joined the GOP in 1960, then rejoined the Democrats in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the Republicans were losing sight of mainstream
America,'' Martinez said. ''It depends on who the leadership is.
Right now, an extreme liberal element is the leadership of the
Democratic Party and they're not doing the best for the American
people.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Inspects Lebanon Border  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOULA, Lebanon (AP) -- A U.N. envoy on Wednesday inspected three
of four points on Lebanon's border with Israel, saying last-minute
Israeli violations are delaying the deployment of U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Terje Roed-Larsen looked through a pair of binoculars as two
bulldozers and two trucks in Israel appeared to be constructing a
road.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this road is built, it will be a violation,'' Brig. Gen.
Jim Sreenan, the Irish deputy commander of peacekeepers in Lebanon,
was heard telling Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen's trip to south Lebanon came a day after the United
Nations envoy issued an unusually strongly worded statement
rebuking Israel for violations along the border. Larsen, according
to the statement, also conveyed to Israeli officials that ''this
pattern of behavior had to be changed immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers had been scheduled to begin fanning out along
the border on Wednesday. But Lebanon, which had given its consent
for the deployment, has put those plans on hold, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the inspection points, Larsen and Sreenan were joined
by Brig. Gen. Amin Hoteit, the head of the Lebanese team of border
surveyors. Hoteit explained to Larsen how Israel built a road and
moved the fence about 10 feet inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
could ease tension in the region, where anti-Israeli guerrillas
have taken control following Israel's May 24 withdrawal from a
south Lebanon border strip it had held for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government had delayed the deployment of the
peacekeepers -- 5,000 of them are already stationed farther north
from the border in southern Lebanon -- and its own troops in the
region because of concerns that Israel had not completed its
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Delayed for Maintenance  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- An engine that began spewing a huge trail
of fire as the doomed Air France Concorde took off had been
repaired at the captain's insistence just before the flight began,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane flew low over the airport, an air traffic
controller saw the flames shooting from the newly repaired engine
and quickly alerted Capt. Christian Marty, but the pilot's frantic,
last-ditch attempts at an emergency landing were in vain. Moments
later, the supersonic jet crashed in a huge fireball, killing 109
people on board and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a day after the Concorde plummeted into a hotel
just outside Paris, investigators focused on the repaired engine --
engine No. 2, located on the plane's left side -- as the likely
source of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As details of Flight AF4590's last moments were released,
authorities ordered all Air France Concorde flights indefinitely
grounded and French forensic experts examined charred bodies to
determine their identities. Relatives of the victims, mainly German
tourists, began arriving in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today Germany is shaken,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
at a service for the victims at a chapel in Hanover, Germany, on
the grounds of the World's Fair. Pope John Paul II sent
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   In France, President Jacques Chirac said ''everything'' would be
done to determine the causes of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Elisabeth Senot, who is in charge of the crash
investigation, said the control tower alerted Capt. Marty that the
back of the plane was on fire 56 seconds after takeoff. The pilot
replied that he had engine trouble, at which point the flames were
rapidly growing, France 2 television quoted Senot as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Marty said he was trying to reach Le Bourget, a nearby airport.
''It is during this looping maneuver that the aircraft crashed on
the hotel in Gonesse,'' France 2 quoted Senot as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Senot identified the engine that burst into flames as engine 2.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Air France said the ''engine reverse thruster''
of engine 2 of the doomed plane was inoperative on its return from
New York on July 24. Such thrusters are used to slow the plane upon
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the required piece was not available, the plane was
cleared for departure because it still met manufacturer's safety
requirements, Air France said. The captain, however, ordered the
part replaced before he would take off, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers made the repair using a part from a backup Concorde, the
airline said. It did not say whether the last-minute repair could
have been related to the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot
ordered the indefinite suspension of all Air France Concorde
flights. He said he wanted more checks, with an emphasis on the
recovered black boxes -- the flight recorders and cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we know a sufficient amount about them, and when we're in
touch with our British colleagues, we will be able to consider the
decision to resume,'' he said. However, he said the future of the
Concorde was ''not in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Transportation said the two recorders were
damaged but had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Air France already had grounded all Concorde flights Wednesday.
British Airways canceled its two Tuesday night flights, but resumed
Concorde service Wednesday between New York and London after
completing safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   French media speculated on whether this marked the end of the
swooping ''white bird,'' a source of French pride. The daily Le
Figaro wrote, ''The Concorde without a doubt died yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde had a perfect safety record during 31 years of
service until Tuesday's disaster. All 100 passengers and nine crew
members died just minutes after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Four people on the ground also were killed, and 12 people were
rushed out of Hotelissimo, the hotel that was hit. One was
seriously injured, police said early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the toll on the ground could have been much worse: 45 Polish
tourists who were staying at Hotelissimo had left earlier to go
sightseeing. They returned after the crash to find an inferno where
the hotel once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six of the passengers on board the Concorde were from
Germany -- 13 from the town of Moenchengladbach, on the border with
the Netherlands. There were also two Danes, one Austrian and one
American. The American, identified by the State Department as
65-year-old Christopher Behrens, was a retired Air France employee
who was living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The victims on the ground included two Polish hotel employees,
the Polish Consulate in Paris confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said 81 bodies had been taken away for autopsies by
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde passengers were headed for New York, where they
planned to board a German cruise liner for a luxury voyage through
the Caribbean. But the dream vacation ended in a nightmare of flame
and black smoke at Gonesse, a small town near Charles de Gaulle
airport about nine miles northeast of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw flames shoot up 40 meters (120 feet) and there was a
huge boom,'' said Samir Hossein, a 15-year-old student from Gonesse
who was playing tennis. ''The pilot tried to yank it up, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concordes. ''There were no
hairline cracks in this Concorde,'' Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, full of fuel on takeoff for the Atlantic run, had
been in service since 1980 and had flown 12,000 hours. It had its
last mandatory regulatory checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the needle-nosed supersonic jetliners are still
operated by Air France and British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which first flew in 1969, has been considered
among the world's safest planes. Air France officials had said in
the past that their current fleet is fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, is popular
with celebrities, world-class athletes and the rich. It flies above
turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing the Atlantic in about 3&AMP;frac12;
hours.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross MD Dies From Lassa Fever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A Red Cross surgeon who was working in Sierra
Leone has died in the Netherlands from Lassa fever, the World
Health Organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Salahuddin Ramez, 48, an Aghan national, died in Leiden
University Hospital on Tuesday, 10 days after he was admitted to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ramez had been working in Kenema, Sierra Leone, and became ill
July 11, the day before he traveled to the Netherlands to visit
relatives, WHO said. He was admitted to hospital on July 15 and the
diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
   Lassa fever is spread by infected rats but infected humans can
also pass it on, usually via bodily fluids. It is fatal in 25
percent of cases and survivors can suffer permanent deafness. There
is no vaccine for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ramez traveled from the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, via
Liberia to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, before flying to Amsterdam, said
WHO.
</P>
<P>
   ''The airline company that brought the patient from Abidjan to
Amsterdam has been informed and will notify passengers that have
been seated close to the patient, and the cabin attendants. WHO is
contacting the airline that transported the patient in Africa,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Ramez ... was a highly motivated staff member and was much
appreciated by his colleagues and patients,'' said the
International Committee of the Red Cross in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ramez joined the ICRC in 1995 and carried out missions to
Pakistan, Sudan and East Timor before going to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth case of Lassa fever reported in Europe this
year. A Nigerian man and a German student died from the disease,
while a British national working on peacekeeping duties in Sierra
Leone also contracted the disease.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Vietnam Economic Ties  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday backed granting Vietnam
continued access to U.S. financial help, an endorsement of better
economic relations that follows President Clinton's conclusion
several weeks ago of a major trade agreement with the Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
   By a 332-91 vote, the House defeated an attempt to overturn the
president's decision to extend for a year Vietnam's eligibility for
export-related financing from agencies such as the Ex-Im Bank, the
Department of Agriculture or the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war with Vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new,
although cautious, expanded relationship with Vietnam. Now is not
the time to reverse this constructive course,'' said Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that cautious rapprochement, Clinton in 1994 lifted
the trade embargo against Vietnam and the next year restored
diplomatic relations. He reopened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996
and in 1998 issued his first waiver of provisions in a 1974 trade
act that denies trade relations with communist nations that deny
citizens the right to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the authority to disapprove that waiver but, as in
the annual battle over trade with China, it has never been able to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who has also led the
unsuccessful fights to restrict trade with China, argued that
Vietnam has not lived up to promises to account for POWs and MIAs,
allow citizens to leave the country and improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we giving this perverse incentive for American
companies to shut up their operations here or even refrain from
opening up operations in countries that are struggling to be
democratic and instead to invest in dictatorships like Vietnam or
China?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and others said Vietnam is
moving in the right direction and ''we must preserve the forward
momentum that has developed over the past six years. ... Let us
keep intact the groundwork upon which a meaningful and enduring
relationship hopefully could be built.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, unlike China, does not now have a bilateral trade
agreement with the United States, so it is not entitled to the
lower tariffs that China and other trading partners have under
normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was only on continued access to U.S. loan
credits and investment guarantees, not on normal trade.
</P>
<P>
   The House in May, in probably the most important trade vote of
the year, approved granting China permanent normal trade status as
part of China's approaching entry into the World Trade
Organization. The Senate has yet to act, but is on a course to
approve that legislation in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of trade relations with Vietnam also took a major
step forward earlier this month when Clinton, after four years of
negotiations, reached an agreement with Vietnam under which
Vietnam, with its market of 77 million people, would open up its
markets to American products. U.S. tariffs on Vietnamese products,
which now average 40 percent, would drop to less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires approval by both the House and Senate,
and it appears unlikely Congress will act on it this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suharto Faces Corruption Charges  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Former President Suharto will be
charged with corruption and pilfering more than $150 million in
state funds through a maze of personally controlled charities,
prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator faces life in prison if found guilty,
although he has been offered a pardon by the reformist head of
state Abdurrahman Wahid if he returns the money.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, ruled Indonesia with an iron hand for 32 years
until 1998. He is now under house arrest at his Jakarta home, where
he is recuperating from a series of strokes.
</P>
<P>
   His defense lawyers condemned the prosecution as being
politically motivated and said their client is too sick to face
trial. They said he has permanent brain damage and has lost much of
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, a former human rights
activist at the height of Suharto's reign, completed the case
against Suharto Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a meeting with state lawyers, he said formal
charges would be filed in a Jakarta court soon before a trial
scheduled to start next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution believes there will be no problem with his
health condition,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Assegaf, one of Suharto's attorneys, criticized the
prosecutors as ignoring ''the condition of Suharto, who is ailing
and has memory problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Suharto to trial will be a crucial test of Indonesia's
resolve to roll back years of authoritarianism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After Suharto quit two years ago, the archipelago nation began
an ambitious transition to democracy. The change has proven
difficult and has been marred by entrenched graft, a deep economic
crisis and outbreaks of sectarian and communal violence, in which
thousands have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Suharto amassed billions rather than millions
of dollars through corruption. Prosecutors have said they limited
their investigation only to the role of the foundations and the
missing $150 million to better ensure a conviction in what could be
a landmark trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, a retired five-star general, has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Since he stepped down, student protesters have regularly clashed
with security forces on Jakarta's streets demanding that Suharto be
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman, the attorney general, said Suharto would be charged
with violating an anti-corruption law that the ex-dictator himself
decreed in 1971, five years after he seized power amid political
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who prided himself on bringing stability and
development to Indonesia's 210 million people, is accused of
enriching himself, his family and cronies in his capacity as
chairman of several charitable foundations, which allegedly
siphoned off a fortune in state money.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the foundations took compulsory levies out of the
salaries of millions of government workers and were also generously
supported through state funding.
</P>
<P>
   They were set up to advance a range of social causes. Critics
have long said they were only a front to bankroll massive business
empires for those within Suharto's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is suspected of having caused a total loss of 1.4 trillion
rupiah ($155 million) to the state,'' said Antasari Ashar, a
spokesman for the attorney general's office.

<HEADLINE> Korean Ministers Extend Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The foreign ministers of North and
South Korea shook hands during their first-ever meeting Wednesday,
pledging to extend their newfound cooperation to the world arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blood is thicker than water,'' said North Korean Foreign
Minister Paek Nam Sun, adding that relations had improved
''conspicuously'' since the leaders of North and South Korea held a
summit in June.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Paek and South Korean Foreign Minister Lee
Jong-binn pledged ''to cooperate ... in the international arena so
as to enhance the spirit of reconciliation and cooperation'' of the
June summit, which they praised as a historic step in bringing
peace and possible unification to the divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met ahead of the ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia's
biggest security conference, which begins Thursday. North Korea is
to become a member of ASEAN, raising hopes that the isolated nation
will live peacefully with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, particularly the United States, are eager to
use the security forum to press North Korea to curb its ballistic
missile program.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, freed by the
collapse of the Middle East peace summit, was dashing to Bangkok
for one-on-one talks Friday with the North Korean foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Her meeting with Paek would be the highest-level talks between
the United States and North Korea in a half-century. Some 37,000
U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in until she arrived, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott
said that many countries want more clarification of a sudden offer
last week by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to convert his
ballistic missile program to peaceful satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will obviously be a movement in the right direction if
North Korea were to give up its ballistic missile program,''
Talbott said. ''That would be, I think, a contribution toward peace
in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans used the meeting Wednesday to push forward on
various issues -- from increasing dialogue to reunifying families
divided by the 1950-53 Korean War -- that North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung agreed to in June.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of their 30-minute meeting, the South Korean
foreign minister leaned over to Paek and said: ''All the world's
news media are here. Let's shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of thawing relations, South Korea's ambassador
to China paid a highly symbolic courtesy call on his counterpart at
the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, a South Korean spokeswoman
said. Lacking formal ties, the two Koreas do not maintain embassies
in each others' capitals.
</P>
<P>
   During the unusual visit, the North Korean ambassador told his
guest that Kim Jong Il planned to keep a promise made last month to
visit Seoul, though he gave no indication of when it will happen,
the South's Yonhap news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Red Cross officials in South Korea announced
Wednesday that the final selection for North-South family reunions
-- the first such reunions in 15 years -- would be delayed by a week
to Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred South Koreans will be allowed to cross the border to
meet their families in the North on Aug. 15, the day both Koreas
celebrate as Independence Day from Japanese colonial rule. One
hundred North Koreans will then visit the South for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of families have remained separated by the
world's most heavily fortified border since the end of the war.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Value May Be Symbolic  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although the Concorde earns money for the two
airlines that use it, the plane's matchless speed and elegant,
dart-like silhouette have made it even more valuable as a source of
corporate prestige, analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic aircraft has carved a firm market niche among
celebrities and executives in a hurry since making its first
commercial flight in 1976. But its biggest impact has been as an
emblem of luxury and technological prowess -- something aviation
observers suggest is likely to outlast Tuesday's deadly crash of an
Air France Concorde in the Paris suburb of Gonesse.
</P>
<P>
   For both British Airways and Air France, the plane has become an
important part of their self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a symbol of service. It's the ultimate you can get in
commercial flying,'' said Philip Butterworth-Hayes, an aviation
editor for Jane's Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France both insist the aircraft is
profitable, but refuse to give details.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth-Hayes estimates the Concorde accounts for as much as
20 percent of profits at British Airways, which operates seven of
the planes.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip ticket for a British Airways Concorde flight from
London to New York can cost up to $10,000, though deep discounts
are often available. A comparable first-class flight on a British
Airways 747 jumbo jet is about $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is little capital expense involved in operating the plane.
The British airline has already written off almost all the cost of
its Concordes, which are more than 20 years old on average.
</P>
<P>
   However, Concorde is a fuel-guzzling monster, requiring eight
times as much jet fuel per passenger as a 747, said Mike Stoddart
of Charterhouse Securities, a London-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, British Airways and Air France typically staff
each of their 100-seat Concordes with nine crew members -- almost
twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat
747.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde pilots are among the most experienced and well-paid,
adding to the expense of operating the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the high cost of a Concorde ticket means that British
Airway's supersonic jets earn an average of 10 times more per mile
than the airline's entire fleet, Stoddart said. He estimated the
airline's annual revenues from its four daily Concorde flights to
be around $378 million.
</P>
<P>
   If it were merely a matter of cold economics, British Airways
could probably afford to stop flying its Concordes without
suffering a significant loss in income, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the calculation isn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negative publicity of dropping it would be enormous,''
Stoddart said. ''It's seen as a flag carrier, almost a symbol of
BA. I think they would probably run it beyond the position where it
makes economic sense just because of the prestige it gathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France had six Concordes until Tuesday's disaster. They make
half as many flights per day as their British counterparts and
accounted for 1.3 percent of the French airline's revenues last
year, said Philippe Gossard, a transport analyst in Paris with
Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from Concorde flights were better than Air
France's total fleet average of 4.4 percent, Gossard estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was too early to say if British Airways or Air
France would suffer pinched profits due to passenger defections or
aircraft groundings following the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But even if profits slip, the Concorde's perceived role as a
virtual mascot for the airlines should ensure it won't vanish
quickly from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think both airlines would be incredibly reluctant to let it
go,'' said Peter Turnbull, a transport specialist at Britain's
Cardiff Business School.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Protest U.S. Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- With Fidel Castro leading the way in uniform and
sneakers, a sea of Cubans flooded Havana's coastal highway
Wednesday in a march authorities said drew more than 1 million
protesters in an effort to consolidate opposition to the U.S. trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The march came amid the most significant efforts by the U.S.
Congress in nearly two generations to ease sanctions imposed by the
Kennedy administration against the communist island at the height
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down with the blockade! Long live the homeland!'' the marchers
chanted as they started the 3&AMP;frac12; mile trek, many waving small Cuban
flags. A military brass band accompanied the protesters, playing
martial music.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures rose, many marchers replaced their flags with
umbrellas to protect themselves from the unrelenting tropical sun.
Military marches gave way to the pounding and clanging of
traditional conga bands.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban president, who turns 74 next month, completed the
march to the U.S. Interests Section, where he boarded his black
Mercedes Benz. The chief of the American mission, Vicky Huddleston,
was briefly seen on a balcony with binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   The event coincided with the 47th anniversary of the July 26,
1953, attack by Castro and his followers on an army barracks that
launched the Cuban Revolution against the dictatorship of
then-President Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attackers were all either killed or jailed, the
movement later regained strength and triumphed on New Year's Day
1959 after Batista fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans celebrate July 26 as a national holiday every year, but
this time the celebration comes amid growing moves in the U.S.
Congress to chip away at the nearly 40-year-old trade sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives last week voted to stop enforcing
provisions that ban U.S. food exports and limit sales of American
medicine to Cuba and four other nations -- Iran, Libya, North Korea
and Sudan. At the same time, the Senate passed a bill the same day
to permit food and medical sales to the five countries
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba welcomed the moves, it said they do not go far enough
and continued to demand a total lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   They have said they believe that massive marches, such as the
scores of gatherings held during the seven-month battle to return
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, are necessary to help turn
American public opinion against the trade embargo while it is the
focus of serious congressional debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has told its citizens the earlier protests were key in
influencing a majority of Americans into siding with Elian's
father, who fought to bring his boy with him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, granted temporary custody of the boy
following his rescue off Florida's coast, went to the Supreme Court
in their unsuccessful attempt to keep him in the United States.
Elian's mother perished along with 10 others in their sea journey
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian was repatriated last month, the government
promised to continue the protests to fight against American
policies, including the trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has been under a total trade embargo since February 1962,
longer than any other country except North Korea. The sanctions
were tightened in July 1963, and most travel by Americans to the
island then was made illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wednesday was a national holiday, all government offices
and virtually all other businesses were closed by government order,
and workers were exhorted to march.
</P>
<P>
   Their participation was organized by municipality, neighborhood
and even street block as communist officials arranged
transportation to the march site.
</P>
<P>
   Independent confirmation was impossible, but state-run media
said the turnout was more than 1 million people. Havana has about 2
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the march included hundreds of thousands and
was by far the largest seen in a recent string of gatherings in
recent months. Castro had promised it would be the largest in the
nation's history.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Economic Ties to Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday backed granting Vietnam
continued access to U.S. financial help, an endorsement of better
economic relations that follows President Clinton's conclusion
several weeks ago of a major trade agreement with the Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
   By a 332-91 vote, the House defeated an attempt to overturn the
president's decision to extend for a year Vietnam's eligibility for
export-related financing from agencies such as the Ex-Im Bank, the
Department of Agriculture or the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war with Vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new,
although cautious, expanded relationship with Vietnam. Now is not
the time to reverse this constructive course,'' said Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that cautious rapprochement, Clinton in 1994 lifted
the trade embargo against Vietnam and the next year restored
diplomatic relations. He reopened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996
and in 1998 issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade
relations with communist nations that deny citizens the right to
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the authority to disapprove that waiver but, as in
the annual battle over trade with China, it has never been able to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who has also led the
unsuccessful fights to restrict trade with China, argued that
Vietnam has not lived up to promises to account for POWs and MIAs,
allow citizens to leave the country and improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we giving this perverse incentive for American
companies to shut up their operations here or even refrain from
opening up operations in countries that are struggling to be
democratic and instead to invest in dictatorships like Vietnam or
China?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and others said Vietnam is
moving in the right direction and ''we must preserve the forward
momentum that has developed over the past six years. ... Let us
keep intact the groundwork upon which a meaningful and enduring
relationship hopefully could be built,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, unlike China, does not now have a bilateral trade
agreement with the United States, so it is not entitled to the
lower tariffs that China and other trading partners have under
normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was only on continued access to U.S. loan
credits and investment guarantees, not on normal trade.
</P>
<P>
   The House in May, in probably the most important trade vote of
the year, approved granting China permanent normal trade status as
part of China's approaching entry into the World Trade
Organization. The Senate has yet to act, but is on a course to
approve that legislation in September.
</P>
<P>
   The future of trade relations with Vietnam also took a major
step forward earlier this month when Clinton, after four years of
negotiations, reached an agreement with Vietnam under which
Vietnam, with 77 million people, would open up its markets to
American products. U.S. tariffs on Vietnamese products, which now
average 40 percent, would drop to less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires approval by both the House and Senate,
and it appears unlikely Congress will act on it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Daly, spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, said the administration was pleased with the way the
House voted just two weeks after the trade pact was concluded.
''U.S. engagement in Vietnam will contribute to a prosperous
Vietnam,'' he said, ''and that will contribute to regional
stability.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Speight Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- George Speight, who toppled Fiji's elected
government in a two-month hostage standoff, was arrested Wednesday
by the military and accused of threatening the island nation's new
president.
</P>
<P>
   Shots rang out at a military checkpoint where Speight, his legal
adviser Tevita Bukarau, his spokesman Jo Nata and a bodyguard were
arrested about 10:30 p.m. and hauled off to a military barracks,
local radio and the military reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although Speight and his supporters had been granted an amnesty
for releasing the last of their 27 hostages on July 13, military
spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said the amnesty was
conditional on the rebels turning in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight goes around with armed bodyguards -- that is
illegal,'' Tarakinikini said. ''We can't have private militias
operating around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Speight was arrested because of ''allegations brought to
us about the carriage of arms in and around Suva by George Speight
and his bodyguards and also threats to the head of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini said a police investigation will determine what
charges will be brought against Speight, who this month boasted how
he had torpedoed the swearing-in of a new government that only had
two of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came as President Ratu Josefa Iloilo put the final
touches on a Cabinet lineup aimed at bringing Fiji out of its
10-week-old government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to the arrest from supporters of
Speight, a self-proclaimed champion of the indigenous Fijian
majority against the sizable ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Speight set off the crisis on May 19 when led an armed gang into
Parliament and took dozens of lawmakers hostage, demanding the
elected government be overthrown and that the ethnic Indian
community be stripped of political power.
</P>
<P>
   The military regime which took power 10 days after the
parliament raid agreed to scrap the multiracial constitution and
oust the government of prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's
first ethnic Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's
population, have too much power. The Indians were first brought to
Fiji in the 1870s as indentured labor.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening a new campaign of unrest, Speight has demanded that
the new interim government be stacked with his supporters. The
government will oversee the rewriting of Fiji's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Speight stormed out of a meeting with Iloilo earlier this week,
apparently in anger that the ailing 80-year-old president refused
to back down from his chosen candidate for prime minister, banker
Laisenia Qarase. The new Cabinet is expected to be announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's military bolstered its presence Wednesday across the
Pacific island ''in anticipation of a negative reaction ... to the
announcement of the new Cabinet,'' spokesman Lt. Ro Alipate
Mataitini said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Team Up to Help the Poor  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats and the White House have
lined up behind a version of legislation intended to bring
prosperity to poor communities. Unlike House-passed legislation,
however, this measure does not include GOP-supported provisions
that would give religious groups a greater opportunity to deliver
government services.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said the ''charitable choice'' issue
would be the major sticking point in reaching agreement with the
GOP on a Senate bill providing tax breaks, regulatory relief and
government programs to encourage more private investment in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charitable choice is the big philosophical divide,'' Robb said
Wednesday. ''On almost all the other pieces, we're in basic
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A version of the legislation passed Tuesday by the House
included language backed by many Democrats that would permit
religious organizations to compete for federal alcohol and drug
treatment grants. Individuals could choose between the
religious-based program and a similar secular one.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP Senate bill would expand current law to permit
charitable and religious organizations to compete for contracts and
vouchers on an equal basis with other nongovernmental providers of
services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats believe this could violate civil rights laws by
permitting the groups to hire people of only one religious faith --
and discriminate against others -- while paying their salaries with
federal money. Republicans contend that religious groups are often
most effective at helping the poor and should be given that chance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this dispute, Robb and top White House officials said
Wednesday they believed compromise could be reached this year on
the overall bill. The measure includes President Clinton's
initiative to funnel venture capital into inner cities and rural
areas and a Republican plan to create 40 new ''renewal
communities'' where businesses are offered tax and regulatory
breaks for locating in the areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bipartisan effort,'' said Gene Sperling, the
president's top economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Because time is short in this session of Congress, the bill
ultimately may wind up in the final tax and budget package
negotiated by GOP leaders and the White House before lawmakers
adjourn in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to try to get it done this year,'' said Melissa
Sabatine, spokeswoman for the chief Republican Senate sponsor,
Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum.

<HEADLINE> Serb Jailed for Kosovo Reporting  </HEADLINE>
By DRAGAN ILIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a trial denounced by human rights
groups, a military court convicted a Serbian journalist of
espionage Wednesday for writing about Serb atrocities in Kosovo and
sentenced him to seven years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups and media organizations quickly condemned the
conviction of Miroslav Filipovic, a reporter for the independent
Belgrade daily Danas, as part of a campaign by President Slobodan
Milosevic's government to suppress dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Filipovic gathered confidential military
information for foreign organizations between May 1999 and May
2000, and convicted him of a lesser charge of spreading false
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, we are terribly dismayed,'' said Ann Cooper,
executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists in New
York. ''But it is very much in keeping with Milosevic's desire to
stamp out all independent voice in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Filipovic's reports included testimony from a Yugoslav army
commander who admitted that he watched a soldier decapitate a
3-year-old ethnic Albanian boy in front of his family. Another
described how tanks indiscriminately shelled a Kosovo Albanian
village before paramilitary police moved in and massacred the
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Filipovic's face was blank as he stood to hear the verdict. His
wife, Slavica, who was inside the courtroom, seemed pale. After
leaving the court, she told The Associated Press Television News
that her husband was no spy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not justice,'' she said. ''This is a political
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was led away, Filipovic embraced his wife and told
reporters he was not surprised. He said he would serve the sentence
as a ''stable person.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Filipovic's three defense lawyers, Zoran Stojanovic, said
they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the
sentence was in keeping with ''the Milosevic regime's typical
attitude'' to suppress Serbia's independent media ''threatening or
even beating those brave enough to report the truth among their own
journalist corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International spokeswoman Judith Arenas said Filipovic
was arrested for normal journalistic work and was denied a fair
trial because the proceedings were partly secret.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the prosecution charged that Filipovic's articles
were false. It also brought as evidence of espionage articles by
Filipovic that cited an alleged secret Yugoslav army intelligence
report on atrocities against Kosovo Albanians during last year's
78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also showed military reports on army formations and
troop movements that coincided with details published in some of
Filipovic's articles.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge Radenko Mladenovic said an examination of
Filipovic's articles indicated the charges were valid and that
Filipovic was never given any official military records but
personally collected secret data.
</P>
<P>
   Filipovic was also accused of exposing army activities in
Sandzak, a Muslim-dominated region in southwestern Serbia, and
reporting on troop movements and army morale in Montenegro,
Serbia's junior partner in the two-republic Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed his information came from public records and was
therefore not secret. He was arrested in May at his home in the
central Serbian town of Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's regime has intensified its crackdown on independent
media in recent months, banning and fining newspapers critical of
his policies and detaining scores of independent reporters and
opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, the London-based Institute for War and
Peace Reporting, which published some of Filipovic's articles, has
been trying to garner international support to pressure the
Yugoslav government to drop the charges. There has been little
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the silence that really makes me feel angry,'' said
Gordana Igric, Filipovic's editor at the London institute. ''For so
many years everyone is screaming that the Serbs should do this and
that to become democratic and when one guy speaks out and is
punished, people don't care.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 100, Nasdaq Slips 74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks traded sharply lower Wednesday on another
batch of disappointing earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 100.41 at 10,599.56.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 15.33 at 1,459.14, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 74.27 at 3,955.30.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pounded the technology sector following announcements
by LSI Logic Corp. and BMC Software Inc. after regular trading
closed Tuesday that second-quarter earnings were below analysts'
expectations. LSI Logic was down $8.875 at $32.125, and BMC
Software fell $1.312 at $17.188.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Xerox Corp. chairman and chief executive Paul
Allaire said Xerox investors should make a ''significant downward
adjustment to current second-half expectations'' for its earnings
over the next six months. The copy machine maker's shares fell
$3.063 to $15.125.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies were among the hardest hit within the broad
technology sector. Vignette Corp. was down $3.875 at $39.75, Rambus
shares were down $11.016 at $73.984. And fiber-optics company SDL
Inc. was down $8.094 to $391.281.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were also down across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reaction to weaker-than-expected earnings reports -- a
characteristic of the markets in recent sessions -- is simply
investors reversing course from a rally that followed the broad
selloff in technology stocks earlier this year, said Richard Hoey,
chief economist and chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of companies are beating Wall Street's
expectations, Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little conviction in the market for days and
investors seemed poised to pounce on any news to provide them with
direction -- one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, stocks rose after AT&AMP;T and Texas Instruments beat
Wall Street earnings forecasts, giving a boost to the technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the trend should continue until more detailed
economic data is released later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 724.28 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 6.39 at 507.94.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Diplomat: Bill Won't Do  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional attempt to prohibit an
international court from prosecuting Americans as war criminals
isn't helping -- and may make matters worse -- during negotiations on
how the court will work, the U.S. war crimes ambassador said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries approved a treaty establishing the International
Criminal Court in July 1998 in Rome. Nonetheless, the United States
is helping draft the court's rules of procedure and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A bill working its way through Congress ''will worsen our
negotiating position'' during negotiations on the court, Ambassador
David Scheffer told the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The United States objects that American soldiers and government
officials can be subject to the court's jurisdiction if an alleged
crime is committed in a country that ratified the treaty -- even if
the United States is not a party.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says this would leave U.S. troops and citizens
vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the American Servicemembers' Protection Act in the House
and Senate, American soldiers would not be able to participate in
global peacekeeping missions in many countries that participate in
the ICC and American officials would not be able to cooperate with
the court, Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely essential, however, that the U.S. not expand
current limitations on cooperation with the ICC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To do so would ensure that we are unable to obtain additional
protection within the ICC Treaty regime. I must be able to offer,
in exchange for the protection we are seeking, the ultimate
cooperation of the United States with the ICC.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., asked whether U.S. actions
during World War II, including the dropping of atomic bombs on

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland To Empty Prison  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- By week's end, when most of the
remaining inmates file out of Northern Ireland's anti-terrorist
Maze prison, the murderers and bombers who made headlines and broke
families' hearts during 30 years of sectarian strife will be free
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army sniper who shot the last British
soldier killed in Northern Ireland. The bomber who massacred nine
people in a Protestant fish shop -- and the Protestant who killed
seven people in retaliation. The IRA man who bombed London's
Docklands area, killing two.
</P>
<P>
   All of them -- a total of 86 prisoners -- are to receive early
paroles Friday, the final beneficiaries of one of the most divisive
provisions of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That stipulation calls for the early release of prisoners
affiliated with paramilitary groups observing cease-fires -- 428
inmates in all, a third of them serving life sentences for murder.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's deadline looming, this week already has seen the
freeing of pro-British Protestant paramilitary member Michael
Stone, who killed three people by opening fire with two pistols and
lobbing grenades at mourners attending an IRA funeral in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''At times -- such as this week -- you ... have to swallow hard on
something like prisoner releases and recognize that while people's
feelings will be hurt, you have to continue with what is necessary
to ensure a permanent peace,'' said Peter Mandelson, Britain's
senior official in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ''I do not pretend that I can even begin to
comprehend the pain the victims and their families must feel at
moments like these.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of ''the Troubles,'' the Maze prison housed 1,700
prisoners. Friday's mass release will reduce the population to just
16 inmates, ineligible for early parole because their paramilitary
groups have not called truces.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, those men will finish their sentences or be
transferred to one of Northern Ireland's other two prisons, leaving
the Maze ''to be mothballed for contingency purposes,'' said prison
service spokesman Mark McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1976, the facility southwest of Belfast evolved into a
most unusual penal institution, with various paramilitary
organizations grouped in individual wings and given considerable
latitude in running their fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere on earth is there a prison like this -- such a
concentration of bombers, killers, terrorist tacticians under one
roof,'' Adam Ingram, the British government's security minister,
said after one visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was street violence incited by inmate protests -- including a
1981 hunger strike that ended with the deaths of Bobby Sands and
nine IRA comrades -- that nudged British authorities toward
eventually loosening the prison's rules, despite the hardcore
population.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, cell doors have not been locked, and guards cannot
search the segregated wings without giving a day's advance warning.
Prisoners with 10 years under their belts get to go home at
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The early paroles began mere months after the striking of the
peace accord, at all three Northern Ireland prisons. After Friday's
completion, only slightly more Catholic prisoners will have gained
release than Protestant inmates.
</P>
<P>
   That still doesn't appease a number of Protestant politicians,
who complain paramilitary groups on both sides of the divide are
reaping the benefits of the peace agreement without being forced to
give up their weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are being released onto the streets and are as armed to
the teeth as they were before,'' said Ian Paisley Jr. of the
Democratic Unionist Party, a hard-line party bitterly opposed to
the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Although the IRA has not turned over any of its weapons to an
independent disarmament commission, the outlawed group agreed in
May to allow two international observers to periodically inspect
its hidden arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for the British government to restore powers to
Northern Ireland's fledgling Protestant-Catholic government,
suspended due to a deadlock over the IRA's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the victims' relatives, it is hope for a lasting
peace -- buttressed by the local government's resumption -- that
allows them to come to grips with seeing those who killed their
loved ones go free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be bitter about this thing,'' said Roddy
Hackett, whose brother, Dermot, was shot to death by Stone in a
separate 1987 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing that would annoy me is if peace didn't come and
these people were allowed to walk about,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party said the
completion of the early releases marks another turning point for
the province, which has seen more than 3,300 people die in
sectarian-related violence over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who are
alive that might be dead were it not for changing circumstances in
Northern Ireland,'' said the Protestant politician, himself once
imprisoned for possessing weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week, for the first time in my lifetime, there will be no
political prisoners in Northern Ireland,'' Ervine said. ''Now, that
has got to be a watershed.''

<HEADLINE> German Paper Gives Up 'New' German  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- After a year of using the government's
new, sleeker method of writing German, one of Germany's most
respected newspapers says it's giving up and returning to the old
way of writing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ''essential goals'' for reforming German,
including an improved command of the language among the public and
more uniformity in writing, ''have not been achieved,'' the
publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of Germans use the new rules -- breaking up
Germany's famously long compound nouns, eliminating many comma
rules and getting rid of the old German letter for double ''s,''
which resembles a capital ''B'' -- at home. Many book publishers
have ignored the new rules, and media outlets adopt their own style
rules anyway, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is set to abandon the new language Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of German-speaking countries agreed in 1996 to changes
intended to simplify what Mark Twain once dubbed ''The Awful German
Language.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch was unpopular with many intellectuals and ordinary
Germans alike, who tried and failed to block it in court.
</P>
<P>
   The German Academy for Language and Literature, which considers
many of the new rules ''absurd, contradictory and unclear,''
welcomed the paper's decision and called on the multinational
commission overseeing the reform to begin ''dismantling'' the
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the Culture and Education Ministry in Hesse state, where
Frankfurt is located, said that although Minister Karin Wolff
doesn't like all the changes herself, the reform should be
considered final, at least as far as teaching in the schools is
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider the discussion closed,'' spokeswoman Ute Primavesi
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the commission and Duden, publisher of Germany's
most authoritative dictionary, denied a report that said they had
begun to secretly reform the reform.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairman Gerhard Augst said experts were not due to
present a report on whether German-speakers had taken to the
changes until 2005 at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Talks Needed More Time  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said the two-week Middle
East summit that collapsed without an Israeli-Palestinian peace
deal was not long enough to solve the question of the fate of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced that if the issue is preserving the fundamental
interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis and the genuine
sanctity of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish interests in the Holy
City, then I think we can do that,'' Clinton said during a question
and answer session with reporters Wednesday. ''We couldn't do it in
the 15 days we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the summit's inconclusive end, Clinton also gave a
blunt assessment of the choice now before the leaders of both
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision that will have to be made is whether there is a
way ... for the Palestinians to win their fundamental interests
without also winning the right to say they routed the Israelis, or
whether there is a way for the Israelis to protect their
fundamental interests without also winning the right to say they
have stuck it to the Palestinians,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there is, and we're going to explore how we might
persuade them -- all of them -- where we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Camp David summit leaves Israel and the
Palestinians facing a round of tough new decisions about when -- or
whether -- to return to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, meanwhile, faces renewed
political infighting at home and a drive by his right-wing
opponents to force early elections -- a move that could put
peacemaking on the back burner for months.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Israel on Wednesday, he told ministers and family
members that he had gone to Camp David knowing there could never be
''peace at any price, but also no peace without paying a certain
price -- a price that is heart-rending and difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say in anguish that we have not yet succeeded,''
Barak said, ''because we did not find a partner that was prepared
for hard decisions on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks drew an immediate retort from Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat, who told CNN: ''Mr. Barak knows very well that we have
come a long way. Assigning blame will not serve any purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was heading into consultations
with other Arab leaders, trying to forge a consensus on whether
Palestinians should consider accepting some form of control in Arab
neighborhoods of east Jerusalem. That is more than Israel has ever
offered before, but falls short of Palestinians' long-standing
sovereignty demands.
</P>
<P>
   As he returned home to the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, thousands of
Palestinians gave him a hero's welcome, praising him for his tough
stand on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat is no longer just a Palestinian leader,'' said Selim
Hashen. ''He is a leader of all the Arabs and all the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Peaceful marches in support of Arafat were held in the West Bank
cities of Ramallah and Jennin, and in the divided city of Hebron,
stores were closed during a two-hour commercial strike in support
of the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week summit punctuated by moments of high drama,
repeated walkout threats by both sides and a premature U.S.
declaration last week that the summit was dead and finished, the
ending was both sudden and somber.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't get there; that's the truth,'' Clinton said
simply, announcing that the two sides could not come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   The chief cause of the breakdown, all sides said, was Jerusalem,
which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they both remain committed to peace,'' the president
said of his summit partners, Barak and Arafat. ''I think they both
will find a way to get there if they don't let time run away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said there might be an attempt by the
parties to regroup sometime in August. Barak, though, told
reporters that ''I cannot know whether there will be another summit
before September.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry said ''the
fact that the sides for the first time directly discussed all
aspects of the final status'' and agreed to continue efforts to
find agreement was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The summit-goers did not leave completely empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations said in a statement they intended ''to continue
their efforts to conclude an agreement on all permanent status
issues as soon as possible.'' But no timetable was set; Barak said
it was important for both his own team and the Palestinians to go
home and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations also said they understood the importance of
avoiding unilateral actions -- seen as an implicit pledge by Arafat
not to declare a Palestinian state outside of negotiations with
Israel. That helps defuse what had been a potential showdown on
Sept. 13, when a deadline set by the two sides for reaching an
accord expires.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit, the Palestinians said they would declare
statehood then, treaty or no treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if the Palestinians intended to go ahead and
declare a state on that date, Erekat said, ''We hope by that time
we have reached an agreement with the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture to Arafat, the statement said the only path to
peace was resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council after
Middle East wars in 1967 and 1973. These call for Israel to
relinquish territory won from the Arabs in exchange for secure
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top Arafat aide, blamed Barak for the
failure, saying he entered the talks with an inflexible list of
''no's.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli position was the cause of failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, though, put the blame squarely on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's painful to realize the other side is not ripe for
peace,'' he told reporters before flying back to Israel.

<HEADLINE> 'Spinning Into Butter': Race Focus  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Daniels, the dean of students at a
picture-perfect New England college, is white, well-meaning and
liberal. She also is a closet bigot.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact revealed with unnerving frankness in the second act
of ''Spinning Into Butter,'' Rebecca Gilman's disquieting,
ambitious drama about race that is anything but black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which opened Wednesday at Lincoln Center's Mitzi
Newhouse Theater, deals fitfully with this explosive dichotomy. The
woman is the play's one fully developed character, and oddly
enough, its most sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed with quivering sensitivity by Hope Davis, Sarah really
wants to help the school's few minority students. She supports a
young man who could lose a scholarship after demanding to be called
Nuyorican rather than Puerto Rican on the application. And, in the
play's main conflict, she is there for a black student who is the
victim of a series of hate letters pinned on his dormitory door.
</P>
<P>
   These hate notes galvanize school officials, who schedule
discussion groups and forums on race that satisfy their own needs
to do something rather than focus on the concerns of the college's
minority students. ''I want a 10-point plan with specific, concrete
suggestions that don't involve a lot of funding but will have a
great impact,'' one administrator tells Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   The dean finds her efforts to help increasingly stymied -- by her
colleagues and by the black student, a character, who, by the way,
never appears in the play. Late in Act 2, the woman confronts her
own prejudices and vows to eradicate them. ''The transformation,''
she calls it: ''Where you think you're not a racist and then you
learn how you are racist. And you stop being a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's most startling scene, the frustrated Sarah
pours out her bitter feelings to a shocked colleague. It's a litany
of racist thoughts, revealing, among other things, the woman's
method of determining who she will sit next to on a subway train, a
hierarchy determined by skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah also talks about once teaching at an all-black school
where now she doesn't remember the good students, only ''the awful
ones because they dominated the landscape.'' And the litany goes
on.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright seems to suggest that for Sarah, the admission of
her feelings is a start, a beginning to confronting her prejudices.
The other characters on stage are not as perceptive.
</P>
<P>
   They react with Keystone Kops clumsiness to the attack on the
black student, who in one of the notes is compared to Little Black
Sambo. The administrators are irritated at their own ineptness, as
well as by the lack of appreciation for their efforts. They compare
themselves to the tigers in the Sambo tale, who chased each other
so furiously that they became a yellow blur, spinning themselves
into butter.
</P>
<P>
   It is in these secondary characters that ''Butter'' falters.
They are not as well-crafted, appearing more as viewpoints rather
than as real people, and stand in vivid contrast to the
self-reflective, fully formed Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Director Daniel Sullivan handles the explosive material with
restraint, played out, as it were, in the most genteel of settings:
designer John Lee Beatty's comfortable, book-lined academic office.
</P>
<P>
   The production has been unevenly cast. Henry Strozier and Brenda
Wehle as the two administrators, the drama's nominal villains, give
hammy, too-knowing performances that seem to be playing to the
audience rather than to the other characters.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman injects an unconvincing romantic subplot into the
proceedings, giving Sarah an unhappy affair with an art instructor,
played by the amiable Daniel Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   There is nice work by Jai Rodriguez as the defiant, would-be
scholarship student and Steven Pasquale as a slick
lawyer-in-training, whose motivation for starting something called
Students for Tolerance is not exactly pristine.
</P>
<P>
   Matt DeCaro, the one holdover from the play's previous
production at Chicago's Goodman Theater, brings some humor to his
role as a common-sense security guard, a man who seems to know more
than all the academics put together.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman is a promising writer, and one looks forward to her next
play, ''Boy Gets Girl,'' scheduled for a viewing later in the year
at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club. The playwright has a
flair for the theatrical and for sturdy dialogue, not to mention
controversial subjects.
</P>
<P>
   More important, with ''Spinning Into Butter,'' she has created a
fascinating central character whose all too human and imperfect
views make an audience think -- and then ponder again -- long after
the curtain has come down.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Janet Jackson  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's something so sweet about Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's that huge smile that lights up her face. Or maybe
it's because Jackson is shy. Really shy. She admits to being a
little nervous, which is evident by how straight she's sitting and
how quickly she answers questions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's very endearing.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that when the people behind ''Nutty Professor
II: The Klumps'' were looking for a love interest for gentle,
oversized professor Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy), they thought of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the younger sister of pop star Michael Jackson, has
sold more than 40 million recordings. She made her feature film
debut in 1993's ''Poetic Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   She was asked to audition twice for the role of professor Denise
Gaines. At one point, she thought, '''Oh, they don't want me,' and
I really wanted it because it's so different from 'Justice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy plays Sherman, four members of the Klump family and
Sherman's alter ego Buddy Love. Jackson was already a big fan of
the Klumps from the brief appearances they made at a family meal in
''The Nutty Professor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends and I, we do the dinner table scene,'' she said.
''I had to be grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she believe it's difficult for people to separate Janet the
singer from the characters she plays?
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times in thinking I might be right for something that
does appear,'' the 34-year-old singer said. ''And I think that's
why they had me audition twice for 'Nutty.' They just wanted to
make sure that people would believe that this woman could be in
love with Sherman and would separate the singer from the person on
the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   1. You've already got a HUGE musical career. Why get back into
acting?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Because I have a passion for it. I love it as I do
singing, it just took a back seat. I really want to get back.
</P>
<P>
   2. What was it like working with Eddie Murphy?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Awesome. He's such a gentleman, such an incredible
actor. I loved it, I really loved going to work. I had the best
time. I really truly did not want this experience to end, that's
how much fun I was having, and I started counting the days because
eventually I knew it would be just a memory.
</P>
<P>
   3. Were you able to forget it was him underneath all those
characters?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: When you would first come on the set, it was definitely
Eddie in makeup and costume and that famous laugh, but the minute
the cameras were rolling ... he just brought each and every
character to life the way you see them onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   4. Who is your favorite Klump?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Granny. She reminds me very much of my grandmother when
she was here, that feistiness, always having something smart to say
but yet ... the love is there, regardless of all the saucy remarks
grandma makes, the love is there. You can see it, you can sense it,
that's the way my grandmother was, she had that life in her.
</P>
<P>
   5. Whose idea was it to put you on the soundtrack?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Mine. They offered me the part in the film, so I
offered to do a song. I didn't know if they wanted me to or not,
but I enjoyed the first soundtrack so much, I had wanted to be a
part of that as well. ... I thought, 'Is this kind of tacky to ask
if I can be on the soundtrack?' But I was glad they said yes.

<HEADLINE> Six Deaths Attributed to E. Coli  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Six people died from E. coli bacteria that
contaminated the drinking water of a southern Ontario town in May,
according to a coroner's report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario chief coroner's office said the outbreak -- the worst
known E. coli contamination in North America -- killed four people
and contributed to the deaths of two others, who succumbed to other
diseases. The cause of a seventh death could not be determined due
to insufficient evidence, the coroner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   First detected by the town's water utility in mid-May, the
outbreak sickened an estimated 2,000 people. Walkerton's five
schools were closed and the 5,000 residents have been forced to
boil or add chlorine to tap water before drinking it, or rely on
bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's report studied 21 deaths that may have been caused
by E. coli, an intestinal bacterium that causes cramps, fever,
nausea and diarrhea, and can lead to kidney failure in extreme
cases.
</P>
<P>
   It ruled 14 of the deaths were unrelated to the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's findings, local officials and media reports
had settled on seven as the likely number of deaths caused by the
contamination. The seven suspected victims were identified as six
older adults and a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's statement Wednesday did not reveal the identities
of the six people killed by E. coli. Most of the critically ill
from the Walkerton contamination were elderly adults and young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Further details were withheld pending the release of the full
coroner's report at a public inquiry. The judge conducting the
inquiry began a series of informal meetings Wednesday with
residents of Walkerton, 90 miles west of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A boil order has remained in effect more than two months, and
local officials say it will be weeks before tap water is safe to
drink. Efforts to flush lingering bacteria out of the town's water
pipes revealed the need to replace more than two miles of piping.

By The Associated Press	   Capsule reviews of selected films:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' -- She is an American original, this
Tammy Faye Bakker -- for better and for worse, an utterly unique
vessel that contains the strange stew of celebrity, spirituality
and sin we have come to expect from our fallen icons in recent
decades. Who better, then, to focus upon than the face that
launched 1,000 quips? That's the mission of a new documentary, and
it doesn't disappoint. Narrated by RuPaul, it's a festival of
weirdness on an impressively documentarian level, and it offers a
dead-on look at Tammy Faye without ever poking fun at her. PG-13.
79 min.

   ''The Girl on the Bridge'' -- Vanessa Paradis gives a mesmerizing
performance in Patrice Leconte's film about the relationship
between a suicidal French girl and a knife thrower. And it's a
comedy! Paradis plays Adele, a depressed young woman standing on
the edge of a bridge over the Seine when knife thrower Gabor
(Daniel Auteuil) rescues her and persuades her to be the target in
his act. The two develop a telepathic connection, and the chemistry
between Paradis and Auteuil gives the film sexual tension. Leconte
(''The Hairdresser's Husband,'' ''Ridicule'') seems to borrow
heavily from legendary Italian director Federico Fellini, but it
works. R. 88 min. In French, Italian and Greek with English
subtitles.

   ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' -- This sequel to Eddie
Murphy's monster 1996 hit is one big fat mess, and that has nothing
to do with the oversized girth of its main characters. What weighs
this movie down is weak storyline and juvenile, crude humor. Unlike
the first ''Nutty Professor,'' the follow-up is charmless and even
boring. Although Murphy turns in hilarious performances as various
members of the Klump family, its not enough to carry the movie. And
Janet Jackson, who plays the fiancee of obese scientist Sherman
Klump, adds nothing except pretty scenery. PG-13. 105 min.

   ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' -- Just in time, the cheeky
blue engine arrives in theaters with his enchanting first feature.
Britt Allcroft, who since the 1980s has delighted kids with TV's
''Thomas the Tank Engine &AMP; Friends,'' wrote and directed. Ably
expanding on the ''Thomas'' shorts, this full-length film
supplements the toy trains on the Island of Sodor with
flesh-and-blood actors, including Alec Baldwin (as Shining Time
Station's Mr. Conductor) and Peter Fonda (a melancholy granddad who
needs cheering up). The youngest tot will be tickled by the action
and comedy, while the film's rather complex tale should keep older
kids (and even parents) engaged. There's magic on this rail line,
so take a seat, ride along and enjoy the trip into dream state. G.
89 min.

   ''Wonderland'' -- A gray, damp London fills the screen in
''Wonderland,'' the Michael Winterbottom movie that may be less
ironically titled than it seems. There's no disputing the often
sorrowful, sad lives of its characters, starting with the three
sisters at its center. But without a trace of sentimentality, the
film dares to hint at an innate decency in people that can survive
any amount of drear, even if it comes expressed in nothing more
dramatic than the quintessentially English offer of ''cheese on
toast.'' The talented cast charges up the most potentially mundane
of moments. Special credit to Gina McKee (''Notting Hill''), here
playing a loveless woman who, the script suggests at the end, may
just have struck it lucky. R. 109 min.

By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   American audiences may know the name Vanessa Paradis because
she's Johnny Depp's girlfriend. She gave birth to his daughter last
May and the two are expecting another child later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But after seeing her mesmerizing performance in ''The Girl on
the Bridge,'' they'll know Paradis as an actress, and a talented
one.
</P>
<P>
   Her chemistry with co-star Daniel Auteuil, along with inspired
direction from Patrice Leconte, make ''The Girl on the Bridge'' an
unforgettable film. It's no wonder it was nominated for a Golden
Globe this year for best foreign language film.
</P>
<P>
   Paradis plays a depressed 22-year-old named Adele. When we meet
her, she's confessing her history of lousy luck and abusive
relationships to a woman off-screen. ''My ideas are almost always
bad,'' she says matter-of-factly. ''I never pick the lucky
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she's standing on the edge of a bridge over the Seine, her
hands slowly releasing the railing, when a man named Gabor
(Auteuil) approaches her. He explains that he's a knife thrower,
and he needs a new target for his act. Since she barely values her
life, she'd be a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   She jumps anyway (no spoilers here, folks -- all these details
are in the promotional materials) but Gabor jumps after her, and
rescues her in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Adele is lost and confused. Gabor is manic and erratic. But they
quickly find an easy banter, and the imagery in writer Serge
Frydman's dialogue is great. ''Boys attract me like beautiful
clothes,'' she tells Gabor one day, explaining her propensity for
falling for the wrong men. ''I always want to try them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabor whisks Adele away to Monaco, then to an Italian cruise
ship to perform their act. Through his friendship and a makeover,
she gains confidence. The two discover a telepathic connection, and
their knife-throwing act takes on an intimate, sexual air.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Dreujou's verite camera work makes us feel as if
we're along for the ride, spying on them.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte (''The Hairdresser's Husband,'' ''Ridicule'') seems to
borrow big-time from legendary Italian director Federico Fellini,
but it works. For starters, our main characters are a suicidal girl
and a knife-thrower. They're surrounded at every stop by carnival
freaks -- contortionists, showgirls, midgets spouting geography
trivia. In her feisty, waifish way, Paradis is reminiscent of
Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife of 50 years who starred in many of
his films.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it was Leconte's intention, the fact that the
film is in black and white recalls Fellini, as well. It also
highlights Paradis' imperfect but unique face -- the gap between her
two front teeth, the strong cheekbones, the big, dark eyes (she
also has worked as a Chanel model and a pop singer).
</P>
<P>
   Although the film is surreal, the characters are believable.
Auteuil, who resembles Michael Douglas with his enormous eyes, is
full of surprises. Paradis makes Adele's transformation from
insecure girl to confident young woman fascinating to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Girl on the Bridge'' (''La Fille sur la Pont''), a
Paramount Classics release, is rated R for some sexuality. It is in
French, Italian and Greek with English subtitles. Running time: 88
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Murphy's Back As 'Nutty Professor'  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy's first ''The Nutty Professor'' was filled with
bathroom humor, sexual jokes and cruel insults. Yet despite its
juvenile slant, it came off as a magical and charming film.
</P>
<P>
   The credit for that feat was mostly due to Murphy's critically
acclaimed, Golden Globe-nominated performance as Sherman Klump, a
lovable, obese science professor. But the film was appealing also
because of its underlying theme: that despite one's outward
appearance, it's what lies inside the heart that really counts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what lies inside the heart of ''Nutty Professor
II: The Klumps'' is a bunch of barely amusing jokes. Make no
mistake about it, the movie is one big, fat mess, and that has
nothing to do with the oversized girths of its main characters.
</P>
<P>
   When we last saw Sherman Klump, he had managed to rid himself of
his slim, obnoxious and oversexed alter ego Buddy Love (Murphy),
who came to life after the insecure Klump developed a weight-loss
concoction.
</P>
<P>
   But to Sherman's dismay, he discovers there is still a little
bit of Buddy inside him -- enough to blurt out the crude phrase,
''Let me put beef in your taco!'' -- putting a serious crimp in his
new relationship with professor Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson).
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to remove the last bit of Buddy, Sherman goes to
the lab once again. Although he succeeds in getting the Buddy gene
removed from his body, it becomes an entirely separate person, who
finds a way to make even more trouble for Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Back for the sequel is the Klump clan -- lovable Mama, irascible
Papa, dimwitted brother Ernie and horny Granny -- all played by
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Murphy dazzles under mounds of prosthetic makeup to
become the Klumps, giving each character such distinct flair that
you forget they are played by the same person. The interplay
between them is also seamless, helping sustain the illusion of
separate people.
</P>
<P>
   The character likely to get the most laughs is Granny, who is
always looking to score -- even with Buddy Love. The sight of
semitoothless Granny giving Buddy some tongue action is both
stomach-turning and hilarious. Also entertaining are Granny's
verbal jabs at Sherman's father, as she taunts him about his
impotence and threatens him with violence: ''Boy, would I love to
throw some hot grease on you.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the expanded roles of the Klumps, the film drags,
primarily because the plot is so weak.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jackson's performance as Gaines is not impressive.
Unlike Jada Pinkett's portrayal of Carla Purty, which added real
spark to the first ''Nutty Professor,'' Jackson's performance is
one-dimensional and bland.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who appeared in the 1993 flop ''Poetic Justice,'' has
two expressions: a bright smile and a look of anxiety. While it
would be difficult for the most experienced actress to steal a
scene from Murphy's multiple characters, Jackson is merely a pretty
prop. At a recent screening, the audience reacted to her only when
she wore something that revealed her ample bosom -- and that
reaction was laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' a Universal picture, is
rated PG-13 for crude humor, sexual references and foul language.
The running time is 1 hour and 45 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Girlfriend Sues Kid Rock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Kid Rock is fighting a lawsuit brought by an
ex-girlfriend who says the rapper lied about her in a song and
damaged her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Russell, the mother of Kid Rock's son, said the song
''Black Chic, White Guy'' on his best-selling 1998 album ''contains
several graphic, inflammatory, untrue, hurtful remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Russell and Kid Rock were scheduled to meet
Thursday to discuss witnesses in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The song described a woman who was promiscuous, had three
children with three men, was beaten by a drug-dealing boyfriend and
''had no man, no money and no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants said they told the truth and did not name
Russell. A Kid Rock lawyer said he is confident the case will be
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Russell did not specify how much money she is seeking. The
lawsuit also names Atlantic Records, and Spin and Rolling Stone
magazines, which wrote about their relationship.

<HEADLINE> Bio of Bob Dylan  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth, Minn., on May 24, 1941,
Bob Dylan grew up in nearby Hibbing. By age 12, he had learned to
play guitar and harmonica, and a few years later, he was
accompanying himself on piano. He left high school to ''follow
Little Richard,'' according to a note he wrote in his yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan gleaned his musical skills playing in local bands, and in
1959 struck out for New York City to visit the ailing Woody
Guthrie. There, he found fertile ground for his music in the
Greenwich Village folk clubs. By 1961 he had recorded his debut
album. ''Bob Dylan'' was a bare-bones collection of traditional
folk songs that featured his guitar and harmonica virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'60s, his albums ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,''
''Bringing It All Back Home'' and ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' had
brought him to the forefront of the U.S. and British folk scenes.
While the Beatles promoted his work, Peter, Paul and Mary scored
big hits with covers of ''Blowin' in the Wind'' and ''Don't Think
Twice, It's Alright,'' as did the Byrds with ''Mr. Tambourine
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he released ''Highway 61 Revisited'' -- to date, still
one of the most critically acclaimed rock albums -- which featured
the classic ''Like a Rolling Stone.'' He followed that up a year
later with ''Blonde on Blonde,'' which included ''Rainy Day Women
12 and 35,'' best known for the refrain, ''Everybody must get
stoned!''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in July
1966 and led a reclusive and relatively inactive life the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   His next album ''John Wesley Harding'' -- released during a
period when psychedelic music and British bands dominated the
popular music scene -- was a minimalist, country sound. In 1969 he
followed that up with ''Nashville Skyline,'' which featured a duet
with Johnny Cash on ''Girl From the North Country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '70s, '80s and '90s, Dylan recorded several classic
albums, including ''Blood on the Tracks,'' ''Street Legal,'' ''Shot
of Love'' and ''Time Out of Mind.'' He continued to perform before
sellout audiences, and toured and recorded with Tom Petty and the
Grateful Dead.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Producer Receives Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark Burnett is trying to be a survivor of
alleged e-mail threats by getting a restraining order against an
irate viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Survivor'' producer received the threats from a woman who
was angry about an episode that featured participants, stranded on
an island, eating rats, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zona, a psychiatrist who filed a declaration supporting
Burnett's successful restraining order request, said Donna
LaPerch's message read: ''Thankfully, there are people out there
who have no qualms about (vengeance) against those who profit and
glorify from the deaths of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The restraining order bans LaPerch from following or contacting
Burnett or distributing information about how to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from LaPerch. Calls to a horse
ranch that she is believed to be associated with were not returned
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iron Maiden Brings Heavy Metal Back  </HEADLINE>
By GERARD O'LEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although Iron Maiden wants to reclaim the title
of ''heavy metal gods,'' don't expect the swashbuckling Brits to
fit into the rock industry's ''flavor of the month'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iron Maiden writes songs that our fans enjoy,'' explained lead
singer Bruce Dickinson in a recent interview. ''We're not going to
compromise our sound to try to fit into the trend that's popular
today and then gone tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Brave New World'' (Columbia) brings the group back to its
vintage roots, from the opening power chord of ''Wicker Man'' to
the intricate time changes of ''Ghost of the Navigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Kevin Shirley, who has worked with Aerosmith and the
Black Crowes, was the catalyst for Iron Maiden's return to its
original style.
</P>
<P>
   ''The album captures the essence of the Maiden sound,''
Dickinson said. ''Kevin Shirley has gotten the band to sound like
it sounds in a room or rehearsal studio playing live. ... Iron
Maiden is a live band, and Kevin brought us back to it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said ''Brave New World'' is Iron Maiden's best work
since the 1983 album ''Piece of Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The chemistry for this album blended perfectly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iron Maiden enjoyed its biggest success in the 1980s with
Dickinson; guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray; bassist and
founding member Steve Harris; and drummer Nicko McBrain. This is
the band's current lineup, plus guitarist Janick Gers.
</P>
<P>
   The band toured nonstop, topping the British album chart in 1982
with ''The Number of the Beast.'' Because of the album's title
track, about the Antichrist, the band was falsely tagged as a
satanic group, a label it has shed over the years by avoiding such
topics.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the '80s, Maiden pumped out hit after hit, including
''The Trooper,'' ''Flight of Icarus,'' ''Wasted Years'' and the fan
favorite ''2 Minutes to Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's popularity grew when it began incorporating
synthesizers into its sound. In 1988, the album ''Seventh Son of a
Seventh Son'' confirmed Iron Maiden's position as Britain's top
metal act.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson left in 1993 to pursue a solo career. He returned last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Journalists ask me if I think I saved Maiden, but I tell them
that's not why I'm here,'' he said. ''Maiden was doing fine without
me. There is an energy and vibe that didn't exist before, but I'm
not here to save Maiden because then it's destined to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   All the stops on the 1999 summer tour sold out, something that
hadn't happened in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tour was the best tour I have ever had,'' Dickinson said.
''It was one of the few tours I just did not want to end. The
energy and the vibe flowed right into rehearsal for the new
album.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Brave New World'' debuted in the top 40 on the U.S. chart,
then quickly slid off the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't judge our success or failure on the number of units
we sell in America,'' he said. ''This band does good business in
other parts of the world, like Brazil, Japan and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron Maiden begins a U.S. tour in August, including a
performance at New York's Madison Square Garden (Aug. 5), which
sold out in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sold out the Garden before, but never this quick,''
Dickinson said. ''We were told that the demand was immense, so we
will try to head back to New York before the end of the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the band's legacy?
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had fans come up to me and tell me that they've had
life-changing experiences listening to Maiden,'' said Dickinson
with a smile. ''It makes you think how special this band is.''

30-Aug. 5:
<TEXT>
<P>
   45 years ago: Alfred Hitchcock's ''To Catch a Thief'' premiered
at a theater in Philadelphia. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, the stars
of the film, attended.
</P>
<P>

''Double Fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pink Floyd began a five-night engagement at Earls Court

<HEADLINE> Nashville Star Wagoner Releases CD  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- When Grand Ole Opry star Porter Wagoner
contacted Dolly Parton recently, he was looking for a little
affirmation from his former '60s duet partner.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner had just completed his first album in two decades. He
wanted Parton's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know each other probably as well as two people can know
each other,'' he said. ''I thought she'd give me an honest
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parton responded by sending him a long letter, praising the
album as ''by far the best thing you've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to call the new CD ''The Best I've Ever Been,'' which
marks his debut on Shell Point Records.
</P>
<P>
   The album could help revive Wagoner's artistic reputation. The
72-year-old singer has become better-known for his rhinestone suits
and showmanship than for his music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to show you what a great singer I am. I just
want to show you what I've been getting away with for all these
years,'' jokes Wagoner from the stage of the Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   But Wagoner has a long list of hits -- including country music
classics ''A Satisfied Mind,'' ''Green, Green Grass of Home'' and
''The Carroll County Accident'' -- that would be the envy of most
Nashville artists,
</P>
<P>
   Like his old hits, Wagoner's new material is simple musically.
The narratives are straightforward, with an occasional surprising
lyrical twist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ''Green, Green Grass of Home,'' it is revealed
that the story about a happy homecoming is the dream of a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   On the new ''I Knew This Day Would Come,'' a young woman leaves
her aging husband for a young lover, only to find herself in the
same situation years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Country audiences don't want to have something so complicated
it takes a German scientist to figure out what ... you're trying to
say to them,'' Wagoner said. ''Good country music is kind of like
getting a straight, honest answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner was raised in West Plains, Mo. His first hit was
''Company's Comin''' in 1954. His career took off six years later
when he became the host of his own syndicated TV show, which ran
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He promoted his records to a weekly audience that grew to 3
million homes at its peak in the 1970s. The show was also a
springboard for Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and other newcomers
on the country music scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, he was joined by Norma Jean, whose hits
included ''Go Cat Go'' and ''I Wouldn't Buy a Used Car From Him.''
Parton replaced her in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Parton and Wagoner teamed up on ''Please Don't Stop Loving Me,''
a No. 1 hit in 1974, and other duets. He produced her solo records
until she left in 1976. As her star rose, Wagoner faltered as a
recording star. His last major hit was ''Making Plans,'' a duet
with Parton that was released in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really didn't have any big desire to make another CD during
my career,'' Wagoner said. ''I'd already had a lot of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he settled into the role of elder statesman at the
Grand Ole Opry, the 75-year-old weekly radio program on Nashville's
WSM-AM. Wagoner became the star most associated with the show after
Roy Acuff's death in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner decided to do the new album after receiving a tape
cassette with 22 songs from Missouri farmer Damon Black. The two
men had known one another 25 years earlier, when Black was a
struggling songwriter in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Black had recently made millions selling land to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ''So he told his wife, 'I'm going to do what I want to do now,
which is write a CD for Porter Wagoner,''' the singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner didn't listen to the cassette for a few days, then put
it on one evening. ''They were the best songs that I'd ever heard
in one group,'' he said. ''I was still listening to them at 4
o'clock the next morning. I listened to them all night long,
starting to learn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner isn't counting on airplay on mainstream country music
radio stations, which have become increasingly youth-oriented. But
he's hoping fans will find him through the Internet and other
alternative outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He's worked the new material into his frequent Grand Ole Opry
performances. The show still reaches a huge audience on AM radio
each Saturday night and with live broadcasts on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having new music seems to have added a kind of youth to my
act,'' Wagoner said. ''Man, with that and Viagra ... I might have a
new career here.''

<HEADLINE> Concorde Engines Are Focus of Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PAM SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French investigators focused Wednesday on the Air
France Concorde's powerful Rolls Royce engines -- one of which was
repaired just before Tuesday's doomed flight -- as the possible
cause of the first-ever Concorde crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Air France said the ''reverse thruster'' of
engine No. 2 of the doomed plane was inoperative on its return from
New York on Monday. Such thrusters are used to slow the plane upon
landing.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute repair was made at the request of the pilot, but
right after take off Tuesday, the same engine was trailing flames.
The pilot made a desperate attempt at an emergency landing before
the plane crashed into a hotel outside Paris, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's statement did not indicate whether the repair
could have led to the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fushelberger, a spokesman for Rolls Royce in London, said
Wednesday the engine has had an impeccable record since the first
Concorde passenger flights in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''This engine has been in service for 24 years. It has nearly 1
million hours of civil service,'' Fushelberger told The Associated
Press. ''It has an excellent safety record.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the repair to the thruster, Flight AF4590 had been
cleared for departure Tuesday because it still met a technical
level of tolerance allowed by the manufacturer, Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot insisted the problem be fixed. Since a replacement
was not available, workers made the repair using a part from a
backup Concorde, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 56 seconds after takeoff, the control tower alerted
the pilot that the back of the plane was on fire, chief
investigator Elisabeth Senot said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot replied that he had trouble with engine No. 2, at
which point the flames were rapidly growing, France 2 television
quoted Senot as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot told the tower that he could not stop the flight and
was trying to reach Le Bourget, a nearby airport. ''It is during
this looping maneuver that the aircraft crashed on the hotel in
Gonesse,'' Senot said.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation specialists have identified insufficient thrust and the
configuration of the engines as possible causes of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also noted that the crash came at a time when airplanes
are most vulnerable -- in the air for only a short time, moving
slowing and loaded with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''For any airplane, the absolute worst time you can have
something come unstuck is after takeoff,'' said William Waldock of
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators must determine whether the fire was a symptom or
cause, Waldock said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''An engine failure by itself should not destroy the airplane's
ability to fly,'' he said. ''Usually it has to come together with
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Turcat, the pilot who flew the first test flight of the
Concorde in 1969, said Wednesday he believed the cause of the
accident was ''much more serious'' than just a malfunctioning
engine. He said that mere engine failure could not have caused the
plane to go down.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the wreckage, officials will search for anything that could
have come apart or even if birds flew into the jet. They will try
to piece together whether fuel or hydraulic lines were severed by
pieces from an engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be a problem with insufficient thrust, which
usually means a problem with the engines,'' said Michael Barr,
director of the aviation safety program at the University of
Southern California. ''It appears the airplane stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   A stall occurs when there is insufficient airspeed over the
wings to create the lift that sustains an aircraft's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Concorde flies higher and faster than passenger
jetliners, its four Rolls Royce Olympus engines do not differ
greatly from slower and lower-flying models on other commercial
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is the only commercial jetliner to use
afterburners, which provide extra thrust. Afterburners, which are
typically found on fighters, mix warm air and fuel in the tailpipe
of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   At supersonic speeds, air entering the Concorde's engines is
slowed down before it is combined with fuel and combusted for
thrust, like in other commercial jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Concordes take off at subsonic speeds and do not break the speed
of sound until they are over the ocean. Because of their unique
design, they take off faster and steeper than other jets -- a fact
some aviation experts pointed out after Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you build a wing that works well low-speed, it doesn't work
well at high-speed and vice versa,'' Waldock said. ''Some airplane
designs like the F-14, it's a very fast airplane, but to be able to
fly it at low speeds, you have to move the wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Concorde pilot David Brister, who flew the aircraft from
1976 to 1982, said other aspects of its design may have made it
vulnerable to engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde is unusual in that the two engines on each wing are
very close together. Any four-engined aircraft can cope perfectly
well with losing one engine but if two go on the same side you can
be in for a difficult time,'' he said. ''But with Concorde the
engines are so close that it is possible one could affect the other
and then you have a much more serious situation.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 122; Nasdaq Sheds 35  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks traded sharply lower Wednesday on another
batch of disappointing earnings reports and fears that earnings
will shrink in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 122.33 at 10,577.64.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 8.92 at 1,465.55, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 35.19 at 3,994.38.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set long before trading began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Semi-conductor maker LSI Logic Corp. and business software
company BMC Software Inc. announced after the close of trading
Tuesday that second-quarter earnings were below analysts'
expectations. LSI Logic was down $8.875 at $32.125, and BMC
Software fell $1.312 at $17.188.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investors worst fears for the second half of the
year seemed to be confirmed when car maker DaimlerChrysler said
2000 profits would fall below 1999 figures, despite solid
first-half results. In spite of the dismal forecast,
DaimlerChrysler's stock rose $1.188 to $53.438.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Xerox Corp. chairman and chief executive Paul
Allaire said Xerox investors should make a ''significant downward
adjustment to current second-half expectations.'' In otherwords,
earnings will slow over the next six months. The copy machine
maker's shares fell $3.188 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies were among the hardest hit within the broad
technology sector. Vignette Corp. was down $3.875 at $39.75, Rambus
shares were down $10.50 at $74.50. And fiber-optics company SDL
Inc. was down $13.312 to $386.063. Internet stocks were also
pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reaction to weaker-than-expected earnings reports -- a
characteristic of the markets in recent sessions -- is simply
investors reversing course from a rally that followed the broad
selloff in technology stocks earlier this year, said Richard Hoey,
chief economist and chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of companies are beating Wall Street's
expectations, Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little conviction in the market for days and
investors seemed poised to pounce on any news to provide them with
direction -- one way or the other. On Tuesday, stocks rose after
AT&AMP;T and Texas Instruments beat Wall Street earnings forecasts,
giving a boost to the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the trend should continue until more detailed
economic data is released later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 867.75 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 3.31 at 511.02.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Pilot Had Engine Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Reluctant to trust an engine with a broken part,
the pilot of the doomed Air France Concorde delayed his flight for
repairs, a terse airline statement said Wednesday. But minutes
after the work was done, that same engine burst into flame on
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Christian Marty heard from the tower 56 seconds off the
ground Tuesday that he was trailing fire. He wrestled the crippled
supersonic airliner through a tight bank away from the populated
town of Gonesse and to the left toward nearby Le Bourget airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified witnesses below watched the Concorde's distinctive
needle nose point downward. The plane divebombed into a small hotel
in Gonesse. Its 100 tons of fuel exploded in a fiery column with a
mushroom of black smoke, killing all 109 people on board and four
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a day after the spectacular crash just outside
Paris, investigators focused on the repaired engine -- engine No. 2,
located on the plane's left side -- as the likely source of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said the plane had returned from New York on July 24
with broken reverse thrusters on its No. 2 engine. Although this
fell within the manufacturer's technical tolerances, the pilot
ordered the part replaced before he would take off, the airline's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Thrusters, which are used to slow the plane upon landing, were
found from a spare Concorde and the repair was made. A late
connecting flight further delayed takeoff from Charles de Gaulle
airport, the brief Air France communique said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only after the spare part was replaced and the luggage loaded
did the captain make the decision to depart,'' it concluded.
</P>
<P>
   As flames began to spout from his plane, Marty radioed the tower
that his No. 2 engine had failed -- a particularly critical problem
in the Concorde, veteran pilots say, because the swept wing
aircraft has two engines close together under each wing. One is
vulnerable to damage from the other. The veteran Concorde captain
said he was trying to reach Le Bourget, a smaller and more
accessible airport than Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is during this looping maneuver that the aircraft crashed
on the hotel,'' said Elisabeth Senot, the local prosecutor in
charge of the crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As crash details trickled in slowly, authorities ordered all Air
France Concorde flights indefinitely grounded. France remained in
shock at the loss of life in their beloved Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, somber in a dark suit, visited a
community hall near the crash site. His wife, Bernadette, seemed
devastated with grief.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic experts sought to identify the dead, 96 of them Germans
headed to New York for a luxury cruise to the Caribbean and, for
some, on to the Sydney Olympics. Two Danes, an Austrian and an
American -- retired Air France employee Christopher Behrens -- were
also passengers. Nine crew members died, along with four people in
the hotel, including two Polish hotel trainees.
</P>
<P>
   As family members arrived in Paris, German Transport Minister
Reinhard Klimmt and about 50 psychologists worked to console them.
The relatives were kept far from reporters and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in Germany that his nation was
in shock. Pope John Paul II sent condolences.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site, investigators picked carefully through ashes
and rubble for more clues. Two recovered flight recorders were
being examined.
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot told reporters
that he needed to see early results from the official inquiries
before clearing French Concordes for takeoff again.
</P>
<P>
   But British Airways resumed its London-New York Concorde flights
Wednesday after briefly grounding them for safety checks. And
Gayssot said that despite the crash, he still believes the Concorde
has a place in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supersonic technology is still the technology of the future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, requiems have already begun for the money-losing
aircraft which never caught on outside of France and England. In
recent days, engineers in both countries found cracks in the wings
in some of the 13 Concordes in service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Concorde without a doubt died yesterday,'' Le Figaro, a
leading Paris daily, wrote. ''It had just turned 31. For France,
it's a day of mourning. The myth of a beautiful white bird will
remain.''

   This was the first Concorde crash after three decades of
service. The Rolls Royce engines, built for the Concordes in
Bristol, England, have totaled a million hours of flying time,
criss-crossing the Atlantic at 1,350 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fushelberger, a spokesman for Rolls Royce in London, said
Wednesday the engine has functioned without trouble since the first
Concorde passenger flights in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''This engine has been in service for 24 years,'' Fushelberger
said. ''It has an excellent safety record.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Marty, known for skill and prudence as a pilot, was also a
popular sportsman. He set a world windsurf record in 1982, crossing
the Atlantic from Dakar, Senegal, to French Guiana in 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, residents praised the pilot as a hero who saved
uncounted lives in their town of 23,000 near Charles de Gaulle
airport, nine miles from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''We avoided catastrophe thanks to the pilot's presence of
mind,'' Mayor Pierre Blazy said, explaining that the plane turned
just before it reached the hospital and the town beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Father Claude Porcheron, a local priest, also said he believed
the pilot made a last-gasp attempt to save lives. ''It was the most
beautiful act in the world,'' he said, tears welling in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Near the demolished Hotelissimo, prayers of thanks were fervent.
A group of 45 Polish tourists had left for a day of sightseeing.
They returned to find smouldering ashes in a wheatfield where their
rooms had been.

<P>
   Almost as many teen-agers from southeastern England never made
it to the hotel. Their bus got stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Brookings, a 21-year-old Cambridge student, made it on
time from England and was on the phone to her sister when the plane
fell. She opened the door to a wall of flame, then leaped back
across her bed and jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heat was amazing,'' she said. ''It was an oven.''

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Asked to Fortify Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the time of the presidential runoff in Peru
two months ago, the Clinton administration was contemplating
sanctions against the government of President Alberto Fujimori
because of perceived flaws in its election process.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, as Fujimori prepares to be sworn in Friday for
a third term, the administration is no longer weighing such action,
but rather is asking Peruvian authorities to do better next time.
On this, there appears to be a consensus among the hemispheric
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   While evading sanctions, Fujimori nonetheless has lost some
stature among his peers as a result of his handling of the May 28
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Only two foreign presidents -- Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador and Hugo
Banzer of Bolivia -- are expected to show up for the inaugural,
compared with the nine who attended the last one. Most countries,
the United States included, will be represented by their
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason the Clinton administration backed away from
sanctions was the absence of support among other countries in the
34-member Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the OAS has been leaning on Peru to ensure that the
electoral process is freer and fairer the next time. There likely
won't be a next time for Fujimori, who will have served 15 years as
president by the end of his third term.
</P>
<P>
   But he has in hand a list of OAS demands for cleansing the
electoral process, including the establishment of an independent
judiciary and reforms aimed at curbing abuses of the intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker reaffirmed Wednesday
the U.S. view that the May 28 runoff failed to meet internationally
recognized standards.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the United States will ''work with the Fujimori
government as long as it meets its commitment to the OAS to reform
democracy and strengthen democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For a hemisphere striving to be free of authoritarians, Fujimori
has been a problem. He shut down the Congress and the Supreme Court
in 1992. And he flouted the constitution by seeking a third term;
the legal maximum is two.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori says the two-term restriction, passed in 1993, should
not apply to him, since he was first elected in 1990. Many
Peruvians disagree.
</P>
<P>
   He also has taken steps to silence media critics, which earned
him a place this year as one of 10 ''enemies of the press''
worldwide, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But he also boasts a string of accomplishments. Terrorist rebel
groups have been tamed under his rule, and the economy has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   He has won the gratitude of the United States as perhaps its
most effective regional partner in the fight against drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said threats in the U.S. Congress to cut assistance to
Peru because of electoral impurities will not influence his
determination to continue the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he said Russian jet fighters purchased for possible
deployment against sometime rival Ecuador will be used in the
anti-narcotics struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The main criticism of the runoff was based on the introduction
of new software for a computerized vote count just days before the
balloting. The OAS election observer mission asked for a delay in
the referendum so it could test the reliability of the new system.
Peruvian authorities rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pushed for sanctions, but other OAS
countries noted that Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate,
had already dropped out of the race, citing concerns about
fairness, before the flap over the software had surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's decision in effect left Fujimori without a challenger
and thus made the doubts about software reliability almost
irrelevant. This reduced any enthusiasm the OAS may have had for
imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say sanctions remain a possibility
if Fujimori spurns the OAS-backed reforms. The first test of
Fujimori's good will, they say, could come next month.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Get Different Welcome  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Yasser Arafat returned from Camp David on
Wednesday to a garland of flowers and crowds of chanting
supporters, thanking him for not trading away their claim to
Jerusalem. Ehud Barak returned to a starkly different landscape:
political uncertainty and a people bitterly divided over his peace
moves.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the summit collapsed, the contrast between the
immediate futures the two men face could be seen in their
expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader flashed the victory sign as he stepped
off his plane, then grinned broadly as he accepted kisses from
ministers and a necklace of yellow-and-white flowers from a young
girl. The Israeli prime minister smiled quickly and tightly as he
greeted members of his government, including Foreign Minister David
Levy, who'd embarrassed him by refusing to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Their words indicated that if it was tough to bridge their
differences while closeted in the mountains of Maryland, it would
be much more so back home.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat lost no time telling his people what they wanted to hear:
No matter what the Israelis want, Jerusalem would one day be the
Palestinians' capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the real and honest expression of the Palestinian
people,'' Arafat said. ''Whether they (the Israelis) like it or
not, whether they want it or not. And if they don't like it, they
can go to Sea of Gaza and drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, lost no time explaining what -- and who -- he
felt caused the summit to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He'd gone to Camp David, he said in an airport speech, knowing
there could never be ''peace at any price, but also no peace
without paying a certain price -- a price that is heart-rending and
difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say in anguish that we have not yet succeeded,''
Barak said, ''because we did not find a partner that was prepared
for hard decisions on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports said Barak was willing to give Palestinians some form of
control in parts of Arab east Jerusalem -- further than Israel had
ever gone, but not enough for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Arafat arrived, thousands of Palestinians lined the
streets of Gaza City, some dancing and singing nationalist songs,
all in praise of Arafat for not having traded away his people's
claim to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are following Arafat on the way to Jerusalem,'' read
banners along the streets. Many chanted: ''We are ready to give our
soul and our blood to our great hero!''
</P>
<P>
   Selim Hashem, 21, said Arafat was a hero because he refused to
give in to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat is no longer just a Palestinian leader,'' said Hashem,
who carried a pistol at his side. ''He is a leader of all the Arabs
and all the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also pro-Arafat demonstrations in West Bank cities
like Ramallah and Bethlehem, and by Palestinians in Lebanon's
largest refugee camp, Ein al-Hilweh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Arafat, under whom domestic political opposition is
extremely rare, much less criticism in his national media, Barak
faced the immediate task of tending to his image -- and downplaying
perceptions he'd been willing to hand over too much.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly stressed how he'd worked at Camp David not to
weaken Israel and its claim on Jerusalem, but to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the names of Israeli peacemakers before him, including
the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, Barak said he ''went to try
and strengthen our capital in Jerusalem, to expand it and ground it
for generations with a pronounced Jewish majority.''
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the peace process that began with the 1993
Oslo accords appeared uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat suggested another summit could be held, perhaps before
the Sept. 13 deadline he has fixed for declaration of an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Top Israeli negotiator Shlomo Ben Ami, asked whether another
summit is likely, said he didn't know, but that ''I think we came
very close to a solution to the conflict at this summit, and we
must not let this chance slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower-level contacts were beginning immediately. Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh was meeting with top Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel
Rahim on Wednesday evening, to discuss how to prevent an upsurge of
post-summit violence.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, the immediate task was to save his government, in
tatters after some coalition partners deserted him on the eve of
the summit. What's more, he faced a potentially fatal Knesset vote
Aug. 2 on a bill to dissolve the legislature and hold new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   His options: try to woo back his wary coalition partners, mainly
the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which tends to be moderate on peace
issues; form a national unity government with the hard-line
opposition Likud party; or opt for the risky course of new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely, analysts felt, was the first -- but like all the
options, it wasn't going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is perhaps why Barak said his first priority was sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a week, I'm going to sleep like a human
being,'' he said, after addressing a throng of supporters outside
his home. ''And then we'll see.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Arms Treaty Allows Radar  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Administration lawyers agree that President
Clinton could approve the first steps toward building a national
missile defense without violating a 1972 arms control treaty,
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' interpret the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty as
allowing preliminary construction work on a new X-band radar -- a
critical piece of a national missile defense -- on Shemya Island,
Alaska, up to the point where rails are laid for placement of the
powerful missile-tracking radar on a concrete pad, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The rails are scheduled to be laid in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not yet accepted his lawyers' analysis. If he does,
it would make it easier for him to give the Pentagon the go-ahead
this year to award contracts for groundbreaking on Shemya, while
letting the next president decide on the more advanced construction
work that would breach the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he expected Clinton to make that decision by
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as a technical breach of the ABM treaty, his decision
in August or September would not constitute that, in our
judgment,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of these decisions is important because the Pentagon
has set a target date of 2005 for having a national missile defense
ready for use. Any delay now would mean missing the target date.
</P>
<P>
   Construction work on Shemya, in the Aleutian Islands, cannot
start until next summer because of weather limitations. The
contractor needs months of lead time because of the remoteness of
Shemya; if Clinton did not give the go-ahead this year, then
construction work on the island could not begin until summer 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which strongly opposes U.S. plans for a national missile
defense, is certain to insist that any construction work on Shemya
would constitute a violation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. critics of national missile defense question the
administration's interpretation of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're moving in the direction of a reinterpretation of
the ABM treaty as meaning construction is not construction, ... I
think that's going to be hard to sustain,'' said Daryl Kimball,
executive director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an
advocacy group opposed to national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has tried unsuccessfully to persuade the
Russians to accept treaty amendments that would permit national
missile defenses. If the Russians continue to resist, then
Clinton's successor would have to decide whether to withdraw from
the treaty or abandon missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said a decision by Clinton to begin the construction work
on Shemya might have the added benefit of moving the Russians
toward an accommodation on the ABM treaty. On the other hand,
awarding the construction contracts this fall would mean the next
administration would have to decide quickly whether to proceed with
the actual work in summer 2001 or to take a different approach to
missile defense, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A consideration will have to be -- by President Clinton --
whether or not this puts any undue pressure on his successor'' to
go forward with the initial construction phases, Cohen told
reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a factor we'll have to measure and weigh,'' said Cohen,
adding that he soon will make a recommendation about whether
Clinton should approve starting construction on Shemya.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - With not one but two minor league baseball
stadiums under construction, the city may soon be trading in its
Big Apple monicker for a new title: the City of Swing.
</P>
<P>
   By this time next year, New York's Major League boys of summer -
the Yankees and Mets - each will have a short-season, class A farm
team playing in spanking new, taxpayer-funded stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   That will make New York the only major league city with two
minor league teams, and Jim Ferguson, a spokesman for Minor League
Baseball, says it's easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most major league teams don't want someone to come in and
operate a minor league park on their turf,'' he said - unless they
own the minor league club, that is. And indeed, Mets owner Fred
Wilpon and Hal Steinbrenner, the son of Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, have financial stakes in the new teams.
</P>
<P>
   Though unique for one city, the two new ball parks are part of a
stadia mania sweeping the country. Since 1985, 91 minor league
parks have been built - with seven opening this year - and that
does not include stadiums built for long-ball, Independent League
teams.
</P>
<P>
   At the groundbreaking for the 6,500-seat Staten Island stadium,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani talked about returning to New York's
baseball glory days when the Brooklyn Dodgers played at Ebbetts
Field and the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds - before both
decamped to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fan Giuliani pushed through the budget $29 million for
the Staten Island Yankee stadium and $30 million for a Mets' minor
league stadium in Brooklyn - raising eyebrows about why the city
was spending so much money essentially on behalf of the Mets and
Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   Including adjacent beautification and redevelopment projects,
the combined price for the two stadiums has been pushed to nearly
$175 million.
</P>
<P>
   Add Giuliani's desire to build new or improved stadiums for the
big league Mets, Yankees and the National Football League's New
York Jets - at a cost to the city some say could run into billions
- and non-sports fans begin to shake their heads in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous ... I'd rather see the money spent on the
construction of new schools, anything but this,'' said Councilwoman
Ronnie Eldridge, who voted against both projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, I don't approve of using public money for the kinds of
projects that seem to exist only to benefit the major league teams,
and second, I don't buy the argument that these seasonal facilities
will bring any economic relief to the communities involved,'' said
Eldridge, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Democratic Councilman Herb Berman disagrees and says the
ballparks will bring new life to two areas long ignored by city
planners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have you seen Coney Island lately,'' asked Berman, who grew up
in the downtrodden amusement area in its better days. ''There are
vast empty spaces of land, the amusement center is a couple of
short blocks. It's almost all gone. The Cyclone (roller coaster) is
a relic and the 'stores' across from the aquarium are nothing but
ugly little shanty stalls. It's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Berman doesn't see why the city shouldn't spend some of
its $3.2 billion budget surplus to add economic value to the
community and provide recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can always make the argument that the money should be used
for housing or other purposes,'' Berman said. ''But the fact is the
city does not only exist to provide housing and social services to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The millions in city dollars distinctly attached to the ball
field projects - but budgeted under separate appropriation lines -
will give both areas much needed facelifts, proponents argue.
</P>
<P>
   The St. George area of Staten Island will get $54 million worth
of tree-lined, well-lighted walkways, fancy garbage cans and
parking lots that can be used by the 61,000 daily commuters on the
Staten Island ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The Coney Island site - where turn of the century visitors once
rode mechanical horses on the famed Steeplechase Race ride - will
get $31 million in boardwalk improvements and $30 million for
amateur sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   The city also spent $2 million to clean up an illegal hazardous
waste site next to the Staten Island stadium. The ferry terminal -
in walking distance from the stadium - is getting an $85 million
facelift, and the city is helping to build a new $20 million
National Lighthouse Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The economic benefits are already being felt, said Josh Getzler,
who with his father Stan owns the major part of the Staten Island
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of new restaurants have already sprung up, some new
townhouses are being built. ... Five years from you can come here
and I guarantee you won't recognize the place,'' said Getzler.
</P>
<P>
   The steel ribs of the stadium, with a clear view of the Statue
of Liberty, are already up. Work on the Coney Island site has not
begun.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art Staten Island stadium, built by the firm
that constructed the San Francisco Giants' new Pacific Bell Park,
will likely be a hit with residents, who have fully embraced the
new team in the year it has been on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island Advance, a daily covering the island's 400,000
residents, calls the minor league team ''Our Yanks.'' Games at a
temporary site have been drawing an average 3,000 fans, who delight
in hokey pie-eating and trivia contests and watch as little
leaguers are introduced and run onto the field with the minor
league players.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real home town feel. You run into people you know
all the time. The kids can roam around because it's not too big and
best of all - it's cheap,'' said Lynn Maseo, who recently dropped
$200 at a single Yankee Stadium outing for her family of four.
</P>
<P>
   At the Staten Island games, the average fan can buy the most
expensive seats for $10, hot dogs at $1.75 and soda for $2 -
compared to the $30 it costs for a single loge seat in the House
that Ruth built.
</P>
<P>
   The Getzlers have promised they ''won't go major league'' on
ticket prices once the stadium opens. It will include a $2 million
high-tech audio and video system with video signs replacing fence
signs, allowing advertising to be sold by the half-inning. It also
will have high-end luxury suites, an open air food court, an arcade
and picnic area.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for the two stadiums is on the high-end compared
to other new ball parks, said minor league spokesman Ferguson,
especially for a short-season club that plays only 38 home games.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''A high percentage of those stadiums are not in
major cities like New York. They're in Louisville, Columbus and
Syracuse ... and they wouldn't be building stadiums of the same
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Though attendance at minor league games nationwide is at an all
time high - drawing some 35 million fans in 1999 - Ferguson said it
remains to be seen if New York can draw enough fans to support four
baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it certainly will be interesting to see how and where
the support comes from,'' Ferguson said. ''Minor league baseball is
local in nature ... drawing 98 percent of its fans from within a
relatively short distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Getzler, a baseball fan who comes from the publishing business,
isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our core ticket base is always going to be Staten Islanders,''
Getzler said. But he also hopes to tap tourists and cash-rich Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   He notes executives in Manhattan's corporate and financial world
often give tickets for sporting events to clients and employees.
And he says the thousands of tourists who take the Staten Island
ferry might stick around on the island if they found something
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be surprised if we weren't well over 6,000 a game next
year,'' Getzler said. ''But the trick is in three, four years when
the bloom is off the rose to remain as popular as we were in 2001 -
and I think we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets soon-to-be minor league franchise - now the Kings
playing in the borough of Queens - has not had the success of the
Yankee farm team. Since opening day in June, the team has averaged
a little under 1,000 fans a game - the worst attendance in the New
York-Penn League.
</P>
<P>
   One reason could be that the Kings are now a Toronto Blue Jays
affiliate, not a Mets franchise, and another is that residents know
the team will move to Brooklyn once the new stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   Berman believes Brooklyn, with its 2&AMP;frac12; million residents, is
waiting for the team with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will they thrive? You betcha,'' said Berman. ''Could I be
wrong? Maybe, but I think not. I believe there is a demand for
inexpensive spectator sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ''It's time to bring baseball back to
Brooklyn.''

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau defends itself against GOP criticism  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Census Bureau leaders are on the defensive
three weeks after completing most of the field work for the
national head count, seeking to refute Republican charges that
shoddy procedures pervade the operation and threaten to produce
inaccurate results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, the census was described as the census that had
gone awry,'' Census Director Kenneth Prewitt told a news conference
Wednesday. ''The facts do not support this characterization of the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he countered accusations by Rep. Dan Miller,
R-Fla., that households in at least 15 areas nationwide were
miscounted. Such allegations are unfounded, Prewitt said, adding
that he remained confident the agency's quality-control checks
ferreted out any inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's
Census panel, on Tuesday publicly questioned the quality of work
done in 15 offices when Census enumerators were trying to account
for some 40 million households that failed to return a form.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau finished that phase of the count a week before
its July 7 deadline, thanks primarily to the fact that residents
mailed back 80 million of the 120 million forms sent out, Prewitt
said. That 66 percent response rate was 5 percentage points higher
than the 1990 census, so officials had fewer nonresponding
households to track down than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   But in a follow-up letter sent to Prewitt on Wednesday, Miller
maintained that the 15 offices showed questionable patterns of data
collection. Some offices collected ''surges'' of responses very
early in the operation, which began April 27. Others had
questionable surges toward the end of the operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel named these areas as questionable: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas, Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas; Rapid City, S.D.; East Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; northeast New York City;
New Castle, Del.; north Philadelphia, and Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Census data are used to distribute billions
of dollars in federal money. The statistics also are used as a
basis for redrawing congressional and state legislative district
lines, as is mandated in the Constitution every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's spokesman, Chip Walker, said the allegations were based
on complaints from Census takers around the country. He would not
disclose the names.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accusations being leveled against the bureau about a rush
to finish the census, and putting quantity before quality, come
from Census Bureau employees,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said Census officials review the work from all offices
regularly, including the 15 in question, and the bureau's internal
checks weed out any discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, earlier this month he announced that
enumerators were going to revisit more than 64,000 households in
Hialeah, Fla., after officials found ''substantial procedural
errors on the part of local census staff.'' Last week, the bureau
announced it would recount 7,000 homes in Chicago because of
similar procedural problems.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the early and late surges in census responses,
Prewitt said:
</P>
<P>
   -In areas where work was completed early, specifically in
California, a flood of census-takers was sent into the field to get
data as close as possible to April 1, the date Census responses are
based on. The further away from that date answers are received, the
less accurate they are considered to be.
</P>
<P>
   -In areas where there was a later surge in work, it was often
because the office was underperforming until new management
officials were installed and more workers were brought in. That
happened in the office in New Castle, Del., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The broader suggestion that this was a 'rushed census', well
the facts point to the opposite direction,'' Prewitt said. ''We
will do everything we can to make what has been a good census a
better census.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the problems in Hialeah and Chicago warranted
similar investigations into the other offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt, based on no real evidence, to discredit
the census because the Republicans fear that it is going too
well,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, top Democrat on the
subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Survivors Recall Concorde Crash  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Moments after a Concorde jet slammed into her
hotel, a 21-year-old British woman jumped from a window, escaping
the inferno that engulfed the building.
</P>
<P>
   A busload of 44 teen-agers from southeastern England had been
scheduled to check into the Hotelissimo an hour before the deadly
crash, but was mercifully stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of Polish tourists returned from a sightseeing trip
to find the hotel in ruins, their belongings destroyed -- and their
lives spared.
</P>
<P>
   They were among those who escaped death in the crash Tuesday
that claimed the lives of all 109 people on board the supersonic
jet and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Brooking tossed her suitcases on her hotel bed Tuesday
afternoon and dialed the phone to call her sister in London. She
had just arrived for a summer job in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden I heard a noise. It sounded like a normal
takeoff. It just got louder and louder until the whole building
started trembling,'' Brooking recalled a day after the Concorde,
smoke and flames streaming from its engines, slammed into the
backside of her 40-room hotel, about two miles from Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the phone, it sounded as if ''there had been
an earthquake in Paris,'' Brooking's 24-year-old sister, Natalie,
recalled at a news conference Wednesday at the British Embassy in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Flames shot through Brooking's room when she opened her door,
turning it into a smoke-filled oven. ''I leapt across the room,
leapt across the bed and out the window,'' said Brooking, of
Hildenborough, England, who suffered only a burned left hand.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't recall how far she fell, if she landed on gravel or
grass, or if the hotel crumbled or exploded. ''All you could see
was flames. It was just flames everywhere,'' said Brooking, a
student of linguistics at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after her brush with death, Brooking said she
had not yet slept and did not consider herself ''someone that had
survived a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very, very lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, a tour leader, was awaiting the arrival of the Suffolk
Youth Wind Band. Their tour bus, filled with 12- to 19-year-old
band members, was late arriving at the Hotelissimo, stalled in
traffic after the trip from Ipswich, England.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see smoke for some time and there were rescue
vehicles on the road,'' said conductor Philip Shaw. ''When we
arrived at the hotel it was explained just what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The youths, who spent Wednesday at a Paris hotel recovering from
shock, planned to go ahead with their five-day music program in the
concert halls of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 45 Polish tourists returned from sightseeing to
find their hotel ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were totally unaware of what had happened,'' Maciej Kuznik,
the group's guide, told Poland's private Radio Zet. ''All of a
sudden we see the road blocked, and we hear our hotel is completely
burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still in shock and very tired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All their belongings and some passports were destroyed. Air
France paid for their stay Tuesday night in a Paris hotel and
offered compensation for the loss of some possessions.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor wept quietly at the Polish Embassy in Paris on
Wednesday, saying she had lost ''everything ... even my most
beautiful outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed two young Poles, Ewa Lipinska and Paulina
Sypko, both students at a hotel school in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still had illusions that it was a different hotel,'' Danuta
Lipinska, Ewa's mother, told a Polish television station after
flying to the crash site. ''Only dust remained. What will I take
home?''

<HEADLINE> State appeals for more prison space; some towns interested  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESHIRE, Conn. (AP) - When it comes to persuading towns to
house some of the state's toughest prisoners, money talks.
</P>
<P>
   Correction Commissioner John Armstrong made an urgent appeal
Wednesday for new or expanded prisons to hold 1,600 high security
prisoners in the next two years. He said the inmates typically have
committed violent crimes, but added that high security prisons have
more correction officers to manage the population than lower
security prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are dealing with a need for highly problematic inmates,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Several municipal officials who attended an information session
Wednesday expressed interest in expanding an existing facility or
opening a new prison. Leaders of 12 towns and cities came to hear
what officials had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome you,'' Montville Mayor Howard Beetham Jr. told
correction officials. ''We want to be partners with you. We want
all the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   New Britain Mayor Lucian Pawlak said after the meeting that he
would bring the prison idea to other city officials, look for a
site and start a public dialogue. Officials in a few other towns
asked for staff names at the corrections department and whether
state officials would visit their towns to discuss a prison
project.
</P>
<P>
   While prisons are normally a hard sell, some local officials are
attracted by the prospect of hundreds of thousands of dollars in
additional state funds, known as payments in lieu of taxes.
Armstrong also said prisons bring jobs with state pensions and more
local business.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledged prisons would be unpopular in some areas,
but he said reforms have improved the system. He said there have
been no major riots in recent years and cited a sharp drop in
escapes and assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can say our system is far safer than it's ever
been,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal comes as the state faces increasing scrutiny for its
most significant move to ease overcrowding - the transfer of nearly
500 inmates to a maximum-security Virginia prison. Two Connecticut
prisoners have died since being shipped to Wallens Ridge in Big
Stone Gap, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the inmates sent to Virginia could be returned if
enough space is created in Connecticut. He said expansion or new
projects likely would be needed at more than one site to handle the
inmate population.
</P>
<P>
   The state has more than 17,000 inmates in 20 prisons, a 22
percent increase from 5 years ago. The inmate population has nearly
doubled in the past decade due to tougher sentencing laws, and is
projected to grow to more than 21,000 prisoners in 2004, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other towns and cities which sent representatives to the meeting
included: Norwich; New Haven; Waterbury; Cheshire; Enfield; East
Lyme; Somers; East Windsor; Brooklyn; Suffield; Lebanon; and
Ledyard. None of the municipalities have committed to prisons and
some said they just came to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is for municipalities to develop formal
proposals.

<HEADLINE> Report details state's poor during economic boom  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The researchers said they used a range of
statistical tests to paint what advocates are calling a complete
picture of poverty in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from unemployment figures to housing costs to welfare
rolls reportedly show that the ranks of the state's poor remained
unchanged while the rest of New Jersey enjoyed a record economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   But while this new report might not yield surprises, it offers
perspective to state policy-makers dealing with the symptoms of
poverty, not the overall problem, said Melville D. Miller Jr., the
president of Legal Services of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are poor, they see it as a bombardment of problems.
Policy-makers tend to fragment,'' Miller said at a news conference
Wednesday. ''If the policy solution isn't holistic, doesn't address
all of them, it's not going to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal Services made its study public Wednesday and Miller
promised it would be the first of many.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our purpose in this was to essentially establish an increased
focus on poverty. This is a benchmark,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Using data collected primarily in 1997, the report claims New
Jersey's poverty rate is 9.1 percent. Analysts used federal poverty
guidelines. A single-parent family of three making $13,133 would be
at the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, roughly 731,000 people in the state were considered to
be living in poverty, according to the report. That was about
50,000 more than those in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that single mothers with children are
increasingly more likely to be poor than married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said blacks and females are also much more likely to
be unemployed than whites. Poor families are also living in or near
the state's cities.
</P>
<P>
   And the figures showed that a disproportionate number of
children live in poverty, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of a number of indicators showed that the state's poor
were not enjoying the same economic growth as other residents,
researcher Kristin Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The top slice of the pie got bigger. The bottom slice got
smaller,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is detailed in several areas, Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real important here not to look at one aggregate
number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare contributions and the minimum wage have failed to keep
up with the growing cost of living, the study claimed. A family
collecting a monthly welfare payment sees $2,300 a year less than
the federal poverty level, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Social service agencies and state officials now need to address
the complete problem of poverty, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to develop really, I think, new approaches,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Outreach workers said they see another job for this study and
its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very easy for us to lose sight of poverty as a real
issue,'' said Marlene Lao-Collins of the New Jersey Catholic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to find ways to bring this out,'' she said. ''I think
a reasonable person, I hope, would be appalled.''

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court won't consider appeal in township water flap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAFFORD TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A man who was once jailed for
refusing to connect his home to a municipal water system has lost a
bid to appeal to the state's highest court. But he says he'll press
on.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kusznikow of Manahawkin was jailed for eight days in 1997
for refusing to hook up to the township's water system. He was
released only after agreeing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He had wanted to use a private well at his Oxycocus Road home,
but the Municipal Utilities Authority said no because it was
worried about water from the well being contaminated and tainting
public water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Kusznikow contended that his water well had been tested and
found to be clean.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a civil suit aimed at overturning the municipal
ordinance that requires property owners to use the public system,
but the state Supreme Court said earlier this month it would not
hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kusznikow, who learned of the ruling Tuesday, said he would file
a suit in federal court next.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, they're not looking at the case. They're not
reading. They're just looking at it like it's the same case,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Township Business Administrator Paul Shives said the township
spent more than $20,000 litigating Kusznikow's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased. It's frustrating, though. We had to expend
a lot of money to defend our position when this is an issue that
has been decided many times - always in favor of the utilities
authorities and municipalities,'' Shives said.

<HEADLINE> A night spent killing mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMSFORD, N.Y. (AP) - As he roared through the deserted streets
of Westchester County, Herb Lawrence had no qualms about the
insecticide mist geysering up from the bed of his pickup. He had
come from Illinois to help stamp out the West Nile virus, and he
had only one thought about the mosquitoes he was killing by the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, 21, was one of 14 drivers - 13 men and a woman -
deployed around the county from 10 p.m. Tuesday to the wee hours of
Wednesday in Westchester's latest assault on the virus. It has
shown up in birds and mosquitoes in much of the metropolitan area
this summer after killing seven people last year.
</P>
<P>
   He works for Clarke Environmental Mosquito Management Inc. of
Roselle, Ill., which was hired by the county - and by New York City
and Rockland County - to battle the mosquitoes. The big demand for
its services has Clarke juggling its resources, especially when
jobs come up suddenly, like the fumigation of Central Park that was
ordered by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for drivers Tuesday, Westchester's assistant
commissioner, Bob Ebersole, urged them to quickly complete their
routes. ''We're in competition ... for Clarke's equipment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the spraying spreads, so does concern about the insecticide,
though Clarke says its product - Anvil, a synthetic version of an
organic pesticide culled from the chrysanthemum - doesn't hurt
humans or even butterflies at mosquito dosage. A group of
environmentalists has asked a federal judge to stop the city from
spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who lives in Carol Stream, Ill., doesn't see what the
fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all used to this in Chicago,'' he said. ''I guess this
spraying is new here but if you ask me, I haven't seen anything
wrong with it.'' He's suffered no ailments from being close to the
pesticide for two summers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His Chevrolet Cheyenne was loaded with a squat anti-mosquito
sprayer and more than 30 gallons of Anvil as he headed out.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying machine operates at a low roar as it pulverizes the
liquid insecticide into droplets just seven-thousandths of an inch
across - just right for penetrating a skeeter's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence wore ear plugs to start the machine. He flicked a
switch in the cab that matched the rate of spray to the speed of
the truck so that the coverage will be consistent: one-seventh of
an ounce to an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned on his yellow roof light and set off behind a
police escort.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence expertly wheeled his truck along major roads,
cul-de-sacs and the occasional dead end (''back in, spray out'').
It was a still night, and the insecticide generally hung suspended
in the air over the street for a few seconds, then was wafted this
way or that by whatever breeze - or passing car - came along.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the plume was even picturesque, rising like a rolling
fog beneath streetlights near the Knollwood Country Club or
cascading from the Interstate 287 overpass.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to bother the few pedestrians, who more or less
walked right through the haze of insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather have the spray,'' said Ed Schmidt, 53, of Elmsford.
''I don't need no mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke has been targeting mosquitoes and only mosquitoes since
1946. ''We don't do ants, we don't do roaches,'' said George Balis,
a company entomologist. As to how many mosquitoes the company has
killed, he said they couldn't be counted but added, ''We can do it
like the McDonald's sign - 99 billion served.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, people in mosquito control can be identified by the
way they swat a skeeter.
</P>
<P>
   ''First I identify it, then I kill it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke is charging Westchester $65 a mile, the smaller Rockland
$75 - and the mileage grows each time an infection is found.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year there have been no human cases of West Nile,
which can result in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. But
Balis says the region might be making a big mistake if it relaxes
mosquito controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''To drop your gloves and say, 'OK, it's over with, we've
handled the problem,' usually means it will come back to bite you
once again,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lung Surgery May Help With Emphysema  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   A risky surgery to remove part of the damaged lungs of emphysema
patients appears to at least temporarily improve their ability to
breathe, walk and lead more normal lives, a small study found.
</P>
<P>
   While a few thousand people with severe emphysema have had the
operation and reported substantial improvement, Medicare and
private insurers won't pay for it without proof it works better
than standard medical care.
</P>
<P>
   This study of ''lung-volume reduction surgery,'' and a much
larger federal study under way, could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're claiming a short-term benefit and hoping that will also
bring a long-term benefit,'' said lead researcher Dr. Duncan
Geddes, a professor of respiratory medicine at London's Royal
Brompton Hospital. ''When it succeeds ... the effect on a person's
life is really quite astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some patients who have had the surgery have been able to resume
activities such as shopping, even golf, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emphysema is an incurable lung disease affecting 2 million
Americans, with an estimated annual cost of $2.5 billion. Severe
emphysema kills 30 percent of patients within in a year and 95
percent within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by smoking, genetic flaws or exposure to hazardous fumes,
emphysema damages the lungs' air sacs, trapping air and destroying
the airways' elasticity and structural support. That makes it hard
to inflate and deflate the lungs, causing progressive shortness of
breath that leaves patients unable to work, and eventually makes
walking or other physical effort too difficult. Patients feel as if
their lungs, enlarged by the disease, are too full to inhale or
exhale much air.
</P>
<P>
   Removing up to 30 percent of the lungs so they fit better inside
the ribs makes it easier to inhale and exhale. The surgery works
best if some tissue is undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ideally, you want (the emphysema) bad in patches and good in
patches and then you take away the bad bits,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was tried -- disastrously -- in the 1950s, then
resumed in the last decade after advances in postoperative care and
development of sealants for air leaks improved survival after
surgery, said Dr. Mark Lavietes, director of the pulmonary function
lab at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The British study appears in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was performed on 23 patients, while a comparison
group of 24 got standard medical care: a smoking-cessation program,
several types of medication, vaccinations to prevent a dangerous
pneumonia or flu infection, physical and occupational therapy, and
supplemental oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Various tests of patients' lung function and sense of well-being
found the surgical patients, on average, did better than the
medical care group on several measures for three months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   When each patient's original scores were compared with their
scores at three, six and 12 months, the surgical group had big
improvements in several key tests of lung function, while the
medical group declined steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, five patients who had the surgery -- and three who
underwent the standard regimen -- died during the study. Also, five
patients who had the surgery didn't benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Lavietes, who was not involved in the study, noted that
improvements in how well the patients' lungs got oxygen into their
blood declined over time -- while the measure improving most was the
subjective one, how well patients felt and could perform daily
activities. He said that could be a placebo effect.
</P>
<P>
   However, Geddes said that doesn't mean the surgery isn't
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are actually doing more and feeling happier, whatever
way it came about, that's what we wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A much larger study with 2,500 patients is under way. The lead
researcher, Dr. Gail Weinmann of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, expects results by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Scans Might Better Cancer Diagnosis  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors can much more accurately judge whether patients with
lung cancer should undergo surgery if they combine two scanning
techniques to find how far the malignancy has spread, a new study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch researchers found that adding PET scans to the standard CT
scans changed their decisions about the need for surgery in nearly
two-thirds of patients studied. Using both kinds of scans could
eliminate needless surgeries and save money.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is patients would get the right treatment, so
they would have less side effects and complications,'' said Dr.
Daniel Sullivan, associate director of the National Cancer
Institute's biomedical imaging program.
</P>
<P>
   PET -- positron emission tomography -- uses a radioactive tracer
to detect ''hot spots'' of increased metabolic activity typical of
even tiny tumors. CT -- computed tomography or ''CAT scans'' -- use
computerized analysis of X-rays to spot possible tumors of at least
1 centimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily caused by smoking, lung cancer is the most common,
most deadly cancer, with a five-year survival rate of only 18
percent if it has spread to nearby parts of the chest and only 2
percent if it has spread farther.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is the best treatment if the cancer hasn't spread far.
Patients who won't benefit from surgery get radiation and/or
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   That means doctors trying to pick the best treatment must
''stage'' the cancer, determining whether surgery is likely to
remove all tumors, as in the earlier stages, or whether an
operation is unlikely to help, as in the later stages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had noninvasive techniques to accurately determine
who should go to surgery and who shouldn't,'' said Dr. Edward Patz,
professor of radiology at Duke University Medical School, who was
not involved in the new research. ''This gives us more accurate
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The research appears in Thursday's edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 102 patients with ''non-small-cell lung
cancer,'' which account for three-fourths of lung cancer cases.
Small-cell lung cancer usually is inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Netherlands' Groningen University Hospital
found PET scans correctly spotted 91 percent of the tumors that had
spread from the lungs to the center of the chest, compared with 75
percent for the CT scans.
</P>
<P>
   PET scans correctly determined cancer hadn't spread to the
central chest in 86 percent, compared with 66 percent for CT scans.
In 11 patients, PET spotted distant tumors that CT scans missed.
</P>
<P>
   PET scans of 62 patients indicated their cancer was at a
different stage than conventional scans showed. For 20 patients,
finding a lower stage meant they were offered surgery instead of
just drugs or radiation; for 42, the higher stage meant surgeons
spared them a risky operation that wouldn't help.
</P>
<P>
   While several studies in the 1990s similarly found PET scans
superior to CT scans, many only looked at chest tumors. This study
also scanned for tumors elsewhere, finding PET scans detected 95
percent of all tumors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, unlike most previous research, this study confirmed
scan findings either by dissecting tissue removed during cancer
surgery or doing a biopsy of suspected tumors in patients with
inoperable cancer.
</P>
<P>
   PET scan technology was developed in the 1970s, but its
complexity limited its use to large research universities until
recently, when insurers began covering the scans and major
hospitals started buying the machines.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 UCLA study estimated using both PET and CT would save
$1,154 to $2,267 per patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''Insurance companies pay for this stuff now because they
realize if we can do a PET scan for $2,000 and save a surgery that
costs $35,000, they're money ahead,'' said Dr. John Hoffman, chief
of the NCI imaging program's molecular imaging branch.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare started covering the scans last year, and medical
device makers are creating combination CT/PET scanners, he added.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn judge approves Swiss bank settlement with Holocaust survivors </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge has approved a historic $1.25
billion settlement between Swiss banks and the more than half
million plaintiffs worldwide who alleged the banks hoarded money
deposited by Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated ruling in Brooklyn on Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Edward Korman brings Holocaust victims and their
heirs a step closer to collecting claims against the banks.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, the judge said the words of a Holocaust survivor
from Long Island, Ernest Lobet, 75, best summarized his own
feelings about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no quarrel with the settlement,'' Korman quoted Lobet
as saying last year at a court hearing. ''I do not say it is fair,
because fairness is a relative term. No amount of money can
possibly be fair under those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Korman now must sign off on a plan, still in the works, for
dividing and distributing the settlement - the final phase of a
painstaking global campaign to compensate potential claimants.
Nearly 600,000 people have expressed interest in making claims.
</P>
<P>
   Under a distribution plan being drawn up by a court-appointed
special master, Judah Gribetz, officials will use bank and other
records to determine if claims are valid. A draft of Gribetz's plan
is due within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
hailed Korman's opinion as ''a belated victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After more than a half century, a measure of justice has been
achieved for the victims of the greatest crime of the century,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official with the World Restitution Organization in
Washington D.C., Bobby Brown, questioned whether $1.25 billion is
really enough to cover the claims. But, he added, ''We are dealing
with people in their 80s and 90s who don't have the luxury to wait
for us to get a higher amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the Swiss government and the nation's two largest
banks - Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG - issued statements
welcoming the ruling. Defense attorney Roger Witten said the banks
have already put $550 million in escrow in anticipation of starting
payments, possibly before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're as anxious as anybody to get this money out,'' Witten
said.
</P>
<P>
   At ''fairness'' hearings last year, attorneys from both sides
told Korman that an overwhelming majority of the plaintiffs in the
class-action lawsuit against the banks supported a proposed
out-of-court settlement reached in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Holocaust victims who deposited money in
Swiss banks for safe keeping as the Nazis gained power in Europe,
expecting to retrieve it later.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs claimed that after the war, they ran into a
stone wall in trying to claim the assets. In some cases, they
lacked detailed account information; some bankers even demanded
impossible-to-obtain death certificates of people killed in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers Jews and other Holocaust victims who lost
money in Swiss accounts. Any remaining money would go to slave
laborers who did work for companies with Swiss accounts, and
victims whose belongings were plundered by the Nazis and apparently
wound up in Switzerland, a wartime depository for gold and other
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year independent investigation headed by Paul A.
Volcker, the former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, found that up to
54,000 accounts may have been opened by Holocaust victims. A report
issued last year by Volcker cleared the banks of ''systematic
destruction of records of victims accounts,'' but said there was
evidence of ''deceitful actions by some individual banks.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG agreed to grant access
to databases containing 2.1 million Holocaust-era accounts to help
speed payments to victims.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Wednesday, Lobet - a Glen Cove, N.Y., attorney who
spent more than two years as a slave laborer in Auschwitz - said
though he was thankful to be part of Korman's ruling, the
settlement itself is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I going to be compensated for Auschwitz? Obviously not,''
he said. ''But at least it's an acknowledgment that something is
owed to the victims. .... It's the best that could be done under
the circumstances. It's time to close the books.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Spar Over Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As House Republicans prepared to pass a bill
repealing a 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits,
President Clinton urged the GOP-led Congress to abandon their major
tax cuts and work instead for wiser uses of the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to Congress: stop passing tax bills you know I'll
veto,'' Clinton told reporters Wednesday at the White House.
''Start working with us on a balanced budget that cuts taxes for
middle-class families, continues to pay off the national debt and
invest in America's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president repeated his charge that the combined cost of all
GOP tax bills over the past two years -- some of which are
duplicates -- would all but consume the $2 trillion in budget
surpluses projected over the next decade, not counting money for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''In good conscience, I cannot sign one of these tax breaks
after another without any coherent strategy for safeguarding our
future and meeting other national priorities,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would push ahead with more stand-alone tax
cuts, including a bill scheduled for debate Thursday in the House
that would cut taxes on Social Security for an estimated 9 million
senior citizens, at a cost of about $100 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also intend as early as Thursday to send the
president the marriage penalty bill passed last week that would
reduce income taxes by $292 billion over 10 years for millions of
married couples, including the 25 million who pay higher rates than
they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills have drawn veto threats, as has a bill to gradually
repeal inheritance taxes at a cost of $104 billion over 10 years.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Republicans believe
the individual tax cuts are winners politically, especially if
voters think the surplus would otherwise be spent on government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton needs to remember that it was only because
Americans were overcharged to begin with that the government now
has this surplus,'' DeLay said. ''What we won't do is to let the
president waste the surplus on more Washington programs.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton vetoes the marriage penalty bill, DeLay said an
attempt to override the veto with a two-thirds House vote would be
''the first order of business'' when lawmakers return in September
from their summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal bill, DeLay said, will not reach Clinton's
desk until September to allow voters a chance during August to
''raise the pressure'' on the president to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republicans of playing politics by
manipulating the timing of the tax bills, saying they should all
reach the White House in a package before the GOP national
convention that begins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then the American people can add up the costs and draw their
own conclusions,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay said the process would make things clearer for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting the bills passed. We'll put them on his desk and
he can either sign them or veto them,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security tax bill to be debated Thursday would
eliminate a tax increase on certain Social Security beneficiaries
enacted in 1993 that now helps pay for Medicare. It imposes income
taxes on 85 percent of the Social Security benefits of individuals
with incomes above $34,000 and married couples above $44,000.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would reduce the taxable amount of benefits
beginning in 2001 from 85 percent to 50 percent, which was the
pre-1993 level for those with incomes above $25,000 for individuals
and $32,000 for married couples. In addition, money would be
transferred out of the general budget surplus to make up for the
losses in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said that without the legislation, the number of senior
citizens paying the tax could reach 13 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tax is a clear and present danger to their retirement
security,'' Archer, R-Texas, said in a letter to Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   In his own letter, Summers said he would recommend that Clinton
veto the bill because it would divert money from Medicare that
could be used to create a prescription drug benefit or help keep
Social Security solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Summers said, ''is the latest in a series of costly
and poorly targeted tax proposals'' from the GOP-led Congress.

<HEADLINE> Teens Can Have Blocked Arteries  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Boys as young as 15 can begin to experience
clogged arteries, according to a new study that says long-range
prevention of heart disease must begin in adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers led by Dr. Henry C. McGill Jr. of the Southwest
Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio pored over the
autopsies of 760 young men and women who had died in accidents,
homicides or suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Arterial blockage was found in 2 percent of the 15- to
19-year-old boys who were studied, and in about 20 percent of the
men ages 20 to 34. Even though a small number of the teen-agers had
clogged arteries, researchers were surprised to see any at all.
</P>
<P>
   McGill said the condition -- even in men as young as those
studied -- would likely lead to a heart attack by the time they were
in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not probably going to get a heart attack for another
10 or 15 years, but this would sure be a good time to start
preventing it,'' said McGill, whose results appear in this week's
edition of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The data was collected over a seven-year period ending in 1994.
Researchers analyzed blood cholesterol levels and measured plaques
in one of the key blood vessels leading to the heart, the left
coronary artery, where blockages are known to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies already have shown teens are not too young to
suffer the physical effects of dangerously high cholesterol levels.
High cholesterol often leads to plaques along the arterial walls,
which then encourage blood clots that may lead to a heart attack or
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Brundage, a cardiologist at St. Charles Medical Center
in Bend, Ore., said the affected males probably suffered no ill
effects from their slowly clogging arteries, especially because
teen boys often feel like they're in top physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   But Brundage, who was not involved in McGill's study, said the
latest findings offered more evidence that the same risk factors
for heart disease -- high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking
-- known to put older people in jeopardy also affect the young.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more confirmation the disease process starts earlier in
life and it's progressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McGill discovered a gender difference: none of the
teen-age girls studied had blockages, and only 8 percent of the
women from 20 to 34 had the severe arterial buildup found in the
male group.
</P>
<P>
   Brundage suggested that estrogen may protect some women from
arterial clogging, but said further research is needed.

<HEADLINE> Judith Jamison's New Dance Opens  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's good news about Judith Jamison's new
dance for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
</P>
<P>
   First, despite being billed as multimedia, the emphasis is on
the dance and dancers. The moving images on the backdrop are
background, not competition, for the dancers on stage. Second, in
''Double Exposure,'' which opened Tuesday at the Lincoln Center
Festival, Jamison focuses her dance language on a fairly limited
range -- and still keeps the piece interesting and vital.
</P>
<P>
   The program was the Ailey company's opening night at the
festival, which is being held at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Double Exposure'' was danced by Matthew Rushing and Glenn A.
Sims, who usually danced opposite each other, and Dwana Adiaha
Smallwood, Bahiyah Sayyed and Asha Thomas, who often circled the
men like three graceful muses or three frenetic furies.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning was the motion of choice in ''Double Exposure.'' The
dance included so much vigorous spinning it was a wonder the
dancers could keep going. But they did, with apparently
undiminished vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Moving images such as snow sliding down a hill, black blobs or a
cloudy sky were projected on the back wall. The faces of the
dancers at times were projected as well, but only served to
distract.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ruggieri's music was varied. It included field shouts,
floating mood sounds and Jamaican rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with ''Grace,'' choreographed by Ronald K.
Brown in 1999, featuring Duke Ellington's ''Come Sunday,'' and
Ailey's masterwork, ''Revelations,'' from 1960.

<HEADLINE> Administration Releases Steel Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration issued an action
plan Wednesday that spells out steps the government will take to
protect the domestic steel industry from future surges in imports.
</P>
<P>
   The 240-page report was the administration's latest effort to
respond to criticism from the steel industry that it was slow to
respond to problems generated by the Asian financial crisis of
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Steel companies and workers complained that a flood of imported
steel during that period pushed six U.S. steel companies into
bankruptcy and resulted in thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser, told
reporters that the new program, prepared by the Commerce
Department, represented a ''comprehensive study of the causes and
consequences'' of the 1997-98 steel crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said the crisis showed ''the
need for vigilance and stepped-up efforts to address the root
causes of global instability in global steel markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta pledged to follow the recommendations in the action plan:
faster release of government statistics on steel imports; expedited
anti-dumping investigations so decisions can be reached earlier;
and an interagency rapid response team to provide relief to
communities suffering from import surges.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the administration will work through the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
and negotiate individually with major foreign steel producers on
ways to address overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials denied there was any link between the
report's release and efforts to help the presidential campaign of
Democrat Al Gore. Labor union have criticized the vice president
for his support of the administration's push to grant China
permanent normal trade status with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steel companies and the United Steelworkers union praised
the report's findings but said it would be critical for the
administration to follow through with its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This report proves that foreign steel producers refuse to play
by the rules. The administration and Congress must now apply the
facts laid out in this report to concrete programs that safeguard
the jobs of American steelworkers,'' United Steelworkers President
George Becker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel importers recently released a report contending
that U.S. government actions to protect the domestic steel industry
had cost American consumers more than $100 billion over the past
three decades in higher prices for products manufactured with steel
such as autos and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   William Barringer, a Washington attorney for the Japanese Iron
and Steel Exporters Association, said his group did not agree with
many of the conclusions but did support the call for more
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having consultations between countries before dumping or
unfair trade cases are filed is a positive idea,'' Barringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The report singled out Japan, Russia, South Korea and Brazil as
nations whose steel industries have unfair advantages in competing
with American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed anti-dumping duties on a number of
countries in 1998 and 1999 after the U.S. market was flooded with
low-cost steel imports following the Asian crisis, which sharply
cut demand in countries hit by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the steel industry complained at the time that it had taken
the administration too long to provide relief in the form of higher
tariffs on foreign products.

<HEADLINE> Gateway to NJ revamped in time for GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - To look at the Canada geese and pigeons
pecking away on the grass between the Cooper River and Admiral
Wilson Boulevard, you'd think they've always called the area home.
</P>
<P>
   But a few months ago, the swath of land between the river and
the road was dotted with strip clubs, motels, gas stations and
billboards touting X-rated shows.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious project to renovate and beautify the seedy south
side of the boulevard is nearing completion, just in time for the
start of the Republican National Convention across the Delaware
River in Philadelphia. The convention will be held from Monday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great,'' said Ron Ardron, sales manager for Zinman Furs,
which has been open for business on the north side of the boulevard
for 70 years. ''Most of the people who have businesses here are
gung-ho about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently they're not alone. Gov. Christie Whitman has been
flooded with letters and e-mails from people who travel the road,
commenting on how welcome the change is, her spokeswoman, Jayne
O'Connor, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to be one of the most noticeable things she's done in
South Jersey,'' O'Connor said. ''That's part of the motivation
behind the whole project. The governor feels it's very important to
area residents to have an attractive and well-kept gateway to the
city, and second of all, it's good for New Jersey to provide a nice
welcome for people coming in to the state through the boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman announced the project in March 1999, she said she
wanted the state to put its best foot forward for those attending
the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's opening ceremonies will be held on Camden's
riverfront, and delegate and corporate events will be held at the
Thomas Kean New Jersey State Aquarium and the Sony E-Centre. Also,
many of the delegates will stay in southern New Jersey hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is scheduled to tour the area Friday with state and
county elected officials and Delaware River Port Authority
commissioners, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority and the state departments of Transportation,
Environmental Protection and Community Affairs worked together on
the project that cost about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority acquired about 40 properties on the south
side of the highway, demolished them and replaced them with grass,
giving passers-by a view of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and shrubs were planted, sidewalks and tiled concrete
barriers were installed and the road itself was resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation also installed lighting and
applied anti-graffiti paint to the barriers and bridges, said
spokesman John Dourgarian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal was to restore the boulevard to what it used to be,
which was a beautiful, tree-lined thoroughfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Community Affairs made housing improvements to
an East Camden neighborhood just off the boulevard and installed
lighting to increase safety there, said spokesman E.J. Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred trees will be planted in the fall, and by next
summer, a park along the Cooper River, with picnic and play areas,
a fishing platform, a bicycle path and an exercise loop will be
finished, said Joe Diemer, spokesman for the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be made a continuation of the Cooper River Park
system, which is run by Camden County, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is for us to turn this over to them,'' Diemer said.
''They know how to manage parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority is still in negotiations to acquire and
demolish several properties on the west end of the boulevard,
including a gas station and a vacant auto and garden center, Diemer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority, with the owners of property on the north
side of the boulevard, is developing a plan that could include
recreation and more businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the south side becomes a park, the north side potential,
we think, increases significantly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge refuses to block spraying by city  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request by
environmentalists to block the spraying of insecticide throughout
most of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Several environmentalists and organizations including the No
Spray Coalition and the National Coalition against the Misuse of
Pesticides had asked U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. to ban the
city from spraying.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was impossible to spray without some of the
pesticides drifting with the wind into the rivers around Manhattan
and other bodies of water, endangering wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The city was prepared to spray large sections of Manhattan
Wednesday night, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Baer concluded that the environmentalists had failed to prove
they would suffer irreparable harm or that they would ultimately
succeed once the facts of the case were explored in detail in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Baer ruled from the bench after listening to several witnesses
during a two-hour hearing, including city Health Commissioner Neal
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen conceded that influenza last winter killed more than 2,000
city residents but did not lead to a declaration that a public
health hazard existed.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the West Nile virus last summer led to
widespread aerial and ground spraying of pesticides. In all, seven
elderly people were killed by the virus and 62 others were infected
with it. Four of those deaths and 45 of the cases occurred in the
city. Thousands of birds and other animals were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said it was necessary to spray insecticide over an ever
widening area of Manhattan because infected mosquitoes were found
in Central Park on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city was merely complying with advisories from the
Centers for Disease Control calling for the spraying of a 2-mile
radius around locations where infected mosquitoes are found.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the insecticides were ''ultra low volume, low
concentration'' and posed no threat to the general population,
although people who might be unusually sensitive to chemicals were
advised to stay indoors during spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the environmentalists said they planned to pursue
their claims through the courts.

<HEADLINE> Entertainers sign on for rap star's assault appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Some big name entertainers are
rallying behind a rap star who's in a Connecticut prison on an
assault conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Recording artists such as LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, Redman, Nas
and pop singer Britney Spears are among those lending their support
to Keith Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is serving a three year prison term for assault. He was
convicted in December 1996 after a 1995 fight at The Sting, a New
Britain nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he beat David Hughes, 16, of West Hempstead,
N.Y, with a bar stool, leaving him with disfiguring scars on his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Murray began serving his sentence in October 1998 after his
appeal was rejected by both the state Appellate Court and the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 25, shares a record label and entertainment lawyer with
pop singer Britney Spear.
</P>
<P>
   At a New York City news conference Tuesday, Joseph Moniz, a
Hartford attorney handling Murray's appeal, said there is new
evidence that justifies a new trial including allegations that some
helpful witnesses were scared away.
</P>
<P>
   Moniz said two witnesses discovered in the last month are ready
to testify under oath that Murray did not attack David Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal system works well, most of the time. But in this case,
there was obstruction of justice,'' Moniz said.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Sermon, a member of the Def Squad rap group that included
Murray and rapper Redman, said he's been in contact with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keith told me he was innocent and I knew he wasn't lying. If
he was, I'd have hit him over the head with a chair'' Sermon said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's first album, ''The Most Beautiful Thing in the World,''
went gold after its release in 1994. His second album, '' Enigma,''
also sold well after its release in November 1996.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Will Grant Oil Concessions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Venezuelan government said
Wednesday it will allow private companies to drill for oil in the
Essequibo territory -- the latest move in an escalating dispute over
the mineral-rich region claimed by both Venezuela and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to grant oil concessions in that area ... just as
Guyana does,'' foreign minister Jose Vicente Rangel said in a
television interview. He added that Venezuela has already contacted
prospective oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela maintains it was unfairly stripped of the Essequibo
region in a 19th century arbitration decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Essequibo region comprises two-thirds of Guyana's land area
of 83,000 sq. miles and is home to gold, diamond and timber
investments by U.S. and Asian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Oil sustains Venezuela's economy, accounting for more than 70
percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing dispute between the two countries was
exacerbated last year when Guyana sold 100,000 acres in Essequibo
to U.S.-based Beal Aerospace Technologies, which plans to build a
satellite launchpad there.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez insists the U.S. government is providing
security for the launching site, and may use it as a military base.
The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela has stated that the United States has
no role in the project except for granting export licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been mediating the boundary dispute
between Venezuela and Guyana during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Guyana, Venezuela, and the UN will meet in New
York on Sept. 6 and 7 to try to negotiate a settlement.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr.'s first plane to be auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The first airplane owned by John F. Kennedy
Jr. will be auctioned at the Essex County Airport on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The 1977 Cessna 182Q Skylane was owned by Kennedy from April
1998 to May 1999 and was flown by him for training and
cross-country flights, according to Fisher Auction Co. of Pompano
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current owner wants to remain anonymous, the
auction company's chief executive officer said the owner did know
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's owned by a corporation, one of the principals of which is
a close friend of (Kennedy) and the family,'' said Louis B. Fisher
III. ''It's a constant reminder of the tragedy and he just wants to
move it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy died last year when his single-engine Piper Saratoga
crashed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with his wife and
sister-in-law on board. They were flying from Fairfield to attend
his cousin Rory Kennedy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the plane is in excellent condition. It has a red,
white and blue paint scheme and the customized registration number
''N529JK,'' which commemorates President John F. Kennedy's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cessna is flown once every 10 days to keep it maintained,
and there are 280 hours on the present engine and prop, Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been kept inside a hangar, and the flight books
are complete as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he couldn't estimate how much the Cessna would earn
at auction. The plane alone is worth a couple hundred thousand
dollars, he said, but he didn't know what additional value would be
placed on it because Kennedy owned it.
</P>
<P>
   The auction company expects museums, restaurants, theme parks,
investors, pilots and collectors to be interested in the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Interested buyers may see the plane before auction, and Fisher
said private viewings can be scheduled by contacting the company
office in Florida.

<HEADLINE> John Deere Classic Has New Look  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVIS, Ill. (AP) -- Those familiar with previous incarnations of
the John Deere Classic -- staged under four other names but always
on the same course -- will encounter an entirely revamped event at
its new home this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is being held at the Tournament Players Club at Deere Run, a
par-71, 7,080-yard course that opened in June. PGA commissioner Tim
Finchem said Wednesday the course, built specifically to hold the
tournament, is a sign the once-struggling event is maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the fundamentals are in place,'' he said. ''It all
starts with a great golf course, and this course is very good and
will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's purse is $2.6 million, up from $2 million, and the
field is one of the best in the tournament's history.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is moving to Deere Run from its former home at
the par-70, 6,762-yard Oakwood Country Club in Coal Valley. Deere
Run designer D.A. Weibring, who won the event three times at the
old site, said tournament veterans will face a tougher layout.
</P>
<P>
   ''A wayward shot will be more penalized, without question,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakwood is centered on a relatively flat-topped bluff with few
trees and lots of rough to protect fairways. Deere Run winds up and
down a heavily wooded ridge overlooking the Rock River, with thick
prairie grasses edging the hardwoods that line fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Weibring said players can expect a moderate rough and greens
that might run a touch slow because of heat and lack of rain. But
the real variable could be the stiff winds that often swirl up to
the top of the ridgeline from the river below.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the course is going to have a nice personality,''
Weibring said. ''When it's damp or the wind blows, it can play
different every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans apparently are excited about the new site, too. Weekend
tickets sold out more than a month ago, and organizers expect
35,000 to 40,000 visitors each day. Tournament director Kym Hougham
said weekend ticket sales were cut off for fear of overcrowding on
a course that's never hosted a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Although gallery space is limited on a few holes because of
trees that crowd the fairway, the up-and-down nature of the course
should lend itself to spectators. From behind three greens -- No. 4,
No. 6 and No. 17 -- fans can see action on multiple fairways.
</P>
<P>
   The field includes several past tournament winners, including
defending champion J.L. Lewis. The tournament also has drawn some
of the most well-known players on the tour, like John Daly, Fred
Funk, Peter Jacobsen and Fuzzy Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   Some tour veterans who played the course in advance predicted it
would help attract quality fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rate the course a 9 (out of 10) and that's worth telling
people about,'' Jacobsen told The (Moline) Dispatch and Rock Island
Argus after playing Deere Run earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the tournament has been called the Miller
Classic, Quad Cities Open, Hardee's Classic and Quad Cities
Classic. This is the second year it has been sponsored by
Moline-based John Deere &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Finchem said Deere appears to be committed to the event, a
commitment symbolized by Deere Run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't recall us having a new facility that is so well
received,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Navy petty officer discharged after posing nude for Playboy  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - A former Navy petty officer is bearing the
consequences for baring all in the September issue of Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Lynne White, 26, said she was discharged from the Navy on
July 9 because she posed for a nude photo spread. She originally
was scheduled to be released from duty on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I wasn't doing anything wrong by posing,'' White said
Tuesday. ''I'm not making the Navy look bad by having those
pictures there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Dave Werner, a Navy spokesman in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
where White was stationed, said both the Navy and White agreed to
the discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ''As she agreed, it was best that she pursue her career outside
the military,'' Werner said. ''It was in everyone's interests for
her to leave early.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner would not say what role the Playboy photos played in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White, a native of Washington, Warren County, N.J., who had
served in the Navy for eight years, said her trouble began when she
submitted a nude photo that was published in the ''Grapevine''
section of Playboy's February issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the photo nor the caption made reference to White's
service in the Navy, she said. But she said her superiors told her
to ask Playboy not to publish any more of her photos.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White contacted the magazine and arranged to do a full
pictorial, with an accompanying article and pictures of her in
uniform. After she told her superiors of her decision, she was told
she would be discharged for misconduct under honorable conditions,
she said. She eventually signed a letter stating those terms.
</P>
<P>
   A notation on her discharge bars her from returning to military
service or holding certain government jobs, White said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not disclose how much she was paid for posing nude.
</P>
<P>
   White most recently had served as a naval information systems
technician second class as part of the Commander Submarine Force,
U.S. Pacific Fleet.

<HEADLINE> Five inches of rain triggers flooding, road closings in Monmouth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) - A band of thunderstorms dumped nearly 5
inches of rain Wednesday on parts of Monmouth County, triggering
street flooding and road closings, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.97 inches fell by 1 p.m., submerging some primary routes
in Monmouth Beach, Sea Bright, Belmar and Oceanport under a foot of
water, according to Harry Conover, director of emergency management
for the county.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile stretch of Route 35 in Belmar was closed for part of
the afternoon, as were parts of Route 33 in Neptune and Ocean
Avenue in Sea Bright.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 inches fell elsewhere at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlantic City, minor street flooding caused some temporary
road closings, but the island's major access routes - the Atlantic
City Expressway, Route 30 and Route 40 - remained open, according
to Michael Schurman, director of highway traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
   More rain was forecast for Thursday, but it will not be as
heavy, National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Stauber said.

<HEADLINE> Leading NY gun control advocates attack Cheney record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of Capitol Hill's leading advocates for
stricter gun laws took aim at GOP vice presidential pick Dick
Cheney Wednesday, saying he had ''a history of hostility toward gun
control.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy painted Cheney as a pawn of the National Rifle Association
and picked apart his voting record from his six terms in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could not create a more pro-NRA ticket unless Charlton
Heston was on it,'' Schumer said. ''Bush-Cheney means the NRA is in
the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and McCarthy noted Cheney was one of only 21 House
members to vote against a ban on armor-piercing bullets, commonly
called cop-killer bullets. Cheney was also one of only four members
who opposed a law to ban plastic guns that are able to pass
unnoticed through metal detectors, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NRA clearly had their hand in picking Governor Bush's
running mate, just as they have been killing all reasonable gun
safety measures in Congress for a year,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, announced Tuesday that Cheney would be his
running mate. Since then Democrats have been attacking Cheney's
conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a former defense secretary and six-term congressman
from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's husband was killed and her son wounded in the 1993
massacre on the Long Island Railroad. The shooting made her an
ardent gun control advocate and propelled her to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While in the House, Schumer sponsored the Brady Bill, which
required background checks for most gun purchases.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Dan Marino would cringe if he saw this.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Miami Dolphins trying to replace their longtime star,
the team's new offense is expected to include plenty of wrinkles.
They unveiled one Wednesday when veteran receiver Bert Emanuel took
snaps at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Wannstedt played coy when asked about No. 87 lining
up under center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under center? When did that happen?'' Wannstedt said. He then
added, ''We're experimenting with a lot of different looks and a
lot of different guys.''
</P>
<P>
   New offensive coordinator Chan Gailey was with the Pittsburgh
Steelers when Kordell Stewart enjoyed his greatest success there
shuffling between quarterback, receiver and running back.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel was an All-Southwest Conference quarterback at Rice in
1993-94 but has thrown just one pass in the NFL. The Dolphins will
decide whether to use him on occasion at quarterback, especially in
short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   Marino retired in March.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Richmond Webb, meanwhile, was deciding whether
to have surgery to remove bone chips in his right elbow. If he opts
for the operation, Webb would be expected to be sidelined for about
two weeks.
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith didn't practice Wednesday because of a strained big
toe on his left foot, but Dallas coach Dave Campo said the running
back's injury isn't cause for great concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-rays were negative. ... It's just a tip of the toe
sprain,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stubbed his toe when he was walking out of a building on
Tuesday night, Campo said. Smith was on the field Wednesday but
didn't take part in drills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really not a serious thing, we don't think,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo listed Smith as day-to-day, but did not specifically
address the running back's status for Sunday's preseason opener
against Pittsburgh.
Chiefs:
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gunther Cunningham canceled the afternoon practice, saying
the players had already been through 10 workouts and probably
needed a break.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning practice tight end Tony Gonzalez slipped on
the wet grass and got his right hand stepped on. Cunningham said
tests revealed there was no break and the All-Pro continued to
practice.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the 84 players on New England's roster sat out
rainy-day workouts with various injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick, however, said he was encouraged by his
training staff's reports and expected several players to return for
Monday night's preseason opener in Canton, Ohio, against the San
Francisco 49ers.
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   Another link to the Jack Kent Cooke era was severed when Joe
Mendes resigned as chief contract negotiator for the club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided to do something else with the rest of my life,''
Mendes said in a statement released by the team. ''At some point
you have to reassess your career path. I reached that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes' resignation came after the very contentious Stephen
Davis holdout and an exhausting week of talks getting rookies Chris
Samuels and LaVar Arrington into camp. It was Mendes, known as
tough bargainer, who delivered the offer that prompted Davis to
walk out of a negotiating session in February.
</P>
<P>
   Davis finally signed a one-year deal Saturday, although Mendes
wasn't instrumental in that agreement. Instead, Mendes was spending
most of the week at a nearby hotel completing Arrington's complex,
seven-year contract, also signed Saturday.

<HEADLINE> One More Time: Titans vs. Rams  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- The game is billed as Super Bowl 34 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day practice and scrimmage between the St. Louis Rams
and Tennessee Titans that starts Thursday is the first meeting
between the teams since the Super Bowl. The isolated training camp
setting lessens the magnitude, as does the fact the teams play an
exhibition next month in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But not that much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake, there will be no illusions, there will be a
war,'' defensive tackle D'Marco Farr said. ''They're still mad they
came up a yard short.''
</P>
<P>
   Farr is fired up and he's not even going to participate, due to
arthroscopic knee surgery in June.
</P>
<P>
   Other Rams are equally enthusiastic. They can only imagine how
the Titans, who lost 23-16 when Mike Jones tackled Kevin Dyson a
yard-and-a-half short of the end zone on the game's final play,
feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say we're two teams that love each other,''
tight end Roland Williams said. ''And I don't know how you keep it
from getting too intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Isaac Bruce said he wasn't looking forward to the
scrimmage, but even he was trash talking a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll probably start it off, and we'll probably finish it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup calls for two days of joint workouts, with the Rams'
offense going against the Titans' defense and vice versa, and a
scrimmage on Saturday. The Rams haven't been a huge draw in
training camp, with around 100 or so watching during weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage, however, is a 15,000-seat sellout. And the Super
Bowl can't help but intrude on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Farr said he got excited watching a tape of the telecast
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, after playing in it I was still sweating,'' Farr
said. ''It was just awesome. Watching the game, I forgot we won.
'We've got to stop these guys, we've got to stop these guys,'
jumping up and down and yelling 'Yay, we won.'''
</P>
<P>
   The key will be moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to calm down and realize it's just
practice,'' Titans wide receiver Chris Thomas said. ''It's not the
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting subplot is the return of offensive tackle Fred
Miller, who jumped from the Rams to sign a free-agent deal in
Tennessee in the offseason. Miller is looking forward to another
trip to isolated Macomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small town, a lot of great people, a lot of great
fans,'' Miller said. ''They really make you feel like you're at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches would like to bill it as a chance to improve the
quality of practices while breaking the monotony of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys are kind of looking forward to seeing another body
over there, somebody different,'' new Rams coach Mike Martz said.
''The tempo picks up. But you don't win scrimmages and practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher said it will be challenging for his
team to try to contain the Rams' explosive offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be a good challenge for them because of the multiple
things we do on defense,'' Fisher said. ''I know both clubs are
really looking forward to getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are isolated in Western Illinois, so scrimmages involve
a lot of travel. The previous three years, they worked out against
the Colts, meeting them basically halfway, in Champaign, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 practices, players are ready for some variety, any
variety. Middle linebacker London Fletcher said meeting the Titans
is nothing special because the Rams won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just another way for me to get ready,'' Fletcher said.
''A lot of guys will be hyped about it. I'm hyped anyway,
regardless.''

<HEADLINE> S.Koreans Remember No Gun Ri Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NO GUN RI, South Korea (AP) -- With poems, prayers and tears,
survivors and relatives on Wednesday commemorated the 50th
anniversary of an alleged mass killing of hundreds of civilians by
U.S. troops at a railroad bridge early in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In summer heat, several hundred people bowed and burned incense
at a makeshift altar in an underpass where survivors said many
victims were trapped and killed in a hail of gunfire. Trains
periodically passed overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like today, that day was sweltering too,'' said Chung
Eun-yong, chairman of a survivors' group, the Committee for
Unveiling Truth at the No Gun Ri Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy occurred in a small suffocating space where even
breathing was difficult and moving your body an inch was extremely
painful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Pentagon and South Korea opened inquiries last year
after The Associated Press quoted U.S. veterans and South Korean
survivors as saying American GIs carried out a mass killing of
refugees July 26-28, 1950, at the hamlet of No Gun Ri. Ex-GIs spoke
of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The South Koreans say up to
300 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged shootings were preceded by an aerial strafing of a
refugee column in which survivors and ex-GIs estimate about 100
civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. archival documents showed that orders were issued in the
early weeks of the war to U.S. ground troops and Air Force planes
to open fire and prevent civilian refugees crossing the American
lines for fear they may have included enemy infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
   Chung and other survivors, who want compensation, have
complained that Washington has been slow to release information on
its investigation. The U.S. military has denied accusations that it
was not sharing enough information with South Korean investigators.
The Pentagon says the work won't be finished until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service, 74-year-old Sohn Hyun-uk was among the
survivors who described the shooting at No Gun Ri, 100 miles
southeast of the capital of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw sparks from rifles firing on the hills in the distance
and then bullets ricocheted on the concrete walls like beans
popping around in a hot frying pan. People died,'' said Sohn, whose
14-year-old brother died under the railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean investigators have found 316 bullet marks and 59
bullets or bullet fragments stuck in the concrete walls of the
bridge, according to Seoul's defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, 63-year-old Yang Hye-suk, lost her left eye in
the shooting. Her grandmother and two brothers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel a lot of pain. The uncovering of truth doesn't
help me at all. When I am busy doing family chores, then I forget
this tragedy,'' Yang said. ''But whenever I hear news about No Gun
Ri, then the horrible scene comes to my mind and hurts me again.''

<HEADLINE> Big Game still waiting for holder of winning Bergen County ticket  </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Someone in New Jersey overcame long lottery
odds to become a millionaire but never bothered to come forward to
claim the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Is the winner away on vacation or just gathering friends and
family in preparation? Perhaps the ticket is hidden somewhere among
a sheaf of papers.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, whoever bought the winning ticket in Bergen County
has about a year to claim $23.7 million in winnings from the Big
Game lottery drawn June 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice that we sell winning tickets. But it's much nicer
that we have the winner come forward,'' said Virginia E. Haines,
New Jersey Lottery executive director. ''Sometimes you wonder if
someone put it in a suit pocket or a notebook or a newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   If the prize isn't claimed one year after the date of the
drawing, New Jersey and the six other states get back the money
they sent to the multistate Big Game pool. The game is played in
New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, 30 percent of that returned money goes to the
state treasury, earmarked for a limited group of institutions and
educational funding, Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   The other 70 percent remains in an unclaimed prize fund. At the
end of the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, that unclaimed
money also goes to the state treasury, also earmarked for
educational spending and funding to some state institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs and institutions are overseen by the state
departments of Education, Higher Education, Human Services, Law and
Public Safety and Military and Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education was allocated about $51.6 million in
fiscal year 1998, according to a report from the New Jersey State
Lottery, which contained the latest numbers, but didn't indicate
how much was from unclaimed prize funds.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says the Department of Higher Education received
about $170 million and the Department of Human Services got $318
million. Also, $4.5 million went to the Department of Law and
Public Safety and $18.6 million went to the Department of Military
and Veterans Affairs, according to the 1998 report.
</P>
<P>
   The winning ticket from June 9 was the only winner out of 2.6
million sold in the seven-state lottery. The winning numbers were
6, 7, 25, 34, 45, and the ''Big Gold Money Ball'' number 2. The
winner opted for the cash option of about $23.7 million before
taxes, instead of $46 million spread over 26 annual payments.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said they hope the winner comes forward before
the money is absorbed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd sort of feel bad, but the law is the law,'' said Haines.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's first Big Game winner, Carlos Toscano, 67, of
Lakewood, came forward last December to claim his $13 million
jackpot drawn Nov. 23. Toscano took the cash value payment of
$6,572,293.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has participated in the Big Game since May 1999 and
has quickly become the leading state in ticket sales, topping 295
million tickets since then, about 27 percent of sales. For Monday
night's drawing, the state sold 3.5 million tickets between
Saturday and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The same rules apply to other lottery games played in New
Jersey, such as the Pick 6 Lotto. In that game, there have been
four multimillion dollar prizes that went unclaimed.

<HEADLINE> Woods Films Commercial in Canada  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh off his historic victory in the British Open, Tiger Woods
broke ranks from the Screen Actors Guild's strike by filming a
commercial Wednesday in Canada for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was in the Toronto area for a Buick commercial. The
30-second spot shows Woods winning a number of track and field
events in the Sydney Olympics using only his golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger is very empathetic toward actors and entertainers,''
agent Mark Steinberg said. ''All he's doing is living up to his
contractual obligations. He's an athlete. He has to uphold his
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods signed a five-year, $30 million deal with General Motors
late last year and carries the Buick brand on his golf bag.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists,
which represent about 135,000 actors, went on strike May 1. The
unions want to change the advertising industry's pay structure.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and other athletes who make TV commercials are mandatory
members.
</P>
<P>
   He went along with the strike in May by canceling commercial
shoots for Nike, his top sponsor, which were supposed to be shown
the week of the U.S. Open. That proved costly when Woods won at
Pebble Beach by a record 15 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Shaquille O'Neal made a commercial by saying, ''I'm
going to Disneyland'' after the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA
title, and Olympic sprinters Michael Johnson and Marion Jones made
commercials for Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Woods did not technically break the strike
because the spot was filmed in Canada. SAG spokeswoman Ilyanne
Kichaven disagreed and said Woods could be subject to disciplinary
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a commercial being done in Canada, it is breaking
the strike,'' Kichaven said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, has become the most marketable figure in sports.
After shattering records to win the U.S. Open, he became the
youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam with another
record-setting performance in the British Open at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Buick said while it was aware of the strike, it was only
protecting its interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We delayed this shoot as long as we possibly could,''
spokesman John Wray said, referring to the Olympic theme of the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He said Buick would continue to develop TV commercials only as
needed, but will do what it must to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   It was Woods' first commercial since SAG went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''His only stance is being loyal to his sponsors,'' Steinberg
said. ''Tiger's position is, 'If I was an actor, I probably
wouldn't be doing this (filming the commercial). But my trade is
sports. I'm an athlete.'''

<HEADLINE> Three Greystone doctors fired in connection with patient death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - Three doctors at Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital have been fired in connection with two patient
deaths earlier this year, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were not responsible for the deaths but were slow to
treat the patients or failed to diagnose them properly, state
officials said Tuesday. No criminal charges were filed against the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cohen, a former Greystone chief of medicine, Jan Barnes and
Lawrence Dalglish all were escorted from the hospital on July 12,
state Department of Human Services spokeswoman Pam Ronan said.
Ronan said the doctors were dismissed for neglecting their duties,
but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was fired in connection with the death of Dominick
Constantino, 56, of Totowa, who died of a heart attack May 6 in the
hospital, state officials told The Star-Ledger of Newark in
Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Cohen did not immediately respond to a call
for help and suggested that a nurse find a medical doctor on call,
state officials said. Cohen was not on duty but was in his office
when the patient collapsed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Dalglish were dismissed for allegedly failing to
properly treat James Giorgianni, 46, of Fredon. Giorgianni died of
pneumonia March 4, two weeks after being sent from Greystone to
Morristown Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dalglish prescribed Tylenol to Giorgianni for a fever, but
failed to write a report on the prescription, state investigators
found. Dalglish then left Giorgianni's case the next day to Barnes,
who found nothing wrong with the patient, investigators said.
Barnes failed to file a progress report on his actions, state
officials said. Giorgianni went to the hospital the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are expected to appeal their dismissals. Home
telephone numbers listed in Dalglish and Cohen's name went
unanswered on Wednesday. Barnes did not immediately respond to a
telephone message left at his home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three doctors were among those who signed a complaint letter
in April to Gov. Christie Whitman criticizing hospital
administrators. The hospital's medical staff sent a letter to state
officials protesting the dismissals and accused administrators of
targeting the doctors for their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely not true. We took actions based on our
investigations,'' said Human Services spokesman Edward Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman decided in April to close Greystone over the next three
years after decades of problems that included attacks on patients,
patient suicides and overcrowding at the 600-bed facility.

<HEADLINE> Titans, Pickens Near Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Negotiating face-to-face apparently has
helped the Tennessee Titans convince wide receiver Carl Pickens to
join the reigning AFC champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans called a news conference for 6:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday,
and general manager Floyd Reese said a deal was close.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got something now they're mulling over and if it's
something they can handle, we can handle, then we're probably real
close to having a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''they'' Reese mentioned really is just Pickens, who has
been negotiating with the Titans by himself the past two days.
Asked Wednesday if he would have anyone look over a new contract,
Pickens said he knows what to look for after eight years in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my third time going through this situation,'' said
Pickens, who signed a five-year, $23 million contract with the
Bengals last year. ''I'm the one that has to deal with the deal at
the end of the day, so I kind of know what I want. I can come down
here and sell myself. I don't need an agent to tell me yea or nay
over a contract I can read and understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens starred at the University of Tennessee in the early
1990s, has friends in Nashville and would be closer to his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest with you, I think I will be here. It's just a
matter of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have wanted Pickens since the Cincinnati Bengals
released him last week, ending an acrimonious eight-year
relationship. Tennessee finally lured him to town Tuesday morning,
and he has been meeting with team officials, coaches and players
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens has talked with Pro Bowl running back Eddie George,
backup quarterback Neil O'Donnell and receiver Yancey Thigpen.
O'Donnell played with Pickens in Cincinnati in 1998, and Thigpen's
injury is why the Titans so desperately want to sign Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen has been slow to recover from ankle surgery in April and
may miss most of training camp. That would leave Kevin Dyson as the
Titans' only receiver with a 50-catch season on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens caught 57 passes in 1999 in what was essentially a down
year. He left Cincinnati holding team records for career receptions
(530) and touchdown catches (63).
</P>
<P>
   The Titans should have enough room under the salary cap to sign
Pickens but may need to clear some more room if they have to find
help for the secondary, because cornerback Donald Mitchell hurt his
knee in practice Tuesday. Receiver Chris Sanders, who caught only
20 passes last season, could be a cap casualty since his salary
will count $1.4 million against the cap this season.

<HEADLINE> Lott Makes China Trade Bill Motion  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott took a
preliminary step Wednesday toward Senate consideration of a
historic China trade bill. The legislation faces numerous
obstacles, and a final vote will not come until September.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., made a motion to proceed to the debate on the
legislation that would make permanent China's normal trade status
with the United States. A vote on that motion could occur Friday,
the last day before Congress recesses for the month of August.
</P>
<P>
   While the measure was purely procedural, Lott has said he wanted
to show his commitment to move the bill quickly when Congress
reconvenes after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we come back in September, this will be an issue that we
can go to soon rather than later in the month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the outgrowth of a major trade accord under which
China agreed to open its markets to American products and runs
parallel to U.S. support for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. The House passed the legislation in May, and
supporters, including the White House and business groups, have
pressed the Senate to follow suit as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for Senate passage during July have been dashed by
unrelated squabbles between the parties that have put the chamber
behind schedule and by the unresolved issue of how to address
concerns over Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
have legislation that would impose sanctions if China violates
agreements on exporting weapons. The Clinton administration opposes
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade bill are trying hard to keep the
proposal from being offered as an amendment to the trade bill, a
move that would require the bill to be sent back to the House for
another vote.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is agreeable to having his measure attached to another
bill, but is ready to offer it to the trade bill if there are no
other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has made concessions to address some concerns of his
bill's critics and ''if they force it onto PNTR (permanent normal
trade relations) it is going to be a very tough vote'' for those
who want to show their opposition to China's proliferation
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he had broadened the bill to cover key suppliers
of weapons beyond China such as Russia and North Korea, given the
president more flexibility in applying sanctions and made clear
that the bill's penalties apply only to companies of key supplier
countries, not to U.S. companies and workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Pat Roberts, R-Kan., leading
supporters of the trade bill, said in a letter to other senators
that even with modifications, the Thompson bill ''would reverse
course and return the U.S. to the failed strategy of mandatory
unilateral sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said his organization was still ''totally opposed''
to the Thompson measure because it ''broadens the number of
countries hit and still uses unilateral sanctions that don't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lott ''showed a lot of guts'' in initiating action on
the China bill in the face of political opposition. Jasinowski also
wrote Wednesday to Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
who also supports the trade bill, urging him to work with Lott
because ''PNTR must not fall victim to disagreements over other
political priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill is H.R. 4444. The Thompson bill is S. 2645.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Cut off Palestinian aid if statehood declared  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said U.S. aid to
Palestinians should be cut off if they unilaterally declare
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be clear that any unilateral declaration of
Palestinian statehood would be entirely unacceptable and should be
met with a cutoff of United States assistance,'' she said in a
statement released Tuesday night, after the Camp David peace talks
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Her position appeared to go beyond what President Clinton has
said in urging the Israelis and the Palestinians to keep trying to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a Wednesday afternoon news conference if she thought
she was going beyond the position of her husband's administration,
she said: ''I may be. It's what I believe. ... Aid should be
conditional on people acting in a way that leads to a permanent and
lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   She also praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak while saying
little about Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Prime Minister Barak showed enormous courage, vision
and extraordinary commitment to these peace talks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her assessment of Arafat, she said: ''He participated
and I hope will continue to participate in the ongoing discussions
that were promised at the end of Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   A trilateral statement from the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians on the Camp David summit said that both sides
''understand the importance of avoiding unilateral actions,'' but
Arafat has threatened to declare statehood if no agreement is
reached by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is seeking to shore up her pro-Israel credentials
as she wages a tough campaign for the Senate in New York. Jews make
up 12 percent of the electorate here. Polls show about 15 percent
of them are undecided about whether to support her or her
Republican opponent, Long Island Congressman Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also favors cutting off Palestinian aid if
statehood is unilaterally declared, and previously cosponsored
legislation recommending the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Senate campaign has been involved in a number of
flaps involving Jewish issues, including the meeting last year of
the first lady and Arafat's wife that resulted in their
much-publicized kiss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the first lady spurred controversy when she said that a
Palestinian state was ''very important'' to Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   In other events Wednesday, Lazio mocked the Clinton campaign for
booking the first lady to speak on a Pennsylvania radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The station, WLKK-AM in Erie, Pa., has some listeners across the
border in Chautauqua County, N.Y., but that is not its primary
market.
</P>
<P>
   Station program director Jeff Johns said he believed Clinton
''thought she was talking to a Buffalo, N.Y., radio station.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the show, Clinton said: ''Last week, I was
up your way talking about my upstate economic agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns never told her the station is based in Pennsylvania and
ended the interview by telling her: ''I hope you come back for our
listeners in the southern tier of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she knew she was speaking on a Pennsylvania-based
station, Clinton said: ''I don't remember.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivors Settlement OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge approved a historic $1.25
billion settlement Wednesday between Swiss banks and more than a
half-million plaintiffs who alleged the banks hoarded money
deposited by Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman
brings Holocaust victims and their heirs worldwide a step closer to
collecting claims against the banks.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, the judge said the words of Holocaust survivor
Ernest Lobet best summarized his own feelings about the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no quarrel with the settlement,'' Korman quoted Lobet
as saying. ''I do not say it is fair, because fairness is a
relative term. No amount of money can possibly be fair under those
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Korman now must sign off on a plan, still in the works, for
dividing and distributing the settlement -- the final phase of a
painstaking global campaign to compensate roughly 600,000
claimants.
</P>
<P>
   Under a distribution plan being drawn up by a court-appointed
special master, Judah Gribetz, officials will use bank and other
records to determine if claims are valid. A draft of Gribetz's plan
is due within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
hailed Korman's decision as ''a belated victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After more than a half century, a measure of justice has been
achieved for the victims of the greatest crime of the century,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Roger Witten said the banks have already put
$550 million in escrow in anticipation of starting payments,
possibly before the end of this year. ''We're as anxious as anybody
to get this money out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings last year, attorneys from both sides told Korman
that an overwhelming majority of the plaintiffs in the class-action
lawsuit supported a proposed out-of-court settlement reached in
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Holocaust victims who deposited money in
Swiss banks for safekeeping as the Nazis gained power in Europe,
expecting to retrieve it later.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the plaintiffs claimed, they ran into a stone
wall in trying to claim the assets. In some cases, they lacked
detailed account information; some bankers even demanded
impossible-to-obtain death certificates of people killed in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers Jews and other Holocaust victims who lost
money in Swiss accounts, as well as those whose belongings were
plundered by the Nazis and apparently wound up in Switzerland, a
wartime depository for gold and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year independent investigation headed by Paul A.
Volcker, the former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, found that up to
54,000 accounts may have been opened by Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued last year by Volcker cleared the banks of
systematic destruction of records of victims' accounts, but said
there was evidence of ''deceitful actions by some individual
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, the two largest Swiss banks -- Credit Suisse Group AG and
UBS AG -- agreed to grant access to databases containing 2.1 million
Holocaust-era accounts to help speed payments to victims.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Wednesday, Lobet -- a Glen Cove, N.Y., attorney who
spent more than two years as a slave laborer in Auschwitz -- said
though he was thankful to be part of Korman's ruling, the
settlement itself is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I going to be compensated for Auschwitz? Obviously not,''
he said. ''But at least it's an acknowledgment that something is
owed to the victims. .... It's the best that could be done under
the circumstances. It's time to close the books.''

<HEADLINE> Canada Gives N.Korea Recognition  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada extended diplomatic recognition to North
Korea on Wednesday, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy
said talks on establishing formal diplomatic ties would soon begin.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy, in Bangkok, Thailand, attending the Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum, made the announcement after talks with
North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in the first ministerial
level meeting between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   In officially recognizing North Korea, Canada joined Italy as
the only major Western nations in the G-8 grouping of industrial
powers to take the diplomatic step.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some time now, the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)
has been reaching out to the international community and attempting
to increase the number of countries with which it has foreign
relations,'' Axworthy said. ''Canada welcomes this initiative, and
intends to assist (North Korea) to integrate itself into
international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a statement by Prime Minister Jean
Chretien at the recent G-8 summit in Okinawa, Japan, that welcomed
the recent Korean summit and what it called a constructive attitude
by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's recognition comes as North Korea tries to reposition
itself in the international arena after decades as one of the
world's most isolated, unpredictable regimes.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has established diplomatic ties with Italy,
Australia and the Philippines this year in what analysts see as an
attempt to win badly needed economic aid to rebuild its devastated
economy. The Pyongyang government is in talks with Britain, the
United States and Japan to try to open talks to normalize ties.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea became a member of the United Nations in 1991, but
it only joined a second international group when Paek attended the
ASEAN Regional Forum this week.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic recognition is a key step in a process leading to
formal relations, which entail setting up embassies in each other's
country.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said Canada began the process of normalizing relations
with North Korea in 1998. Bilateral missions, including two by
Canada to North Korea, set up the meeting Wednesday in Thailand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a much anticipated moment for both countries,''
Axworthy said. ''I look forward to establishing official channels
of diplomatic communication in order to broaden and deepen
understanding and relations between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassies in Beijing now would begin talks on technical
issues of establishing formal relations, which Axworthy said ''will
take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which fought alongside the United States in the Korean
War five decades ago, had never recognized North Korea. Axworthy
noted that despite the lack of formal relations, Canadian
nongovernment organizations had worked in North Korea since the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A major security issue -- North Korea's missile program --
continues to worry the United States and other countries. North
Korea shocked East Asia by test-firing a long-range missile that
flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean nearly two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The North's missile program is a key factor in the U.S. drive to
develop a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy told reporters Wednesday he hoped that recognizing
North Korea and starting talks on formal relations would give
Canada ''a much more direct, active and ongoing connection'' that
it could use to discuss ''the need to limit both the missile
technology and the development of missile systems.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Another batch of disappointing earnings reports
pushed stock prices lower Wednesday and left worried investors
mulling the possibility of shrinking profits in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 183.49 at
10,516.48.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index rebounded from a loss of more than 100 points early in the
session to end down 41.85 at 3,987.72. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 22.05 at 1,452.42.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worst fears for the coming months seemed to be
confirmed Wednesday when car maker DaimlerChrysler said 2000
profits would fall below 1999 figures, despite solid first-half
results. DaimlerChrysler's stock rose $1.313 to $53.563 in spite of
the dismal forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Xerox Corp. chairman and chief executive Paul
Allaire said Xerox investors should make a ''significant downward
adjustment to current second-half expectations.'' In other words,
earnings will slow over the next six months. The copy machine
maker's shares fell $3.313 to $14.875.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Dow Jones indexes technology components lost ground,
led by computer maker Hewlett Packard, down $5.375 to $110.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone was set long before trading began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor maker LSI Logic Corp. and business software
company BMC Software Inc. announced after the close of trading
Tuesday that second-quarter earnings were below analysts'
expectations. LSI Logic was down $8.375 at $32.625, and BMC
Software fell $1.562 at $16.938.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic could take hold on Thursday. Internet retailer
Amazon.com reported after the close of trading Wednesday that its
second quarter losses were bigger than a year ago. Investors
promptly knocked the stock down about 8 percent in after hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern that has emerged since earnings season began two
weeks ago is that investors respond to disappointing results by
pummeling the offending stocks, as well as their respective
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that trend Wednesday, semiconductor shares were
down across-the board, and software companies were among the
hardest hit within the broad technology sector. Vignette Corp. was
down $4.875 at $38.75, Rambus shares were down $9.50 at $75.50.
Internet stocks also suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts believe investors may not be overreacting as
much as responding to more technical forces.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh response to weaker-than-expected earnings reports -- a
characteristic of the markets in recent sessions -- is simply
investors reversing course from a rally that followed the broad
selloff in technology stocks earlier this year, said Richard Hoey,
chief economist and chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some high-profile disappointments -- namely from
Microsoft, Intel and Apple -- the majority of companies are beating
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that across the breadth of the numbers we've
seen so far that it's been disappointing. It's really been a mix, a
cross-current. But the impact has been mostly negative,'' Hoey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have proven especially fickle in recent days, ready to
pounce on any news that might provide a direction. For example, on
Tuesday, stocks rose after AT&AMP;T and Texas Instruments beat Wall
Street earnings forecasts, giving a boost to the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of focus should continue until more detailed economic
data is released later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.47 billion shares,
up from Tuesday's pace of 1.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.52 at 513.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.43 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.37 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.06 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.45 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Primary Size Plan Adopted  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A GOP plan to hold presidential primaries in
four waves, with small states going first in February and large
states last in May, was adopted by a panel of the Republican
National Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal, known as the Delaware plan, faces stiff
opposition from some of the largest states, and must clear three
more hurdles in the next week. The RNC rules committee adopted the
plan after initially voting for it in Indianapolis in May by a
3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gotten this through two steps, but there are some big
gorillas out there,'' said Basil Battaglia, chairman of the
Delaware Republican Party. He acknowledged that the opposition of
big states like New York and California could sink the plan before
it is passed by the full Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential
primary, would not be given a special exemption to retain its place
under the approved plan. New Hampshire GOP chairman Steve Duprey
said there was no point in raising the issue Wednesday since it was
unclear whether the state had the votes to get an exemption and
whether the Delaware plan would survive the next few days. Iowa's
caucus would retain its early status because of technical
amendments made Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will be considered by the full Republican National
Committee on Thursday, the convention's rules committee on Friday
and, if it survives, it could reach the convention floor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware plan was proposed as a way to cope with the
cramming of the nominating season into a smaller window of time
each election year as states jockey for the media spotlight and
money that go with early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By March 7 of this year, nominees for both parties had won
enough contests to settle the issue, leaving two-thirds of the
states without a voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has offered a compromise that would allow the 16 smallest
states to go first and then put the remaining states in groups
organized by region that would vote in rotating order each election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio GOP Chairman Bob Bennett said he offered that plan because
the Delaware proposal ''is not going to make it past the floor of
the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Small states do need a voice and do need to be relevant in the
process,'' Bennett said. ''But I understand why the big states are
coalescing to defeat the Delaware plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules committee also voted to allow flexibility in the rules
that would allow it to work on the timing of the primaries, even if
nothing is passed during the convention. That flexibility proposal
would have to pass the same series of votes as the primary plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have decided to stay with their current system for
now, allowing Iowa and New Hampshire to go first and restricting
other states to a window from the first Tuesday in March to the
second Tuesday in June. Republicans hope their actions could spur
movement by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   California's GOP executive director Jon Fleischman was urging
''no'' votes on the Delaware plan. He argued that states like
California and New York would be in an impossible situation because
of the heavy influence of Democrats in their states who wouldn't
cooperate with the GOP proposal. He proposed waiting until after
the election -- assuming a victory by George W. Bush -- so
Republicans could deal from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans feel something must be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing is right because members of both parties have
stated on numerous occasions that the current system is broken,''
said Tom Sansonetti, a Wyoming Republican who is chairman of the
RNC's rules committee. ''Two thirds of the states did not get to
participate this year and it's only going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the rules committee said the Bush campaign has been
neutral, but Bush clearly wants the message of the convention to be
harmonious, not a fierce floor fight over primary schedules.

<HEADLINE> Violinist Oscar Shumsky dead at 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RYE, N.Y. (AP) - Violinist Oscar Shumsky, a brilliant performer
who trained generations of successful younger artists, has died. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky died early Monday morning at his Rye home. He had been
suffering from heart disease during the last year, his son Noel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia to Russian immigrant parents, Shumsky
displayed his musical talent at an early age, first picking up a
violin when he was 3 years old. His father, an amateur player who
recognized his son's brilliance, took him to the Curtis Institute
of Music, where he was accepted as a student by violinist Leopold
Auer and was later taught by Efrem Zimbalist.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 9, Shumsky performed with the Philadelphia
Orchestra, and after graduating from Curtis in 1936, he began
playing around the world to widespread critical acclaim. He later
branched into conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky was a frequent performer at music festivals across the
country, as well as being featured at Lincoln Center's ''Great
Performer Series.''
</P>
<P>
   He trained generations of violinists at some of the nation's
most prestigious music schools, including the Curtis Institute, the
Peabody Conservatory, Yale University and, for 25 years, at the
Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky returned to the concert platform later in life, still
drawing dazzling reviews. He retired from concert performances
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Shumsky and his son Eric, also a
violinist, were collecting Shumsky's recordings to release on
compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his two sons, Shumsky is survived by two
grandchildren. His wife, Louise, died in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong completes Tour de New York  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - He was surrounded by so many handlers it must
have seemed as if Lance Armstrong were back with the pack on some
mountain road in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was a different sort of race - the Tour de New
York.
</P>
<P>
   There were morning talk shows, then a promotional appearance at
a store run by his Nike sponsor, complete with police barricades
clearing the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a satellite media tour that fed one interview after
another all across the country. Finally, the two-time champion of
the Tour de France made a trip to Wall Street, ending trading at
the New York Stock Exchange by banging a ceremonial gavel.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lance Armstrong Day in New York. And considering the
weather, it was a good thing he didn't bring his bike. But people
wait in a driving rain for an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   Fans packed the atrium of Niketown to catch a glimpse of the man
in the bright yellow shirt, the color of the Tour winner, a color
that is becoming more and more comfortable for Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The country's premier cyclist seemed embarrassed by all the
attention. He's just a down-to-earth guy from Austin, Texas, who
likes to ride his bike, a regular guy, who four years ago was given
less than a 40 percent chance to survive cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a job and I love what I do,'' Armstrong said. ''I
represent a sport and the cancer community. I'm not in it for the
money or notoriety or fame. I'm in it because I love it. The day I
don't, I'll go away.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen soon, though.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 days, he'll be back on the bike, beginning preparations
for the Olympics in Europe, first at the Tour of Burgos, then the
World Cup. He recalls the last time he tried for Olympic gold medal
in Atlanta. He was just starting a fight for his life with
testicular cancer that had spread through his body and into his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1996, two months before I was diagnosed, the illness was
raging,'' he said. ''It's not that I felt bad but I didn't compete
well. It's great to go back as a cured person or a healthy
person.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who are astonished by what Armstrong has
achieved. He's not one of them, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 2000, I'm not so much of a miracle,'' he said. ''Thirty
years ago, yes, it would have been a miracle. Thirty years ago, 95
percent of those who had testicular cancer died. Today, 95 percent
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is none of the other survivors has won the Tour
de France, a 23-day, 2,250-mile test of courage and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   And Armstrong has done it twice.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was fun. The second one was vindication.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Tour was still shaken from a drug scandal that
had thinned the field. That was not the case this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason, it was sweeter,'' Armstrong said. ''Everybody
was there. The course was not made for me. The course suited them,
not me.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tour changes every year. This was a harder Tour. Last
year, I didn't know the impact on my life and my career and my
team. Now, I understand what the Tour is, the meaning of it. I
crossed the finish line knowing that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time as he pedaled through the mountains that
Armstrong thought he might lose this race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was suffering physically,'' he said. ''I had run out of
energy and run out of fuel. More than that, I was scared. Suffering
in the mountains, you can lose 20 minutes. I was scared in the
mountains that I was going to lose it in one day. I was in a crisis
and I just tried to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was afraid to come down to dinner to face the other
members of the U.S. Postal Service team. ''I told them, 'I won't
let you down,''' he said. ''I rode hard but not too hard. If you
ride too hard, you burn out everything. I lost 1&AMP;frac12; minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He had enough of a cushion to survive the crisis. And
considering the one he'd faced before, this one was easy.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the challenge of Sydney, where he will be one of the
favorites, especially in the individual time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my third Olympics,'' he said. ''The first two were
disappointments. I would like to have Olympic glory in my career.''

<HEADLINE> Migraine Hits Bears' Daniels Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Defensive end Phillip Daniels was
forced off the Chicago Bears practice field for the second straight
day Wednesday because of a migraine headache.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your head starts thumping and it's just hard to stand up. Your
vision is blurred. I couldn't see for a while,'' said Daniels, who
signed a five-year $25 million free agent contract after playing
four seasons with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said it is a common for him to get headaches during the
early days of practice when contact drills begin. He's tried
several pain relievers. But none seem to work and tests have not
revealed the cause of the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   He experienced the headaches during training camp with the
Seahawks and said they usually last four days, leave and then don't
return.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year at the start of camp when we start hitting. I think
it has something do to with the contact. Then they leave and I
don't have any problems,'' he said. ''Basically, it puts you to
your knees. You just can't hold your head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears coach Dick Jauron said the team was aware of Daniels'
migraine problems before signing him.
</P>
<P>
   '' We didn't think it was a problem because he's never missed a
lot of time and never missed any regular-season time. We were
hoping it wouldn't occur, but I guess it does annually.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels began to feel better after he left the practice field
Wednesday. He said he would probably skip practice Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NBA referee pleads guilty to tax evasion  </HEADLINE>
dchoflsfons
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A National Basketball Association
referee pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to tax fraud in
connection with an airline ticket scam.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett L. Salvatore, who waived indictment, faces up to three
years in prison and could be fined up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore, 50, was one of about a dozen NBA referees accused of
not reporting income when they were reimbursed for first-class
airline tickets after buying less-expensive tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The referees' union contract allows them to downgrade their
first-class tickets to coach and keep the difference as a way of
supplementing their incomes. But they are required to report the
extra income to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New Haven said Salvatore submitted a tax
return for 1993 in which he falsely reported his income. They said
he failed to report about $39,000 he received from downgrading his
airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements made in U.S. District Court, Salvatore
obtained fake receipts for first-class tickets from a travel agency
in Columbia, S.C. He then submitted those receipts to the NBA to
verify that he had flown first-class, when he really flew coach,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore, who lives in Stamford, could not be reached for
comment. He has an unlisted telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 other NBA officials have pleaded guilty to similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were put on probation, fined a few thousand dollars
and ordered to pay their back taxes. Some also served short periods
of home detention. The NBA reinstated several of them.
</P>
<P>
   One referee, Steve Javie, was acquitted by a jury in
Philadelphia last year. He was the only referee to plead innocent
to the charges.

<HEADLINE> Twins, Red Sox Game Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- While Red Sox management haggled with the state's
political leaders over the funding for a ballpark to replace Fenway
Park, the Boston players went about the business of playing
baseball, largely ignoring the debate over their future home.
</P>
<P>
   With the final game of their series against the Minnesota Twins
rained out on Wednesday, the Red Sox left for a week-long West
Coast road trip. By the time they return, the Legislature probably
will have adjourned -- and if all goes as planned, it will approve
the state's share of the financing for the $665 million ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even think about that. I'm comfortable here,'' said
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who is one of the few current players
who is under contract to the team through the likely opening date
of the new ballpark in 2003 or 2004. ''I don't worry about the new
ballpark. That's not my concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The rainout was Boston's seventh of the season. The game will be
made up Sept. 7, at a time to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pushed scheduled starter Tim Wakefield back to
Thursday and moved Jeff Fassero back two days to allow Pedro
Martinez to stay on schedule for Friday. Ramon Martinez is to pitch
Sunday and Tomo Ohka to start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins moved Wednesday's scheduled starter, Mark Redman, to
Thursday and moved J.C. Romero to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway, built in 1912 and seating about 33,000, is the oldest
and smallest ballpark in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   To replace it, the team would spend $352 million to build a
44,000-seat ballpark across the street, the city would contribute
$140 million to buy the land and $72 million for a parking garage,
and the state would kick in $100 million on road and subway
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   To finance construction, the team agreed to a $5 parking
surcharge on spaces around the park on game days, a 5 percent tax
on most tickets and a 15 percent tax on luxury box tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still needs Legislative and City Council approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they get it. That isn't just from a player's
standpoint. I think it would good for the whole community,'' Red
Sox reliever Derek Lowe said. ''We travel around and see all the
new facilities. ... It would be nice to get it done, but it's not
set in stone, from my understanding. Hopefully, they can have it
open by 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of his teammates seemed unconcerned about the ballpark
deal, in part because the opening is so far off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chances are, I'm not going to be around to play in it,'' said
reliever Rod Beck, who is in the last year of his Red Sox contract.
''When things are go, and there's a timetable, that would be the
time to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others just focus on the field between the lines, not the stands
that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get paid to play the game,'' pitcher Pedro Martinez said.
''It can be a backyard for all I care.''

<HEADLINE> Critics say state failing to provide quality preschool to poor students </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Advocates who have sued New Jersey on
behalf of poor school children for more funding and better
facilities for decades said Wednesday they're willing to give the
state more time to implement court-ordered preschool programs.
</P>
<P>
   But not much more, said David Sciarra of the Education Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saying to the Whitman administration, give this a chance
to work. Let's see some leadership,'' Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how much longer he would wait for the state
to comply with a March state Supreme Court ruling ordering
high-quality programs for 3- and 4-year-olds, before pursuing more
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state has failed to meet the grade, Sciarra said at
a Statehouse news conference.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that children attending the state's 30
so-called special needs districts this fall will benefit from such
reforms as smaller class sizes and certified preschool teachers as
ordered by the court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is the culprit for failing to offer firm and timely
guidance to the districts to develop plans to comply with the court
order, and for not providing adequate funding to implement those
plans, Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   The law center's conclusion? ''Despite the Supreme Court's March
ruling requiring an overhaul and clarifying standards, most
children will not receive high quality preschool in September,''
Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials later denied Sciarra's charges, saying
the state has done its best to prepare and fund districts to meet
the court's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner David C. Hespe called a law center
report on the status of the state's preschool compliance
''seriously flawed and self serving to a fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of heeding the Supreme Court's advice to end its
adversarial relationship and collaborate with the state, the Law
Center has once again fanned the flames of mistrust and antagonism
by spreading mistaken and misleading information,'' Hespe said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Law Center report, only about 60 percent of the
approximately 50,000 eligible preschoolers will be enrolled this
fall. And the quality of their education will be uneven across the
state, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the districts, had no plan to limit class sizes to
the court-ordered maximum of 15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And only 15 of the districts had a plan to help teachers achieve
certification, also as ordered by the Supreme Court, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 districts, the department approved preschool plans
that did not ask for more state funds to meet the ruling's new high
standards, according to Sciarra. But it cut funding from plans that
asked for more state dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the department ordered some districts to reduce
enrollment, lower payments to community service providers, or
eliminate such extras as transportation, bilingual education and
staff training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They reduce (our aid) so they don't have to fund it. That's
basically it,'' said Ron Larkin, New Brunswick schools
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra demanded that state officials immediately develop
emergency procedures, including freeing up funding, to allow
schools to comply with the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''How clear do we have to be? Do we have to go back to court
again?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Barak Compromises May Bring Peace  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Compromises offered by Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak at the Camp David summit could be the starting point for
any renewal of efforts to make peace with the Palestinians,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But, President Clinton said Wednesday, ''a certain imagination
and flexibility'' in defining the interests of the two sides will
be required.
</P>
<P>
   ''That, frankly, just takes more time and more reflection'' than
the 15 days Barak and Arafat spent at the presidential retreat,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said in an exchange with reporters at the White House,
the leaders might do better without the kind of pressure they were
under at the summit talks.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak is known to have offered Yasser Arafat a
capital for a Palestinian state comprising some Arab neighborhoods
inside and some in the suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   However, Elyakim Rubinstein, the Israeli attorney general, said
the Palestinians were unwilling to make difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''An opportunity was missed,'' Rubinstein told the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, a research group here. ''All of us
could have gained from an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein, a member of the Israeli delegation at the talks, and
at the successful Israeli-Egyptian summit at Camp David in 1978,
said Jerusalem was the main sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   But he said other key issues also were not resolved, such as
borders and refugees. ''Although the coming weeks and months will
probably not be easy, it is clear that negotiations are the only
possible course,'' Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barak's proposal on Jerusalem, Israel would retain overall
sovereignty in the Old City and the Palestinians would have
autonomous management of Muslim holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   A road or bridge would provide free access for Muslims to the
sacred Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian capital would be called Al-Quds, the Arabic name
for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   These gestures, and offers by Barak to compromise on other core
issues, prompted praise from Clinton -- but not the approval of
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prime Minister Barak showed particular courage, vision and an
understanding of the historical importance of this moment,''
Clinton said Tuesday amid the collapse of a two-week peace effort
at the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat insisted on more -- all of East Jerusalem as a capital
under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the most difficult problem,'' Clinton said of
Jerusalem. ''And I must tell you that we tried a lot of different
approaches to it, and we have not yet found a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Palestinians gave Arafat a hero's welcome on his
return to Gaza. They praised him for his tough stand on Jerusalem.
''Arafat is no longer just a Palestinian leader,'' Selim Hashen
said. ''He is a leader of all the Arabs and all the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks ahead, Arafat will huddle with other Arab
leaders. A key question is whether they will bolster his tough
stand, or suggest he accept Barak's offer.
</P>
<P>
   With it comes a state, most of the West Bank and Gaza and
probably relocation of thousands of Palestinians to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli prime minister has ever taken a more dovish stand;
none ever has been so willing to surrender hard-won land.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not enough, even with Clinton's cajoling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say in anguish that we have not yet succeeded,''
Barak said on his return home, ''because we did not find a partner
that was prepared for hard decisions on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly disappointed, Clinton said Wednesday he was convinced,
nonetheless, ''that if the issue is preserving the fundamental
interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis, and the genuine
sanctity of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish interests in the holy
city, that I think we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, said
Wednesday there could be a ''honorable compromise'' on Jerusalem.
''I think there are many ways to meet the needs of both if they're
both prepared to see the larger picture here, which is to protect
their vital interests,'' he told CNN. But he said it would require
compromise on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum in
Philadelphia. said Arafat may have missed a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   There are doubts on the Israeli side about what Barak offered,
and he may not be able politically to repeat it, Pipes said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Syria also rejected in January a chance to recover
virtually all of the Golan Heights from Israel, Pipes said ''the
mood in the Palestinian Authority and the Arab world is
emphatically against compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, said Wednesday Arafat did little to create
an environment among his followers that would have made compromise
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Haass said Palestinian reconsideration of Arafat's stand on
Jerusalem ''is the only route to success,''
</P>
<P>
   Shibley Telhami, a colleague of Haass' at Brookings, said, on
the other hand, that Arafat deserved credit for ''important
compromises on important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not correct to say he was not flexible,'' Telhami said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Hiring More Disabled  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a light rain fell on President Clinton
and a crowd of people celebrating the 10th anniversary of the
Americans With Disabilities Act on Wednesday, he performed a simple
act that most people take for granted: He unfurled an umbrella and
held it over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the young people in wheelchairs behind him on stage
could not do the same, and White House aides scrambled to find a
motley assortment of golf umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of what the Americans with Disabilities Act is all about
is to make sure that people can live like people, can do things
other folks take for granted,'' Clinton said to applause from the
crowd of activists, disabled people and their families at the
Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   FDR's use of a wheelchair was a secret from most Americans. He
and his aides worried that his disability would be taken as a sign
of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that stigma has been erased since FDR's time, but
Clinton said too many disabled people still face needless daily
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody counts, everybody deserves a chance, everybody has a
role to play, we all do better when we help each other,'' Clinton
said. ''That's what this memorial represents, that's what the ADA
represents, that's America at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark the anniversary of the law barring discrimination and
requiring wheelchair ramps and other accommodations for the
disabled, Clinton asked federal agencies to hire 100,000 people
with disabilities over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed federal agencies to recruit disabled candidates
for jobs at every level in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want excuses. Instead, they want opportunity in
terms of jobs and careers,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also unveiled a new Web site entitled Access America
providing information to disabled people and their families on a
variety of topics such as employment, entrepreneurship,
transportation, health care, education and support services.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the young people on this stage, you know you
have given them a better today,'' Clinton said of the dozen or so
disabled youngsters on stage with him. ''We should leave here
committed to giving them a better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a new ''youth to
work initiative'' to help ease the transition from school to work
for disabled young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passing the ADA was the beginning, not the end, of our
commitment to ensure all people have the rights they are entitled
to,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We have a new generation of Americans
who want to work, expect to work, are graduating from high school,
going to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists in Texas commemorated the anniversary a different way:
filing a lawsuit against a country club and nine other defendants
around the state. They say the suit is meant as a wake-up call for
uncooperative businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been great change ... but there's still a lot to do,''
said James Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project,
one of the plaintiffs. ''There's still some hard hearts out there
that need to be reminded.''

<HEADLINE> Saratoga Race Course a family hangout  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - The words ''betting'' and ''horse
racing'' hardly evoke an image of the family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday's opening day, Saratoga Race Course proved
again the thoroughbreds here are a tradition enjoyed as much by the
generations as the gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in exclusive box seats or on the lawn with coolers and
blankets, most attending Saratoga Race Course have been doing so
for years, and bringing their families.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Marie McGonigle, from Boston, sit on the lawn every
year so they can enjoy the sun and their cooler full of beer and
soda.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been bringing our two sons for 15 years,'' Bill said as
he paid for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Vetter, a 38-year-old Saratoga Springs native who started
working security at the track when he was 16, said the mystique of
Saratoga is what keeps people coming back year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the aura of the place,'' said Vetter. ''Other tracks are
sleazier. Here it's more reserved, with more black-tie events, and
people get all dressed up. First race of the year, I get goose
bumps just being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vetter is among those who pay a little extra for the goose
bumps, enjoying a day at the races from the luxury of box seats.
The seats - which average around $4,000 a year - are coveted by
race fans, who can stay on a waiting list for years before a box
opens up.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from the boxes is worth the wait, Vetter said,
pointing to the boxes around him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's George Steinbrenner's box,'' he said. ''In front of you
is Wayne Lukas - he's the top trainer in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Marylou Whitney, the social grand dame of Saratoga, sat in her
front row box seat dressed in a wide mauve hat and suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started coming here in 1959,'' she said. ''It is very
traditional. My son and daughter are working or they would be here
with the grandchildren - that's why we have seven chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Schwartz, who is seen as Whitney's social heir apparent,
nodded toward her husband - Calvin Klein CEO Barry Schwartz - and
said, ''We met on a blind date at a track. It's perfect, a lot of
fun and no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has come to Saratoga Race Course for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   People agree there is something unique about newly renovated
Saratoga's ambiance: Unique enough to draw 27,810 people out on an
overcast opening day, the 132nd opener at historic Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn was dotted with families sprawled out on the grass or
huddled around umbrella-covered, big-screen television monitors
that broadcast the day's races.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Plow stuck her hand into a crib and gave her daughter's
hand a squeeze as co-worker Steve Geleta offered visitors beer,
chips or sodas. The pair was at the track as part of a company
function with scores of co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on our annual work picnic,'' Plow said. ''And Steve's
always like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it that makes Saratoga so special to people? That all
depends on who's asked. Opening day fans gave the music, the
people, the atmosphere and the social scene as reasons to keep
coming to the races.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to be seen in their hats and their fancy
sundresses,'' said Alan von Stetina, a bartender at the course for
12 years.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Warns States on Medicare  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government warned states on Wednesday to
end a practice by which they temporarily transfer money into their
own Medicaid programs to earn higher matching funds from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded letter, Timothy M. Westmoreland, director of
the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid,
said many states allow their Medicaid providers to keep only a
fraction of the nearly $2 billion generated by the transfers. In
some cases, he said, as little as 5 percent is properly allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the practice, which is legal under a loophole in laws
concerning Medicaid, some states transfer their own funds, borrowed
money or property taxes into state coffers to qualify for more
matching funds. The states then siphon off a portion of the federal
funds to use for non-Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
   The practice drives up the cost of Medicaid, the federal-state
program that provides health benefits to low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland said the states' estimates of federal Medicaid
spending for fiscal year 2000 have already increased by $3.4
billion over earlier projections -- with an estimated $1.9 billion
due to the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA officials say they became concerned recently as some states
have gotten more creative with their transfer programs and bolder
about using the matching funds for programs other than Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Some states simply keep a portion of the money in their general
fund for other programs. A Department of Health and Human Services
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said New Jersey has
used the money to fund tax cuts, while Kansas and Louisiana have
used it to trim budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, Nebraska has received $139 million in
matching Medicaid payments, but has paid only an estimated $500,000
to county-owned nursing homes that qualified for the money, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Seiffert, the administrator of the Nebraska Medicaid
program, said he wasn't familiar with the figure quoted, but
defended the state's use of Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that all our decisions on the use of federal
dollars are reasonable,'' he said. ''All expenditures are made in
accordance with our approved federal plan for Medicaid services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Westmoreland said 17 states are using the
transfers to get extra federal funding and 11 others are
considering the practice.
</P>
<P>
   He said the HCFA's inspector general's office, which
investigates possible waste, fraud and abuse, is examining how
states are using the Medicaid funds. The General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative and auditing arm, may also investigate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Medicaid officials say they have been using the so-called
intergovernmental transfers for years without a peep from the HCFA.
They contend that a change could lead to service cuts or nursing
homes not being able to afford to take new Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some states could lose millions in Medicaid payments under the
proposed change. It could dramatically reduce federal matching
funds in many states that have come to rely on the money to shore
up struggling county-run nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Intergovernmental transfers vary from state to state. Michigan
routes $300 million in state funds through county-run nursing homes
to increase its matching funds, which are then used for health
services for the poor. Louisiana plans to have county-run nursing
homes borrow money from banks and hand the funds over to the state,
which will use the money to boost what it can qualify for. The
loans are paid back out of the federal funds and nursing homes get
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid cost an estimated $181 billion last year. The federal
government's share was $103 million.

<HEADLINE> Shopping Channel Gets Election Fever  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The QVC shopping channel is getting election
fever.
</P>
<P>
   The cable TV marketer of housewares, jewelry and exercise gear
will put on a special show from the Republican National Convention
to hawk campaign buttons and other mementoes.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenirs will range from the inexpensive buttons to a
collection of lapel pins representing the 50 states and the
District of Columbia, valued at more than $250.
</P>
<P>
   A Waterford crystal jelly bean jar reminiscent of former
President Reagan was scratched from the list when it failed QVC
shipping tests, spokeswoman Bonnie Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to vendors selling official souvenirs at the
convention and around the city, the GOP said Wednesday it was
naming QVC the official national retailer to try to reach a wider
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Americans won't be here in person. By having a national
retail outlet, more people can take part,'' said Chip DiPaula,
convention manager for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The QVC connection was natural since Brian Roberts, president of
QVC owner Comcast Corp., is co-chairman of the convention host
committee, Philadelphia 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping channel has parked its orange broadcasting van at
the First Union Center, where the convention opens Monday, and
plans a one-hour live national broadcast on Saturday specifically
to peddle GOP souvenirs. A similar show is planned from the
Democratic National Convention opening Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first QVC broadcast from a national political
convention, though the shopping channel did a live show from
President Clinton's inauguration in 1997.

<HEADLINE> CDC leaves NJ after West Nile research with samples from four counties </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) - Centers for Disease Control officials left
New Jersey on Wednesday to await the results of tests on mosquitoes
and sparrows in four northern counties that could show how far west
the West Nile virus has spread.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC ended a two-week research project that was centered on
Bergen County, where seven dead crows have been found infected with
the virus this year. One dead crow was found in Middlesex County
and another in Hudson County last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Moore, a supervisory entomologist for the CDC, said the
agency will look for signs of infected mosquitoes in Bergen,
Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties to find out if the disease has
spread to western New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is collecting samples from sparrows to find out how
many antibodies birds have to defend themselves against the virus.
The CDC is testing sparrows instead of crows because crows are
exceptionally sensitive to West Nile and are not a good average
sample, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Test results are expected next week on 2,000 to 3,000 mosquitoes
collected in each county, and on samples from several hundred birds
in each county, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crows found in Bergen County and Rockland County,
N.Y., were located along a straight line along the Hackensack
River, which Moore said may or may not mean something. Mosquitoes
are known to breed in standing water.
</P>
<P>
   The birds were found quite a distance offshore, he said, but
''it looks too interesting to be pure chance.''
</P>
<P>
   State testing of 452 flocks of sentinel chickens and 405
mosquito-breeding areas have found no mosquitoes or chickens
infected with the disease, Bergen County Executive William ''Pat''
Schuber said. No humans have become infected.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people died last year in New York, when the West Nile
strain of encephalitis first surfaced in the region, sickening
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Schuber lashed out Wednesday at New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who said it would be preferable if some suburban counties
sprayed areas where the virus is detected more thoroughly. Schuber
said the county has spent $1.15 million on West Nile prevention
efforts this year and last year lent its trucks to New York City to
help spraying efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, this disease unfortunately started in the city of New
York,'' Schuber said. ''Our efforts ... are not only expensive,
they are expansive.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined comment on Schuber's remarks through a
spokeswoman.

   Reno had disqualified herself from the case when the matter
arose in 1995, telling her staff in a memo not to contact her
because ''a close personal friend'' was involved. The decision to
access the database was made by then-Associate Attorney General
John Schmidt, who in an interview defended his decision to overrule
a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah Poston, an acquaintance of Reno, sought arrest records
on a Japanese religious leader on behalf of a client. While Ms.
Poston successfully worked around the normal practice, she didn't
get the answer she wanted: She was informed there were no records
on the individual.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee planned a hearing Thursday
to examine whether Ms. Poston received favored treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators also raised questions, in an internal
memo, of whether private investigators working for Poston broke the
law by surreptitiously obtaining information from the database. The
private investigators told Poston they initially learned there was
an entry about the religious leader but speculated that it was
deleted after their inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department chief spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that
Reno and Poston worked for the same Miami law firm, Steel Hector &AMP;
Davis, but said they worked there at different times. He also
confirmed that Poston's sister, Roberta Forrest, worked on Reno's
successful campaign as Florida state attorney for Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a practice of not providing information on third
parties,'' Marlin said. ''In this case, we believed it was
appropriate to clear a person's name by indicating we had no
criminal record on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to provide the information was made by Schmidt, who
as associate attorney general was the department's No. 3 official
at the time. He said he recalls the 1995 decision but does not
remember Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt overruled the department's freedom of information
official, who initially turned Poston down because of the policy of
neither confirming nor denying information from the National Crime
Information Center database.
</P>
<P>
   Now a private attorney in Chicago, Schmidt said in an interview,
''I talked with anybody who wanted to complain about decisions made
within parts of the Justice Department that were my
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case we had no records. I concluded it made sense to
disclose that and put the matter to rest, and avoid the need to
litigate. I made exceptions in particular cases that did not
undermine the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to reach Poston's lawyers were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Government Reform Committee investigators, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said Poston told them in an interview that
she believed the department changed its practice in this case
because of her strong legal arguments. She pointed out that federal
privacy law does not apply to foreign citizens.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to discuss the work of the private investigators,
the committee sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing records indicate Poston was hired in 1994 by the
Japanese Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai to obtain criminal justice
records on Nobuo Abe, who led a rival Buddhist sect called Nichiren
Shoshu. The lawyer was attempting to confirm an account that Abe
was arrested in Seattle in 1963 for soliciting prostitutes --
information that never was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Poston retained the private investigation firm Philip Manuel
Resource Group to determine whether Abe had a record in the
database, according to committee documents. Investigator Richard
Lucas wrote Poston that he learned from ''a source within the U.S.
government'' that there was ''an inquiry for information'' on Abe
by the Seattle Police Department -- but not an arrest record.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staff memo said it could violate the law to
surreptitiously obtain information from the database. A federal
statute makes it illegal to obtain any government record with
intent to use it for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hiring the investigators, Poston tried to obtain
information through a freedom of information request with Justice.
The request was denied on Feb. 3, 1995, because of the department's
policy on the database.
</P>
<P>
   Poston contacted high-level Justice Department officials at
least 22 times in an effort to reverse the denial, and in April
1995, Reno said she wanted no part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, an attorney who is a close personal friend of mine
and participated in my confirmation hearing preparation, has
requested my intervention in the matter and I want to make it very
clear that I have chosen to disqualify myself from any
participation,'' Reno wrote in a memo to her staff. She did not
identify the individual who contacted her, although committee memos
said it was a now-deceased lawyer who worked for the Miami firm.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, 1995, Poston managed to obtain a meeting with
Schmidt and, eventually, was told that no record existed.

<HEADLINE> FTC Makes Internet Venture Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is seeking more
information from automakers and software companies about Covisint,
the Internet site being set up to handle billions of dollars worth
of online business in auto supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Covisint is the online joint venture between General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler AG, Renault and Nissan. The
companies buy $300 billion in goods and services every year, and
their suppliers make $700 billion to $800 billion in purchases a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to link thousands of suppliers over the Internet to
save money by cutting the paperwork and time needed for hundreds of
thousands of transactions. Before it can begin operations, Covisint
has to get approval from the FTC and European antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, one of the software companies building the site
for the automakers, said in a filing with the Securities Exchange
Commission that the FTC had recently asked for more information
about Covisint. Commerce One said it may take ''a significant
period of time'' to produce the information.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Covisint seeking comment were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Other software companies involved in Covisint include Oracle
Corp. and SAP.

<HEADLINE> Young Basketball Players Meet Old  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) -- As the ballplayers stroll past,
the tourists get giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Younger ones set their sights on the likes of Alonzo Mourning
and Ray Allen; the older ones point out Oscar Robertson and try to
tell their kids about the greatest player they've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Trying in different ways to bridge the gap between young and
old, more than 100 retired NBA players are holding their annual
meeting at a resort hotel this week in conjunction with the NBA
players' union.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups will hold a joint session Thursday morning,
looking for ways -- including, possibly, a mentoring program -- to
foster new relationships between the players of the past and the
players of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 20-somethings in the league have never stopped to
consider their long-term futures: What's life like after an NBA
playing career ends? How much money should be set aside? What else
can be done to prepare for a life after basketball?
</P>
<P>
   The retired players know, but they need a better way to get
their information across. By meeting with the union, they may find
a way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those guys are going through things that we are all going to
go through one day, and they can help us prepare,'' union president
Patrick Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   The retired players were around when the NBA was nothing near
the global giant that it is today, when pay was in the tens of
thousands instead of the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like now, there were unscrupulous people who preyed on
newly monied professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just like then, there's a need for players to get
advice from those who have been there before.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Davis, director of the XNBA (formerly called the Retired
Players Association) and a former director of player programs for
the NBA, has heard of all kinds of swindles.
</P>
<P>
   One player who lost a bundle was Bill Willoughby, who was in the
NBA from 1975-84 and was the first player to jump directly from
high school to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lived off a stipend for nine years, and when he retired and
went to get his money, it wasn't there,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants the members of his group to have a more open line
into the lives of current players, not just to help, but also to
talk and teach about the history of the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also would like a few things that can only come from
having a better relationship with the players' union:
</P>
<P>
   -- better pensions for retired players, which currently pay
$306.34 per month multiplied by years of service for players who
spent three or more seasons in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   -- more basketball-related employment opportunities for retired
players, with Davis claiming 10 percent of his 500-member XNBA is
looking to somehow get involved in the game again.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he has been an informal mentor to several NBA
players who have called him over the years seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   Often the topic is money, and how to handle so much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson tells them to play smart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would you rather have handle your money, an agent or some
company like Prudential? It's an easy question, but it's a big
problem in the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis entered the NBA in the early 1970s, he did what a lot
of young players do with their first rookie paycheck. He went out
and bought a Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than fritter away the rest of his money or put it
into a risky investment, he took the advice of teammate Willis Reed
and went with low-risk, conservative investments. Now, nearly 20
years after he retired as a player, Davis lives comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   It was the smart thing to do, even though it's not always the
easy thing when you're young and rich and living the NBA life. A
word from a wise old man could help every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of wisdom, experience and history to offer,''
said Howard Porter, who played for Chicago and Detroit from
1971-79. ''In pro sports you're often forgotten a year or two after
you retire from the playing field. But if you have something to
give like we do, you can be remembered for a lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- NBA referee Bennett Salvatore pleaded
guilty in federal court Wednesday to tax fraud in connection with
an airline ticket scam.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore, 50, who waived indictment, faces up to three years in
prison and could be fined up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of about a dozen NBA referees accused of not
reporting income when they were reimbursed for first-class airline
tickets after buying less-expensive tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The referees' union contract allows them to downgrade their
first-class tickets to coach and keep the difference as a way of
supplementing their incomes. But they are required to report the
extra income to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New Haven said Salvatore submitted a tax
return for 1993 in which he falsely reported his income. They said
he failed to report about $39,000 he received from downgrading his
airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements made in U.S. District Court, Salvatore
obtained fake receipts for first-class tickets from a travel agency
in Columbia, S.C. He then submitted those receipts to the NBA to
verify that he had flown first-class, when he really flew coach,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore, who lives in Stamford, Conn., could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 other NBA officials have pleaded guilty to similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were put on probation, fined a few thousand dollars
and ordered to pay their back taxes. Some also served short periods
of home detention. The NBA reinstated several of those officials.
</P>
<P>
   One referee, Steve Javie, was acquitted by a jury in
Philadelphia last year. He was the only referee to plead innocent
to the charges.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Mariners 1  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Tim Hudson bounced back from the worst start of
his career to allow one run in 7 1-3 innings and lead the Oakland
Athletics over the Seattle Mariners 6-1 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (11-3), who allowed nine runs and 12 hits in a 12-3 loss
to Anaheim last Friday, gave up a run on two hits and a walk in the
first inning, then settled down.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up allowing seven hits, striking out five and walking
four. Hudson has won 10 of his last 11 decisions, improving his
career record to 22-5.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez had a two-run homer and a run-scoring grounder
off Paul Abbott (6-4) as Oakland closed within three games of
first-place Seattle in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi added a two-run homer in the eighth off Brett
Tomko, his 26th, as the A's improved to 6-3 against Seattle this
season. Giambi has homered in two straight games and three of four.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez went 2-for-4 with a double in his second game for
Seattle since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's sacrifice fly put Seattle ahead in the first, but
Hernandez gave Oakland a 2-1 lead in the third with a two-run
homer. The A's made it 4-1 in the fifth on Hernandez's RBI
groundout and Terrence Long's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott gave up four runs and four hits in seven innings with
three walks -- all to Jeremy Giambi, who scored after his first two
walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners lost only their second series in their last
16, dropping two of three to the A's. They lost two of three at San
Diego from July 13-15. ... Veteran backup C Joe Oliver of Seattle
had his second stolen base of the season and the 13th of his
career.

<HEADLINE> Washington More Than Red-Skin Deep  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Ready to hear just how loaded the Washington
Redskins are? Here's a number that says it all:
</P>
<P>
   The team's projected backups -- the backups, mind you -- have
combined for an astounding 1,145 NFL starts.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes everyone from Darrell Green (248 starts) and
Irving Fryar (201) -- past their prime but still going strong -- to
Jeff George (117) and Jay Leeuwenburg (96) -- still at the peaks of
their careers -- to Kenard Lang (36) and Greg Jones (23) -- former
starters relegated because of the infusion of star talent acquired
in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The depth showed Wednesday, when Deion Sanders experienced back
spasms after leaping to knock the ball away from Albert Connell on
a deep route. Sanders left practice -- he'll be re-evaluated on a
day-to-day basis -- and was replaced by seven-time Pro Bowl
selection Green.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has a history of back spasms, but trainer Bubba Tyer
indicated the latest flare-up is not serious.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have 15 first-round draft picks in camp, and only
10 are expected to start. At most positions, there's a seasoned
veteran ready and eager in case of injury. That second unit could
probably win a game or two on its own if it had to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if anyone addressed their needs as well as we did
this year,'' coach Norv Turner said. ''I think we have a complete
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive the point home, here's Sanders talking about George,
the backup quarterback:
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeff is the man,'' Sanders said. ''I could talk all day about
Jeff George. He is great. His arm's unbelievable. When you're
playing against Jeff, you've got to cover (a receiver) for 10
seconds. You've got to even to cover that guy back to the huddle,
because Jeff might still be holding onto the ball and he'll just
wing it for 40, 50 yards on a line.''
</P>
<P>
   But if George is so good, why is he here? Why did he sign a
four-year contract for a team with Brad Johnson, an established
starter who went to the Pro Bowl last year?
</P>
<P>
   George's response: After years of so-so treatment elsewhere, he
liked the Redskins' candor -- they didn't mince words and give him a
false promise of a shot at the starting job -- and he also liked the
Super Bowl-bound feeling willed by owner Dan Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference between here and somewhere else is how they
treat you,'' George said. ''As a player, that's all you ask for, is
loyalty and honesty. I haven't had either one of those in my
career, and I hope I've found that here.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask any player out there, any coach, 'Would you want to
play for Mr. Snyder?' I guarantee you he's at the top of
everybody's wish list. You didn't have to ask the free agents where
they wanted to go. You just knew they wanted to be a Redskin.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeuwenburg echoed the sentiment. Over the last three seasons,
the 31-year-old guard has played for Colts and Bengals teams that
finished 3-13, 3-13 and 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets old,'' Leeuwenburg said. ''Going into my ninth year, I
want to go somewhere where I feel like there's a legitimate chance
to win. It's not just lip service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel they've been very up-front with me and very honest with
me, which unfortunately in this business is a rarity. If the Skins
came in and said, 'We want you to be No. 1, we want you to beat out
Tre Johnson, a Pro Bowler,' then you know they'd be lying. I can
start in this league. It just so happens that at this point, with
this team, that I made the decision with my family to come out here
and hopefully be a part of this special, special season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins aren't universally deep. A team that hasn't been
able to stop the run for nearly a decade has very little experience
backing up Dan Wilkinson and Dana Stubblefield at defensive tackle.
If Andy Heck's back doesn't get better, then No. 3 overall draft
pick Chris Samuels had better be solid for 16 games in his rookie
year at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   For Redskins fans, the strangest sight at practice is watching
18-year veteran Green, Mr. Redskin himself, not answering the call
when the first-team unit takes the field for a drill. Out of
respect, Green is listed as a co-starter with Sanders on the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his second-string days are here, he's pleased to report
that it doesn't feel as bad as he thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't sting,'' Green said. ''In my soul, in my mind, I am
more at peace than I was as a young guy.''

<HEADLINE> Commission Wants More Fish Warnings  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents in the Great Lakes region need to be
clearly told what kinds of fish are contaminated and what damage
invisible, tasteless toxins can do to a developing fetus or a young
child, a U.S.-Canadian commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The International Joint Commission said the eight Great Lakes
states and two lakeside provinces haven't targeted their fish
consumption warnings to the families that make sport fish a large
part of their diets.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings ''are not clear enough and they're not getting to
the people that need the information,'' said Thomas Baldini, who
heads the American section of the body that oversees the shared
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   A particular frustration, he said, was the states' preferred
method of distributing the advisories: as another piece of
information included with a fishing license.
</P>
<P>
   If the family member who catches the fish isn't the one who
cooks it, those warnings often get lost, said Commissioner Alice
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a simplified, clear warning in the case of children
and women of child bearing years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a state did not issue fish consumption
advisories, the federal Environmental Protection Agency ''stepped
in and issued them to protect public health,'' the EPA said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Carpenter, a public health physician and researcher at
the University at Albany, said studies done in Lakes Michigan and
Ontario showed behavioral changes and reductions in intelligence in
the children of women who ate contaminated sport fish, and a
reduction of thyroid function in children who consumed contaminated
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the substances that move from fish flesh to human tissue
can remain in the body for years. ''What a child eats at the age of
six, at least half of it can be passed on to that young woman's
child years later,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Michigan Department of Community Health, spokeswoman
Geralyn Lasher said that state already is trying to get warnings
into the hands of lower-income subsistence anglers, Native
Americans and other groups that tend to eat a lot of sport fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We distribute the advisory to all local health departments,
WIC (women, infants and children) clinics, doctors offices and many
other locations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Department of Health epidemiology investigator Robert
Johnson, whose area of expertise is fish, said that state is
working with WIC groups and the Ohio Environmental Council to try
to distribute more copies of the fish advisory and a toll-free
information number, 1-800-755-GROW.
</P>
<P>
   State officials began looking for more ways to distribute their
warnings after reading studies that showed women tended to do less
of the fishing and have less awareness of the contamination
advisories, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would describe what we're doing as a work in progress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated fish warnings tend be complicated lists or charts,
which attempt to map, among other things, whether fish from
slightly polluted waterways can be eaten often, occasionally or
never.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings distinguish between big fish and little fish, but
there's no uniformity from state to state except for PCB
contamination
</P>
<P>
   For all other chemicals, ''it's up to the state to devise
whatever testing protocol, sampling protocol, risk assessment/ risk
management numbers that they want to devise,'' said Eric Uram of
the Sierra Club Great Lakes Program.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Belle on Homerless Streak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles outfielder Albert Belle hasn't homered
since June 29 in Boston, and the slugger's 23-game drought is the
longest of his 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove is concerned by Belle's slump, but the
manager knows that Belle -- who had 12 homers and 37 RBIs in June to
win league player of the month honors -- is capable of going on a
tear at any time, particularly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time a player of Albert's stature goes 100-plus at-bats
without a home run, it causes concern,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's 18 home runs are second-most on the Orioles behind
Charles Johnson's 20 and his 76 RBIs are a team high. Last year,
Belle batted .325 with 33 doubles, 27 homers and 82 RBIs over the
season's final 103 games, ending the year on a 15-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than the fact that he's only got 18 home runs, his
production has been (OK),'' Hargrove said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Preparing Bush Speech  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Offering closure to a bitter primary fight,
John McCain is preparing a prime-time convention speech in which he
praises Texas Gov. George W. Bush and declares ''it is my time to
serve'' his former rival and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft of his speech being reviewed by convention planners
and Bush advisers, McCain calls for ''government reform'' in
general, but avoids direct mention of his bid to overhaul election
finance laws -- the issue that divides McCain from Bush and other
GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cynicism is suffocating the idealism of many Americans,
especially among the young -- and with cause, for they have lost
pride in their government,'' McCain says in the text prepared for
Tuesday's night's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the address were read Wednesday to The Associated
Press by three senior Republican officials. One source said the
Bush campaign has voiced no objections to it. McCain began
rehearsing the speech this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials had anxiously awaited the draft, hoping McCain
would avoid conflict and give full-throated support to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator issues his highest praise in a section tying
his grandfather, a World War II admiral, to Bush's father, a World
War II pilot and former U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many years ago, the governor's father fought for our country,
with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my
turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's subordinate,''
McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   The address is expected to be a highlight of the convention's
second night, a reward for winning seven primaries and posing the
greatest threat to Bush's candidacy. Though denied a spot on the
ticket, McCain's support is important as Bush tries to appeal to
ticket-splitters and swing voters energized by the senator's
underdog campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his most direct mention of the primary fight, the text has
McCain thanking the crowd for warmly welcoming ''a distant
runner-up'' to the convention stage.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the address is ''America's greatness,'' officials
said. He urges Americans to emulate the World War II generation,
saying that men of that era went to war for the sake of an idea
that was more valuable than their own self interests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a prisoner-of-war during the Vietnam War for 51/2
years. Bush stayed home, serving in the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are extraordinary times to be alive. We are so strong
and so prosperous that we can scarcely imagine the heights we can
ascend if we had the will to make the climb. Yet I think each of us
senses that America, for all our prosperity, is in danger of losing
the best sense of herself -- that there is a purpose to being an
American beyond materialism,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Let nothing separate us, McCain says -- ''not our color, not our
race, not our religion, not our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a constant theme of Bush's, McCain calls for a
bipartisan approach to government. ''Too often differences are
defined with derision. Too often we seem to put our personal
interests before the national interest, leaving the peoples'
business unattended while we posture, poll and spin.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who still has presidential aspirations, will keep a busy
schedule throughout the convention. He arrives to Philadelphia by
bus this weekend with a press corps in tow, and plans to address
his delegates, conduct dozens of interviews and appear at a
''shadow convention'' designed by GOP gadflies to steal some
attention from the real convention.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Chooses New Prime Minister  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KOHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- Mongolia's parliament on Wednesday
chose a Moscow-educated translator of Charles Dickens and Mongolian
epics as its new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Nambaryn Enkhbayar won unanimous approval from the Great Hural,
Mongolia's parliament, three weeks after his ex-communist party
overwhelmingly won parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   His Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which now calls
itself center-left, has promised that the nation won't return to
communism but favors slowing the nation's race toward capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Enkhbayar said he plans to clean up the environment, promote a
free press, attract foreign investment and increase Mongolia's
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''We only have 2.4 million people. Increasing the population
will secure our independence, our market economy and our
democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue in the July 2 election was Mongolia's struggle to
remake itself from a Soviet satellite state into a modern,
capitalist democracy, a process that began with a peaceful
revolution in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy is growing, many Mongolians have lost their
jobs. More than a third of the population lives below the poverty
level, and unemployment rates are as high as 50 percent in some
towns. A drought this year has killed 2.4 million herd animals, the
livelihood of thousands of nomad families.
</P>
<P>
   Enkhbayar, 42, graduated from the Literature Institute in Moscow
and also studied at Leeds University in northern England. He served
as Minister of Culture from 1992-96 and has translated classic
Mongolian epics as well as Western literature.

<HEADLINE> Cheney, Donors Met at Pentagon  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long before there were White House coffees for
Democratic donors, Dick Cheney entertained major Republican
contributors at private meetings at the Pentagon, according to
documents gathered by congressional fund-raising investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney -- who on Tuesday became George W. Bush's running mate --
hosted at least two GOP donor gatherings inside the Defense
Department in 1991 and in 1992, the records show. As defense
secretary under President Bush during the Persian Gulf War,
Cheney's popularity was then at its height.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore previously have
been criticized by Republicans for inviting some big Democratic
donors to White House coffees or to stay overnight in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's having an open house for contributors at the Pentagon,
it does bring back reminiscences of the Lincoln Bedroom,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same idea, using a high government office as a means
of extracting campaign contributions,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Bill Pascoe declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Cheney's integrity
was above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secretary Cheney is a leader who is widely respected across
party lines for his integrity, experience and judgment, even
earning praise from Al Gore,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served with Cheney in the House and later, as a member of
the Armed Services Committee, supported his appointment as
secretary of defense. ''I applaud the choice and congratulate the
president for the choice,'' Gore said in March 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, 1992, members of the Presidential Roundtable
(minimum donation $5,000) attended a briefing with Cheney,
according to the minority report written by Democrats on the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee that investigated campaign finance
practices.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican National Committee brochure that touted the
benefits of joining the Presidential Roundtable included a picture
of Cheney briefing members at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure noted that members had twice-yearly meetings in
Washington with top administration officials and GOP lawmakers,
where contributors could ''review courses of action, suggest
legislative strategies and have the opportunity to directly impact
current policy debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The minority report cited the Cheney briefing as part of the
GOP's ''long-standing practice of raising money by offering, and
providing, major contributors with access to top Republican federal
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison with Clinton's use of the Lincoln Bedroom also
was made with Bush's use of the Texas governor's mansion to host
campaign contributors. Both Sen. John McCain and Gore criticized
the practice. Bush said the guests were relatives and longtime
friends.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill requiring day-care worker checks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - All day-care workers at licensed facilities
in the state must now clear criminal background checks before
working with children.
</P>
<P>
   The law signed by Gov. Christie Whitman on Wednesday would bar
those with a record of violent crimes or any conviction involving a
child or child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the law is that more and more families are
turning to child care outside of the home, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We owe it to them to make that a safe choice. We need to make
sure that our children are in good hands,'' Whitman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Checks for new employees must be requested within two weeks of
employment and they cannot be left alone with children until the
results are known. Criminal checks will be conducted for existing
workers as the day-care centers licenses come up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations will cost the state around $60 per worker, or
about $2.5 million during the first year.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has more than 3,700 licensed child care centers
serving more than 250,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This measure will help reassure these parents that the people
who are watching their children have been thoroughly screened and
do not have a violent criminal history,'' bill sponsor state Sen.

<HEADLINE> Trial Ordered in Egypt Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A prosecutor on Wednesday ordered eight
people to stand trial for manslaughter and negligence after they
allegedly left behind radioactive materials at a construction site
that killed a father and his son.
</P>
<P>
   The eight -- the owner of a welding company and seven employees --
face up to life in prison if convicted, said security officials
said. A date for the trial has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
   After Hassan Fadel Hassan and his 9-year-old son died last month
of radiation sickness, authorities discovered radioactive iridium
in his home in the village of Mit Halfa, 18 miles north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The material was allegedly left behind at a construction site by
the welding company, which had been repairing a natural gas
pipeline in the village and forgotten the radioactive metal after
work was finished. Hassan found it and took it home believing it
was valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium is used at construction sites to take X-rays to look for
flaws at points where pieces of metal have been welded together.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, 60, took his wife, sister and four children to the
hospital on June 22 after the whole family developed skin
discoloration. Hours later, Hassan's son died. The family moved to
a hospital in Cairo, where Hassan died a few days later.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects N.J. Abortion Law  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Wednesday agreed
that a New Jersey law banning certain late-term abortions is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The finding by a three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upholds the ruling of a federal judge in Trenton who
struck down the law in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Maryanne Trump Barry
said the court's decision was made before the U.S. Supreme Court
heard arguments on a Nebraska law also aimed at banning so-called
''partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on June 28 found the Nebraska law
unconstitutional. ''Nothing in that opinion is at odds with this
court's opinion,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates had argued that the ban was so broad
and vague it could be used to prohibit all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents countered that the law applied specifically to
''partial-birth'' abortion, in which the fetus is pulled part of
the way through the birth canal and the brain is removed to allow
the head to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the law
along with Planned Parenthood, said it was ''gratified'' by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Collier Jr., an attorney and anti-abortion advocate
hired to defend the law, was on vacation Wednesday and not
immediately available for comment, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one states have laws banning the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a defeat to New Jersey Republican leaders who
enacted the measure over a veto from Gov. Christie Whitman and used
more than $400,000 in taxpayer money to defend it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had recommended a different ban that would have
prohibited a wide variety of late-term procedures provided the
health of the mother was taken into account first.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are serious about protecting an unborn child in the
late stage of pregnancy,'' Whitman said, then that alternative
proposal ''allows for that protection while recognizing the right
of the mother to be considered in this equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Tasy, director of public and legislative affairs for New
Jersey Right to Life, said it would be fruitless to appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court until new members are appointed by an
anti-abortion president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until the composition of the court changes, any redraft of the
law would be meaningless,'' Tasy said.

<HEADLINE> Panther Rookie Out For the Season  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Carolina rookie Deon Grant, vying to be
the Panthers' starting free safety, was lost for the season
Wednesday when he fractured his left hip during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers coach George Seifert said there was ''a minimal
chance'' the injury could threaten Grant's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly doesn't sound like he'll play again this year,''
Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a second round pick from Tennessee, was injured while
Carolina was practicing with the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   He was running down field when he bumped a Lions player, lost
his balance and stuck his left leg out to stop himself from
falling. Seifert said the pressure on his leg caused the hip to pop
out and fractured the socket.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage was done before he hit the ground,'' Seifert said.
''His hip is now back in the socket, but the socket was
fractured.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant was taken from the field in an ambulance and flown to
Charlotte, where he will have surgery later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's injury was just one on what turned out to be a
devastating day for the Panthers. Right guard James Dexter
partially tore his right tricep, fullback Chris Hetherington
fractured his right pinkie finger and defensive end Jason Peter
strained his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of injuries came a day after receiver Muhsin Muhammad
was lost for several weeks with a pulled hamstring, and rookie
receiver Scottie Montgomery sprained his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the negatives of the business,'' Seifert said.
''The team has to go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert said Dexter would be out ''many weeks, into the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington will only miss about two weeks, which was far
better than Seifert's initial fears that the backup fullback would
be almost two months. Peter is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blow, though, was Grant's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Grant led the nation with nine interceptions last season, and
left Tennessee after his junior year to enter the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He was battling first-round pick Rashard Anderson for the
starting free safety spot. And even though Anderson was listed
ahead of him on the depth chart, Grant had an edge because Anderson
played cornerback in college and is still trying to learn the
safety position.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert said the job was now Anderson's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's full speed ahead, that's what were committed to at this
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was also competing for a job as a punt returner and
Carolina is now especially thin at that position. Montgomery was
also being used there until he sprained his ankle, possibly costing
the rookie a spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   With both Grant and Montgomery sidelined, cornerback Eric Davis
and kick returner Michael Bates are the only other candidates to
return kicks.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush will not have to give a
deposition in a lawsuit accusing him of violating free speech
rights of environmental protesters at the governor's mansion in
1999, District Judge John Dietz ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the environmentalists allege that Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting, gave state troopers
''unbridled discretion'' to target protesters picketing in front of
the mansion on a public sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed against Bush and the Department of Public
Safety in August 1999 by people arrested and jailed on four
different occasions. They were protesting environmental policies
backed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides have said they strayed from a designated protest
area.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the group said it has no plans to appeal but
will pursue the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Prayer Breakfast Room Dedicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private House dining room where lawmakers'
have held weekly prayer breakfasts for decades was named Wednesday
in honor of former Rep. G.V. ''Sonny'' Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to my room,'' the Mississippi Democrat quipped to
Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott, also a Mississippian, at a
brief ceremony attended by about 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who turns 80 next week, has continued to help
organize the weekly breakfasts since retiring in 1996 following a
30-year career in the House. He called the dedication of the room
''one of the greatest honors to come my way.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast room is located on the first floor at the south
end of the Capitol. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said the
decision to name it in honor of Montgomery was to recognize his
''human characteristics'' as much as his legislative
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most religions dictate that we should treat one another the
way we ourselves would like to be treated. If there is one trait I
can think of about Sonny Montgomery, it is that trait,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   A World War II veteran and retired National Guard general,
Montgomery chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee from 1981
to 1995, writing legislation that boosted veterans' education
benefits.

<HEADLINE> Engine Focus of Concorde Crash  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators into the first-ever Concorde crash
focused Wednesday on the Rolls Royce engines that powered the
doomed Air France jet, after learning the pilot delayed the flight
for emergency repairs on an engine thruster. Seconds after takeoff,
that same engine burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic video footage showed the crippled supersonic plane's
last seconds Tuesday, flying over a road with bright orange flames
enveloping the left side of the fuselage. Thick black smoke trailed
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the grainy, shaky pictures of the 15-second video, shown on
French TV, the flames appear to have engulfed the rear end of the
jet by the time it leaves the camera frame.
</P>
<P>
   The video then cuts to the black mushroom cloud from the crash
rising from the wheat fields. The amateur footage was shot by the
wife of a Spanish truck driver as the couple drove outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of flight AF4590, Capt. Christian Marty, made a
desperate attempt at an emergency landing before the plane crashed
into a hotel outside Paris, killing all 109 people onboard and four
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Marty heard from the tower 56 seconds off the ground that he was
trailing fire, investigators said. The veteran Concorde captain
wrestled the crippled supersonic airliner through a tight bank away
from the populated town of Gonesse and to the left toward nearby Le
Bourget airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified witnesses below watched the Concorde's distinctive
needle nose point downward. The plane dive-bombed into a small
hotel in Gonesse. Its 100 tons of fuel exploded in a fiery column.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is during this looping maneuver that the aircraft crashed
on the hotel,'' said Elisabeth Senot, the local prosecutor in
charge of the crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The repaired engine No. 2 on the plane's left wing emerged as a
likely cause in Tuesday's spectacular crash.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said the plane had returned from New York on Monday
with broken reverse thrusters on its No. 2 engine. Although this
fell within the manufacturer's technical tolerances, the pilot
ordered the part replaced before he would take off, the airline's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Thrusters, which are used to slow the plane upon landing, were
found from a spare Concorde and the repair was made. A late
connecting flight further delayed takeoff from Charles de Gaulle
airport, the brief Air France communique said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only after the spare part was replaced and the luggage loaded
did the captain make the decision to depart,'' it concluded.
</P>
<P>
   As flames began to spout from his plane, Marty radioed the tower
that his No. 2 engine had failed -- a particularly critical problem
in the Concorde, veteran pilots say, because the swept wing
aircraft has two engines close together under each wing. One is
vulnerable to damage from the other.
</P>
<P>
   All Air France Concorde flights have been grounded since the
crash. Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot told journalists
Wednesday that French Concorde flights could resume ''in the coming
days'' depending on the results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   France remained in shock at the loss of life in their beloved
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, somber in a dark suit, visited a
community hall near the crash site. His wife, Bernadette, seemed
devastated with grief.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic experts sought to identify the dead, 96 of them Germans
headed to New York for a luxury cruise to the Caribbean and, for
some, on to the Sydney Olympics. Two Danes, an Austrian and an
American -- retired Air France employee Christopher Behrens -- were
also passengers. Nine crew members died, along with four people in
the hotel, including two Polish hotel trainees.
</P>
<P>
   As family members arrived in Paris, German Transport Minister
Reinhard Klimmt and about 50 psychologists worked to console them.
The relatives were kept far from reporters and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in Germany that his nation was
in shock. Pope John Paul II sent condolences.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site, investigators picked carefully through ashes
and rubble for more clues. Two recovered flight recorders were
being examined.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its London-New York Concorde flights
Wednesday after briefly grounding them for safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   Gayssot said that despite the crash, he still believes the
Concorde has a place in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supersonic technology is still the technology of the future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, requiems have already begun for the money-losing
aircraft, which never caught on outside of France and England. In
recent days, engineers in both countries found cracks in the wings
in some of the 13 Concordes in service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Concorde without a doubt died yesterday,'' Le Figaro, a
leading Paris daily, wrote. ''It had just turned 31. For France,
it's a day of mourning. The myth of a beautiful white bird will
remain.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first Concorde crash after three decades of
service. The Rolls Royce engines, built for the Concordes in
Bristol, England, have totaled a million hours of flying time,
crisscrossing the Atlantic at 1,350 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fushelberger, a spokesman for Rolls Royce in London, said
Wednesday the engine has functioned without trouble since the first
Concorde passenger flights in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''This engine has been in service for 24 years,'' Fushelberger
said. ''It has an excellent safety record.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Marty, known for skill and prudence as a pilot, was also a
popular sportsman. He set a world windsurf record in 1982, crossing
the Atlantic from Dakar, Senegal, to French Guiana in 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, residents praised the pilot as a hero who saved
uncounted lives in their town of 23,000 near Charles de Gaulle
airport, nine miles from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''We avoided catastrophe thanks to the pilot's presence of
mind,'' Mayor Pierre Blazy said, explaining that the plane turned
just before it reached the hospital and the town beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Father Claude Porcheron, a local priest, also said he believed
the pilot made a last-gasp attempt to save lives. ''It was the most
beautiful act in the world,'' he said, tears welling in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Near the demolished Hotelissimo, prayers of thanks were fervent.
A group of 45 Polish tourists had left for a day of sightseeing.
They returned to find smoldering ashes in a wheatfield where their
rooms had been.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as many teen-agers from southeastern England never made
it to the hotel. Their bus got stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Brookings, a 21-year-old Cambridge student, made it on
time from England and was on the phone to her sister when the plane
fell. She opened the door to a wall of flame, then leaped back
across her bed and jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heat was amazing,'' she said. ''It was an oven.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Threatens Palestinian Aid  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said U.S. aid to
Palestinians should be cut off if they unilaterally declare
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be clear that any unilateral declaration of
Palestinian statehood would be entirely unacceptable and should be
met with a cutoff of United States assistance,'' she said in a
statement released after the Camp David peace talks collapsed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate candidate's position appeared to go beyond
what President Clinton has said in urging the Israelis and the
Palestinians to keep trying to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a Wednesday news conference if she thought she was
going beyond the position of her husband's administration, she
said: ''I may be. It's what I believe. ... Aid should be
conditional on people acting in a way that leads to a permanent and
lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   A trilateral statement from the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians on the Camp David summit said that both sides
''understand the importance of avoiding unilateral actions,'' but
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare
statehood if no agreement is reached by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak while
saying little about Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Prime Minister Barak showed enormous courage, vision
and extraordinary commitment to these peace talks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is seeking to shore up her pro-Israel credentials
in New York, where Jews make up 12 percent of the electorate. Polls
show about 15 percent of them are undecided about whether to
support her or her Republican opponent, Long Island Congressman
Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also favors cutting off Palestinian aid if statehood is
unilaterally declared. He previously cosponsored legislation
recommending the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Senate campaign has been involved in a number of
flaps involving Jewish issues, including the meeting last year
between the first lady and Yasser Arafat's wife that resulted in
their much-publicized kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, another controversy erupted when a new book,
''State of a Union,'' accused Hillary Clinton of using an
anti-Semitic obscenity during an argument with a man who worked on
Bill Clinton's 1974 Congressional campaign in Arkansas. She denied
the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   A memo subsequently surfaced in which an adviser to the Clinton
Senate campaign asked Jewish supporters to call Jewish newspapers
and defend her, but urged them to conceal the fact that the
campaign had asked them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the first lady spurred controversy when she said that a
Palestinian state was ''very important'' to Middle East peace.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Outfielder Jordan Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves outfielder Brian Jordan didn't start
Wednesday night's game against the Florida Marlins because of a
sore knee and ankle, joining a long list of teammates plagued by
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta fielded a lineup that included only two of its
opening-day starters. First baseman Andres Galarraga (sprained
thumb), outfielder Reggie Sanders (strained hamstring), shortstop
Walt Weiss (strained knee ligament) also sat out.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez (torn rotator cuff) and second baseman
Quilvio Veras (torn knee ligament) already were out for the season,
joining pitchers John Smoltz, Rudy Seanez and Greg McMichael in
that category.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was injured Tuesday night as he lunged at first base
trying to beat out an infield grounder. He twisted his right knee
and sprained his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just sore,'' said Jordan, adding that he would be
available for pinch-hitting duty or to play in an emergency. ''It
looked a lot worse than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss tested his knee during batting practice and may try to
play Thursday. Sanders, struggling with a .191 average, also is
hoping to rejoin the lineup in the next day or two. Galarraga won't
be able to play until the swelling in his thumb goes down.
</P>
<P>
   The only opening-day starters in Wednesday's lineup were third
baseman Chipper Jones and center fielder Andruw Jones. Catcher Javy
Lopez also played.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Holds Subpoenaed Papers  </HEADLINE>
By M.R. KROPKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- U.S. Rep. James A. Traficant is refusing to
turn over documents subpoenaed by federal prosecutors, arguing they
are his personal property and that he has a right to avoid
self-incrimination, a spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, D-Ohio, has said he expects to be indicted in a
public corruption probe, which has led to more than 70 convictions,
including a judge, a prosecutor, a sheriff and a Traficant aide.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Morford, the lead prosecutor in
the Youngstown-area corruption cases, said he is prohibited from
commenting on secret grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant was acquitted in 1983 of charges he accepted mob
bribes, but he lost a federal tax case in 1987 stemming from the
same issues.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Paul Marcone said that Traficant still expects to be
indicted and that he plans to defend himself, although he is not a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant complied with a December subpoena that requested his
telephone, payroll and rent records. The government requested more
documents in May.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant notified the U.S. attorney in Cleveland in early July
that he was applying his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination and would not turn over the documents. The
government filed a motion to compel the congressman to comply,
Marcone said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcone said Traficant decided not to comply after the Supreme
Court's decision in June clearing presidential friend Webster
Hubbell of a tax charge. Hubbell's defense was that he could not be
prosecuted with documents he was forced to provide while under
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant is not under immunity, but he believes a traditional
immunity applies, Marcone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the House of Representatives, traditionally, all documents
generated by an individual member's office are considered to be the
personal documents of the member,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Wyclef Jean's Album Has Diallo Song  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A new album from Wyclef Jean features a pointed
song about the police shooting of unarmed West African immigrant
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, who performed at last year's funeral of John F. Kennedy
Jr., offers a more angry take on Diallo's slaying than rocker Bruce
Springsteen did in his recent song inspired by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was killed last year in the Bronx by four police officers
searching for a rape suspect. The officers, who said the shooting
was a tragic mistake, were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus of Jean's song -- simply titled ''Diallo'' -- contains
the lines, ''You said he reached, sir/But he didn't have no piece,
sir/But now he rests in peace, sir/In the belly of the beast,
sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean's album is due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   A group of rappers under the name ''Hip-hop for Respect'' also
released a song against police brutality in reaction to Diallo's
death.

<HEADLINE> Toomer Aims To Be Giants' Best  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One year after his breakout season, Amani
Toomer isn't content just being among the NFL's top receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants wideout is looking to join the league's
elite, quite a goal for a player who appeared to be a bust a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing with Amani is he can play,'' said Giants
cornerback Jason Sehorn, who covers Toomer in practice. ''Something
was holding him back his first couple of years. But whatever it
was, he found it, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   After catching 44 passes for 635 yards and six touchdowns in his
first three seasons, Toomer turned his career around last year with
one of the most productive seasons in Giants' history.
</P>
<P>
   The former second-round draft choice had 79 catches for 1,183
yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The receptions broke Earnest Gray's single-season team record by
one. Toomer's yardage was the second most in team history, 26 yards
shy of the record set by Homer Jones in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   His catches tied him for 15th best in the league last season,
while the yards were 10th best.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to be the ...,'' Toomer said before slamming the
brakes on his thought pattern.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the words he was going to use were ''the best,''
Toomer smiled as if to say: ''You said it, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Toomer in practice, it's obvious he's looking to
produce even more this season.
</P>
<P>
   Running a slant pattern in Wednesday's morning practice, Toomer
reached down to his shins to try to catch a pass thrown by Kerry
Collins. He got his hands on the ball, but couldn't hold it before
Sehorn shoved him to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   As Toomer walked back to the huddle he kept looking at his
hands. He stared at his palms and then repositioned his hands as if
he were trying to catch the ball. As he walked, he kept talking to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just going over the thought process in my head because
sometimes you don't get to look at all the film,'' Toomer said. ''I
was just thinking if there was a way I could have caught the ball.
If it happens in a game, I have to protect the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer never thought like that a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He always seemed to be in the doghouse. He was either dropping
balls or running the wrong patterns. His major contributions were
as a special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   However, sometime between the '98 and '99 seasons, Toomer seemed
to commit himself to football.
</P>
<P>
   He got more involved in the offense in the '98 season and then
took the next step last season after working out like crazy in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to fall in love with working out in the offseason,''
Toomer said. ''You have to fall in love with the training camp, try
to keep the intensity up and never forget what got you where are. I
just want to keep on building.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer has a good chance to improve his numbers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins should improve in his second year as the Giants'
starting quarterback, and teams won't be able to double on Toomer
with fellow receiver Ike Hilliard and tight end Pete Mitchell on
the field. If the running game gets going with Ron Dayne, that will
open things up more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about this year,'' Toomer said. ''We have a great
quarterback and great receivers around me. We have an offensive
coordinator (Sean Payton) who is really aggressive, and that makes
for an exciting situation for a receiver to be in this offense with
the tools we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer also didn't leave anything to chance in the offseason. He
did more long distance running to improve his stamina. He took Kung
Fu to improve his flexibility. He had a personal trainer and was a
very active member of the Giants offseason training program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way we do things I think it is going to be tough for teams
to match me with people, or to match Ike with different people,''
Toomer said. ''It is going to put stress on defenses and we are
going to have some advantages out there.''

<HEADLINE> Popular but fake Marianna doctor gets federal prison term  </HEADLINE>

BILL KACZOR:
Associated Press Writer:
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) - A man who practiced medicine for 17
years although he never went to medical school received a prison
sentence of three years and three months Wednesday for defrauding
federal health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Ramos, 54, who was popular as a doctor in the small
northwest Florida town of Marianna, also was ordered to pay nearly
$5 million in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   He will appeal on grounds U.S. District Judge Stephan Mickle
should have dismissed the charges, said Assistant U.S. Public
Defender Elizabeth Timothy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gist of our argument was that regulating doctors is a
state matter,'' Timothy said. ''Really, what the government was
punishing him here for was practicing without a license.''
</P>
<P>
   The state already has punished Ramos for practicing with an
invalid license that he obtained with a forged medical school
diploma. The native of the Dominican Republic was convicted in
state court last year, sentenced to 47 days of time served and
fined $24,000
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ramos pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding
Medicare, Medicaid and a military health care program because he
was not a real doctor after Mickle refused to dismiss the charges.
The plea, however, was with the condition that he could appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy contends it is not against federal law to practice
without a license and that Ramos was not accused of failing to
provide services or of double billing, the kinds of crimes for
which the fraud law was intended.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who also goes by the name Nelson de Jesus Ramos-Santiago,
had a family practice and delivered hundreds of babies in Marianna,
about 50 miles west of Tallahassee in the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   He was popular among patients and doctors who testified at his
state sentencing that he was knowledgeable, caring and generous.
Dr. Lisa Bailey, said ''His knowledge was at or above other
physicians in this area including myself.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no testimony, however, Wednesday. Ramos and his lawyer
declined a chance to address the judge, who agreed to let the
defendant remain free until Sept. 15. Timothy said she now will ask
Mickle to delay Ramos' reporting date until the appeal is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Mickle gave Ramos a midlevel sentence. Sentencing guidelines
ranged from two years, nine months to three years, five months. The
maximum possible would have been 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos came to the courthouse alone and stood passively in front
of the judge with his hands clasped in front of him during the
sentencing. When approached for comment afterward he walked away
without saying anything.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos fooled state regulators into giving him a medical license
in 1981 with a phony diploma from a medical school in Spain
although he had been convicted the year before of practicing
without a license in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   His license was suspended two years ago after a colleague
discovered Ramos was listed graduating from a medical school in the
Dominican Republican, not Spain, on an American Medical Association
Internet directory. An investigation showed he attended neither
school.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities can only surmise how he learned enough medicine to
practice for so many years without being detected. State officials
said he attended seminars, had two nurse practitioners who could
cover for him and learned to do Caesarean sections by observing and
then assisting a real doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed since the charade was discovered now requires
regulators to check academic credentials. Doctors also must submit
fingerprints for criminal background checks.

<HEADLINE> Indifference in Sydney To Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A young couple kisses in the sand, a
few yards from the giant shell of the unfinished Olympic beach
volleyball stadium. Joggers splash past, oblivious to the hum of
huge machines driving posts deep into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Bondi Beach, where six protesters buried themselves neck-deep
in the sand in May, a security guard yawns as kids play and
tourists dip their toes in the Pacific. Waves lap at the edges of
''Stephen I luv U,'' carved in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Olympic banners or signs nearby. Store windows
feature notices of garage sales, not of the Sydney Games. It's
business as usual at the Russian Roulette restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marks 50 days to go until the Sydney Olympics. Does
anyone here care?
</P>
<P>
   ''People from overseas are more excited. People here are not
that excited yet,'' says Maria Nori, who works at an ice cream shop
on Bondi Beach. ''I'm excited because I love volleyball. But I
haven't heard anything here about the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to Atlantans, who were Olympics-obsessed
months before their games in 1996, Sydneysiders generally are
indifferent right now.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that attitude may be due to the laid-back Australian
temperament. And there's no need for panic, since almost all
Olympic venues have long been completed -- again, a sharp difference
from Atlanta at this stage four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Olympic torch relay is generating interest as it winds
through the country. And Sydney newspapers are full of stories
about Olympic preparations, such as hotel workers demanding big
bonuses during the games.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, dozens of people lined up at official
Olympic stores in Sydney to purchase ''50 Days to Go'' pins. One
collector had been waiting in line since early Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the international terminal at Sydney Airport
officially was opened after a $354 million redevelopment program.
</P>
<P>
   But most people are far more interested in their favorite
Australian Rules football team, or this weekend's international
rugby match against South Africa, than in a sporting event nearly
two months away.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was abuzz with Olympic excitement with 50 days to go.
Vendors jockeyed for prime spots to sell T-shirts and soft drinks,
while Olympic flags fluttered from light poles. The upcoming games
dominated talk at lunch counters.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Sydney, there are few Olympic billboards. Buses have
their usual advertisements for banks and candy bars, unlike the
huge ads featuring Olympic stars such as Michael Johnson that
plastered Atlanta buses.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic officials completed nearly all of a $1.92 billion
construction program well ahead of schedule. Thousands of visitors
have toured the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium, which already is
being used for rugby and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, with 50 days to go, officials still were fretting
over the completion of 12 new competition venues in time for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Some Sydney residents plan to escape during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1
Olympics. A survey for Ansett Airlines showed more than half a
million Sydneysiders, about 14 percent of the city's population,
plan to go somewhere else during the games.
</P>
<P>
   At Bondi, where protesters tried to block construction of a
10,000-seat stadium they feel defaces one of the country's best
surfing and sunning spots, the attitude is decidedly low-key.
</P>
<P>
   A sign outside the Bondi Road Art Supplies store complains,
''Bondi Beach is under martial law'' and decries the fences and
security guards now closing off much of the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But most visitors seem more interested in the white sand and the
bands of seagulls scavenging for scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Even Aboriginal leaders, who threatened to disrupt the games
with protests, now say they want to use the Olympics as a way of
publicizing their cause. Many of the nation's 386,000 Aborigines
complain of discrimination and of being treated as second-class
citizens in a land they once ruled.
</P>
<P>
   At a tent city set up outside Sydney University, Aborigines such
as Isabell Coe say their main purpose is to increase public
awareness of their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Aboriginal people love their sport, but they're angry
about what's going on in this country,'' says Coe, a member of the
Wiradjuri tribe. ''They know there's nothing they can do to stop
this, they know the Games will happen. We just want people to hear
our stories.''

<HEADLINE> Mistake Said Made In Waco Tear Gas  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI lawyer ''goofed'' in not telling
superiors in 1996 that federal agents fired pyrotechnic tear gas
canisters into the Branch Davidians' compound in Waco, Texas, a
former senator who investigated the deadly raid said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That simple mistake by a ''very junior'' lawyer helped lead to
the controversy over whether the government was trying to hide the
fact the three canisters were fired, Special Counsel John Danforth
told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the lawyer had marked on her ''to-do'' list in
1996 to tell the Justice Department about the canisters but never
did. Refusing to name the lawyer, he said she even lied about it
when his investigators questioned her but that there was no
maliciousness in her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened in this case was that this fairly young lawyer
simply goofed, simply failed to do an adequate job ... and in the
face of the fear of personal ruin ... she then began to concoct
various stories,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a longtime Republican senator from Missouri, was
appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the siege
after the government acknowledged, following years of denials, that
it used pyrotechnic tear gas canisters during the final assault.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began Feb. 28, 1993, when agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to arrest Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh. A gunfight broke out, leaving four ATF agents
and six Davidians dead, and the standoff started.
</P>
<P>
   It ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when tanks driven by
FBI agents pumped tear gas into the compound. A fire broke out and
80 Davidians, including Koresh, died, some from the fire, some from
gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth concluded last week with ''100 percent certainty'' that
federal agents did not start the fire or shoot at cult members. The
government also did not improperly use the military and did not
engage in a major cover-up, Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to investigate why no one told the Justice
Department that the tear gas canisters were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Those canister had nothing to do with the fire, he told the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI lawyer found out about the tear gas while
working on the Waco civil trial. On July 14, a five-member jury
decided that the government was not responsible for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   She marked it down on a list to tell her superiors but never
did, Danforth said. After that mistake, she was afraid to come
forward with the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think for a minute that this FBI lawyer was part of
any cover-up or conspiracy,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., asked Danforth whether he would
recommend prosecuting the lawyer for lying. Danforth said that
would be like hitting ''a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government needs to find a way to reduce its
internal ''culture of fear'' and force its lawyers to be more open
and candid, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pickens Signs With Titans  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Wide receiver Carl Pickens has agreed to
a five-year deal with the AFC champion Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are delighted to add a player of Carl's caliber to the
roster,'' Titans general manager Floyd Reese said Wednesday. ''You
always look for playmakers on both offense and defense and Carl
definitely qualifies as a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese did not reveal the financial terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens will sign the contract Thursday, Reese said, because the
two-time Pro Bowler had to fly home to pack for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens negotiated with the Titans by himself for two days.
Asked early Wednesday if he would have anyone look over a new
contract, Pickens said he knows what to look for after eight years
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my third time going through this situation,'' said
Pickens, who signed a five-year, $23 million contract with the
Bengals last year. ''I'm the one that has to deal with the deal at
the end of the day, so I kind of know what I want. I can come down
here and sell myself. I don't need an agent to tell me yea or nay
over a contract I can read and understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens starred at the University of Tennessee in the early
1990s and has friends in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have wanted Pickens since the Cincinnati Bengals
released him last week, ending an acrimonious eight-year
relationship. Tennessee finally lured him to town Tuesday morning,
and he had been meeting with team officials, coaches and players
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens has talked with Pro Bowl running back Eddie George,
backup quarterback Neil O'Donnell and receiver Yancey Thigpen.
O'Donnell played with Pickens in Cincinnati in 1998, and Thigpen's
injury is why the Titans so desperately want to sign Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen has been slow to recover from ankle surgery in April and
may miss most of training camp. That would leave Kevin Dyson as the
Titans' only receiver with a 50-catch season on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens caught 57 passes in 1999 in what was essentially a down
year. He left Cincinnati holding team records for career receptions
(530) and touchdown catches (63).
</P>
<P>
   The Titans might need to clear some cap room if they have to
find help for the secondary, because cornerback Donald Mitchell
hurt his knee in practice Tuesday. Receiver Chris Sanders, who
caught only 20 passes last season, could be a cap casualty since
his salary will count $1.4 million against the cap this season.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Frustrated by Taylor Holdout  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens are perplexed and
more than a bit angry over the holdout of first-round pick Travis
Taylor, who missed a third straight day of practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a wide receiver out of the University of Florida, was
the 10th pick in the NFL draft. The Ravens have offered him a deal
that falls somewhere between the five-year, $7.86 million contract
signed by No. 9 pick Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears and the
five-year, $7.14 million pact that Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne
received from the New York Giants as the 11th choice.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's agents, Steve Weinberg and David Canter, are looking
for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts seem to be so clear, and yet the resolution is
not,'' Ravens president David Modell said Wednesday. ''It
frustrates you.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've said pretty clearly that there is no advantage to
holding out, and there's a greater than average likelihood that a
holdout is more injurious to the player than to us. I just don't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell said the Ravens won't alter their offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached the point at which there is a deal on the table,
and no deal will get better than what's on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg did not return a call Wednesday to his Dallas office
for comment. Canter also did not return a call to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens coach Brian Billick was happy with the offer tendered by
Pat Moriarty, the team's director of football administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have put our best foot forward in regard to Travis Taylor.
Pat Moriarty sat with Travis Taylor's representation and made it
very clear what our position was and this was our best effort,''
Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens' second-year coach is prepared to move forward
without Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ship is about ready to set sail. We're about to pull out
of the dock,'' Billick said. ''I'm very, very comfortable with
everybody that's on board now.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor caught 34 passes and scored six touchdowns for the Gators
last season, capping his college career by earning the MVP award at
the Citrus Bowl after catching 11 passes for 156 yards and three
scores.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to contend for a starting spot with Baltimore,
and his chances improved Tuesday when wide receiver Patrick Johnson
broke his collarbone. One day earlier, free agent receiver Kendrick
Nord broke a bone in his leg.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor can't do anything to enhance his standing on the
depth chart if he's not in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''They clearly want more money. They've talked about a number of
range of years, but every dollar amount they've talked about is
absurd,'' Modell said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective bargaining agreement, rookies are paid
according to their draft order, or slot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The apparent sticking point is that the agent doesn't agree
with the collective bargaining agreement,'' Modell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To want something out of slot is perfectly reasonable; you're
an American. I bet there are a ton of Americans who want more than
they're getting. But there are a ton of Americans who accept what
is, and get on with it.''

<HEADLINE> Evacuated Japan Residents To Return  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Nearly 800 residents evacuated from their
hot-spring resort town in northern Japan after a nearby volcano
erupted in March will be able to go home, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Residents evacuated from their homes in Abuta, on Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido, will be allowed to return as early as
Friday after experts judged that the danger of an eruption near
their homes had subsided, said town official Tadahiro Tsutae.
</P>
<P>
   The residents -- who have been making do in community centers,
gymnasiums and temporary housing -- lived in homes as close as 400
yards to the crater of 2,416-foot Mount Usu, which started spewing
steam and ash on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,000 people living near Mount Usu were initially
ordered to evacuate, but many were permitted to go home starting in
May. Earlier this month, about 400 more people in Abuta were
allowed to go home.
</P>
<P>
   With four of Mount Usu's craters still active, evacuation orders
remain in effect for nearly 380 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the area surrounding their homes may be too dangerous for
quite a while, the town is considering buying land to relocate the
remaining evacuees, Tsutae said. The families would have to pay for
construction of new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Usu, which has claimed no casualties since awakening from
its 22-year slumber, is not the only volcano to have erupted in
seismologically active Japan this year. Earlier this month, a
volcano on the island of Miyakejima off Tokyo erupted several
times, spewing ash into the sky and triggering thousands of
earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Wyclef Jean's new album features Diallo song  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A new album from ex-Fugee Wyclef Jean features a
pointed song about the police shooting of unarmed West African
immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, who performed at last year's funeral of John F. Kennedy
Jr., offers a more angry take on the slaying of Amadou Diallo than
rocker Bruce Springsteen did in his recent song inspired by the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was killed Feb. 4, 1999, in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment house by four police officers searching for a rape
suspect. The officers, who said the shooting was a tragic mistake,
were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus of Jean's song - simply titled ''Diallo'' - contains
the lines, ''You said he reached, sir/But he didn't have no piece,
sir/But now he rests in peace, sir/In the belly of the beast,
sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean's album is due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the songs by Jean and Springsteen, a group of rappers
under the name ''Hip-hop for Respect'' put out a song against
police brutality in reaction to Diallo's death.

<HEADLINE> Report: Taylor To Sign With Magic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forward Maurice Taylor says he is going to
join Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor told the Orange County Register he intends to sign with
the Magic once the Aug. 1 signing period begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where I'm going,'' Taylor was quoted as saying in
Wednesday's newspaper. ''It's a good situation with the players
that they have and the organization. There are just a few
technicalities that need to be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ''Orlando was always my first choice. Most definitely, I'm very
excited. We'll be of the better teams in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   He visited Orlando this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic, who are also interested in Portland's Brian Grant and
New York's Kurt Thomas, refused to comment on the Taylor report.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's agent, David Falk, was traveling and unavailable for
comment, according to a spokesperson at his office in Washington,
D.C. Per club policy, the Clippers would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a first-round draft choice of the Clippers in 1997,
earned $1,367,400 last season -- his third with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Falk said before last season that his client would leave when he
became a free agent after negotiations on an extension went
nowhere, and Taylor said the same thing once the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and McGrady have both said they will sign free-agent deals
with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   If the Magic sign Hill and McGrady, though, it's unlikely the
team would have enough room remaining under the salary cap to also
lure Taylor, Grant or Thomas -- unless the player accepted the
minimum salary or Orlando can clear more cap room.
</P>
<P>
   One option for filling the team's starting power forward slot is
re-signing free agent Bo Outlaw, who played small forward last
year.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Traded to Arizona  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Adding Curt Schilling to a staff that includes
Randy Johnson, the Arizona Diamondbacks head into the pennant race
with one of the most powerful 1-2 pitching combinations in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Koufax and Drysdale come to mind,'' Arizona general manager
Joe Garagiola Jr. said after Wednesday's 4-for-1 trade with
Philadelphia. ''I'll take these two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who had pushed for a deal to a contender, is headed
home to Phoenix in exchange for first baseman-outfielder Travis Lee
and pitchers Omar Daal, Vicente Padilla and Nelson Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will leave here with nothing but the best memories on and
off the field,'' Schilling said during a news conference at
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. ''I was booed so much less than I
probably deserve to be booed here, which I don't think too many
people leaving Philly can say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as tough as you think because it's all pretty much my
fault. I would create problems that shouldn't have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, the defending NL West champion, began Wednesday in
first place, one game ahead of San Francisco. Schilling is to make
his Diamondbacks' debut Friday at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''There aren't many teams who have a couple of number ones on
the roster on their pitching staff like we feel we do with Randy
and Curt Schilling,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said.
''This could be a very significant addition in a very tight pennant
race.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Schilling waived his right to demand a
trade following the season, a power given to veterans traded while
under a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can only pitch once every fifth day,'' manager Buck
Showalter said before the Diamondbacks played at St. Louis.
''Hopefully, this will be a new chapter for us. We've taken a lot
of blows after 100 games and we're still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling recently told the Phillies there were about a
half-dozen teams he would allow himself to be dealt to. He is
making $5.65 million this season and is signed for next season at
$6.5 million. After the 2001 season, he becomes eligible for free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of the deal is that we are giving up, obviously,
one of the top starting pitchers in all of baseball,'' Phillies
general manager Ed Wade said. ''In getting these four players, we
answer a lot of needs. Did we get Curt Schilling back in this deal?
Obviously we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the deadline for making deals without waivers. The New
York Yankees also had been talking to Philadelphia about Schilling,
a baseball executive said on the condition of anonymity, but the
extent of their interest was unclear. The New York Mets also had
been interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians made a run at Schilling last week. St.
Louis and Seattle also were considered contenders to land the
33-year-old pitcher. The Cardinals offered outfielder J.D. Drew and
pitcher Matt Morris, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We explored it quite extensively with every club that was on
the list,'' Wade said. ''He made it clear that if the opportunity
presents itself, he wouldn't stand in the way. Obviously it wasn't
a great surprise to him that this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (6-6) started clearing out his locker Tuesday. The
starter in last year's All-Star game, he had shoulder surgery in
the offseason and struggled at first after rejoining the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has pitched complete games in three of his last four
starts. He is 5-2 with a 2.00 ERA in his last eight starts, six of
them Phillies victories. He has lasted at least seven innings in
his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last week and a half, I heard enough rumblings that I
knew it was going to happen,'' Schilling said. ''I'm in a pennant
race now, and now it's time to ante up on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona sorely needed another starter because of the injury to
Todd Stottlemyre and the struggles of Daal. Stottlemyre has been
sidelined for a month with a slight tear in his elbow and is not
expected to return until September, at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who is likely to pitch against ex-Phillies pitcher
Andy Ashby next Wednesday at Atlanta, has a 105-89 career record
and won at least 15 games in each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling had been with the Phillies since 1992, when he was
acquired from Houston for right-hander Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed hitting Lee was signed to a then-record $10
million signing bonus by Arizona before its 1998 expansion season.
He was considered the cornerstone of the young franchise, but he
has struggled at the plate the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was optioned to Triple-A Tucson on July 16 to work on his
hitting. He was 5-for-5 in a recent contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Travis has struggled this year and I still believe that he has
a very bright future,'' Colangelo said. ''We'll be pulling for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal, 16-9 last season with a 3.65 ERA, is 2-10 with a 7.22 ERA
this year and has lost his spot in the starting rotation. He is to
start for the Phillies on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I have not had a good year this year,'' Daal said.
''They need someone to be a starter and Schilling is a great
starter. That's how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, 22, has been strong out of the bullpen this season and
the Diamondbacks had projected him as a possible starter in the
future. He is 2-1 with a 2.31 ERA and could serve as closer for
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could have acquired Curt Schilling for a rosin bag and a
cracked fungo, that would have been the deal I would have made,''
Garagiola said. ''Unfortunately, real life doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, 26, considered Arizona's best pitcher at Tucson, made
a couple of appearances for the Diamondbacks this season. He was
0-2 with a 7.47 ERA for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we have improved our ballclub, improved the
future of our ballclub,'' Wade said. ''I wish we could have done it
without losing Curt Schilling, but obviously we couldn't. If these
guys come in and do what they're capable of doing, we're not very
far from being where we want to be.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Trade Aybar to Marlins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins acquired right-handed
reliever Manny Aybar from the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday for
Class A pitcher Jorge Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got Aybar, 25, from Colorado on April 7 for left-hander
Gabe White and cash. Aybar went 1-1 with a 4.83 ERA in 32
appearances for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manny is a player we have liked a great deal,'' Marlins
general manager David Dombrowski said. ''He is still a maturing
major-league talent, and he has a great arm. We are very excited
about his opportunities here with the Marlins.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room on their roster for Aybar, the Marlins designated
pitcher Ron Mahay for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova, 22, is 6-7 with a 3.88 ERA in 15 starts and seven
relief appearances for Kane County of the Midwest League. The
right-hander struck out 94 in 95 innings, but also threw nine wild
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also called up starter Rob Bell from Triple-A
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Bell opened the season as the Reds' fifth starter, but was
optioned to Louisville on June 25 after going 4-6 with a 5.28 ERA.
He went 4-0 in six starts for Louisville with a 3.73 ERA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- In a 15-second video, a Spanish truck driver's wife
captured the horrifying flight of Air France Concorde AF4590.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed from a moving truck, the amateur footage shows the jet
flying low above a highway busy with vehicles, an enormous trail of
flame and smoke streaming from the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans to the left and the truck's driver in the next
seat is caught in profile. Behind him through the window, the
grainy, shaky picture shows bright, orange-and-white fire
enveloping the left side of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the plane, still flying level to the ground,
disappears from the frame, the flames appear to have engulfed the
rear end of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   The video did not show the plane fall. But the footage jumps to
a shot of a black mushroom cloud rising from a wheat field in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-and-wife truck driving team were taking cargo from
Germany to France when they filmed the video. Requesting anonymity,
they sold the footage to Spain's Antena 3, which passed on the
international rights to Associated Press Television News.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt: No Snowmobile Decision Yet  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political backlash that followed a
proposed ban on snowmobiling in the national parks has brought
assurances from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt that no decision
has been made, and the proposal may change.
</P>
<P>
   The snowmobile industry, citing a letter last week from Babbitt
to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., declared Wednesday
that the Interior Department was backing off the proposed ban.
Department officials quickly denied that, but conceded that a
decision may not come in time for winter
</P>
<P>
   In the July 17 letter to Daschle, Babbitt said no decision will
come without formal rulemaking and public comment periods, a
process likely not to be completed until late fall or early winter.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt wrote that a draft rule on a snowmobile ban had not yet
been completed. ''We are likely to consider additional alternatives
... and a different outcome could result,'' Babbitt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a release, the International Snowmobile Manufacturers
Association claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mounting public opposition ... has forced the National Park
Service to rethink the announced ban,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior and Park Service officials insisted that the policy,
touted last April as essential to protect the parks, has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely not,'' said Destry Jarvis, with Interior's Office
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, when asked if the department was
backing off.
</P>
<P>
   David Barna, spokesman for the National Park Service, said that
when the formal rulemaking period is completed, ''purely
recreational use (of snowmobiles) in the parks will not be
allowed'' -- although with some exceptions outlined last April.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Interior Department said it would ban
recreational snowmobile use in most of the 42 sites in the National
Park System where snowmobiling is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles would still be welcome in parks in Alaska and
Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, where Congress expressly
permits snowmobiling. Also, a decision at Yellowstone and Grand
Teton national parks in Wyoming was postponed, pending the outcome
of a separate review, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt in his letter reiterated that any ban would provide
exemptions for snowmobile use for access to private land within or
adjacent to a park, and where roads through a park are not under
federal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists estimate that 180,000 snowmobilers visited the
park system last year. They downplayed the significance of
Babbitt's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a backing off at all,'' said Kevin Collins
of the National Parks and Conservation Association, a private park
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the San Francisco-based Bluewater Network, which
filed the petition demanding new restrictions more than a year ago,
promised that the group would hold Interior accountable for the
commitments it has made.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to continue to watch them and hold them to the
promise they made in April and that is to phase out recreational
snowmobiles,'' said Sean Smith. ''But we also recognize it isn't a
done deal.''

<HEADLINE> Ewing Wants To Play 3 More Years  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) -- Patrick Ewing wants to play
three more seasons, even if the New York Knicks don't want him back
after his contract expires next June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd probably like to play two more years after next year. If
it's New York, it's New York. If not, it's somewhere else,'' Ewing
told The Associated Press on Wednesday, breaking a long silence
over his plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, in the Bahamas for the players' union's annual meeting,
has one year remaining on the four-year, $60 million contract
extension he signed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is eligible to sign an extension, but the Knicks have not
said whether they will offer him one this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has spent his entire 15-year career with the Knicks,
reaching the NBA finals twice (once when he was injured) but never
having won a championship. His 15.0 scoring average last season was
the lowest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks management has had a policy in recent years of never
letting a coach enter the final year of his contract without giving
him an extension, but not so with players.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Scott Layden refuses to discuss anything
relating to contracts, and Ewing's agent, David Falk, also begged
off the subject Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm prepared to do whatever,'' Ewing said. ''I'll let David
Falk and the powers that be at the Knicks handle it, and I won't
worry myself with it. The only thing I'm worried about is getting
better and healthier for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing settled into a reduced offensive role with the Knicks last
season before a foot injury knocked him out of Games 3 and 4 of the
Eastern Conference finals against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing returned in Games 5 and 6, but New York lost both --
leading many to wonder whether the Knicks were better off with him
or without him.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing also went through a lonely season in the locker room,
keeping distant from many of the younger players who have been
added to the roster over the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the season he hinted that he might like to
finish his career in Miami, but it seems likely he'll give the
Knicks every chance to make him an offer that will allow him to
finish his career in New York in 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that offer comes this summer, he isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy it in New York. The team is good to me, the fans have
been good to me,'' Ewing said. ''We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Layden would not comment on Ewing's desire to play three more
years -- or his interest in a two-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ''He plays hard, he's important to our team. His skill level has
always been very good. He always works on his game, and he's
continued to keep the Knicks competitive,'' said Layden, who gave
Ewing a stronger endorsement two days after the Knicks were knocked
out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden president David Checketts was on vacation
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Layden has been exploring a sign-and-trade deal with Portland
for free agent forward Brian Grant, the type of player who could
move over to the center position if Ewing got hurt -- or after Ewing
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, who spent part of July trying to convince free agent
Grant Hill to come to the Knicks in a sign-and-trade deal, has been
discussing trades with the Boston Celtics. Two league sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that a swap of
Chris Childs and Andrew Lang for Danny Fortson, Calbert Cheaney and
Doug Overton was discussed earlier this month. That deal, however,
appears dead.

<HEADLINE> Manning Draws Interest From Jazz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Veteran forward Danny Manning met with the
Utah Jazz on Wednesday after reaching an agreement to buy out the
final year of his contract with the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the 34-year-old backup forward would have entered
the final year of a six-year, $38 million deal originally
negotiated with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's agent, Mark Bartlestein, said the 6-foot-10, 235-pound
forward will be available to sign with other teams Aug. 1.
Bartlestein also confirmed Manning met with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny is a great player and he's going to be a great
contributor for whatever team he goes to,'' Bartlestein said.
''Certainly, the Jazz are among those possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Bucks will pay Manning $7.833 million -- the
guaranteed amount for next season -- over several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing Manning, the Bucks will reduce a glut of forwards
that includes Glenn Robinson, Scott Williams, Jason Caffey, Billy
Owens, Tim Thomas and Darvin Ham.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Ham are free agents but both are expected to return
to the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Manning played in 72 regular-season games for Milwaukee,
averaging 4.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in 16.9 minutes. In a
first-round playoff series against Indiana, he played in only one
game.
</P>
<P>
   Manning played on Kansas' 1988 NCAA championship team and the
bronze-medal U.S. Olympic team that year. The Los Angeles Clippers
made him the top overall pick in the 1988 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his surgically repaired knees, the Jazz like Manning's
experience and hope he can help John Stockton and Karl Malone try
to make another playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, though, is over the salary cap and would be unable to
offer more than a $2.25 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd have to be creative, but it might be something that can
work out,'' said Kevin O'Connor, Utah's vice president for
basketball operations.

<HEADLINE> Two Oregon St. Receivers Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Two Oregon State wide receivers were
suspended indefinitely Wednesday by coach Dennis Erickson after
they were arrested and charged with assault following a fight at an
off-campus party.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Prescott, a senior starter, and Junior Adams, a
sophomore, were charged with third-degree assault following a
weekend brawl that left another Oregon State student injured.
</P>
<P>
   A third player, redshirt freshman receiver James Newson, also
was charged with third-degree assault, but he was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still sorting out facts with this incident, and as time
goes on, things could change,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The three players allegedly beat Victor Becerra, a 21-year-old
Oregon State senior, outside a house early Saturday morning.
Witnesses said two other men were involved in the attack, and more
arrests could be made.
</P>
<P>
   Becerra was treated at a hospital for injuries to the face and
released later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for third-degree assault is about five
years, although most people receive a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The players have had previous problems with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott is already taking part in a diversion program for a
drunken driving offense in January. Newson missed all of last
season after breaking his leg in a car accident in which he was
cited for driving with a suspended license, careless driving, and
driving while uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott is the top returning receiver for the Beavers. He had
45 receptions for 553 yards and two touchdowns last season as
Oregon State finished 7-5, its first winning season in 29 years.

<HEADLINE> No Trial For Cop in Soccer Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The police commander in charge of security at a
soccer game where 96 fans died will not face a new trial for
manslaughter after a previous jury failed to reach a verdict, a
judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Anthony Hooper rejected calls for a retrial of former
Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, who faced two counts of
manslaughter the deaths at Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium in 1989
-- the worst sporting disaster in British history.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the judge dismissed the jury after jurors said they
could not reach a verdict. They had earlier acquitted Duckenfield's
deputy, former police superintendent Bernard Murray, of identical
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims and fans' groups argued that police
caused the disaster at a semifinal match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest by herding spectators who arrived late into
overcrowded pens in a fenced-off area behind one of the goals. Most
victims were crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper's ruling ends an 11-year campaign by the relatives, who
brought the case as a private prosecution after state prosecutors
declined to try anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A statement read by Duckenfield's lawyer said the former police
officer, now 55, was ''naturally very pleased and relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Eastwood said his client had suffered post-traumatic
stress disorder following the tragedy. ''As a husband and father he
has every sympathy with the victims' families for the loss of their
loved ones,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Refutes GOP Charges  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Census Bureau leaders are on the defensive
three weeks after completing most of the field work for the
national head count, seeking to refute Republican charges that
shoddy procedures pervade the operation and threaten to produce
inaccurate results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, the census was described as the census that had
gone awry,'' Census Director Kenneth Prewitt told a news conference
Wednesday. ''The facts do not support this characterization of the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he countered accusations by Rep. Dan Miller,
R-Fla., that households in at least 15 areas nationwide were
miscounted. Such allegations are unfounded, Prewitt said, adding
that he remained confident the agency's quality-control checks
ferreted out any inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's
Census panel, on Tuesday publicly questioned the quality of work
done in 15 offices when Census enumerators were trying to account
for some 40 million households that failed to return a form.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau finished that phase of the count a week before
its July 7 deadline, mainly because residents mailed back 80
million of the 120 million forms sent out, Prewitt said. That 66
percent response rate was 5 percentage points higher than what
Census officials budgeted for this year, so the agency had fewer
nonresponding households to track down than planned.
</P>
<P>
   But in a follow-up letter sent to Prewitt on Wednesday, Miller
maintained that the 15 offices showed questionable patterns of data
collection. Some offices collected ''surges'' of responses very
early in the operation, which began April 27. Others had
questionable surges toward the end of the operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel named these areas as questionable: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas, Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas; Rapid City, S.D.; East Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; northeast New York City;
New Castle, Del.; north Philadelphia; and Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Census data are used to distribute billions
of dollars in federal money. The statistics also are used as a
basis for redrawing congressional and state legislative district
lines, as is mandated in the Constitution every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's spokesman, Chip Walker, said they have received related
complaints from Census takers around the country. The latest
concerns over the 15 offices were based on a review of records from
those offices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every office we listed was based mainly on data and not worker
complaints,'' Walker said. ''We used the worker complaints as
anecdotal evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said Census officials review the work from all offices
regularly, including the 15 in question, and the bureau's internal
checks weed out any discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, earlier this month he announced that
enumerators were going to revisit more than 64,000 households in
Hialeah, Fla., after officials found ''substantial procedural
errors on the part of local census staff.'' Last week, the bureau
announced it would recount 7,000 homes in Chicago because of
similar procedural problems.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the early and late surges in census responses,
Prewitt said:
</P>
<P>
   --In areas where work was completed early, specifically in
California, a flood of census-takers was sent into the field to get
data as close as possible to April 1, the date Census responses are
based on. The further away from that date answers are received, the
less accurate they are considered to be.
</P>
<P>
   --In areas where there was a later surge in work, it was often
because the office was underperforming until new management
officials were installed and more workers were brought in. That
happened in the office in New Castle, Del., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The broader suggestion that this was a 'rushed census', well
the facts point to the opposite direction,'' Prewitt said. ''We
will do everything we can to make what has been a good census a
better census.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the problems in Hialeah and Chicago warranted
similar investigations into the other offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt, based on no real evidence, to discredit
the census because the Republicans fear that it is going too
well,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, top Democrat on the
subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Johnson to speak at GOP convention on education  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Joan Johnson, seeking to become the first
black woman Republican in Congress, has landed a speaking slot at
next week's GOP National Convention in Philadelphia, Republican
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who jumped into the race for Rep. Rick Lazio's House
seat when he challenged Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate,
will speak about 10:30 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've dropped me down in a tornado and I'm still spinning,''
she chuckled on Wednesday. ''This is just extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is one of only two black Republican women running for
the House of Representatives. Her contest in eastern Long Island is
expected to be one of the most closely watched congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Monday's speakers is ''Opportunity with a purpose:
Leave no child behind.'' The featured speakers that day include
Laura Bush, wife of GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, and
Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson says she won't just focus on education during her
time in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be hitting on that subject,'' she said. She'll also touch
on securing Social Security and supporting small businesses as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party spokesman Dan Allen said the only other
confirmed speaker from New York so far is U.S. Rep. Vito Fossella,
who will speak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Johnson, who has a master's degree in social
work, has worked with the Head Start program and was personnel
administrator for the Town of Islip. She has been Islip's town
clerk since 1991 and won re-election last year with 68 percent of
the vote. Her opponent will be decided in a Democratic primary.
Lazio - a close ally - has already endorsed her.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson even served as master of ceremonies at West Islip High
School in May when Lazio announced his Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is getting used to the spotlight: she sang the Star
Spangled Banner for the opening of the Long Island Ducks baseball
team earlier this year in front of more than 6,000 people. She said
she'll use the same method at the convention as she did for the
national anthem: ''Find a friendly face and focus on it,'' she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The only black Republican now in the House is Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma; there are 28 black Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Johnson, the other black Republican woman seeking a
House seat is Jennifer Carroll, a retired Naval officer challenging
Democratic incumbent Rep. Corrine Brown of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, county legislator David Bishop and Huntington
town board member Steve Israel, are planning to compete for the
right to face Johnson in a Sept. 12 primary.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes House Vote On Measures  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an eleventh-hour bid for accomplishments
before their party convention, Republican leaders considered a
House vote Thursday on a package of tax-cut and spending measures
that also would raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would boost the $5.15 hourly minimum wage by $1 per
hour over two years, repeal the 3 percent federal tax on
telephones, cut what Republicans said were some taxes on small
businesses and finance the Treasury Department, Congress' own
operations and several smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reaction ranged from skepticism to outright
hostility, as they questioned whether the package would include tax
breaks for the wealthy and provide funds President Clinton wants
for the Internal Revenue Service and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're hearing from reports raises serious questions,''
said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also angry over the Senate's failure to act on
some of Clinton's judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish them a lot of luck,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the No.
2 Senate Democratic leader, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear how many conservative GOP House members
would support a package that contains increases in the minimum wage
and federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't vote for it,'' said conservative Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., citing both issues.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, it was unclear whether a House vote would occur
as Republicans remained uncertain over how to shape the measure in
a way that would attract maximum support.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, they said a House vote would help them blunt
campaign-season attacks by Democrats over past GOP opposition to a
minimum wage increase. They also saw it as a chance to ease the
schedule of what looms as a hectic September, when lawmakers will
be rushing to finish their work and adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate
would probably not get to the measure until after Congress'
monthlong August recess, which begins Friday. Democrats have bogged
down the Senate's work in recent days because of the fight over
judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other Republicans said they were doing all they could
to make the measure uncontroversial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to do is find a way to get a bill that we
can move and the White House hopefully can sign,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract Clinton's signature, Republicans said
they would include Democratic-sought language boosting the minimum
wage over two years, not three as Republicans have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said they would add at least $1.2 billion to a
$29.1 billion House-passed measure financing the Treasury
Department and smaller agencies. Even with the extra money, the
bill remained more than $300 million short of the $8.9 billion
Clinton wants for the Internal Revenue Service, said one
participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the extra money was expected to go to home-state
projects requested by lawmakers. The participant said it included
$3.2 million to consolidate some federal law enforcement agencies
in St. Petersburg, Fla., a city represented by House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   That measure also would allow members of Congress' salaries to
rise by 2.7 percent next year, to $145,100.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would drop controversial language in the
earlier versions of the Treasury spending bill, which had faced a
White House veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   They said this included a provision blocking preferences Smith &AMP;
Wesson would receive from federal agencies as a result of the giant
arms maker's agreement to begin using trigger locks and other
safety steps.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone were provisions easing travel and trade restrictions
with Cuba, which the House approved last week.

<HEADLINE> Roberto Benigni To Play Pinocchio  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- After resting on his ''Life is Beautiful'' laurels
for two years, Roberto Benigni is about to play what he calls the
role of his life: a puppet who wanted to be a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Italian media said Wednesday that ''Pinocchio'' will feature the
same winning formula as ''Life is Beautiful'' -- Benigni co-starring
with spouse Nicoletta Braschi as well as co-writing the script with
longtime collaborator Vincenzo Cerami.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant Benigni, whose child-like antics captivated Oscar
audiences in 1999, often compares himself to Pinocchio, whose nose
grew longer every time he lied.
</P>
<P>
   He even fell into guilty-conscience character at a Vatican
screening of ''Life is Beautiful'' for Pope John Paul II last year.
''Dad! Dad!'' Benigni cried, grabbing the elderly pontiff and
kissing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 20 years, or maybe ever since I was born, that I had
a desire that my nose would grow long,'' Benigni told the ANSA news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several ''Pinocchio'' movies since the story was
first put on film in a 1911 Italian production. The most famous was
the 1940 Disney animated classic.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Addresses Halliburton Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dick Cheney, who resigned as chairman and chief
executive officer of Halliburton Co. to join George W. Bush on the
GOP presidential ticket, told shareholders and analysts Wednesday
that his decision to leave the oil services company was not an easy
one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not seek the job offered to me ... but I concluded after
the governor talked to me a number of times I did have an
obligation to return to public service if I was asked,'' said
Cheney, who was named Tuesday as Bush's vice presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney joined Halliburton five years ago and is credited with
leading it to the top of the oilfield services and products
industry. He described his final statement during a conference on
the company's second-quarter earnings as ''a special occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney returned to the company's Dallas headquarters after his
first campaign excursion with Bush on Wednesday morning to Cheney's
hometown of Casper, Wyo. He was rejoining Bush on the campaign
trail on Friday in advance of next week's Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spoke briefly at the beginning of the conference before
turning it over to company president Dave Lesar, who will succeed
Cheney as chairman and CEO effective Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the company is in excellent hands,'' said Cheney,
adding that he'll be watching the company very closely since he is
a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cheney sold 100,000 shares of stock in the oil
services and construction conglomerate for an estimated $5.1
million. He held options on 229,000 shares before the sale.
</P>
<P>
   On the earnings front, Halliburton's second-quarter net income
was $75 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $83 million,
or 19 cents per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues were $2.9 billion, down slightly from just over $3
billion in the 1999 quarter. Revenues for the company's Energy
Services Group increased 13 percent over the division's 1999
second-quarter revenues. Company officials say price improvements
fed the increase, which offset a 29 percent decrease in the
Engineering and Construction Group's revenues. Officials attributed
the decrease to reduced customer spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of the year, Halliburton's net income
was $339 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with $145
million, or 33 cents per share, for the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the first half of the year was $5.7 billion,
compared with $6.3 billion during the same period in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Pirates: Kendall Talks at Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates' contract talks with
catcher Jason Kendall are at a stalemate, apparently because of the
significant amount of money the Pirates want to defer in a proposed
$60 million, six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talks are at an impasse and, other than that, I have no
comment,'' general manager Cam Bonifay said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates are trying to lock up Kendall, a three-time All-Star
and a consistent .300 hitter, with a long-term contract before they
open their new ballpark next season. Kendall could become a free
agent after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have offered Kendall a contract that would make him
the second highest-paid catcher behind the Mets' Mike Piazza, even
though Kendall does not hit for power and will finish the season
with about one-third as many RBIs as Piazza. Piazza has a $91
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But while Kendall has told friends in baseball that the money is
acceptable, he is reluctant to sign a contract in which about 40
percent of the money -- or more -- might be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pirates, who play in baseball's second-smallest
market, lack the significant revenues of clubs such as the Yankees
and Braves, they are asking their top players to defer some money
until they move into their new ballpark and their revenues
gradually increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates recently signed outfielder Brian Giles to a $45
million, six-year contract -- $12 million of it deferred, a
significant sum by comparison to most multimillion dollar contracts
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Giles agreed to defer some money to help the Pirates sign
Kendall and pitcher Todd Ritchie, who signed a $5.5 million,
two-year contract last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has said little about the talks since the amount of the
contract offer was revealed, saying, ''I really don't want to talk
about it. Everybody knows I want to stay here, and I'm just trying
to concentrate on playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bonifay's remarks the talks are stalled, Kendall's
agent, Dan Lozano, has told the Pirates to be more creative. It is
believed Kendall would sign if the Pirates shifted more of the
money into upfront cash rather than deferred money.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall is making $2.1 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's reluctance to defer millions of dollars holds more
significance in Pittsburgh than it would most cities. Two of the
city's best-known athletes, Mario Lemieux and Dave Parker, did not
receive all of the money initially due them in long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after 1985 federal court testimony revealed Parker
used cocaine, the Pirates sued the former NL MVP to keep from
paying money owed under the $8 million, five-year contract he
agreed to in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates argued Parker's drug use negatively affected his
play and thus negated the contract. The two sides settled out of
court, with Parker accepting less money than was due in his initial
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux wound up buying the Penguins last year after the team
went bankrupt and couldn't pay him more than $26 million owed him
in deferred compensation. Lemieux subsequently rolled the money due
him into an equity stake he used to become the team's majority
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kendall's reluctance to sign the contract, he is not
being booed during home games and has generally received a warm
reception each time his name is announced. A banner hanging in
Three Rivers Stadium on Monday night read, ''Please stay.''

<HEADLINE> 14-year-old rape, robbery defendant denied release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A state Superior Court judge Wednesday
denied a request by a 14-year-old Camden boy charged in a break-in
and rape at a Gloucester Township motel that he be released to the
custody of his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose name is not being released because of his age,
has been held at the Camden County Juvenile Detention Center in
Lakeland since July 9. He and Ernest Buffaloe, 23, also of Camden,
allegedly broke into a room at the Howard Johnson Express Inn on
July 8, bound and raped a Blackwood woman, then held her hostage
with her two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe and the teen are charged with robbery, aggravated
assault, sexual assault, kidnapping, conspiracy and cruelty to a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe is being held at the Camden County Jail in lieu of
$300,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested, the teen was wanted on a bench warrant for
charges stemming from incidents in 1997 and 1999. He admitted
Wednesday to a disorderly person's offense and theft in relation to
those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ann Mandell, the boy's lawyer, argued that she intends to
contest the new charges against him and that, except for the
offenses he admitted to Wednesday, he had no prior record.
</P>
<P>
   She also said he had been in the custody of his father, who is
now in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''That could be one of the reasons he got into trouble, because
there's no example for him to follow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ergood, assistant Camden County prosecutor, objected to
his release, saying he was wanted on a bench warrant for two years,
and, because he faces serious charges, has ''great incentive to
flee.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Robert W. Page said the teen must continue
to be held at the juvenile detention center because he was a
fugitive, because he faces serious charges and because he is a
threat to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed other unspecified charges from August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Page scheduled a hearing for Sept. 28 on whether the teen should
be tried as an adult, as the Camden County Prosecutor's Office is
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the pair broke into the room at the inn, about 15
miles southeast of Camden, raped the woman in front of her two
sons, ages 2 and 6, then held the family hostage. When the father
returned to the room, he also was bound.
</P>
<P>
   The family escaped after about 30 minutes, but the
hostage-takers barricaded themselves in the room for three hours
before surrendering, police said.

<HEADLINE> Ft. Worth Convicted Killer Executed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convicted killer who attacked a
prison chaplain while on death row was executed Wednesday for the
abduction and slaying of a Fort Worth teen-ager 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The execution by injection was the second this month in Texas
and 26th this year. At least six executions are scheduled for
August.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Soria, 33, spoke slowly and barely audibly for several
minutes before his execution, mentioning ''Allah'' and ''love.'' He
never made eye contact with the father of his victim, who watched
through a window nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Allen Bolden, 17, was leaving the Fort Worth Boys Club
when Soria and a companion asked for a ride in his father's car.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered Bolden to drive to a secluded spot, where Soria
told police he ''stabbed the guy twice in the soft spot at the back
of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The knife severed Bolden's spinal cord and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Soria and the companion, now serving a 45-year prison term for
aggravated kidnapping, were stopped two days later for speeding
near Del Rio, 400 miles to the southwest, where Soria hoped to sell
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Soria confessed to the killing and told authorities where they
could find Bolden's body.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Soria, while on death row, attacked a 78-year-old
volunteer prison chaplain with a razor, nearly severing the man's
hand. The minister is recovering.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's any blessing at all, at least now jurors will know
what they did was the correct and appropriate thing to do,'' said
Edward Bolden, father of the murdered teen.
</P>
<P>
   Soria in recent weeks repeatedly tried to kill himself.

<HEADLINE> Arrests Made in Jerusalem Fires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police have arrested three Orthodox
Jews suspected of setting fire to a Conservative synagogue in
Jerusalem and vandalizing a sanctuary of Messianic Jews, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were arrested in the last two days, Jerusalem
police spokeswoman Sigal Toledo said. One is a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, secular Jews who recently became religious, are
suspected in the June 24 firebombing at the Ramot Forest synagogue,
affiliated with the Conservative stream of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Several prayer books and chairs were lost in the fire. The
damage was estimated at several thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue, located in the well-to-do section of Jerusalem's
Ramot neighborhood, had been the target of demonstrations and
protests by ultra-Orthodox Jews before.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, police suspect the three of attacking a sanctuary
where Messianic Jews worship in downtown Jerusalem. That attack was
two days after the firebombing at the Ramot synagogue. Torah
scrolls were stolen and the assailants -- unsuccessfully -- tried to
set fire to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Messianic Jews accept Jesus as the messiah, while maintaining
Jewish rituals and practices.

<HEADLINE> Court's error allows inmate's early release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Because of an oversight by the court system,
the reputed former head of a southern New Jersey crime network will
be released from prison several years early.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Patrick Giaquinto, who has been incarcerated since 1984,
could be paroled as early as February. U.S. District Court Judge
Stanley S. Brotman on Tuesday reduced Giaquinto's sentence from 50
years to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under his original sentence, Giaquinto, 46, of Bellmawr, would
not have been eligible for parole until 2008.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in 1983 of trying to sell and distribute $1.5
million in bogus food stamps and paying two men to shoot a Maple
Shade man who had implicated Giaquinto in the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Giaquinto filed a motion in 1987 maintaining that the court had
illegally imposed his sentence by relying on inaccurate information
from a presentencing report that said he was a ''dangerous special
offender.'' That characterization increased his sentence by 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the court failed to consider his motion. Brotman, in an
opinion filed March 8, said the court was therefore obligated by
law to resentence him.
</P>
<P>
   Giaquinto pleaded guilty in 1981 to setting ablaze a Pennsauken
restaurant owned by his wife and sister to get an insurance
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Giaquinto was a model prisoner while he was
held at several federal penitentiaries. Giaquinto earned his
general equivalency diploma, completed an anger-management course
and started an arts-and-crafts class for inmates at Lewisburg
Federal Prison in Pennsylvania, making art that was sold to raise
money for a children's wing of a hospital, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Raging Fires Straining Resources  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Expecting no relief for months in the West's
brutal and unrelenting fire season, federal officials have called
out the military to help contain blazes that are charring tens of
thousands of acres from Washington to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At least four dozen fires burned across parts of 10 Western
states on Wednesday, racing through timber, grass and brush.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the smaller fires had no crews on hand at all. In
some cases, calls for help with wildfires have been delayed or
unfilled for days because resources have been devoted to major
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are approaching the end of July and already resources
are thin,'' said Amy Teegarden, a Forest Service spokeswoman in
Helena, Mont. ''We're just now getting into what is normally the
busy fire season.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire season, which began when a prescribed
brush-clearing fire near Los Alamos, N.M., raged out of control and
destroyed more than 200 homes in May, has become the worst since
1996. The long-range forecast calls for much more hot, dry weather
before the season ends, typically with the autumn's first snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Elite hot-shot firefighting crews, air tankers and helicopters
are in big demand. Federal authorities have asked Canada to send
firefighting planes; they've also asked Montana Gov. Marc Racicot
to encourage businesses and state agencies to let employees
volunteer for fire duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more to do than can be done, then when something like
two large fires hit you, it gets worse,'' said Joe Hartman, a fire
management team commander on the blaze that has charred 23,000
acres of Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of gaining ground on the fires, Army soldiers will
attend crash courses in firefighting techniques organized by the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. Center
spokeswoman Lorraine Buck said the soldiers should be ready to join
fire lines next week.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the fire center mobilized military units was in
the summer of 1996, using 1,160 soldiers. Fires that year had
burned 3 million acres by July 25; so far this year, fires have
burned 2.6 million acres. Buck did not know how many soldiers would
end up on lines.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the Mesa Verde National Park, the nation's largest
archaeological preserve, was 25 percent contained Wednesday. Among
the other large fires in the West are a pair of wildfires totaling
18,000 acres near Helena, Mont., that have forced dozens of
families from their homes; and a 9,500-acre lightning-sparked fire
in northeastern Washington state that has charred more than 30
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Buck, of the fire center in Idaho, said another setback is that
summer monsoons have not hit Arizona and New Mexico, so the fire
danger remains high. That has strained resources there because
firefighters are being called to help other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll get skeleton thin -- just a bare bones minimum -- but
we'll reach a threshold where we'll say, 'Sorry, we have to keep
these folks here,''' said Gary Benavidez, fire management officer
for the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico, where
about a dozen lightning-ignited fires were burning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 5,600 federally financed firefighters are in the
field -- in addition to those from state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, Gail Baer of the Forest Service said this is the first
year she has seen firefighting crews recruited from as far away as
Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Georgia to help
with her state's blazes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we have a shortage, because everybody is busy on a
fire,'' said Vi Hillman of the Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
''We are stretched pretty thin.''

<HEADLINE> Problems Found in Zimbabwe Election  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The main opposition party on Wednesday
asked the High Court to annul a parliamentary election result after
polling officials found evidence of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Shepherd Mushonga, who lost to ruling party
veteran Chen Chimutengwende, asked the High Court to cancel the
result based on findings made by election officials examining the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials reopened ballot boxes and examined voting
materials after a court on Tuesday sided with a request by the
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The district
is one of 30 that the party has disputed following June 24-25
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation, election officials found incomplete voter
lists and lists where names had been checked off twice, indicating
they voted more than once at different polling stations, Mushonga
said. The documents also showed that unlisted voters from other
districts as well as voters known to be dead had cast ballots, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mushonga, a lawyer, said scrutinizers saw this as evidence of
rigging in the ruling party's favor and grounds to seek a judicial
order canceling the result. The opposition was asking for a
reversal of the result by default or a fresh poll, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have been messed up and interfered with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the High Court rules against Chimutengwende, a former
information minister, he could be disqualified under electoral law
from holding any political office for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Chimutengwende and Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede were not
immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the June elections, the opposition party, the biggest threat
to President Robert Mugabe's two decades of rule, won 57 of the 120
parliament seats up for grabs, leaving the ruling party with a
slender 62-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party said it is also contesting ruling party
victories in districts where it said widespread political violence
and intimidation violated electoral law. Political violence in the
run up to polling left at least 31 people dead and thousands
homeless, most of them opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After the polls, international observers from the European Union
declared the polls could not be interpreted as free and fair mainly
because of the violence preceding voting.

<HEADLINE> Speakers at Tue's GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf will address
the Republican National Convention next Tuesday -- from the
battleship USS New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf is to join Sen. John McCain, both Bob and Elizabeth
Dole and George W. Bush's international affairs adviser Condoleezza
Rice in discussing the night's theme, national security.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers will discuss military readiness and the morale of
U.S. troops, convention co-chairman Andrew Card said Wednesday at a
briefing outside the First Union Center. Bob Dole, who was badly
wounded in World War II, will talk about the sacrifices and
contributions made by veterans of that war, Card said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, who was commander of U.S. and allied troops in the
Persian Gulf War, will speak about military preparedness. For
dramatic impact, he will be aboard the Iowa-class battleship that
saw action in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and off the coast of
Lebanon in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The 887-foot New Jersey is to be towed from the Philadelphia
Naval Yard, where it was launched in 1942, to its new permanent
home at a pier across the Delaware River in Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Tuesday's lineup is Vietnam War veteran Everett Alvarez
Jr. of Rockville, Md., who will lead the pledge of allegiance.
Alvarez was the first American pilot shot down over North Vietnam,
in 1964 and spent more than eight years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   In an addition to Monday's lineup, New York GOP House candidate
Joan Johnson will speak on education.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who wants to become the first black Republican woman in
Congress, jumped into the race for Rep. Rick Lazio's seat after he
decided to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau credits Newark response surge to more workers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A surge of responses toward the end of the
Census operation in Newark is attributable to ''more people and
better management,'' the Census Bureau argued Wednesday, responding
to Republican charges of questionable practices in the state's
biggest city and 14 other areas of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Newark had lagged well behind state and national
response rates after the national mailing of forms, which Census
officials attributed to a low response in the black community and a
high turnover rate among Census enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got off to a slow start, they had a poor recruitment
effort,'' said Steve Jost, associate Census director. ''We ended up
sending management from the regional office, and sending hundreds
of door-to-door workers from the Bronx (N.Y.), Manhattan (N.Y.),
and other New Jersey offices.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Census now has a response from every housing
unit in Newark, or confirmation that no one lives there, Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   No recount for Newark is planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June, the bureau reported that more than 82 percent of
all Newark households had returned forms, compared to a national
average of over 98 percent and a New Jersey rate of 96.2 percent in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of Newark's Census outreach efforts, Luigi
Campana, said Wednesday the late surge could be attributable to the
national ad campaign and that the Newark Full Count Committee
provided liaisons to Census enumerators ''in neighborhoods where
doors were not being opened.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sound trucks and church officials asked people to
open their doors to Census workers, said Campana, the city's
assistant business administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point I am not aware of anything that would be called
questionable,'' Campana said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear yet whether Newark will maintain its position as
the state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   No official numbers are available yet, but Campana said he
expects the count to show 320,000 to 350,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Census gave Newark 275,221 residents, compared to
228,517 in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 estimates showed that Newark had lost people to its
suburbs, dropping to 267,823, while Jersey City's waterfront
development and continued influx of new immigrants brought its
population up to 232,429 people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's Census panel, on Tuesday questioned the quality of work
done in 15 offices when Census enumerators were trying to account
for some 40 million households that failed to return a form.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt told a news conference in
Washington on Wednesday that the allegations are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up letter sent to Prewitt on Wednesday, Miller
maintained that the 15 offices showed questionable patterns of data
collection. Some offices collected ''surges'' of responses very
early in the operation, which began April 27. Others had
questionable surges toward the end of the operation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Looks To Thwart Huge Protest  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Armored vehicles ringed Lima's historic center
and police stopped buses in the Andean highlands Wednesday as
President Alberto Fujimori worked to thwart a huge protest that
aims to disrupt his inauguration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the series of planned demonstrations took shape
Wednesday evening, when several thousand laborers gathered in
Lima's main plaza outside the gates of National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted ''Democracy, yes; dictatorship, no,'' and waved
banners, but there was no confrontation with security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the palace, Fujimori told reporters that ''the rights of
all citizens will be respected.'' But, he added, ''naturally,
outbreaks against public order will not be permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent bid to show his willingness to work with the
opposition, Fujimori also named Federico Salas, one of eight
opposition candidates who ran against Fujimori in this year's
elections, as his new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also reiterated that his feared national intelligence
adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, who for a decade has been answerable
only to the president, would take on a more public role.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements appeared to aim at taking the wind out of the
protests, which the opposition has said will peak Friday with
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the streets to disrupt
Fujimori's swearing-in for a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Buses carrying thousands of Peruvians headed toward the capital
Wednesday to take part. But some didn't make it far: Cable news
station Canal N flashed images of police and local authorities
detaining vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   One would-be protester, Martin Soto, said he and 59 other
passengers were halted early Wednesday on the Central Highway, 50
miles east of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, a caravan of police vehicles was deployed before dawn
as the Interior Ministry prepared to place 40,000 anti-riot police
armed with tear gas around the National Palace and Congress. The
air force declared a no-fly zone above the city, prohibiting
reporters and international monitors from observing the protests in
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The protest has been dubbed the ''March of the Four Suyos,'' a
reference to the far reaches of the ancient Inca empire.
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is to show the world that there is widespread opposition
in Peru to Fujimori's ''illegitimate government,'' says Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate who withdrew from May's
presidential runoff after accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was assured of another congressional majority late
Tuesday after a flood of last-minute defections from opposition
ranks gave him 70 seats in the 120-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's candidates had won only 52 seats in the April 9
general elections. He and his supporters have denied charges that
bribes, intimidation and the threat of tax investigations were used
to regain legislative control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a betrayal, not only for the opposition but for all
Peruvians,'' said opposition Congresswoman Anel Townsend. ''We are
experiencing state terrorism, blackmail and corruption that
demonstrate that we are in the midst of a dictatorship.''

<HEADLINE> Women Make Up Much of Baseball Fans  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Women make up 46 percent of the average crowd at
a major league game, according to a report issued Wednesday by the
commissioner's office that urges teams to market more to female
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of women could not name a player on their
home team's current roster, according to ''The Commissioner's
Initiative: Women and Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys in pilot markets in Atlanta, Cleveland,
Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and New York, the report said 81
percent of women have the final say on family consumer purchases,
76 percent of women determine family merchandise purchases and 58
percent of women determine family leisure activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although women easily identify baseball as one of their
favorites and one of the best sports for the family, they have a
much more difficult time translating this belief into the behavior
of an active fan,'' commissioner Bud Selig said in a memo
accompanying the study. ''While they can talk about baseball's
positive traits in the abstract, women often do not relate the game
and the ballpark experience to the needs of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every city and among every aspect of the women's market,
the research showed that this group is seriously unfamiliar with
ballpark amenities and discount and family packages, as well as
club philanthropy and even player rosters.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, presented to owners at their July 14 meeting, urges
teams to be innovative in their marketing to women.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's OK to be corny. Women aren't looking for baseball to be
like basketball or football,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of women would attend more games and buy
merchandise if they knew about discounted ticket plans, according
to surveys in the report, and teams could raise sales to women
10-15 percent if they take initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball should have more merchandise for women produced, and in
more colors and with smaller logos, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends:
</P>
<P>
   -- Each team should create a ''Father of the Year'' award.
</P>
<P>
   -- Major league baseball should establish a promotion in which
each mother or grandmother would get a reduced-price ticket on
Mother's Day -- or the next home Sunday if the team is traveling --
if accompanied by child.
</P>
<P>
   -- Teams should create updated ''Ladies' Nights'' with
reduced-price tickets and merchandise for women
</P>
<P>
   -- Baseball should create a ''women's corner'' on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   -- Teams should invite prominent women reporters for ''insider''
tours of ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Teams and the commissioner's office should try to get
women-oriented cable stations to cover baseball.
</P>
<P>
   -- Teams and the commissioner's officer should pitch player
personality stories to morning and daytime talk shows and to
lifestyle sections of newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Gore edge in New Jersey means state GOP has its work cut out  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - As New Jersey's Republican delegates
prepare for Philadelphia, they face a tougher task than many of
their friends from other states.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from all points of the map will arrive full of
confident promises to win their home state for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But while many polls have given Bush an edge over Vice President
Al Gore nationally, which is a cheerful development for Republicans
running against an eight-year White House incumbent, the New Jersey
GOP faces a considerably steeper hill to climb.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a state where registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans 2-to-1, where President Clinton and his running mate
won in 1996 with a landslide margin of 60 percent, and where a
nationally admired Republican governor, Christie Whitman, won
re-election in 1997 by the skin of her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent national poll, done by The New York Times and
CBS News, and reported Tuesday, gave Bush 46 percent to 40 percent
for Gore. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
which means with both numbers being adjusted the race could be a
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   A new Quinnipiac Poll released Wednesday shows the reverse to be
true in New Jersey but with the same close margin.
</P>
<P>
   The poll produced by Quinnipiac College of Hamden, Conn., gave
Gore 46 percent to 41 percent for Bush with the same 3-point margin
of error. Adjusting the outcomes by the margin could reduce Gore to
43 percent and raise Bush to 44.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, co-chairman of the Bush
campaign in New Jersey, said the poll is too early to matter. He
said the key outcome of the poll is to show the two are essentially
running neck and neck, as a similar Quinnipiac Poll in June showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certainly a battleground state. I think it really hasn't
moved either way, Bush versus Gore,'' DiFrancesco said. ''We always
knew that this would be close in New Jersey. Our party is prepared
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Golden, a former Republican adviser and aide to the
governor, agreed. ''Far too much attention is paid too early on.
The campaigns really haven't begun in earnest yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said Republicans will rally for their nominee next
week in Philadelphia, and that most expect the candidate to enjoy
his first substantial ''bounce'' in public opinion against Gore
following his keynote speech to accept a nomination that in fact he
secured in March.
</P>
<P>
   But to a large extent this will be insider work, making sure the
party apparatus and fund-raising in the 21 counties gets organized
and focused. The GOP convention is not so much a wake-up call -
DiFrancesco said New Jersey was one of the first organizations to
recognize and encourage the Texas governor - as it is a strategy
conference and pep rally to get things moving.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people start to focus in the fall, this is probably good
for Bush. He is not way behind. As they get to be more comfortable
with him, it becomes better for Bush. They already know Al Gore.
They know all about him,'' DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McLean, a political analyst at Quinnipiac College, said
the poll means the field is wide open with Gore failing to seize
the early advantage some might have expected. The poll gave the
president himself a landslide approval rating in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton has a 63 percent job approval rating, and it is not
helping Gore,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Quinnipiac question showed Bush will need Whitman's help
in New Jersey since she and other prominent Republican women are
seen as crucial in reducing the so-called ''gender gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman this week said the gender-gap issue does not exist for
Bush, but the Quinnipiac Poll suggests she is wrong. While Gore had
a 5-point lead on Bush in the overall poll, among women the poll
gave Gore a much more impressive 51-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader registered a surprising
potential impact on the outcome, according to the Quinnipiac Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The main numbers in the Quinnipiac Poll relied on one question
that offered 910 registered voters a head-to-head matchup between
Bush and Gore. But when voters were given a multiple choice, as
they will be in November, Gore dropped to 42 and Bush to 38.
</P>
<P>
   This was an insignificant change between the front-runners. What
was significant was the showing for Nader, who was backed by 7
percent of the registered voters, presumably most of that support
coming out of support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been grousing for eight years about the damage
that Reform Party founder Ross Perot did to former President Bush's
election-night chances in 1992. In New Jersey alone, Perot's
520,000-vote total was six times larger than Bill Clinton's margin
of victory. Had former President Bush managed to attract just one
out of every five Perot voters, he would have been the winner here.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nader poses the same threat, this time to the Democrat. If
the Quinnipiac Poll holds true, Nader could potentially take
250,000 votes away from Gore on Nov. 7.

<HEADLINE> Passenger sentenced after pleading guilty to disrupting flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGOR, Maine (AP) - A passenger accused of causing a ruckus
that forced a London-bound jetliner to make an unscheduled landing
pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court to charges of
assault and interfering with a flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Driss Ghandi, 38, was sentenced to three months in jail, most of
which he had already served, and was fined $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Ghandi was accused of groping, assaulting and verbally harassing
people aboard United Airlines Flight 906 on a Boeing 777 on May 16
while en route from the Newark International Airport to London.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the FBI that Ghandi was so drunk that he needed
help to open the restroom door and then was unable to get out
without help.
</P>
<P>
   There were 166 passengers and 15 crew members on Flight 906,
according to court records. After a two-hour delay in Bangor while
FBI agents conducted interviews, the flight continued to London.
</P>
<P>
   Ghandi, who held a license that listed an address of Glendale,
Colo., was authorized to work in the United States with permission
of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest involving jetliners diverted to the
Bangor International Airport, the last major U.S. airport on the
flight path commonly used by jets flying to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, three jets were diverted to Bangor within a
five-week span because of air rage incidents, all of which involved
alcohol.

<HEADLINE> LA Warned On Democratic Convention  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Using videotape of the violent protests
during the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle to make
their point, police are warning downtown businesses to prepare for
the worst during the Democratic National Convention next month.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners should consider boarding up glass walls and
windows, hiring additional security and stocking up on emergency
provisions like flashlights, food and water, police suggested
during a presentation to downtown workers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like a tornado,'' said Detective Darryl Butler,
who has been giving up to four such talks a day with his partner.
''You can see it coming, but you don't know where it's going to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of businesses and property owners, police have
been meeting with downtown workers to answer questions and give
advice on how to prepare for the Aug. 14-17 event. Eight officers
have been making the rounds over the past month, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some estimates are that as many as 50,000 protesters
will converge on Los Angeles, police say it's difficult to know how
many will come or what they'll do once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of activists has been trying to convince the public
that nonviolent demonstrations, marches and acts of civil
disobedience are planned and that fears about violence are
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Police concede that some of the protesters will be nonviolent,
but said they have just cause to expect destructive demonstrators,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they already have found signs that anarchists
from a national organization based in Oregon are in Los Angeles.
Within the past few weeks, police have arrested a handful of people
for taking pictures of downtown buildings from rooftops and other
unusual places, Butler said. The suspects' addresses all trace back
to Oregon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At his monthly news conference Wednesday, Police Chief Bernard
Parks said police were contacting businesses in an effort to
''develop a close relationship'' with private security guards and
to warn multinational corporations and chains, such as Starbucks,
that they may become targets.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said his department will be prepared ''for any
eventuality'' that develops, but wants protesters and others to not
think of Los Angeles as an ''armed encampment.''

<HEADLINE> Government warns states to stop inflating Medicaid numbers  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The government warned states on Wednesday to
end a practice by which they temporarily transfer money into their
own Medicaid programs to earn higher matching funds from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded letter, Timothy M. Westmoreland, director of
the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid,
said many states allow their Medicaid providers to keep only a
fraction of the nearly $2 billion generated by the transfers. In
some cases, he said, as little as 5 percent is properly allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the practice, which is legal under a loophole in laws
concerning Medicaid, some states transfer their own funds, borrowed
money or property taxes into state coffers to qualify for more
matching funds. The states then siphon off a portion of the federal
funds to use for non-Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
   The practice drives up the cost of Medicaid, the federal-state
program that provides health benefits to low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland said the states' estimates of federal Medicaid
spending for fiscal year 2000 have already increased by $3.4
billion over earlier projections - with an estimated $1.9 billion
due to the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA officials say they became concerned recently as some states
have gotten more creative with their transfer programs and bolder
about using the matching funds for programs other than Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Some states simply keep a portion of the money in their general
fund for other programs. A Department of Health and Human Services
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said New Jersey has
used the money to fund tax cuts, while Kansas and Louisiana have
used it to trim budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, Nebraska has received $139 million in
matching Medicaid payments, but has paid only an estimated $500,000
to county-owned nursing homes that qualified for the money, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Seiffert, the administrator of the Nebraska Medicaid
program, said he wasn't familiar with the figure quoted, but
defended the state's use of Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that all our decisions on the use of federal
dollars are reasonable,'' he said. ''All expenditures are made in
accordance with our approved federal plan for Medicaid services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Westmoreland said 17 states are using the
transfers to get extra federal funding and 11 others are
considering the practice.
</P>
<P>
   He said the HCFA's inspector general's office, which
investigates possible waste, fraud and abuse, is examining how
states are using the Medicaid funds. The General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative and auditing arm, may also investigate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Medicaid officials say they have been using the so-called
intergovernmental transfers for years without a peep from the HCFA.
They contend that a change could lead to service cuts or nursing
homes not being able to afford to take new Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some states could lose millions in Medicaid payments under the
proposed change. It could dramatically reduce federal matching
funds in many states that have come to rely on the money to shore
up struggling county-run nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Intergovernmental transfers vary from state to state. Michigan
routes $300 million in state funds through county-run nursing homes
to increase its matching funds, which are then used for health
services for the poor. Louisiana plans to have county-run nursing
homes borrow money from banks and hand the funds over to the state,
which will use the money to boost what it can qualify for. The
loans are paid back out of the federal funds and nursing homes get
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid cost an estimated $181 billion last year. The federal
government's share was $103 million.

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island Prison Guards Strike  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. (AP) -- A judge ordered striking correctional
officers to return to work Wednesday night, as Rhode Island
National Guardsmen called in by the governor patrolled the halls of
the state's only prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-member Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional
Officers went on strike at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday over a contract
dispute. The judge, granting an injunction requested by Gov.
Lincoln Almond, ordered them to return to duty starting with the 11
p.m. shift.
</P>
<P>
   A union lawyer said he expected all the guards to obey the
injunction, though some individual guards said they would not leave
the strike lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the correctional officers to abide by the court
order,'' Almond said at an afternoon news conference. ''Let me make
it very clear, we will not tolerate these disruptions at the
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   About 260 National Guard members, most of whom work as military
police and medical personnel, were working 12-hour shifts in the
prison in place of the striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Correctional officers outside yelled at them as they entered the
prison with state and local police and predicted they wouldn't be
able to control the estimated 3,414 inmates inside.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities insisted the prison was secure, but at the court
hearing on the injunction, Department of Corrections director A.T.
Wall described trouble inside.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic inmate didn't get his insulin on time, food trucks
were turned away by pickets and nurses and members of other unions
honored the strike and did not report for work, Wall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what it's like to train a murderer to try and do
something? They would certainly be taken advantage of,'' said Ernie
Battey of Warwick, a state prison officer for 25 years who was
among those striking outside. ''When you're in the prison, your
biggest weapons are your head and your mouth. It has nothing to do
with force.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike began after union leaders told workers at the state
prison complex, the Adult Correctional Institutions, not to report
for the day shift, which began around 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of work, the union held a rally outside the maximum
security building and told its members to strike.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 guards working the night shift were asked by the
Department of Corrections to stay on the job, and the prison was
locked down, meaning most inmates remained in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Maj. Steven Pare said guards from the overnight
shift were held over to fill the gap left by the striking day-shift
workers. ''They have the ability to run the institution, so it's
secure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 state troopers drove around the prison complex, joined
by Cranston police. Correctional officers blocked entrances and
carried signs that read ''On Strike'' and ''United We Stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't give us any respect whatsoever,'' said Chris
Travers of Pawtucket, who has worked at the prison complex for 17
years. ''We all have kids, wives and education to pay for. We're
still living on 1995 wages.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Rhode Island prison strike was in the 1970s. The state
also sent in National Guardsmen during that walkout.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator earlier this month issued some conclusions on
contract issues, including allowing the state to privatize some
non-security prison work, such as the prison kitchen and store.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no decision on pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   The union says a meeting on the issue with the state Tuesday was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The state prison is a complex of several buildings that has a
capacity to hold 3,858 inmates.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Reacquire Valdes From Cubs  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Right-hander Ismael Valdes is returning to
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Traded to the Chicago Cubs last winter along with second baseman
Eric Young, Valdes was reacquired by the Dodgers on Wednesday along
with cash considerations for two minor leaguers -- right-hander
Jamie Arnold and outfielder Jorge Piedra.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched well in his last start,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ''We think he's a quality starter who's still
young. He's a free agent after this year, which gives him incentive
to pitch well.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thanked me for bringing him back, said he's excited about
returning home to Los Angeles. He was just real excited, very
thankful and appreciative, you could hear it in his voice. It
pumped me up to hear him so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, 26, was 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA in 12 starts for the Cubs
this year after opening the season in the 15-day disabled list with
tenderness in his pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has had some adversity, but he's been pitching well of
late,'' manager Davey Johnson said from Denver where the Dodgers
played the Colorado Rockies. ''He has done well in his last two
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes spent the first six years of his career with the Dodgers,
going 61-54 with a 3.38 ERA in 176 games -- 150 of them starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocket was a fan favorite here,'' Malone said, referring to
Valdes by his nickname. ''I think the fans will be happy to have
him back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think he can help us down the stretch. He knows how to win.
He pitches well in this ballpark, he's comfortable in this
environment. He'll keep us in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, 26, was 4-7 with a 5.07 ERA in 20 games, 13 of them
starts, for Triple-A Albuquerque this year. He also appeared in two
games with the Dodgers with no record and a 4.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Piedra, 21, was hitting .283 with six homers and 52 RBIs in 92
games with Class-A Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes and Young were sent to the Cubs on Dec. 12 in what the
Dodgers acknowledged was a move to lower payroll. In return, Los
Angeles received right-hander Terry Adams and minor league pitchers
Chad Ricketts and Brian Stephenson in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was my No. 2 starter last year,'' Johnson said. ''The Cubs
are out of it, and he became available and we jumped at it. I'm
sure he will be a welcome addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is earning $5.75 million this year, is eligible for
free agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focusing on winning this year,'' Malone said when asked
if the Dodgers will try to sign Valdes to an extension. ''We'll
deal with that at the appropriate time. All our focus is on trying
to do our best to win in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was uncertain as to when Valdes will pitch for
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to talk with him to see where he's at,'' the manager
said. ''His next turn would be Friday, which is Darren Dreifort's
turn. Darren has been pitching pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers open a three-game series at Philadelphia on Friday
night. Earlier Wednesday, the Phillies traded ace right-hander Curt
Schilling to the Arizona Diamondbacks, who entered the day one game
ahead of San Francisco and 2&AMP;frac12; games ahead of the Dodgers in the NL
West race.

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign First-Round Pick Morris  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Rob Morris
signed a five-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts on
Wednesday and arrived at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a linebacker from Brigham Young, received a $5.6 million
deal, including a $2.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to be here,'' Morris said. ''We got what we needed to
get done, so now it's time to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things happened really fast and I think both sides just
realized that it was time for me to get into camp and to be with my
teammates. I think we both came to a deal that was fair and that we
felt good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris attended his first team meeting Wednesday night and will
take part in his first practice Thursday. He said that sitting out
while the rest of the team practiced was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was difficult for me,'' he said. ''I really wanted to be
here. You wanted to be playing the game that got you to this point,
so it was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Club president Bill Polian said Morris, the 28th pick overall,
agreed to the terms Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Morris missed 17 practices since training camp opened July 13.
However, he did have a chance to learn the team's defensive scheme
while participating in minicamp and summer school workouts since
being drafted in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a very good player in college. He produced and was very
effective,'' coach Jim Mora said. ''He can run for a guy who is
245, 250 pounds. He's very smart, an instinctive guy. He's a good
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts open their exhibition schedule Saturday against
Atlanta in the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will not play because it would be unfair to him because he
will have only three practices under his belt,'' Mora said. ''He
can make up what he's missed. How quickly he can make it up is the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2, 250-pound Morris was expected to be the Colts' starting
middle linebacker when the team opens the season Sept. 3 at Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was the last of Indianapolis' draft picks to agree to
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the system. There's no hard feelings,'' Polian said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, you make a deal. We went forward and I'm glad it
was done. It was a typical business deal. Since the Colts opened
camp a week early it made it look like the holdout was longer than

<HEADLINE> Miller Awaits USA Gymnastics Answer  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Shannon Miller wants to compete at the U.S.
Gymnastics Championships. Now it's up to USA Gymnastics to decide
if it will let her.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is still nursing a hairline crack in her right leg and
won't be able to do all four events when competition begins
Thursday night. But she'd like to do something, said her coach,
Steve Nunno.
</P>
<P>
   Nunno would like Miller to do one or two events, probably the
uneven bars and the vault. But she's scheduled to start on the
balance beam Thursday night, an event she might not be ready to do,
and the uneven bars are her last event.
</P>
<P>
   So Nunno wants USA Gymnastics to tell him whether Miller can
just do an event or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to pull us out of the meet, they can pull us
out,'' Nunno said Wednesday. ''But they'll have to pull us out,
because we want to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Colarossi, president of USA Gymnastics, was not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is letting Miller skip Thursday night's
event and compete Saturday. But that would be highly unusual
because Saturday's event is a continuation of Thursday's, and
results from each day are combined to get the final all-around
score.
</P>
<P>
   It's also never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to be a distraction to the girls during the
all-around,'' Nunno said. ''... Personally, I don't care what other
people care about. I care about my athlete and for her to do the
best she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is getting better with each day, Nunno said. She did
dismounts off the uneven bars and vault for the first time since
she was injured, and she ran faster during practice Tuesday night
than she has in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nunno said he'll have Miller warm up with the other athletes,
and make a decision at the last second on whether she can go or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ''She'll be warming up with everybody else,'' he said. ''If she
does a good routine at the 30-second touch, I'll say, 'She can do
it, it's safe, let's go.'''
</P>

<P>
   ENERGIZED ATLER: Even for an athlete training for the
Olympics, Vanessa Atler knew she was way too tired.
</P>
<P>
   She was exhausted all the time, she didn't have any energy and
her legs were dead after only one floor routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something was wrong,'' the 1997 co-national champion said. ''I
knew something wasn't balanced out. We just got the idea, why don't
we go to a nutritionist and see what's going on. And he's fixing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The nutritionist told Atler she was lacking vital nutrients and
minerals, like magnesium. He made some changes to her diet, and
she's now eating three to four servings of fruit and vegetables a
day, two servings of bread and a handful of nuts. She also eats
beans three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   She's been on the new diet for 1&AMP;frac12; months, and is amazed at the
change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm never tired,'' she said. ''The day he started me on
it, I felt it right away. It was such a big difference. I couldn't
believe it. I was like, 'How was I doing this before?'''
</P>
<P>
   That Atler's body revolted wasn't a complete surprise. She
admits she had ''really bad'' eating habits when she was younger,
and she didn't do anything to change them as she got older.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making her feel better physically, Atler said the
changes to her diet have helped her mentally, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a lot more confident. I feel healthy,'' she said. ''I
just feel better. You know when you look better, you feel more
confident.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BELLICOSE BELA: Women's national team coordinator Bela Karolyi
pulled back from the criticism he levied last month against USA
Gymnastics, when he voiced his displeasure with the makeup of the
selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi was upset because two members of the committee, U.S.
judge Marilyn Cross and former Olympic gymnast Tracee Talavera, had
not seen the gymnasts work in the number of training camps he has
held this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little concerned and I think I expressed it more than
I was supposed to,'' Karolyi said. ''But I do have respect for all
these people. Marilyn Cross is an excellent judge. Tracee Talavera
is a wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   The other member of the committee will be former gymnast Shari
Knight-Hunter. At one point, she considered making a comeback and
entering the national championships, but she didn't, which means
her spot on the committee is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was definitely concerned about it,'' Karolyi said. ''But I
think, overall, these people are going to watch the competition and
they're going to be able to make good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The four will not have votes, per se, when they decide on the
team in the minutes following the Olympic trials. They will simply
meet and try to reach a consensus.
</P>

   NEW CHAMPIONS: David Henderson and Justin Spring finished
first in the junior championships Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, from Crosby, Texas, totaled 50.450 points in the
all-around competition to defeat Jamey Houle by .05 points in the
junior 16-18 division.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson will win the title if none of the 17-year-olds
competing in the senior event fail to make the senior team, but
still score higher than Henderson did.
</P>
<P>
   Spring, from Burke, Va., won in a relative runaway, outscoring
DJ Bucher 51.025-50.100 in the junior 14-15 division.
</P>
<P>
   The junior girls determine their all-around finals Saturday.
</P>

   ROPES AND MATS: Yewki Tomita withdrew from the men's senior
competition Wednesday. He reinjured his left shoulder during a
training camp in June. He has filed a petition to compete at the
Olympic trials next month. ... 1996 Olympian Amanda Borden was in
the audience, as was Jennie Thompson, who retired last month.

<HEADLINE> Booker Back in Camp for Falcons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons cornerback Michael
Booker returned to training camp Wednesday, two days after failing
to show up for afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great to be back with the team,'' Booker said after
practicing at Furman University. ''This team has been my family for
three years, and I was one of the brothers who strayed away for a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker, a former No. 1 draft pick vying for a spot on the
Falcons, took part in a workout Monday morning, then didn't show up
for the afternoon session. He was spotted later that night picking
up a takeout order at a nearby pancake house.
</P>
<P>
   Booker missed two more workouts Tuesday. After talking with
coach Dan Reeves, the cornerback promised to rejoin the team
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him I was glad,'' said Reeves, who didn't plan to fine
Booker. ''I felt he needed time to think about some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker said he left the team ''because I felt a lot of weight on
my shoulders. I didn't know if I was contributing. I didn't want to
be out there if I wasn't contributing. I prayed about it, and I
felt like being in camp where I was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker, a first-round draft pick from Nebraska in 1997, has
failed to meet the Falcons' expectations. Plagued by injuries, he
has made only 10 starts in three seasons and took a pay cut from
$1.4 million to $750,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta signed free-agent cornerback Ashley Ambrose in the
offseason, leaving Booker to compete for a backup position.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that his mind was on football again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can guarantee that when I step on the field, I'm playing
hard now,'' Booker said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal immigrant sentenced to life for murder of innocent bystander </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A New Jersey drug dealer who entered this
country illegally was sentenced Wednesday to 57&AMP;frac12; years to life in
prison for the murder of a bystander, a father of six, during a
shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Molina, 25, of Paterson, N.J., was sentenced on his April
25 conviction for the murder of Arcadio Guerrero, 54, in 1997 even
though it is uncertain whether the bullet that killed Guerrero was
fired by Molina or the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had it not been for the actions of Pedro Molina, Mr. Guerrero
would be alive today,'' Assistant District Attorney Gail Heatherly
told State Supreme Court Justice Benard Fried just before he
sentenced the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly said Molina entered this country from the Dominican
Republic several years ago with a phony birth certificate and a
fake Social Security card. Even now, she said, no one is sure who
he is.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said Molina was selling drugs out of his
apartment and terrorizing his neighborhood from the day he arrived.
''He would fire his gun at people on the street if they displeased
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The events that led to Guerrero's slaying began when Molina
hailed a cab in the Bronx around 7:45 a.m. on Oct. 13, 1997. Seeing
a young woman on the street, he had the driver pull over and he
convinced her to ride with him.
</P>
<P>
   Molina soon pulled a gun and said he intended to go to a hotel
with the woman, trial testimony showed. The woman objected and the
driver, trying to attract attention, sideswiped a police car at
Broadway and 137th Street.
</P>
<P>
   As the two officers approached, Molina bolted and ran west on
137th Street toward Riverside Drive while firing a gun. As the cops
chased him and returned fire, Guerrero, sweeping the steps of his
building, was hit in the torso by a bullet. He died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly said that Molina could have simply thrown the gun
under a car somewhere as he fled, but he chose to shoot it out with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Troy Brown, who was in court to see the sentencing,
said that when Molina fired at him during the foot chase, ''You
could see puffs of smoke from the bullets hitting the ground by my
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina was shot in the leg and treated at Harlem Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Molina told Fried that Guerrero's death was as much the police
officers' fault as his. ''Never will I say that I am guilty,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Fried sentenced Molina to 25 years to life for murder, two
consecutive terms of 12&AMP;frac12; to life for kidnapping the cabby and the
woman, and 7&AMP;frac12; to 15 for attempted aggravated assault for shooting
at the cops.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Take Deal in Stride  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr.
arrived Wednesday at Busch Stadium, he insisted he'd done nothing
all day but goof off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spent a little time at the hotel, had some lunch,'' he said as
he rode the elevator down to the Diamondbacks locker room. ''Now,
we're going to catch a ball game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a bad way to spend the day.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Garagiola wanted to hide his excitement by pretending
he had taken the day off, his smile gave it all away. About 30
minutes later, he stepped out of the locker room to confirm what
everybody already knew: Curt Schilling was a Diamondback.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia sent Schilling to Arizona for first
baseman-outfielder Travis Lee and pitchers Omar Daal, Vicente
Padilla and Nelson Figueroa. It's a deal that will match Schilling
with Randy Johnson, who leads the National League with 15 wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are probably a handful of true number one
starting pitchers in baseball,'' Garagiola said. ''With today's
trade, we now have two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And as imposing as that prospect is, the Diamondbacks didn't let
the excitement of adding Schilling to their rotation get the best
of them. Following a closed-door meeting, the team filed out for
batting practice, while manager Buck Showalter downplayed what
certainly is one of the top 1-2 punches in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has potential, and that potential is based on a very strong
track record,'' Showalter said. ''I hope that Randy isn't going to
pitch any differently. He has been outstanding. We have got to win
more than two out of five games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Daal said he understood. After going 16-9 last
season with a 3.65 ERA, he had lost his spot in the Diamondbacks
starting rotation. He's is 2-10 with a 7.22 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I have not had a good year this year,'' Daal said.
''They need someone to be a starter and Schilling is a great
starter. That's how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Garagiola and Showalter are pleased that the 33-year-old
Schilling will be part of the Diamondbacks rotation beyond this
year. He is signed through the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''That fact that he is signed for next year is important in this
deal,'' Garagiola said. ''This is a not a stretch-drive
rent-a-player.''

''wholesale infringing'' against the industry. Noting that 70 million people

Hall Patel said ''what lures them is the infringing use.'' Patel said the
injunction will go into effect Friday. Napster had argued that personal copying

<HEADLINE> Balloons filling GOP convention hall, last minute preps under way  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The First Union Center is filling up with a
lot of air - and the politicians haven't even arrived yet.
</P>
<P>
   High school students Wednesday began inflating more than 150,000
balloons that will be dropped onto presumed Republican nominee
George W. Bush and the crowd at the GOP convention after he
delivers his acceptance speech Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of tedious, because you just keep blowing and
tossing, blowing and tossing,'' said Lauren Roberts, a senior at
North Penn High School. ''But it's better than sitting home.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, hunched over a series of air nozzles on the
mezzanine of the First Union Center, dropped each inflated balloon
into a long tube made of plastic netting. The tubes were then
hoisted to the catwalk high above the arena floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed hour, workers will pull a series of ripcords
and the balloons will gently float to the convention floor in
curtains of red, white and blue. The display will last 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big deal for Balloon Celebrations, the Atco, N.J.,
company that won the contract. Owner Rick Sicolo said his biggest
previous drop was about 15,000 balloons - one-tenth the number at
the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Sicolo admitted the convention is keeping him up nights, but
said he's confident the drop will go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of thought that goes into it, a lot of
calculating,'' he said. ''You have to make sure everything goes as
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the students filled the balloons, Republican officials
gave reporters a tour of the nearly completed convention stage.
</P>
<P>
   The curvy, blue-carpeted stage is finished in wood Formica,
rosewood, jade-green slate tiles, and mahogany and maple wood
laminates. In a departure from conventions past, the lectern is
only 7&AMP;frac12; feet above the convention floor, to give speakers a less
imposing look.
</P>
<P>
   They used to speak ''down to the masses. This time, the
Republicans are with the masses,'' convention co-chairman Andrew
Card said.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the stage is the 10-mm LED video screens,
which use a new technology that provides sharper resolution than
the grainy video walls used at previous conventions. The
Republicans are using three screens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're using just about every (video) panel that's been
manufactured so far,'' said Joe Stewart, the stage designer.
</P>
<P>
   The podium - 167 feet wide, 62 feet deep and weighing about
100,000 pounds - will accommodate musical performances in addition
to the parade of speakers that will address delegates each night of
the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, transportation officials said they had made
extensive preparations to deal with the expected increase in
traffic in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware will boost the number of
highway patrols and deploy extra tow trucks. Electronic signs will
alert motorists to potential delays and suggest alternate routes.
And except for northbound Interstate 95 in Delaware, construction
projects on all major roadways will cease.
</P>
<P>
   Planners have also tried to limit the number of road closures.
In the downtown area, one block of Chestnut Street in front of
Independence Hall will be closed to accommodate TV news crews.
Another eight blocks around the First Union Center will be shut
down.

<P>
   David Cohen, co-chairman of the regional convention host
committee, said there will be traffic delays, but they will be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason for people to feel that they need to flee
the city and avoid the city because we're going to have gridlock.
People will be able to get around if they're careful,'' he said.

<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the crown jewels of the convention experience,
PoliticalFest, opened its doors to media and invited guests
Wednesday evening. The nine-day festival celebrates American
politics and is being held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   PoliticalFest was dreamed up as a way for ordinary folks to
participate in the festivities. It opens to the public Thursday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Georgia Senate Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bob Barr, an outspoken critic of
President Clinton and a staunch gun rights advocate, was the only
Georgia Republican known to be considering a run for the Senate
seat vacated by the death of Democratic Sen. Paul Coverdell. But
his Georgia GOP colleagues endorsed nobody after meeting Wednesday
for the fourth time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our version of 'Survivor','' said Rep. Nathan Deal,
who confirmed he isn't a candidate. ''We're trying to decide who to
vote off the island.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP meeting coincided with the arrival in Washington of
Democrat Zell Miller, who will be sworn in Thursday as Georgia's
junior senator. Gov. Roy Barnes appointed Miller to temporarily
fill the Senate seat left by Coverdell, who died last week of a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to mount a united front against the popular
former governor in the Nov. 7 special election, which is open to
any candidate who pays the $4,100 filing fee.
</P>
<P>
   While hoping to reach a consensus Wednesday, they merely
narrowed the field. Rep. Saxby Chambliss, who didn't attend the
meeting, announced he wouldn't seek the post despite closely
exploring the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want a Democrat winning my seat, particularly the one
who's running for it,'' said Chambliss, who faces former Macon
Mayor James Marshall in his re-election bid for the moderate 8th
District.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, the first to remove his name from
consideration, indicated colleague John Linder wasn't interested
either and that Jack Kingston was leaning against it.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Mac Collins and Johnny Isakson announced earlier they've
ruled out a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Barr wouldn't declare his candidacy Wednesday
night but wouldn't rule out an announcement Thursday. Barr attended
Wednesday's meeting but refused to answer questions from reporters.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Candidates End Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez and the former
state governor trying to unseat him in this weekend's general
elections closed their campaigns Wednesday with large rallies in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people braved rain and filled two main
avenues in different parts of Caracas. The turnout for Chavez's
rally was much larger than that for Francisco Arias Cardenas, who
is hoping to stage an upset victory on Sunday despite polls that
show him well behind the popular, charismatic president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to deliver a thundering knockout to the
traitor!'' Chavez said of his opponent before a throng of cheering
supporters, many of them wearing the president's trademark red
beret.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, is up for re-election only 17 months after taking
office because of a new constitution he pushed through last year
that requires public offices to be ''re-legitimized'' through new
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Arias broke into Venezuela's national scene by
staging a failed military coup together in 1992, and both paid for
it with a jail term. But Arias broke away from the president
earlier this year, claiming Chavez had betrayed the original goals
of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Polls released earlier this week gave Chavez a 20-point
advantage over Arias, who has had difficulty shaking an image as
the candidate of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting has polarized Venezuela along class lines, with
the overwhelming majority of Venezuela's poor flocking to Chavez
despite rising crime and an anemic economy.
</P>
<P>
   During a rousing speech Wednesday in which he repeatedly broke
into song, Chavez called his detractors ''oligarchs, traitors and
counterrevolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same time across the city, the 49-year-old
Arias, a two-time governor of the oil-rich state of Zulia, made a
plea for national unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''My proposal is for rich and poor alike,'' he said. ''The
people in the slums do understand me, do comprehend me and do hear
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was supposed to have been held on May 28, but was
postponed due to technical problems in the vote tallying system.
The delay was a major embarrassment for Chavez, whose leftist
movement had ''handpicked'' the electoral council that failed to
organize the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans will also choose congressional legislators,
governors and mayors on Sunday, and those races are tighter than
the presidential fight.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition will likely get more
than 50 percent of a new, 165-member unicameral congress, it will
probably fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to rubber
stamp presidential appointees and proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with the likelihood of the opposition capturing
half of Venezuela's 23 governorships, could mean greater checks on
Chavez's power.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and other opposition candidates are trying to capitalize
on an acute economic slump that occurred during Chavez's rule
despite a surge in the international price of oil, Venezuela's main
export.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez blames the downturn on decades of corruption in previous
governments, and is promising to concentrate on fixing the economy
once re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   But 60-year-old Frances Becerra, one of about 5,000 Arias
supporters who showed up for the candidate's closing rally, said
she thinks a re-elected Chavez ''won't last three months because of
his poor performance.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs $600M for AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation committing up to $600 million in
U.S. aid for fighting HIV and AIDS in Africa and developing
countries elsewhere was passed Wednesday by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On a voice vote, the Senate approved a bill by Sens. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., and Jesse Helms, R-N.C., authorizing $300 million in each
of the next two years for AIDS prevention and treatment and also
for the care of AIDS orphans in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill directs the Treasury Department to establish a trust
fund with the World Bank for the prevention efforts and the
treatment of orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
the bill requires that up to $220 million of all U.S. bilateral
funding for HIV-AIDS programs over the next two years be spent on
supporting orphans in Africa. The United Nations has predicted that
the disease is expected to wipe out half the teen-age population in
some poor countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children are the hardest hit and they are the innocent victims
of this sexually transmitted disease,'' said Helms. ''In fact the
28 million children orphaned in Africa alone could easily prove to
be a low estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also authorizes $120 million over the next to years for
treating and controlling tuberculosis in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in the House, which voted earlier
this month to fully fund President Clinton's request for $244
million next year for combatting and treating AIDS in poor
countries.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Leader Speight Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- George Speight, who toppled Fiji's elected
government in a two-month hostage standoff, was arrested Wednesday
by the military, which then stormed a stronghold of his armed
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Troops gas assaulted a school in a suburb of Suva, Fiji's
capital, where about 300 Speight supporters have been camped for
more than a week. One man died and 39 others were injured, seven
seriously, in the gunbattle, military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise action came ahead of the announcement of Fiji's new
Cabinet, expected Thursday, which Speight had demanded be stacked
with his supporters or he would renew his campaign of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a self-proclaimed champion of the indigenous Fijian
majority against the sizable ethnic Indian minority, was accused of
illegally possessing weapons and threatening Fiji's new president --
and Tarakinikini said Speight could face treason charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat on the life of the head of state was connected with
pressure for him to nominate a certain lineup of the interim
government,'' Tarakinikini told a news conference. ''That in itself
can be seen as an act of treason.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight was seized around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, at a checkpoint,
along with his legal adviser Tevita Bukarau, his spokesman Jo Nata
and a bodyguard, local radio and the military reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shots rang out, but there were no injuries reported. Speight and
his entourage were hauled off to a military barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, around 6 a.m. Thursday, troops raided the school,
firing tear gas, and gunfire rang out several times, FM96 radio
reported. Soon afterward a heavily guarded truck emerged, carrying
more than dozens of Speight supporters, some of them bleeding, all
of them with their hands and feet tied.
</P>
<P>
   The truck took about 30 to Suva hospitals, while more military
vehicles ferried hundreds of other rebel supporters out of the
school. FM96 reported that a soldier was wounded by a gunshot in
his upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to the root of the matter, we are arresting the
people who orchestrated the whole campaign of civil unrest in this
country,'' Tarakinikini told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini said a police investigation will determine what
charges will be brought against Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Although Speight and his supporters had been granted an amnesty
for releasing the last of their 27 hostages on July 13,
Tarakinikini said the amnesty was conditional on the rebels turning
in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came as President Ratu Josefa Iloilo put the final
touches on a Cabinet lineup aimed at bringing Fiji out of its
10-week-old government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's military bolstered its presence Wednesday across the
country ''in anticipation of a negative reaction ... to the
announcement of the new Cabinet,'' spokesman Lt. Ro Alipate
Mataitini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight set off the crisis on May 19 when led an armed gang into
Parliament and took dozens of lawmakers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The military regime which took power 10 days after the
parliament raid agreed to his demands to scrap the multiracial
constitution and oust the government of prime minister Mahendra
Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's
population, have too much power. The Indians were first brought to
Fiji in the 1870s as indentured labor.
</P>
<P>
   Speight stormed out of a meeting with Iloilo earlier this week,
apparently in anger that the ailing 80-year-old president refused
to back down from his chosen candidate for prime minister, banker
Laisenia Qarase.

<HEADLINE> SFC Judge: Executions Can Be Viewed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Media and witnesses may view executions in
their entirety, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, overturning
California's prison policy of allowing people to watch lethal
injections only after the deadly chemicals begin flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in 1996 by news organizations challenging the
state's policy of keeping a curtain drawn in the death chamber
while the prisoner is led in and strapped down and needles and
tubes are inserted.
</P>
<P>
   The media groups, including The Associated Press, claimed those
procedures are part of the execution process that should be visible
to witnesses and argued that the state was effectively preventing
the public from learning what happens in an execution.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions on observation were adopted by the state
Corrections Department in 1996 shortly before California's first
lethal injection execution.
</P>
<P>
   At that execution, Feb. 23, 1996, a curtain was pushed back to
reveal William Bonin already strapped to the table with needles and
tubes inserted into his body.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, officials reported Bonin's last words and described
the difficulty a staff member had in inserting a needle into a
vein.
</P>
<P>
   The procedures were challenged by the Society of Professional
Journalists and the California First Amendment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is, if there is a purpose to witnessing
executions, it is to see the manner of the execution, to see how
the execution was administered,'' Terry Francke, the coalition's
executive director, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Past and present San Quentin wardens had testified in support of
keeping reporters and other witnesses from seeing guards or the
prisoner until the chemicals began flowing. Warden Jeanne Woodford,
and others said allowing reporters to see more of the procedure
would increase the chances that guards would be identified and
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The media said claims of danger to guards were unfounded and
could be addressed by protective measures, such as using surgical
masks to conceal their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Calls after hours Wednesday to the Corrections Department were
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in 1997 had ruled that an
execution must be visible to reporters from start to finish. His
order was in effect for only one execution before an appeals court
reinstated the state's restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the public and press have, at most, a ''severely
limited'' constitutional right to view executions, which must be
balanced against the prison's security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The court returned the case to Walker to determine whether the
state's rules were an ''exaggerated response'' to its security
needs. Walker said Wednesday he had determined that they were.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 5, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jose Silva beat Milwaukee for the second time
in a week after going winless as a starter for more than a year,
pitching four-hit ball over seven innings of the Pittsburgh
Pirates' 5-4 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aramis Ramirez hit a two-run home run off Jimmy Haynes (9-10),
while two Pirates runs scored on errors as the Brewers lost their
fifth in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Silva (7-4) matched a career high with eight strikeouts and
allowed only an unearned run in his second successive strong start
against the Brewers. Milwaukee's lone run off Silva came when third
baseman Ramirez threw away Marquis Grissom's apparent inning-ending
grounder following Haynes' two-out double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Haynes did, Silva -- usually a weak hitter -- helped
himself by contributing a run-scoring single to the Pirates'
two-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pirates leading 3-1, Kevin Young led off with a single
and came around to score when left fielder Geoff Jenkins misplayed
Pat Meares' two-out single. Silva followed with a single to center,
only his third hit in 17 at-bats this season and his fifth hit in
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Young also led off the third with a double and scored as catcher
Raul Casanova threw wildly as Young moved up on Haynes' wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Silva's start continued a run of excellent starts by the
Pirates' rotation, which has allowed five earned runs in its last
43 innings. The Brewers have one earned run off Pirates starters in
the first two games of the three-game series, a solo homer Tuesday
by Tyler Houston that was the only run allowed in nine innings by
Kris Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Silva began the run of strong starts by winning in Milwaukee 9-2
on July 20, yielding two runs in eight innings. Before that
victory, he was 0-8 as a starter since beating Montreal on May 15,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez had an RBI single off Scott Sauerbeck in the
eighth and Mike Williams allowed on RBI double to Chris Jones and a
sacrifice fly Luis Lopez in the ninth. Williams got his 15th save
in 17 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seven of the last nine Brewers errors are by outfielders.
... Ramirez's homer was his second since returning from the minors
June 19. ... Pirates RHP Francisco Cordova will come off the DL and
start Saturday against San Diego, with RHP Todd Ritchie going on
the DL with a strained muscle in his right side. ... The Brewers
are 11-5 in Pittsburgh since joining the NL, but have lost three of
their last four there. ... Silva is 10-17 as a starter. ... Pirates
All-Star OF Brian Giles went 0-for-3, dropping his average to .298.
He was hitting .342 in mid-June. ... Haynes lost his third start in
a row.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes House Vote On Measures  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an eleventh-hour bid for accomplishments
before their party convention, Republican leaders planned a House
vote Thursday on a package of tax-cut and spending measures.
</P>
<P>
   A bill combining the measures would repeal the 3 percent federal
tax on telephones, cut what Republicans said were some taxes on
small businesses and finance the Treasury Department, Congress' own
operations and several smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also had considered including a $1 boost over two
years to the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. But that was
dropped from the package late Wednesday night after Democratic
leaders in the Senate said they would block any consideration of it
there, according to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract President Clinton's signature,
Republicans had said earlier they would include Democratic-sought
language boosting the minimum wage over two years, not three as
Republicans have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw it as a chance to ease the schedule of what looms
as a hectic September, when lawmakers will be rushing to finish
their work and adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reaction ranged from skepticism to outright
hostility, as they questioned whether the package would include tax
breaks for the wealthy and provide funds Clinton wants for the
Internal Revenue Service and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're hearing from reports raises serious questions,''
said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also angry over the Senate's failure to act on
some of Clinton's judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish them a lot of luck,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the No.
2 Senate Democratic leader, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear how many conservative GOP House members
would support a package that contains increases in the minimum wage
and federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't vote for it,'' said conservative Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., citing both issues.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate
would probably not get to the measure until after Congress'
monthlong August recess, which begins Friday. Democrats have bogged
down the Senate's work in recent days because of the fight over
judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other Republicans said they were doing all they could
to make the measure uncontroversial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to do is find a way to get a bill that we
can move and the White House hopefully can sign,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans are adding at least $1.2 billion to a
$29.1 billion House-passed measure financing the Treasury
Department and smaller agencies. Even with the extra money, the
bill remained more than $300 million short of the $8.9 billion
Clinton wants for the Internal Revenue Service, said one
participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the extra money was expected to go to home-state
projects requested by lawmakers. The participant said it included
$3.2 million to consolidate some federal law enforcement agencies
in St. Petersburg, Fla., a city represented by House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   That measure also would allow members of Congress' salaries to
rise by 2.7 percent next year, to $145,100.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would drop controversial language in the
earlier versions of the Treasury spending bill, which had faced a
White House veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   They said this included a provision blocking preferences Smith &AMP;
Wesson would receive from federal agencies as a result of the giant
arms maker's agreement to begin using trigger locks and other
safety steps.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone were provisions easing travel and trade restrictions
with Cuba, which the House approved last week.
