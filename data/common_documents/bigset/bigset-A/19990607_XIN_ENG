<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Mexico Pledge to Maintain Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Mexico on Sunday
pledged to continue the implementation of the agreed oil
production cuts and warned against non-abidance by the output
quota.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reiterated their full support and
commitment, along with other oil producers, to the continued
implementation of the agreed supply cuts, said a joint statement
issued after the talks between Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Nasser
Al-Sabah and visiting Mexican Energy Secretary Luis Tellez.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) including Kuwait and non-OPEC nations including
Mexico agreed in the Netherlands last March to trim their
production by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) to raise the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Mexico pledged to cut their output by 144,000 bpd
and 125,000 bpd respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides expressed satisfaction with the significant level
of adherence in the supply reduction agreements," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
However, they asserted the need to maintain vigilance and
continuation of the concerted action of all producers in order
to achieve the desired improvement in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have recently climbed back to about 17 U.S.
dollars per barrel since the oil producers began to make
their pledged cuts on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The prices in the global oil market plunged to below 10
dollars per barrel at the end of last year, or a nearly ten-year
low.
</P>
<P>
Tellez arrived here earlier in the day from Saudi Arabia
for a one-day visit, the Kuwait News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Li Zhaoxing on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to oppose
hegemonism and, meanwhile, to develop its ties with the United
States, Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, said
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the growth of a sound and stable Sino-U.S.
relationship is beneficial not only for the fundamental interests
of the two countries but also for the maintenance of peace and
stability in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li made the remarks at a reception here in honor of
over 20 American scholars who will leave for China to work in some
Chinese Universities under a Fulbright exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed high appreciation of the "courage, boldness and
strong faith in justice" on the part of those American scholars
who are ready to go to China at a time when the Sino-U.S.
relations hit "difficult times in many years" as a result of the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S.-led NATO forces
and the release of the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador refuted the "dirty names" the Cox report
imposed on China, and exposed the hypocrisy of the authors of the
report.
</P>
<P>
"If the authors of the report really have any conscience, why
(they) not conduct an investigation on the U.S.-led NATO bombing
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade which resulted in the killing
of three innocent Chinese correspondents and wounding more than 20
Chinese diplomats?"
</P>
<P>
"If they are really concerned with espionage-hunting, why
(they) not carry out an investigation on how much technologies the
United States has 'stolen' and 'illegally gained' from China?"
</P>
<P>
"If they are really to care about peace and security of
America, why (they) not make efforts to encourage the U.S.
government to follow suit of the Chinese government to renounce
the first use of its nuclear weapons?"
</P>
<P>
While castigating the authors of the Cox report, Ambassador Li,
however, paid high tributes to the American people for their
sincere "friendly sentiment" toward China.
</P>
<P>
he said that after the Chinese Embassy got attacked in
Belgrade, more than 1000 American friends went to the Chinese
Embassy here to pay condolences and sympathy over the death of the
three Chinese correspondents and condemn the brutal bombing, and
among them were over 20 U.S. Congressmen and dozens of
high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, "I have received more than 4000
letters and e-mails which expressed deep sorrow and indignation
over the bombing event."
</P>
<P>
"China do regard the Americans as friendly people and we're
very sincere in developing relations between the two countries and
the two peoples, and we're also sincere in opposing power politics
and hegemonism," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Urges EU Play a Key Role in Rebuilding of Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Europe may have played second fiddle
to the U.S. in the war for Kosovo, but in the reconstruction it
will play as protagonist, Romano Prodi, the designated head of
the European Commission, said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As NATO and Yugoslav generals discussed details of the Serb
withdrawal from the war-torn region, Prodi told Italian daily
Corriere della Sera about his plan to spark a virtuous circle of
economic and political development in the entire Balkan area.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a future of guaranteed peace could only come by
gradually drawing the Balkans into European institutions, he
recalled that on Friday the European Union summit in Cologne had
confirmed the commission's leading role in this process.
</P>
<P>
"Europe may have had a secondary role in the war but in peace
it will be the key player," said Prodi, who will formally take up
his powers as head of the EU executive in September.
</P>
<P>
Prodi has already said he intends to call an international
conference as soon as the war is definitively over to look for
ways of stabilizing the situation in Kosovo by confronting the
problems of the area of which it is part.
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear that we're not talking here about
helping Kosovo alone," he told the daily, adding that "we must
help the entire Balkan area."
</P>
<P>
"We must think about an international conference and a plan for
the economic, social and political reconstruction of the region
involving the progressive integration of the Balkans into the
common European home," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League to Help Palestinians Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab League legal experts will help
the Palestinian National Authority draft a constitution for a
future Palestinian state, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A committee of the league's experts has been formed to work on
the draft, Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said
after a meeting with Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, who arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for a three-day
visit, heads a Palestinian committee of legal experts for drafting
the constitution and Abdel-Meguid chairs the league's committee.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said he and Abdel-Meguid discussed in detail steps for
preparing the Palestinian constitution, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had originally planned to
declare an independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim
Palestinian self-rule under the 1993 Oslo Accord expires. But he
later postponed such a declaration to avoid complicating Israel's
elections on May 17, which turned out to be Ehud Barak, leader of
the leftist Labor Party, ousting Benjamin Netanyahu, hardline
Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Shaath and Abdel-Meguid also discussed a
possible five-way Arab summit among Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon
and the Palestinians, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who called for
the summit after Barak's victory, is continuing efforts to
organize the summit to coordinate positions before peace talks
resume under Israel's new government.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Targets Bombed by U.S. Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Some civilian facilities and
military sites in southern Iraq were bombed on Sunday by U.S. and
British warplanes, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 12:00 (0800 GMT) and 17:45
(1345 GMT), 36 formations of enemy warplanes coming from Kuwaiti
and Saudi airspace violated southern Iraqi airspace over the
provinces of Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiya, Misan, Najaf and Muthana.
</P>
<P>
He said that the enemy formations attacked civilian facilities
and military sites in Muthana and Thi-Qar provinces, adding that
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not mention whether there were any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Eleven formations of enemy planes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Dohuk and Erbil
provinces at 10:34 (0634 GMT), said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the United States and British bombardment
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have made 6,285
sorties in the southern no-fly zone and 1,523 sorties in the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the two no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraq's military and civilian targets in the no-fly zones,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these no-fly
zones and has vowed to continue confronting any allied plane
violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament to Discuss Government Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament is expected to
start debate on Monday on the government program characterized by
its positions about the outstanding issues of headscarf wearing and
basic education.
</P>
<P>
According to the parliamentary bylaws, the government program
should be negotiated within two days after it is publicized and a
vote of confidence must be held one day after the debates are
complete.
</P>
<P>
The 57th government, led by the central-left Democratic Left
Party (DSP), has a total of 351 deputies in the 550-seat
parliament, showing that the newly formed coalition is likely to
win the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The coalition between the DSP, right-wing Nationalist Movement
Party (MHP) and the central-right Motherland Party (ANAP) has
promised the country a fruitful and harmonious government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition partners agreed in the government program to
maintain the eight-year basic education policy, under which
primary school graduates should be able to attend Koran courses
organized by the Religious Affairs Directorate during the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
The government is also determined to prevent the use of
religious sentiments for political purposes and to uphold the
secular principles of the state.
</P>
<P>
A women deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party was boycotted in
the parliament last month for wearing headscarf, a traditional
Islamic costume. She was later deprived of her Turkish citizenship
as well as her deputy status after she was found to have American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
People wearing headscarfs were forbidden from entering public
institutions in Turkey, a mostly Muslim-populated but strictly
secular country.
</P>
<P>
Under the government program, measures will continue to be
implemented in an effort to prevent headscarfs from becoming a
political symbol in state offices.

Speaking in a press conference in the northern Greek city of

Venizelos noted that in order to protect Greek consumers, the
Greek government would not hesitate to impose a ban on imports of
foodstuffs and beverages from any country that failed to meet
public health standards.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that he would request domestic producers
to widen quality control measures for their own products.

Fears of dioxin contamination in imports of Belgian chicken,
eggs and egg-based products spread to cover other meat imports
Friday, Greece's veterinary authorities imposed a ban on all
Belgian animal products and prepared to seize shipments of beef
and port, including sausages and canned meats.

BRUSSELS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
here Sunday that it will take time to discuss detailed military
agreement between NATO and Yugoslav generals.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that NATO will continue its bombing and preparation
of ground troop deployment "until the Serbs accept and begin to
implement the detailed military agreement that has been outlined
to them by NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions between General Sir Mike Jackson and his team,
and the representatives of the Serb military, are continuing," he
said. "Now I do not have the details at the present time of
exactly what clarifications the Serb have sought from General
Jackson and what additional authority the Serb military commanders
have brought with them today from Belgrade," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are a number of very technical, very complex
issues to be discussed and these talks in Kumanovo could take some
time to conclude," the NATO spokesman told reporters at NATO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Shea also said that "it is in the interests of the Serbs" to
accept and sign the military agreement as soon as possible because
"the linkage here is simple". "We will not stop until they start,
and as they are not yet starting their withdrawal, we are not yet
stopping our air operations," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He also described the continuing talks between the NATO and
Yugoslav militaries as "in a businesslike professional manner".
But he said the talks will "take a little bit longer and NATO has
to continue its air operations because "we are determined to nail
down every last detail in this military technical agreement so
that later on there can be no misunderstanding, no
misinterpretation, no ambiguity as to exactly what the Serbs are
required to do".
</P>
<P>
"We know that a little bit of care and patience at the
beginning," the spokesman said. "We will continue both out air
operations and the build-up of our ground forces in theater until
the detailed agreement is signed and until we see clear signs that
it is being effectively implemented," he added.

<HEADLINE> Abkhazia Peace Talks to Be Held in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The three-day peace talks between
representatives of the Georgian state and its region of Abkhazia
are expected to be held in Istanbul, Turkey on Monday under the
patronage of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Organization of Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), the United States, Germany, France, Britain and Russia
will also participate in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are expected to include negotiations not only
on the political and security aspects of the Abkhazia conflicts,
but also on economic, humanitarian and social issues.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that "the outline
of a durable and just solution to the Abkhazia conflict is of
great significance, not only for Georgia's internal peace and
stability, but also for peace, security and welfare in our region
to prevail."
</P>
<P>
The Abkhazia conflict erupted after Georgia gained independence
in 1991, with the new constitution failing to address the status
of the Abkhazia region.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Georgia's state forces and rebels flared up in
the summer of 1992, and a ceasefire agreement was signed one year
later.
</P>
<P>
At present, the U.N. and Commonwealth of the Independent
States (CIS) peace-keeping forces are monitoring the
implementation of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Abkhazia has led to a mass exodus of Georgians
from the region.
</P>
<P>
The number of Georgian refugees is estimated at some 200,000,
which accounts for more than 80 percent of the original Georgian
population in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 Russians and 25,000 Armenians have also fled the
area.
</P>
<P>
Before the conflict, Georgians constituted 45.7 percent of the
Abkhazia population while the Abkhazians made up 17.2 percent. In
addition, some 16.5 percent of the population were Russians and
14.6 percent Armenians.
</P>
<P>
The remaining population included Orthodox Greeks and other
ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Jones Beats Johnson to Become Undisputed Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Roy Jones unified the light
heavyweight boxing title Saturday night by winning every round in
a brutal beating of Reggie Johnson in Mississipi.
</P>
<P>
Jones punished Johnson from the third round on, punching him at
will in the late rounds.
</P>
<P>
Jones, 40-1 with 33 knockouts, became the first undisputed
light heavyweight champion since Michael Spinks relingquished the
title in 1985 to campaign as a heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
Jones won 120-106 on the three judges' cards. Jones, holder of
the WBC and WBA titles, knocked down Johnson three times. Johnson,
IBF champion, couldn't hit back in the sixth, blood dripping down
his chest and staining his white trunks, while Jones danced around,
taunting him.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 39-6-1, seemed to be in desperate trouble throughout
the fight, but kept answering at the bell.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth defense of his titles in the last 18 months
for Jones, who won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, lost
on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained the
title later that year. Jones added the WBA title last July 18.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 32, won the WBA light heavyweight title in 1992 and
lost it in 1993. He became IBF champion by knocking out William
Guthrie last year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Yugoslavia's Acceptance of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday welcomed
Yugoslavia's acceptance of the Kosovo peace plan, hoping it would
pave the way for the return of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, during its regular weekly session, "welcomes the
approval of Yugoslavia of the proposed peace plan which calls for
stopping hostilities, the withdrawal of Serbian forces and the
return of refugees," the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia on Thursday agreed to accept the peace plan for
Kosovo drafted by the Group of Eight (G-8), comprising seven most
developed nations and Russia, and brought to Belgrade by European
Union envoy and Finish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russia's
Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) demands the Serb
forces to withdraw from Kosovo to let in an international force
with NATO at its core to monitor the return of the refugees, who
had fled to neighboring countries since NATO began airstikes
against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government expressed hope that the return of
refugees and the establishment of an ethnic Albanian self-rule
system in Kosovo would help peace to prevail in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> ANC Could Miss Two-Thirds Majority by One Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) appears to be one parliamentary seat shy
of winning a two- thirds majority in the second democratic
election, as the vote-counting process entered its final stage.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results show that by Sunday afternoon, the ANC had
won 66.38 percent of the 15.94 million votes counted, although
only part of this figure had been verified.
</P>
<P>
This would give it 266 seats in the National Assembly, one
short of what it needs to change certain clauses of the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
With results from 99.07 percent of voting districts
representing about 99.79 percent of registered voters already in,
no significant new power shifts were expected, according to South
African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
The final verified results are expected to be announced by the
Independent Electoral Commission Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said the formulae used to allocate seats means
the ANC could need up to 68 percent of the total vote to win a
two-thirds majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, SAPA quoted the New National Party's (NNP's) election
campaign head Boy Geldenhuys as pointing out that the issue was an
academic one.
</P>
<P>
This was because the ANC would receive backing from the Pan
Africanist Congress -- which is set to secure three seats in the
next Parliament -- should it want to change key elements of the
constitution, such as the provisions dealing with land, he said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of the ANC winning a two-thirds majority has
dominated much of the build-up to the poll, despite the ruling
party's assurances that it had no intention of changing the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, the Democratic Party (DP) was still well
ahead of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in the race for second
place in the poll. DP officials said even if the IFP won the
majority of outstanding votes, it would still be more than 100,000
votes clear. The DP had 9.56 percent of the unverified vote count
and the IFP 8.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The beleaguered NNP had slipped to 6.88 percent while newcomer
United Democratic Movement was in fifth place with 3.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with 1.43 percent
of the counted votes was the only other party to win more than one
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Federal Alliance, Pan Africanist Congress, United
Christian Democratic Party, Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging (Afrikaner
Unity Movement), Freedom Front and Minority Front also secured
enough support to be represented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the crunch provinces of KwaZulu- Natal
and the Western Cape have changed little throughout the weekend,
with no party emerging with an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, the IFP was leading with 41.98 percent of the
counted vote for the provincial legislature, followed by the ANC
with 39.18 percent and the DP with 8.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Western Cape, the ACDP looked like emerging as the
king-maker with its 2.79 percent of the vote enough to give an
NNP-DP alliance the support it needed for an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
The NNP won 38.39 percent of the vote and the DP 11.91 percent.
The ANC with 42.07 percent, won the most votes in the province,
but its chances of wooing alliance partners to rule the province
appeared slim.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Youths to Achieve Educational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela has
urged South African youths to redouble their efforts to ensure
they reach the highest pinnacles in education, South African Press
Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the funeral of Eastern Cape Premier Makhenkesi
Stofile's only son Sikhulule, 21, in Alice in the Eastern Cape at
the weekend, Mandela encouraged the youth to aim for masters and
doctorate degrees.
</P>
<P>
"You must not be satisfied with the attainment of matric and
junior degrees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sikhulule, a student at Varsity College in Cape Town, died when
Lindiwe Hani's car he was driving hit a wall in Rondebosch on May
29.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by his wife Graca Machel and slain Black
Consciousness leader Steve Biko's son Hlumelo, said youths were
the foundation the country would be built on.
</P>
<P>
He said the best way for youths to remember Sikhulule was to
make a pledge to achieve excellent educational performance. They
should provide themselves with a quality education as future
leaders of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress was established by traditional
leaders committed to liberating their people from "the iron hand
of white supremacy" , he told mourners.
</P>
<P>
Churches had played a vital role on the education of black
people, and had built schools, as well as hiring teachers to
ensure black people had education, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He urged the youth to emulate Sikhulule's resilience in facing
hardships, which he experienced when his father was periodically
jailed by former governments.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Yugoslav Military Officials Agree to Extend Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO and
Yugoslav military officials, who having been holding a marathon
meeting all day Sunday, agreed to extend the two-hour break for
another couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
The talks did not resume at 9:00 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) as
earlier announced. A NATO spokesman told reporters: "a mutually
agreeable extension to that break has been agreed."
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting so far as "the talks between military
professionals although "very little progress has been made."
</P>
<P>
"At nine o'clock when they (the Yugoslav representatives) came,
we were expecting signature," he said, admitting that he was "a
little bit disapointed" about the Serb's refusal to sign the
so-called military technical agreement.
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman, who is from the U.S. army, declined to
speculate why the Yugoslav side has so far not signed the
six-page document.
</P>
<P>
He just said that "they are in a meeting at their own level" in
a separate tent and that "we hope they would come back to sign it
in a few more hours."
</P>
<P>
There is no specific deadline for the Yugoslav delegation to
sign and "we are flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that if the Yugoslav side does not sign the
document, the air campaign will continue.
</P>

era. Education, which is responsible for nurturing professionals
for the new era, must introduce advanced information technology to
meet the need of the future," said Zhou Li-gao, rector of Macao
University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese culture has a long history and enjoyed
periods of glory. "In the computer era of the times, however,
Chinese education and Chinese computerization face new challenges.
"
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the conference will include several forums for
participants to discuss standard Chinese terminology used in
information science, a unified and standard coding system for
Chinese characters and the conversion of different Chinese texts
on the Internet, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee of the conference has received 152
papers from nine countries and regions and 95 of them will be
presented at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Cypriot Foreign Ministers Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan today demanded that NATO immediately stop the bombing of
Yugoslavia so as to provide the necessary conditions and
atmosphere for the United Nations to solve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides, who is accompanying Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides on a six day state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that an immediate halt in the bombing would not only
help all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia get relief from the suffering
of war, but would also be beneficial to the stability and
development in the Balkans, the rest of Europe and the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that Cyprus stands for a peaceful solution to
the Kosovo issue, and opposes the use of force. Tang expressed his
appreciation for that.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government holds that the Kosovo issue should be
peacefully solved through political dialogue under the principle
of respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity
and ensuring the rights and interests of all ethnic groups in the
Kosovo region," the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations should play its due role in
seeking a political solution of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Tang also expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of
bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
He said China holds that each country should be equal no matter
how big or small it is, noting that China is keen to promote
diplomatic consultations with Cyprus and work together with Cyprus
to develop a stable and cooperative relationship into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that China is an influential country in the
world, adding that Cyprus places great importance on its relations
with China, and is willing to conduct multi-faceted consultations
and exchanges with it, so as to promote the continuous development
of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges World to Defuse Tension in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The international community
should "contribute positively" to defusing the tension along the
Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir area, Pakistan's
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press briefing here that the international
community must look at the root cause of the present "serious
escalation."
</P>
<P>
Indians "are not talking of peace. They are on war path. We are
talking of peace, which reflected our goodwill to defuse the
situation," Altaf told the briefing at the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
There cannot be a durable peace without the settlement of the
Kashmir issue and the international community should help realize
this objective, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community must "focus on the need for
the just and permanent settlement" of the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said that under the Simla Agreement signed between
Pakistan and India in 1972, no country should use force to alter
the LoC.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the Indian allegation of "armed intrusion and
aggression" by Pakistan and termed it as "a baseless charge."
</P>
<P>
Altaf also refuted the Indian allegation that Pakistan is not
respecting the LoC. "It is in fact India which has violated the
LoC several times since the Simla Agreement in 1972," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian attempt now is "to hoodwink the world and
deflect its attention from the Indian military repression as well
as the illegal occupation of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, despite all provocation, continues to strive for the
peaceful resolution of all disputes and has offered to solve the
current situation on the LoC through dialogue, Altaf noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian military aggression and the illegal occupation of
Kashmir is the root cause of this core dispute in the region,"
said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Have Smaller Cotton Growing Areas: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)-- China has to reduce its cotton
growing areas, improve cotton quality, lower cost and raise
efficiency in an effort to increase its cotton competitiveness on
the market, according to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji who spoke
recently at a national working conference on cotton held here
between June 3-4.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that
the country has to reduce its cotton growing areas through
economic means instead of administrative orders, as the cotton
supply far exceeds the demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that years of bumper cotton harvests and decreasing
consumption have resulted in mounting stockpiles and losses to
farmers. In addition, he said, many farmers are still growing low
quality cotton which is not marketable.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that governments of all levels must send out a strong
signal to the market, stating clearly that the cotton supply is
far too high and that cotton prices will definitely go down
substantially this year, especially for low quality cotton.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged local governments to set different prices for
different quality of cotton, so as to stimulate farmers to
voluntarily choose to grow high quality cotton and in smaller
areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that cotton is an important source of income for
farmers in some regions. The reduction of cotton growing areas and
lowering of cotton prices will adversely affect some cotton
farmers' income at present, but is in keeping with farmers' long-
term interests. Only when cotton output is reduced and cotton
quality raised can farmers' income be increased gradually, Zhu
added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that lifting control over cotton prices doesn't
mean that the government can just idly sit and watch, adding that
governments of all levels should impose tough punishments to
companies and individuals that engage in cotton purchase,
processing and marketing without proper approval.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local governments should no longer approve new
cotton ginning projects, he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Disburse Loans to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will disburse the delayed 18 million U.S. dollars loan to
Uganda and cooperation between the world financial institution and
the African country is back on track, a senior official with the
IMF said here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zia Ebrahim-Zadeh, resident representative of the IMF in
Uganda, told a press conference that an IMF came to Uganda
recently and found the Ugandan economy has been running well.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF never suspends its discussion and cooperation with
Uganda as reported in some newspapers. We only delayed some of the
process," he corrected.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from the Statistics Bureau based in Entebbe, 40
kms south of Kampala, he said Ugandan economy is expected to grow
by 7.8 percent, a very rare growth rate in Africa and even in the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said the IMF delayed the disbursement because
it thought the country's defense spending was surpassing the
designated limit.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official also commended the efforts by the Ugandan
government, especially, the Bank of Uganda, to close insolvent
commercial banks, saying that it is necessary to keep the
financial sector healthy.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year arrangement, the IMF is to disburse 78
million dollars to Uganda in the coming financial year beginning
from July.
</P>
<P>
One third of the money running the Ugandan government is from
the donors with the World Bank and the IMF as key members.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Rush To Confirm Attendance at Fortune Global Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Droves of multinational companies
are confirming their presence at this year's Fortune Global Forum
scheduled for September in Shanghai and the numbers have increased
in the last few weeks, the organizers said here today.
</P>
<P>
John Needham, president of the Conference Division of Fortune,
told Xinhua that after the bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade on May 8 by NATO, people had worried that some
multinationals might withdraw from the Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said the worry has proved unnecessary, as not a single
multinational company has done so and on the contrary more
companies have applied for participation.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said in the last week of May, more than 30
representatives, including seven from multinational companies from
the United States, confirmed their presence.
</P>
<P>
Needham said he was more than satisfied that more than 350
leading companies in the world have confirmed their presence at
the forum, though the event is more than 100 days away.
</P>
<P>
Among the 350 firms are General Motors, Ford Motor Company,
Mitsui and Co., Limited, the General Electric Corporation, Sony,
Kodak and Nokia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is expecting more confirmations in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Needham expressed his belief that economic development would be
China's top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said the heads of multinational companies surely understand
this and know that this forms the basis of their co-operation with
China.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident of the success of the Forum, because he
is confident of the Chinese economy and the strong competitive
power of Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Solve Own Health Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Africa must not depend on developed
nations to control epidemiological diseases, a Zimbabwean minister
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps
said in most cases developed countries intervened when the
diseases threatened their preferential trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Stamps was opening a one-week conference of experts on
epidemiological diseases being attended by delegates from Southern
African and Indian Ocean countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The problem is ours to solve because developed
nations have a habit to combat areas that have devastating
potential to spread to the north."
</P>
<P>
He said the conference should come up with solutions to meet
the challenges of communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Regional Director for Africa of the World Health Organization
Ebrahim Samba said the conference would seek to end weaknesses
affecting national capacity for adequate epidemic preparedness and
response.
</P>
<P>
He said the countries in the sub-region were confronted with
severe outbreaks of cholera, meningitis, malaria and measles.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation is purely and simply unacceptable given the
availability of effective technologies and the possibility to
mobilize adequate resources," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He said the countries should change their working methods to
re-orient activities and resources toward measurable results.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch New Stimulus Package: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will announce a
new economic stimulus package soon to lure foreign investors with
new tax breaks, Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leatham said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said tax breaks and a new import tax structure would be
contained in the economic stimulus package, which is expected to
go to the cabinet by next month.
</P>
<P>
The new package would be focused on stimulating the real estate
sector and related industries, possibly through a proposed
securitization scheme, so that the Thai economy would grow 1
percent this year as targeted.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry would also give financial support to local
investors, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises,
through the so-called venture capital fund, which is a cooperation
project between lenders in both the public and private sectors and
those in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposed package would supplement the one implemented in
late March aimed mainly at stimulating private consumption and
government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The first package featured slashes of personal income, business
and value-added taxes and an injection of 130 billion baht (3.5
U.S. billion dollars) into the economy.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Steady Industrial Growth in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's economic and financial hub
-- the Shanghai Municipality -- enjoyed a growth of 10.4 percent
in industrial added value last month, the Shanghai Municipal
Bureau of Statistics announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the bureau show that the financial figure
in May hit 15.1 billion yuan (1.82 billion US dollars) with the
production/sales ratio standing at a high of 97.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The stock-holding enterprises registered the highest production/
sales ratio of 100.5 percent, selling their stockpiles, while the
ratio of the state-owned sector stood at 98.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new products have made a great contribution to the
industrial growth. Mass production of Buicks has added 2.2 billion
yuan to the sales value of new products of the Shanghai Auto
Industry Group, 639 million yuan more than that in the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Total sales value of new products in Shanghai during the time
amounted to 5.365 billion yuan, surging 25.5 percent on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the bureau also indicate better economic returns
by industrial enterprises in Shanghai by showing better
performances of loss-making companies in the first four months of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls Indian Hostilities Major Setback to Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Monday termed the "Indian hostilities" over the past month
across the Line of Control (LoC) as a major setback to Pakistan's
efforts to promote Indo-Pak cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly, the foreign minister reviewed
the development of tensions on the LoC in the disputed area of
Kashmir, saying the Indian hostilities have badly damaged the
dialogue process initiated by Pakistan to reduce tensions between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, his government also initiated several other
measures, including the launching of a Lahore-New Delhi bus
service, release of civilian prisoners and fishermen, sale of
electricity and resumption of contacts in the field of sports, to
promote mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In response to India's provocation, "while stating our
determination to take appropriate action in self-defense, we have
reiterated our continuing commitment to the Lahore Declaration and
the dialogue process," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has also asked India to demonstrate restraint,
de-escalate the situation and join Pakistan in efforts to defuse
prevailing tension," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed his regret over the Indian refusal to accept
July 7 as the date for his proposed visit.
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that the Indians are dragging their feet and
using delaying tactics, the foreign minister charged.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nuclear Scientist Bombards Cox Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)-- Zhu Zuliang, president of the
Chinese Research Institute of Engineering Physics, recently wrote
an article denouncing the slanders of the Cox report on China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that from the day China owned nuclear arms, it
announced solemnly that it would not first use nuclear arms
anytime and under any condition. "China is the only country that
has made this promise worldwide."
</P>
<P>
He argued that China developed its own atom bomb and H-bomb
when the United States imposed a tough blockade and containment
policy on the country.
</P>
<P>
"China has never stolen, is not stealing and will never steal
US nuclear technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the world economy moving towards integration,
technological exchanges are enhanced between China and the rest of
the world. Against this background, China and the United States
conducted normal scholarly exchanges on arms control and some
other areas on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Some of the exchanges were proposed by the US, which admitted
having benefited from the exchanges with China. These exchanges
were aimed at the prevention of nuclear proliferation and didn't
involve sensitive military technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cox report said that the two visits to the US state
laboratory, which were normal exchanges approved by both
governments, were targeted at collecting intelligence. Zhu said
this is a slander not only on the Chinese scientists but also the
American scientists.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the so-called secrets of major data on nuclear
warheads in the types of W56, W62, W 70 and some others were
openly published in books as early as 1983. In addition, he said,
basic data on more than 100 types of nuclear warheads have also
been available in the form of tables on the Internet for several
years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the exchanges and cooperation of the Chinese
and American people and scientists conform with the basic
interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the American people will make a fair appraisal
and judgment on the matter," he said. "We urge the US government
to refrain from doing anything that hurts the feelings of the
Chinese people and harms Sino-US relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that containing China will lead to nowhere and that the
Chinese people are capable of developing their own state defense
technology and protecting national security.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Khmer Rouge Commander Gets Life Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's ex-Khmer Rouge
commander Nuon Paet was sentenced to life imprisonment Monday for
kidnapping and murdering three Western tourists five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited public trial of the ex-Khmer Rouge commander
lasted nearly 10 hours at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
It is the heaviest sentence in Cambodia which does not have the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Paet faced five charges relating to the kidnapping and the
subsequent murder of Briton Mark Slater, Frenchman Jean-Michel
Braquet and Australian David Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The three men were abducted from a train traveling to
Sihanoukville during an ambush by Khmer Rouge troops in July 1994
that also killed more than 10 Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses including two high-ranking officers of the
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), Sam Bet and Chhouk Rin, were
present at the trial.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and representatives of the three victims as well as
some diplomats and U.N. observers were present at the trial.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Paet, who was arrested last August, was the first senior
Khmer Rouge commander to stand public trial and be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Nuon Paet always protested his innocence and
argued that his former commanders Sam Bet and Chhouk Rin were
responsible for the three men's death.
</P>
<P>
He said the train ambush was directed by Chhouk Rin and the
murders were ordered by Sam Bet while the actual killing was
carried out by Veth Vorn, who has already died.
</P>
<P>
According to the final judgment of the court, the Council of
Ministers has agreed to file suits against Sam Bet and Chhouk Rin,
but the trial will be carried out later.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that those victims' families would be
given compensation ranging from 7 million riel (1,842 U.S.
dollars) to 50 million riel (13,158 dollars).
</P>
<P>
When asked about his reaction to the judgment, Nuon Paet said,
"It is not fair and just."

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Luo Gan
said today that China is pleased to see Myanmar's membership of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Luo made the remark in talks with Khin Nyunt, the first
secretary of Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council, who
arrived on a five day official visit to China earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"China appreciates Myanmar's independent foreign policy of
peace, and holds that Myanmar, as a sovereign state, has the right
to choose the social system and development path of its own suited
to its national conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that Myanmar will enjoy political stability,
economic growth and the improvement of people's standard of living,
" Luo said.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt reiterated that the Myanmese government observes the
"one China" policy, and it also recognizes that Taiwan is an
inseparable part of Chinese territory, stressing that Myanmar will
not develop any forms of official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Luo expressed his appreciation for those remarks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese state councillor said that China highly values Sino-
Myanmese friendship, and is fully prepared to further exchanges
and mutually beneficial cooperation based on the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence with Myanmar, so as to bring about a long
term, good neighborly and cooperative relations of mutual trust. (

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Improve Ties with UAE: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Monday that Iran is ready to improve its ties
with all the countries, particularly those in the Arab and Islamic
world, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks after his UAE counterpart Rashid
Abdullah al-Nuaimi claimed recently that the recent rapprochement
between Iran and Saudi Arabia is taking place at Abu Dhabi's
expense.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said in an interview with the Qatari TV channel
al-Jazira on Saturday criticized Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states for improving relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Kharrazi said
that "we are prepared to expand our relations with all the
Arab and Islamic states, and the UAE is no exception."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that Iran, as a neighboring country
of the Persian Gulf littoral states, "is seriously determined to
establish contacts with all these countries and steps have been
taken to this end and a positive climate has been created so far."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that this policy will continue and more
confidence will be built between Iran and the Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
For years Iran and the UAE have been entangled in a dispute
over the sovereignty over islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb
and the Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands in 1971 after the British
forces withdrew from the region. However, both Tehran and Abu
Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the three islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has proposed to clear the "misunderstanding" between the
two countries through bilateral talks, but the UAE has threatened
to resort to international arbitrary to settle its dispute with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the Gulf States, including Saudi
Arabia, have repeatedly announced their support for the UAE over
the islands on the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait.

<HEADLINE> Marine Turtles Protected in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A marine turtle rearing center
has been set up in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to protect
these endangered species, an environmental official said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center is located on Qarnain Island, a natural nesting
habitat for green and hawksbill turtles, said Dr. Saif Al Ghais,
secretary general of the UAE's Environment Research and Wildlife
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the project is to carry out research on
the turtles and to make suggestions for conserving and eventually
releasing them in order to ensure sustainable development of these
species in the Gulf waters, Dr. Al Ghais said.
</P>
<P>
He added that protecting endangered green and hawksbill turtles
is part of the UAE's concerns to safeguard and develop environment
and wildlife for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Over 48 turtle nests have been located on the shores of Qarnain
Island last May.
</P>
<P>
The project involves collecting a certain percentage of the
hatching turtles. The young turtles will be reared in special
fibre-glass tanks, and great care will be taken with them till
their release after being tagged.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims at creating better environmental
awareness among the public, Dr. Al Ghais said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Held Fairly: Election Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's general election has
been carried out fairly and justly, Chairman of the General
Election Committee (PPI) Jacob Tobing said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The PPI has been monitoring all polling stations in Indonesia,
especially in its eastern part. So far, (the election) has been
running well, without any major problem," Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were some technical problems, but they were
easily handled by local election committees.
</P>
<P>
Voting in the country's first multi-party general election
ended peacefully at 14:00 local time (0700 GMT) with a massive
voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Jakarta Metropolitan Police Maj. Gen. Noegroho
Djajoesman said the city and its vicinity, despite a small
incident in Tangerang, were generally peaceful and well under
control during the polls.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the situation was all right. The burning of a
polling station in Tangerang is considered a crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the police chief, the incident in Tangerang
originated from a misunderstanding between voters and polling
station officials regarding the polling mechanism, resulting in
the burning of polling station number 9 in Kemuning village by 200
angry non-registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful situation in Jakarta was reflected in the city's
deserted streets during the polling period, he said, adding that
almost all trade centers were virtually closed to give people the
opportunity to cast their ballots near their residences.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita Monday said a successful election will
settle half of the country's political problems as it is vital for
forming a new government supported by the people and domestic and
foreign entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
"I see the election process today has run well and there was no
intimidation. Its result will show the people's will," he said.

Minister Abeloulage Ndombasi and Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo

</P>
<P>
The summit was expected to discuss the allied forces' position
after Rwanda declared a unilateral cease-fire on the conflict in

Analysts here believed that the meeting of the allies was aimed

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last month signed a

Zimbabwe, together with Angola, Chad and Namibia, deployed
troops to the former Zaire when the rebels backed by Uganda and

<HEADLINE> UN Role in Solving Kosovo Issue Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A ranking lawmaker of Russia's lower
house of parliament said Monday that the UN Security Council
should play the key role in settling the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma's International
Affairs Committee, said a future resolution of the UN Security
Council "should contain clear-cut and unequivocal wording that a
security mission in Yugoslavia should have precise political and
military guidance from the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He accused NATO generals of abusing the "vague wording of the
Bonn understandings" to force Belgrade into "full capitulation,"
the Itar-Tass quoted Lukin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Yugoslav and NATO military representatives broke
down early Monday in Kumanovo, Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who arrived
in Bonn earlier Monday to attend the so-called G-8 foreign
ministers' meeting on Kosovo, also stressed the role of the UN
Security Council in resolving the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"NATO tried to embed in the document a whole string of
political issues of principle. Only the UN Security Council has
the prerogative to decide these issues," Tass quoted him as saying
in Bonn. "This concerns the very format of international forces in
Kosovo and the use of force as such."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the leftist opposition in the State
Duma on Monday demanded the dismissal of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
the country's Balkan envoy.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who was instrumental in hammering out a peace
deal with representatives of the UN and the European Union, and in
subsequently convincing Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to
accept the deal, was accused of selling out the interests of
Yugoslavia and those of Russia, a charge he repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
"From a special destroyer he has become a special traitor,"
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said in reference to
Chernomyrdin's mediating efforts.
</P>
<P>
"He is bringing to life the position of his masters, not his
people," Interfax quoted Zyuganov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Chernomyrdin's efforts, Russia has become an
accomplice to the tragedy in Yugoslavia," he said.

MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
engaging local government officials in conducting peace talks with
some of the rebel groups.

<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Monday that these local

He added that regionalization of the peace talks is not likely
to put a heavy load on local officials whom President Joseph

"They have not complained," he said. "We will still have to

<HEADLINE> IOC: No Plans to Split Staging of Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Xinhua) -- There will be no more split
staging of the Olympic Games between tow cities, according to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bach, IOC executive board member, said the committee was
not in favor of holding the summer Olympic Games in two different
locales, but would not restrict the number of cities bidding to
host the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a wrong attitude to limit the number of cities
making bids to host the Olympic Games," Bach said after a ceremony
staged by the Olympic Council of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He also said the IOC was likely to subsidize the host country
with about one billion U.S.dollars to help put on the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the bidding countries are big or small does not matter
at all...as we will assist the organizers financially," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur, at least eight
other cities have expressed interest in hosting the 2008 Olympic
Games, Bach said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will select the host city in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the host job would be rotated among continents or
geographic regions, Bach said only that the idea was under
discussion.

ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Monday that there
has been no incident of violation of its airspace by India since
it shot down two Indian Mig fighters on May 27.
</P>
<P>
"We have been continuously cautioning India that any violation
of our airspace will be dealt with accordingly," Brig. Rashid
Qureshi, director general of the Inter Services Public Relations
(ISPR), said here at press briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a few rockets and bombs dropped by Indian
aircraft close to the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir fell inside
Pakistani territory. "It is also a violation and we take it as
such," Qureshi said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted India's claims of killing 220 Pakistani soldiers in
the recent clash as "absolutely false and highly exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said there have been casualties on the Pakistani side
due to Indian artillery fire and it was no surprise.

<P>
He said four Pakistani soldiers were killed and five others
wounded during the past 24 hours in the Kargil area along the LoC.

On the other hand, Qureshi said, Indian press reports put the
casualties on the Indian side at more than 200.

BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government plans to
liberalize satellite services after the monopoly by a local

<P>
However, liberalization of satellite services would take at
least six months after the Shinawatra monopoly ends.

<P>
The committee would discuss the possibility of ending the
payment of state revenue by Shinawatra Satellite and instructing
the firm to reduce its service charges to clients.
</P>
<P>
It would also submit soon a recommendation to Transport and
Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban, the TNA said.

<HEADLINE> French Warplanes Join NATO Campaign in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- About 20 French warplanes joined on
Sunday the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, said the French
military authorities on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The general staff of the French armed forces said that six
Mirage 2000C's carried out covering missions in the Yugoslav skies
for NATO bombers, while four other Mirage jet fighters made
reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
Some other French warplanes did combat search and rescue
operations to secure possible allied pilots ejected into hostile
zone.
</P>
<P>
France has appealed to NATO and Yugoslavia to quickly reach an
agreement on the implementation of the G-8 peace plan.
</P>
<P>
"We should arrive at a solution. We should overcome the last
minute obstacles," said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine in
reference to the failure of the first round of talks between NATO
and Yugoslav military officers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first reinforcement of French troops for the Balkans will
sail off from the military port of Toulon on Thursday, said the
general staff on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unspecified number of French troops will arrive in Greece
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
France will send a total reinforcement of 2,500 soldiers, 1,500
military vehicles by road and sea to the Kumanovo region in
Macedonia on the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
France will also send about 15 Leclerc tanks, two cannon
batteries and other equipment to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
All these are in preparation for the participation by French
troops in the 50,000-strong future Kosovo international peace
keeping force (KFOR), to which France will contribute 6,000 men.

<HEADLINE> Israel's 15th Knesset Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The 15th Israeli Knesset
(parliament) officially started its tenure here on Monday after
the 120 deputies elected to the Knesset took their oaths of
office .
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman officially declared the opening
of the new Knesset at 4:00 PM local time (1400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Weizman urged all Knesset members to resolve
their conflicts for the future of the country and to move the
Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
As the oldest member in Knesset, One Israel deputy and former
prime minister Shimon Peres was designated interim Knesset Speaker
until a regular speaker was elected.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister and Likud deputy Benjamin Netanyahu,
who earlier announced his intention to resign from the Knesset,
was also sworn in.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people, including top brass of the military
services, celebrities and foreign envoys based in Israel, were
invited to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The direct Knesset election on May 17 has brought more
political parties into the Knesset. The 120 seats have been
divided among 15 parties in the current Knesset, as compared to 11
in the last one.
</P>
<P>
Among the major parties, Labor-led One Israel got 26 seats
while the Likud occupied 19, Shas 17, Meretz 10 and the Center
Party six. With a total of 10 seats, the Israeli Arab parties have
gained more strength in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
One of the tough issues awaiting the new Knesset is whether it
will succeed in amending the current Basic Law so that it may
become the country's first constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-orthodox parties has been strongly opposed to any
changes to the current basic law, citing that some revisions
proposed by other parties will impair their interests.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, the dispute over whether to cancel the
law of direct election for prime minister will resume in the
parliament. And another decision has to be made whether to
increase the minimum seat number requirement for a party to enter
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is to everyone's concern how the new Knesset will
help move the stalled Middle East peace process forward.

BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes bombed targets in
Yugoslavia on Monday as the military bloc's air campaign against

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Step up Crackdown on Pornography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Strict new regulations aimed at
cracking down on pornography and illegal publications have been
issued by south China's Guangdong Province to encourage local
citizens to play a part in ending the evil trade.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Press and Publication Bureau, the Provincial
Finance Department, and the Provincial Public Security Department
joined together to draw up the new rules.
</P>
<P>
As an inducement to help the police break the production and
transportation networks of such illegal activities the public will
be rewarded with ten percent of the money raised from the auction
of confiscated goods and fines imposed on publishers.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, China's economic powerhouse, has been very firm in
cracking down on illegal publications. In 1996 the municipal
government initiated a system which allowed the public to inform
about such illegal ventures and offers a huge 300,000 yuan reward
(36,000 U.S. dollars) for information leading to the closure of
just one production line of pirate CDs.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 16 million yuan (1.9 million U.S. dollars)
has been paid out to members of the public supplying such
information.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiakun, who is in charge of the anti-pornography drive in
Guangdong, said the help of citizens in helping solve such crimes
will be of great help to the government.

fear of being attacked but were pacified by the boys that they
were not rioting or attacking anybody but known robbers in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Different groups of the boys carried dangerous weapons like
machetes, butchers' knives, and broken bottles etc, said the

Efforts to get the reaction of the police proved futile, it

<HEADLINE> Romanians Have Confidence in State-Run Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Romanians keep their confidence
in the state banks, in spite of the hardships some of them have
been lately going through because of the big amount of
unprofitable credits they granted, according to a local daily on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As high as 74.6 percent of Romanians trust the state banks when
having to chose between them and the private (12 percent) and
foreign banks (13.4 percent), the newspaper Adevarul quoted a
recent opinion poll by the National Institute of Opinion Polls and
Marketing.
</P>
<P>
Adevarul explained that this lack of confidence in the private
banks is caused by their abandoning of depositors once they are in
difficulty and by the lack of support from the state in such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll lists the Romanian Commercial Bank as the most-
trusted bank in Romania, followed by the National Bank (central
bank), the Savings Bank and the Romanian Bank for Development.

HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Monday that the official foreign currency assets
of Hong Kong amounted to 88.9 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 0.67 percent lower than that at the end of April,
which were 89.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to an HKMA spokesperson, the 0.6 billion-U.S. dollar
drop in settled foreign currency assets during the month reflects
"primarily the valuation effect of foreign currency investments
held by the Exchange Fund."
</P>
<P>
Including unsettled forward contracts, the foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong at the end of May 1999 stood at 88.9 billion U.
S. dollars.

In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is now
the world's fifth largest holder of foreign currency reserves
after Japan, China's mainland, Taiwan and Germany.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>

The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- India mounted an offensive to drive out gurrillas from the

pilot training, as part of that carrier's nearly 200 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the prime minister, I'm asking you to deposit the
illegal arms and ammunition to avoid further action," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned the "terrorists" in the region, which witnessed
12,000 people killed after the country's independence in 1971,
that stern action would be taken against those who fail to respond
to the call.
</P>
<P>
But "no action will be taken if you surrender arms, rather, you
will be rehabilitated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the combing operation following fierce
attacks from opposition parties and concern of the country's
donors over the deterioration of law and order in the country,
particularly in the southwestern region, where bomb explosions
early this year in two separate places killed several political
leaders and activists and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern region has reportedly become a haven for the
outlawed extremists, with fierce rivalry resulting in many deaths
and rising crimes. Many people there have deserted their ancestral
homes in search of security, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Dainik Dinkal, a Bengali-language newspaper, alleged that
the ruling Awami League was joining hands with the "terrorists" to
win the next general election scheduled for the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Industries and Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed told the
parliament on Monday that he regretted the paper's comment.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Youths Seize Part of Nigerian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Armed youths Sunday occupied some
major streets in Warri, Nigeria's oil city in the south, and set
several buildings ablaze, the Punch newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose ethnic origin could not be ascertained, also
compelled passers-by to show loyalty to them, said the major
Nigerian daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death toll in last Friday's inter-ethnic
violence between armed Itsekiri and Urhobo youths has hit 34, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
Olu of Warri Ogiame Atuwatse II, a traditional monarch of the
region had appealed to Itsekiris, one of the three major ethnic
groups in the Niger river delta, to exercise restraint in an
statement titled "Violence is not our way of life".
</P>
<P>
He urged that the new civilian government at federal and state
levels should be given a chance to look into the problem against
criticisms of lack of strong action from the government.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of ethnic conflict was ignited when militant
Ijaw youths two week ago touched the entire Itsekiri dominant
village of Aruton, killing about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris are apparently in fighting back lately on Ijaws
and some Urhobo communities suspected to have sheltered Ijaw
refugees, leading to death of more people.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Six Executed in China's Biggest Smuggling Case (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Six people who were involved in a
notorious case of smuggling cars, petroleum, steel, and other
items to China through the city of Zhanjiang in south China's
Guangdong Province were executed today, according to Liu Jiachen,
vice-president of the country's Supreme People's Court (SPC).
</P>
<P>
They were Cao Xiukang, the former head of Zhanjiang Customs,
Zhu Xiangcheng, the former director of the investigation
department at Zhanjiang Customs, three people from Hong Kong, and
another person from elsewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
Cao was found to have taken 2.4 million yuan worth of bribes
from smugglers, while Zhu was found to have taken 2.8 million yuan
worth of bribes and another 3.4 million yuan worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
According to the SPC, 25 other people involved in the case,
including five high-ranking officials, were given stiff sentences,
and their appeals were turned down by the Higher People's Court of
Guangdong Province today.
</P>
<P>
The former Party chief of Zhanjiang, Chen Tongqing, the former
vice-mayor, Yang Quqing, the former head of Maoming Customs in
Guangdong, Yang Hong, the former chief of Zhanjiang Public
Security Bureau's Frontier Defense Sub-Bureau, Deng Ye, and the
sub-bureau's former political commissar, Chen En, were all given
death sentences with a two-year reprieve.
</P>
<P>
The SPC vice-president said that the five were exempted from
execution for the "good attitude in admitting crimes and voluntary
handover of illegal money".

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Recover Letters from Fraudsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- About three million fraudulent
letters by advance fee fraudsters were at the weekend retrieved
from a hide-out during a police raid, The Guardian newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that three customs and excise personnel, six
drivers of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the
Nigeria Postal Services were caught red-handed.
</P>
<P>
With this, the paper quoted a source as saying that the police
had smashed a network of fraudsters comprising employees of
Customs and Excise, the airports authority and the postal
services.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, members of the syndicate are believed
to be behind the stream of fraudulent mails which leave the west
African country through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport
in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The letters were marked by franking machines to avoid use of
postage stamps and were already set to be loaded aboard foreign
airlines when men of the international mail anti-theft squad
swooped on their depot following a tip-off.
</P>
<P>
The arrested personnel are said to be working for several
groups of fraudsters who write letters to foreigners suggesting
deals worth millions of U.S. dollars about supply of crude oil or
the transfer of stolen government money.
</P>
<P>
The officials who were taken into custody have made useful
statements which led to the apprehension of those behind the deal,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Postal Services has recently been plagued by
frequent use of the franking machine by unauthorized persons,
especially fraudsters, so the authorities have to set up the
international mail anti-theft squad with members drawn from the
police, the State Security Services, the Nigeria Airways, the
airports authority and the postal services.

BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi is scheduled to arrive in Beirut on June 17 to hold
bilateral talks and discuss regional developments with Lebanese
officials, Lebanese Foreign Ministry sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi will be the first Iranian high-ranking official to
visit Lebanon since Lebanese President Emile Lahoud took the helm
last November.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kharrazi is expected to meet with Lahoud and
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also cover the lastest developments in the
Middle East peace process, especially the aftermath of the
election of Labor leader Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister in
the May 17 general election.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised that he would withdraw Israeli troops from
south Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas that are spearheaded
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Curb Jewish Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak Monday promised to halt Jewish settlement activities in the
West Bank in his first public reassurance to the Palestinians
since Israel's general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a government headed by me will continue the
settlement drive on hills around Nablus," Barak told Israel
Radio, referring to the Palestinian city in northern West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Winning a landslide in the May 17 elections on a platform to
move forward the stalled peace process, Barak said he would
review the settlement policy adopted by outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
During his three years in office, Netanyahu encouraged
settlement expansion in the West Bank in defiance of Palestinian
objection and worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The activity stepped up in the last few months since Netanyahu
appeared likely to lose in the elections. Settlers grabbed
several hilltops in the West Bank and began construction of
Jewish buildings in Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Further outraging the Palestinians, the outgoing government
approved a plan soon after the voting to extend the borders of
the biggest West Bank settlement Maale Adumin to East Jerusalem,
effectively cutting the West Bank in half.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have repeatedly urged Barak, who has remained
silence since the elections on the issue, to take immediate steps
to halt the intensified settlement activity which they said would
kill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, the Palestinians welcomed Barak's
statement on the settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adviser to Palestinian National Authority
leader Yasser Arafat, said Barak's statement is a move "in the
right direction."
</P>
<P>
Barak's position will help regain the mutual trust between
Israel and the Palestinians which was destroyed by the Netanyahu
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said the top priority of his government will be to
revive the peace process. He has until early next month to put
together a governing coalition.

<HEADLINE> Former Singapore MP Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Singapore Parliamentarian
Choo Wee Khiang was sentenced Monday to two weeks in jail and
fined 10,000 Singapore dollars on a cheating charge.
</P>
<P>
The sentence came five days after Choo resigned his seat in
Parliament and quit the People's Action Party before his
conviction in court of cheating.
</P>
<P>
Choo has pleaded guilty to issuing a false invoice in November
1990 to help his brother-in-law get 830,000 Singapore dollars
(488,235 U.S. dollars) from the UMBC Finance company.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that another charge involving one million
Singapore dollars was taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Choo's lawyer had asked the court to impose a fine rather than
a jail sentence on him but the judge Friday handed down a sentence
of combining jail and fine instead of just a fine.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted District Judge Jasvender Kaur as saying that
Choo has signed the fictitious documents with his eyes opened.
</P>
<P>
The media also noted that the judge gave substantial weight to
Choo's 15 year's contribution to society and gave him the least
possible jail term.
</P>
<P>
Choo, a director of Mei Marketing, was first elected as an MP
in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Pak Opposes U.S. Restriction on Yarn Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will take up the issue
of quota restriction on combed yarn to the Ministerial Conference
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) if the United States refuses
to lift restriction on import of such yarn from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Textile Monitoring Board (TMB) asked the United States in
May to lift its restriction on the quota of combed yarn import
from Pakistan, but the United States has sent back this case to
the TMB for further review, official sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that if the United States again refuses to
abide by the TMB recommendation, the combed yarn matter will be
taken to the WTO Ministerial Conference for a neutral decision.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan earns 15 million U.S. dollars a year by exporting
combed yarn to the United States, which slapped quota restriction
on the import of Pakistani combed yarn a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Unites States intends to promote its trade
of yarn with other countries and is in a bid to develop a textile
block to maneuver markets and exploit Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Export of Pakistani yarn has fallen by 13 percent in the first
10 months in 1998-99. Yarn manufacturers and exporters fear that
the Unites States will attempt to slap restrictions on other
categories of yarn if it succeeds in enforcing quota on combed
yarn, hence damaging overall textile exports in the future.

<HEADLINE> All Serial Killing Bodies Found in Australia: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian police said Monday that
they believed they had found the bodies of all 11 victims in
Australia's worst serial killing.
</P>
<P>
Detective Superintendent Paul Schramm said that skeletal
remains found at Lower Light, north of the south Australian port
city of Adelaide, in 1994 had been linked to the investigation
into the bodies-in-barrels murder case, involving 11 victims.
</P>
<P>
The bodies-in-barrels murder case first emerged on May 20 when
eight bodies were found in barrels in a disused bank vault at
Snowtown, in mid-south of the state of South Australia.
</P>
<P>
Two more bodies were dug up in the following week from a
backyard in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, about 1,400 km from
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"The body at Lower Light is what I think has been speculated
as the 11th body so that now means that of the 11 people who we
had on our list, we now think that we can account for all of those
people," Schramm told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Schramm said the condition of the remains and a lack of
clothing or other markings had made the identification extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
But as a result of renewed inquiries, investigators had found
an old set of X-rays which provided the key to the identification.
</P>
<P>
Four men have been charged in relation to the case. Robert Joe
Wagner, 27, of Elizabeth Grove, John Justin Bunting, 32, of
Craigmore and Mark Ray Haydon, 40, from Smithfield Plains,
appeared in court charged with the murder of a person unknown
following the discovery of the bodies at Snowtown, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Schramm said police did not rule out the possibility of further
arrests although that was becoming less likely as the
investigation progressed.

<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The demand for bitumen in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) is likely to grow steadily as more and more rural
areas in the hinterland are being connected by modern highways and
old dirt tracks are converted into paved roads.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Emirates Industrial Bank, as a
result of the sustained infrastructure works, the current demand
growth of bitumen at around 10 percent a year is likely to persist.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the UAE imported 165,000 tons of bitumen valued
at 11.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total demand in the country, including both raw and processed
bitumen, is around 181,000 tons worth around 16.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study said bitumen is imported in bulk from Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia. The UAE has currently no facilities for the
manufacture of base bitumen.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and South Korea reached an agreement on setting
up a joint committee to examine the Technology Valley project in
Ismailia, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech zone will cover an approximate area of 7,200
hecters at a cost of 22 billion U.S. dollars, the Arabic daily
Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Egypt will undertake the infrastructure works
of the project, while South Korea will undertake to finance the
program and to develop the area.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The volume of stocks issued through augmentation
of company capital and loans amounted to about 2.5 billion
Tunisian dinars (2.27 billion U.S.dollars) from 1990 to 1998, said
Mahir Al Rawawi, a Tunisian government representative at the
Tunisian Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar organized by the Tunisian Embassy to the
United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi Sunday, Rawawi said that
foreign investments in Tunisia constitute 18 percent of the total
investments, the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investments in Tunisia increased from 307
million dinars (279 million dollars) in 1996 to 900 million dinars
(818 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli trade deficit dropped by 2.3 percent to
1.34 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter compared with the
last quarter of 1998, according to figures released by the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The CBS attributed the shrinkage to a 2.8 percent tumble in
import prices, excluding diamonds and fuel, as commodity prices
fell globally following the financial crisis that swept emerging
markets last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports excluding diamonds and fuel dropped by 0.9 percent in
the first three months, following stability in the last quarter of
1998 and a 1.5 percent rise in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials imports, which account for some 60 percent of
total imports, fell by 2.4 percent and imported consumer products
rose by 2.9 percent and investment goods by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports decreased by a slight 0.5 percent in
general. Industrial exports excluding diamonds fell by 2.9 percent
after a 1.5 percent rise in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The prices of industrial exports fell by 1.1 percent in the
first quarter of this year after gaining 0.3 percent in the final
quarter of 1998. The sharpest decline was recorded in the fields
of wood and paper, which fell by 6.4 percent, while textile and
clothing decreased by 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Frozen Food Exporters Demand Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Frozen Food Exporters
Association (BFFEA) Monday demanded that the government give a
15-percent cash subsidy on export earnings to cope with the price
fall in the international market, the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The price fall in the international market has already forced
the BFFEA to have a stockpile of shrimps worth 4 billion taka
(about 82.5 million U.S. dollars), the agency quoted BFFEA
President Kazi Shahnewaz as saying.
</P>
<P>
A price fall of around 35 percent in the international market
hit Bangladesh's frozen food sector for the second time last May
after a 40-percent drop last September, he said. He added that the
currency devaluation in other competitive exporting countries also
caused huge losses to the sector.
</P>
<P>
The frozen food export sector had incurred huge losses due to
declining prices, last year's flood and the European Union's
restrictions on export, he stated.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take steps so that the sector could
compete in the international market and he also called for the
implementation of a report of the Commerce Ministry's task force
to waive penal interest of 3 billion taka (about 61.9 million
dollars) on loans borrowed by producers and exporters of this
sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had exported 22,000 tons of shrimps worth 10.4
billion taka (about 214.4 million dollars) by April this year
against the target of 15 billion taka (about 309.3 million
dollars) during the July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: Chinese Need to Unite as One for Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, People's
Daily, is asking the Chinese people to be patriotic and unite as
one in the nationwide efforts to invigorate the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade last month was a serious infringement on Chinese
sovereignty and damaged the dignity of the Chinese, it says in an
editorial to be released tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have always showed their patriotic tradition and
united together when faced by an invasion or catastrophic
disasters, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony for embassy staff members returning from Belgrade,
President Jiang Zemin asked the nation to build a more democratic
and prosperous socialist country under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
This represents the strong will of the Chinese people of all
ethnic groups at this pivotal point in time and is a powerful
response to the hegemonism and power politics that still exist in
the world, it says.
</P>
<P>
The unity of the people and the Party is very important for
invigorating the nation and building a more prosperous state.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese in the past suffered during periods of disunity and
got strong when they were unified. Hostile Western forces are
afraid of that unity, strength and development, and have tried in
every possible way to undermine it and disrupt the situation, it
says, and urges people to keep a sober mind.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a big country with 56 ethnic groups, China faces many new
problems and difficulties, especially during a period of turning
from a planned economy to a market economy, the editorial says.
Properly dealing with contradictions among the people to unify the
nation is important.
</P>
<P>
China has had some outstanding success in promoting its
socialist modernization and building up its comprehensive national
strength. But, the scientific advancements in the world and global
economic integration are putting pressure on China, which is
encountering fiercer competition.
</P>
<P>
China is still a developing country, with tens of millions of
poor people who are trying to just make a living, it says, urging
Party members and leading cadres to strictly discipline themselves
and speed up work to put China on a global level.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people must build a more prosperous state under the
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, it says.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee led the nation in its brave fight
against last summer's disastrous floods, showing the indomitable
spirit of the Chinese and their determination to surmount all
difficulties, it says.
</P>
<P>
After the NATO bombing of the embassy the people protested the
barbarous attack and exhibited their unity to the whole world, the
editorial says, asking the people to channel their patriotism that
was aroused in the protest into action to make the country strong.
</P>
<P>
China persists in supporting justice and defying brute force,
the paper says, concluding that the unity of the people and their
hard work will push the reforms and opening-up forward and
maintain social stability.

<HEADLINE> Meretz Still Opposes Shas to Join Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- One Israel's sister party Meretz
said here Monday that it will oppose the entry of Ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party into the next coalition with or without Aryeh Deri as
its leader.
</P>
<P>
Dovish Meretz said a recent survey in Meretz showed that 80
percent of its members rejected Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's
possible move to sign up Shas.
</P>
<P>
Meretz said its leader Yossi Sarid will take the message to
Barak, who is also One Israel leader, when they meet Monday
evening to discuss the coalition issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak intends to include Shas, which holds moderate stand on
the Middle East peace process, into his government in order to
form a broad-based coalition. The intention has gained majority
support from One Israel's lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which represents Israelis with roots in the Middle East
and North Africa, won 17 seats in the May 17 elections, becoming
the third largest party in the Knesset (parliament). But its
leader Deri was sentenced to a four-year prison term for fraud
and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Barak has since Saturday intensified his coalition talks with
political parties. One Israel's sources said that Barak prefers
Shas to outgoing ruling party Likud as a coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, outgoing Finance Minister Meir
Sheetrit affirmed Monday that chances of Likud's joining force
with Barak are remote. He told Israel Radio that Barak's policy
guidelines do not conform with Likud's policies, so it is
impossible for Likud to Join Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
The 11-page policy guidelines released by One Israel earlier
include paragraphs dedicated to a number of issues such as the
peace process, state and religion, the economy and changing the
national order of priorities. The document is in general without
detailling any specific goals.
</P>
<P>
Within Likud, only outgoing Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Moshe Arens have said that it is better for
Likud to join Barak's coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest
insurance groups, AXA, today formally launched a joint venture
with the China Minmetals Group.
</P>
<P>
The AXA-Minmetals Assurance Company is among the first batch of
foreign-funded insurance joint ventures in China and preparations
have taken ten years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989 the Group has been systematically setting up
representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan,
Chengdu and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Sin, the general manager of AXA-Minmetals, said
preparations by AXA have included sponsoring market research in
1996, 1997 and 1998, and donating 10 million Hong Kong dollars in
1995 for the establishment of the China Financial Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to Sin, the joint venture will make use of advanced
management technologies and other international standards and
combine them with realities of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The AXA group was ranked 16th in Fortune magazine's world top
500 firms in 1998, while China Minmetals is the one of the five
largest import and export companies in China.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years ten overseas insurance companies,
including AXA, have started business operations in Shanghai, a
recognized bridgehead chosen by foreign insurers to enter the
largest potential insurance market in the world.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control on Cotton Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China is tightening control over
funds for cotton purchases in order to reduce surging losses for
cotton distribution enterprises and further streamline the
country's cotton distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national work meeting on cotton, Xie Xuren,
president of the China Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), said
that the volume of loans the bank will offer to cotton
distribution enterprises will only depend on the actual amount of
cotton purchased from growers.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the new measure is to secure the supply of funds
for this year's cotton purchases and prevent distribution
enterprises from incurring new losses.
</P>
<P>
As China began to abandon the 45-year-old government practice
of setting cotton prices this year, cotton prices will be
determined by supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
In granting loans under the new situation, the ADB will shift
its focus to enterprises which purchase cotton directly from
growers and undertake primary processing for storage.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the bank will restrict the scope of cotton loan
recipients to supply and marketing cooperatives which provincial
or higher levels of governments have approved to purchase, process,
store, distribute, export and import cotton, as well as factories
engaged in the processing of improved varieties of cotton and with
the ability to repay loans.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the bank will strictly control the volume of
cotton loans granted to distribution enterprises. The program is
expected to enable related ventures to reduce purchase costs and
help prevent them from diverting the funds for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Xie said distribution enterprises must repay capital and
interest immediately after selling cotton.
</P>
<P>
The bank will supervise the cotton stockpiles of distribution
enterprises in order to prevent related ventures from selling
cotton at levels below purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank will establish separate accounts and
supervise the use of loans more effectively in order to ensure
distributors will not incur new losses.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the bank will impose fines on distributors
violating rules and regulations governing the use of loans.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is working closely with various government departments
to solve problems related to cotton stockpiles and reduce unpaid
credits burdening distribution enterprises. The bank has called on
relevant government departments to promulgate policies for
handling the debts of distribution enterprises and is urging
textile companies to settle accounts with cotton distribution
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Gonzales Stops Stewart in Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Luis Gonzalez downed Alex
Stewart twice to score a third-round technical knockout in a
heavyweight bout at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who weighed 108 kilograms, knocked Stewart down with
an uppercut in the second round and did the same in the third
before referee Joe Cortez stopped the Sunday night bout because
Stewart was absorbing too much punishment.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, originally from Cuba, raised his record to 28-5.
Stewart, an American who weighed 107 kilograms, fell to 43-10.
</P>
<P>
In another 10-rounder, Canada's Syd Vanderpool (25-1) scored a
seventh-round technical knockout over American Mario Iribarren.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Set to Attend Fortune Global Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 350 multinational
corporations have announced plans to attend the '99 Fortune Global
Forum in Shanghai, China's leading industrial and commercial city,
between September 27-29.
</P>
<P>
John Needham, president of the Conference Division of Fortune,
a subsidiary of U.S.-based Time Warner Inc., told Xinhua today
that the number of multinationals registering to attend forum is
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Needham, currently in Shanghai preparing for the forum, said
that representatives of over 30 multinationals confirmed their
plans to attend during the last week of May, including seven
companies from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fortune normally convenes its global forum -- "The Olympics of
the International Economic Arena", in economically vigorous areas.
Previous forums were held in Singapore, Barcelona, Bangkok, and
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
Needham said representatives from Top 500 leaders -- General
Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co. from the United States and Japanese-
based Mitsui and Co. Ltd.-- will present speeches at the '99
Fortune Global Forum. Other companies set to attend include
General Electric Co., Sony, Kodak, and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his office in the Shanghai's Portman Ritz-Carlton,
Needham expressed satisfaction with the number of confirmations
received some 100 days before the forum, and noted that the number
is expected to increase even further.
</P>
<P>
Economic construction remains China's principal task and the
heads of multinational corporations regard that as very important
and consider it the most important foundation for their
cooperation with the country, said Needham.
</P>
<P>
Needham said he expects the Shanghai forum to be one of the
most successful in history. He noted that this year's event will
attract the largest number of participants since the forum was
initiated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Needham based his prediction on China's upward economic growth
momentum, as well as Shanghai's various advantages. Shanghai and
China as a whole remain highly attractive, according to Needham.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Fortune Global Forum, based on the theme "China: The
Next 50 Years," will focus on business opportunities and
challenges, economic issues, and practical realities related to
conducting business in China both today and in the next century,
said Needham.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Survey Predicts Gloomy Farming Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Farm product prices during the
next 18 months will continue to cause dairy, meat and wool farmers
to worry, with only kiwifruit and apple growers having much to
smile about, the National Bank of New Zealand said in a forecast
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kiwifruit and pipfruit look likely to return to similar prices
of last season, but the forecast for dairying is "gloomy," and
beef, lamb, wool, and venison returns do not look promising, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said international prices for the biggest-earning
rural industry and dairying are low and likely to stay weak. It
forecast a base milk price for the next season of 3.35 New Zealand
dollars (1.84 U.S. dollars) a kilogram of milk solids.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecast a budget price (after levies) of 2.20 NZ
dollars (1.2 U.S. dollars) per kilogram for 270-295 kilogram
bulls, down 16 cents per kilogram from the season's price to date.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted little change in weak wool prices.
</P>
<P>
It is more upbeat about the kiwifruit industry. Returns from
last year's harvest are much better than expected and the outlook
is positive with a smaller crop forecast from this year's harvest
possibly giving prices a boost.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecast the prices of New Zealand-produced apple Enza
would hold during the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, the consensus view is that "commodity
prices have bottomed and will slowly improve ... but the
improvement in prices will be a gradual process."

<HEADLINE> BIS President Stresses International Efforts for Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, SWITZERLAND, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to promote
financial stability must become increasingly international for
coinciding with the increasingly global market, President of the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Urban Backstrom said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"One underlying theme of the many meetings held last year at
the BIS and elsewhere is the need to involve directly the emerging
market countries likely to be affected by the decisions to promote
monetary and financial stability," Backstrom said at the bank's
69th annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects a very practical consideration," he said, "
implementation will be an even bigger challenge than setting
international standards in the first place, and a sense of shared
ownership will materially improve the chances of such
implementation."
</P>
<P>
Backstrom said he was satisfied that the BIS and other groups
had made substantive contributions to the pursuit of both monetary
and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts will be taken further, with the assistance of
additional input from the newly established Financial Stability
Institute and the even newer Financial Stability Forum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president meanwhile warned of the danger of potential
financial turmoil although favorable developments had took place
during the last few months.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the principle risk at this point is that the sense of
urgency in the need both to manage current problems and to present
the emergence of new ones will be lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the Mexican crisis in 1994 was foreseen by very
few, Backstrom recalled. In South-East Asia, the onset, duration
and scope of the economic recession were also missed by the
forecasting community. Even at the BIS meeting last year, he
stressed, no one anticipated the extent of the turmoil in
financial markets that would be generated by the Russian
devaluation and moratorium.

MACAO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Judicial officials from Macao and
China's mainland have agreed to strengthen information exchange in
cracking down on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides reached consensus during a visit by a
Macao judicial delegation to Beijing from May 30 to June 4,
according to a press release issued Monday by the Judicial Police
Department of the Macao government.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The officials from both sides had detailed discussions about

</P>
<P>
It also noted that cooperation between the two sides has
resulted in marked achievements.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ANC Wins 66.4 PC of Votes in S. African Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- With the election results of
about eight polling stations still outstanding, the African
National Congress (ANC) was on Monday morning still a whisker away
from capturing a two- thirds majority in last week's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Unverified figures showed the ANC's share of the total vote
standing at 66.4 percent, while the Democratic Party (DP) still
appeared set to become the official opposition with 9.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) remained in third place early
Monday with 8.55 percent, followed by the New National Party (NNP)
which stood at 6.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
At least six smaller parties, including the newly formed
Federal Alliance, each received less than one percent.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted deputy chief electoral
officer of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), Norman du
Plessis, as saying that the results of about six polling stations
had not yet been received.
</P>
<P>
"There are also two voting stations, one in KwaZulu-Natal and
the other in the Eastern Cape, where the votes have not been
counted yet," he said. "But we are confident we will have all
those numbers processed by noon (on Monday)."
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 votes from ballots cast abroad would then be added
to the total.
</P>
<P>
Du Plessis was confident that the IEC would be able to announce
a provisional result from verified figures by 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT)
Monday. It would also give the number of parliamentary seats each
party had secured.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15.93 million votes had been counted by Monday
morning, of which 13.88 million had been verified. This
represented 89.16 percent of the potential voters' total of 18.1
million.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's share of the verified vote stood at 57.45 percent,
with 8.57 percent for the DP, 7.20 percent for the IFP and 6.42
percent for the NNP.
</P>
<P>
The latest unverified figures from the provinces of
KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape had changed little overnight.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, the IFP was leading with 41.82 percent,
followed by the ANC with 39.33 percent and the DP with 8.19
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had so far mustered 42.07 percent of the Western Cape
vote and the NNP 39.39 percent. The DP's share in the province
had risen from 8.18 percent on Sunday night to 11.91 percent on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
As the vote-counting process draws to an end, coalition
governments in the two provinces seem to be inevitable as none of
the parties could win an absolute majority.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Election Conducted Orderly: EU Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's general election has
been conducted in an orderly manner, election monitors from the
European Union (EU) told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The monitors, however, noted that the number of polling
stations they have seen might not be representative of the total
number of polling stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the EU monitoring team John Gwyn Morgan of Britain
said that polling at three stations in Jakarta had been conducted
according to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructures were adequate, he said, adding that he had
only monitored three polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Morgan praised the local election committees and the voters for
exercising their respective tasks enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
Separately, General Election Commission (KPU) member Adnan
Buyung Nasution said that the election held on Monday ran a bit
rough since some of the personnel involved were not well equipped
and trained to conduct the polling process.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, disagreements between polling station officials
and non-registered voters occurred, but none led to more serious
conflicts due to fast anticipation by sub-district election
officers.
</P>
<P>
Similar misunderstanding has caused a polling station burnt
down by 200 angry non-registered voters in Kemuning village in
Tanggerang, about 30 kilometers south of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In some districts, Nasution said, inks and forms for the
election were either not supplied or not enough, causing some
delays in the voting process.
</P>
<P>
Lack of forms occurred in Jakarta and Nusa Tenggara Timur too,
but not serious enough to cause any meaningful delay, Nasution
said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the preliminary results of the election
from areas are expected on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Logistic Problems Hinder Nigeria's Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Logistic problems and inadequate
personnel to set up testing facilities in major entry points in
Nigeria are frustrating the operation of the destination
inspection scheme which started two months ago, The Guardian
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, from 1939 till the end of March this year, had been
operating pre-shipment inspection scheme which was criticized for
constituting delays in the process of importation and barrier to
trade.
</P>
<P>
The two appointed destination inspection agents, Bureau Veritas
and Contecna, are supposed to deploy their personnel and have
support facilities in more than 40 entry points in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The two companies were contracted to undertake pre-shipment
inspection of imports on behalf of the Nigerian government,
relying on readily available experts in inspection and testing
facilities in foreign countries to inspect goods prior to
shipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the shifting of the inspection exercise to the point
of destination meant that the same facilities and personnel ought
to be available in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The investigation by The Guardian showed that of the two
destination inspection agents contracted by the government, only
Bureau Veritas has been able to deploy a few experts to Lagos
ports while Contecna is said to be in the process of recruitment
and deployment of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Strong indications are already emerging that the country may be
losing substantial revenue because of the non-availability of
adequate personnel and facilities for the destination inspection
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Customs Service announced the collection of 10
billion naira (about 100 million U.S. dollars) revenue from the
country's ports for April, the first month of the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
However, the pre-shipment inspection agents had valued duty
payable for imports already inspected in March, which is
collectible in April, at 12.92 billion naira (about 129 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lucky Amiwero, President of the National Council of Managing
Directors of Licensed Customs Agents, and Peter Okocha, President
of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, noted that
the inspection agents who are foreign forwarders are not equipped
for the destination inspection.
</P>
<P>
In their view, their continued retention will only constitute a
drain on the national treasury and the destination inspection job
would be better handled by Nigeria Customs Service.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Providing More Poverty-Relief Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC)
, one of China's four largest commercial banks, plans to increase
loans for poverty-relief to 15 billion yuan this year, according
to Jiang Shangjun, a manager of its Credit Department.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the bank had planned 10.3 billion yuan in
loans with 3.2 billion yuan of that already given out.
</P>
<P>
China is paying more attention to getting rid of poverty and
the bank has been increasing its loan support. In the past decade,
it has set aside 55.36 billion yuan for loans and lent out 67.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the effectiveness of the loans, the bank has improved
its management by setting up special departments and assigning
special personnel to manage the loans, said Jiang. It also has a
mandatory loan planning system at its branches in different
localities. In 1998, it issued 800 million yuan in small loans,
helping 750,000 households with 13 million farmers out of poverty.

HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The total receipts of restaurants,
retail trade and import/export trade industries in Hong Kong grew
moderately in 1997, by 7 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent
respectively as compared to 1996, official figures showed Monday.
</P>

According to figures released by the Census and Statistics

These figures relate to 1997, a spokesman for the Census and
Statistics Department said, adding that they provide detailed
information on the structure and operating characteristics of the
industries concerned and are intended for long-term analysis
rather than tracking the latest performance of such industries.

NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Sunday warned against turning church pulpits into political
platforms.

"Even I am not allowed to politics when I am inside the church
or the pulpit," the East African Standard newspaper Monday quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks during a fund-raising drive in aid of the
African Inland Church in Nairobi and helped the church raise10.4
million shillings (about 150,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The head of state also warned against hatred and revenge,
saying that a number of countries had found themselves in problems
because of such ills.
</P>
<P>
Moi urged churches to offer spiritual guidance and counselling
without being seen to be imposing their religious doctrines on
non-Christian pupils and students in various learning institutions
they sponsored.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
recently established its first flood control engineering research
center in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The center, attached to Nanjing Polytechnical College of
Engineering, focuses on applying modern science to flood control
and improving the PLA's flood control technology.
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of the Science and Technology daily reported
that the center will also develop efficient and portable flood
control equipment and techniques to rapidly repair breaches in
dikes and clear landslides.
</P>
<P>
The center will also introduce and translate advanced foreign
flood control techniques.
</P>
<P>
The PLA played a key role in rescue efforts and protecting
property during last summer's record flooding along the Yangtze
and Songhua rivers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan recently called on
Chinese scientists to make more contributions to the nation's
flood control efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investors Support Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Wenzhou, a booming
city in east China's Zhejiang Province, can expect excellent
returns on investments in factories or trade companies.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu Bingxing, general manager of the Xinqiao Transport
Company based in Wenzhou, opted to invest five million yuan to
establish a kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs more educated professionals and people are
keen to improve," said Xu said, adding that "education is emerging
as a promising area for investment in spite of the lack of short-
term gains."
</P>
<P>
Xu is simply one of many far-sighted Chinese who have made long-
term investments in education, an area previously solely funded by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The number of private educational institutions in Zhejiang
alone has increased by an average 10 percent annually since 1995,
with the number of related institutions topping 10,000 and total
investments standing at two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government opened the educational sector to all individuals
and social institutions in the 1970s. Some 50,000 private
educational institutions have been established, including
kindergartens, primary and middle schools, colleges and
universities. The current enrollment in related institutions
stands at 16 million students.
</P>
<P>
Related schools exhibit a much greater flexibility in adjusting
to social demands than their state-funded counterparts. For
example, they not only establish curriculums, but also employ
teachers and select textbooks on their own.
</P>
<P>
The Xinqiao No.1 Kindergarten, which Xu funded two years ago,
has a range of modern facilities, including a gymnasium and
swimming pool. The school currently recruits teachers from
throughout the nation and attaches special importance to
cultivating dance, vocal and gymnastics skills.
</P>
<P>
Students attending the school won first place at the Ninth
National Preschool Children's Basic Gymnastic Exhibition in May.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that private schools are filling a gap in the
country's increasing demand for high-quality educational
institutions and should therefore be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
However, they point out that some schools operated or funded by
private institutions have charged unreasonably high tuition and
fees and shown more interest in profits. They stress that a
national law should be enacted to standardize the management of
private schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen passengers died in a
bloody Sunday morning accident following a head-on collision
between an army truck and a Nissan matatu (min-bus) along
Naivasha-Nairobi road in central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred a few kilometers from Naivasha town. The
13 victims died on the spot while another eight passengers
including the driver were rushed to a Naivasha town hospital,
local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, 11 were adults and the other two were children.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about a kilometer from the scene of
Saturday's accident which killed eight people and severely injured
40 others when a bus rolled after a tyre burst while trying to
overtake another bus.
</P>
<P>
According to Rift Valley deputy provincial traffic enforcement
officer Mwakio Anthony, the Sunday accident occurred after the
Eldoret- bound army truck broke its steering rod and rammed into
the mini-bus heading for capital Nairobi from Naivasha.
</P>
<P>
Nobody in the army truck transporting soldiers to Eldoret was
injured, Anthony said, adding that investigations would be
launched immediately to establish the cause of the accident.

CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A large orange orchard with an
annual output of 290,000 tons is to be built in the Three Gorges
area, on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where a huge
hydropower project is being built.
</P>
<P>
The China Orange Institute, the Chongqing Three Gorges
Construction Group and a U.S. company have been working on the
project since 1997.

By next year, the orchard will cover 690 hectares and by 2005,
its acreage will be expanded to 6,600 hectares, according to
experts working with the joint venture project.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 700 million yuan, including 31.5 million
U.S. dollars from the American partner who is responsible for
designing the orchard, the training of personnel, irrigation, soil
analysis and some other major technical fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the orchard, the project will also include an
orange juice factory, with a yearly production capacity of 75
million liters.

<HEADLINE> China Taps Coal Gas, Geothermal Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the
development of coal gas and geothermal resources in a bid to
improve the country's energy resource consumption structure and
reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission asserts that China
has abundant coal gas resources, with estimated recoverable
deposits in north, northeast and south China standing at 3.5
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China has developed over 50 coal gas projects, including a 650,
000-cu.m. gas storage facility and coal gas pipeline stretching
620,000 meters. The country's annual coal gas usage tops 400
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to promote coal gas
development by eliminating compensation fees for enterprises
engaged in the initial stages of exploration. Preferential loans
will also be available for key coal gas projects, according to an
official of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed an extensive array of advanced coal
gas technology, including some 20 technological items equaling
international standards.
</P>
<P>
China is also paying close attention to tapping southwestern
geothermal energy resources and building medium-sized geothermal
power stations in Tibet, Yunnan and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The unit capacity of the Yangbajing Geothermal Power Station in
Tibet and Ruili Geothermal Power Station in Yunnan will reach 10
MW and 3-5 MW respectively by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China has 3,000 hot springs, including
2,200 springs with record temperatures higher than 25 degrees
centigrade. The country has developed a total geothermal power
capacity of 28.6 MW.
</P>
<P>
Geothermal energy has been widely used for various industrial
and agricultural applications, including greenhouses and heating.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Improve Quality of Early Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve the quality of
its early rice in the Yangtze River basin, the country's largest
rice growing area.
</P>
<P>
The plan is based on a project launched last year by the
Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Agriculture and
the China Grain Reserve Bureau which will eventually affect 6
million hectares of rice fields in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and
Zhejiang provinces by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen strains of high-quality rice have been selected and
some 40 million yuan are to be spent on the project, which is
expected to solve the problem of lagging grain sales caused by
poor quality, according to Chinese agronomists.
</P>
<P>
Early rice is an important Chinese grain and the lower and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River have 5.3 million hectares of
early rice fields that produce 24 billion k.g. of rice annually.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, however, the rice produced in these areas has
been known for its unpalatability and poor quality. Hubei, for
example, has some 10 billion k.g. of surplus rice that is inferior.
</P>
<P>
China now has high-quality rice growing on 2.8 million hectares
of land.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Shrinks in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli trade deficit dropped by
2.3 percent to 1.34 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter
compared with the last quarter of 1998, according to figures
released by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The CBS attributed the shrinkage to a 2.8 percent tumble in
import prices, excluding diamonds and fuel, as commodity prices
fell globally following the financial crisis that swept emerging
markets last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports excluding diamonds and fuel dropped by 0.9 percent in
the first three months, following stability in the last quarter of
1998 and a 1.5 percent rise in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials imports, which account for some 60 percent of
total imports, fell by 2.4 percent and imported consumer products
rose by 2.9 percent and investment goods by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports decreased by a slight 0.5 percent in
general. Industrial exports excluding diamonds fell by 2.9 percent
after a 1.5 percent rise in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The prices of industrial exports fell by 1.1 percent in the
first quarter of this year after gaining 0.3 percent in the final
quarter of 1998. The sharpest decline was recorded in the fields
of wood and paper, which fell by 6.4 percent, while textile and
clothing decreased by 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Says Election Running Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
said Monday that the general election was running smoothly despite
the fact that it was prepared in a short time.
</P>
<P>
"It is because public trust is very high, apart from the good
intention of the Indonesian people to have a fair election,"
Habibie said after observing the election in several polling
stations in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Habibie expressed satisfaction at the smooth voting as well as
the election campaigns, which were marred only by "some minor
problems."
</P>
<P>
"I hope all Indonesians would make the election smooth and fair
and maintain brotherhood and unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said other countries, especially neighboring Asian
countries, have given their full attention to the Indonesian
election.
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia is stable, I am sure the Southeast Asian region
will be stable as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, activities in most Indonesian
cities were sluggish on Monday as people flocked to polling
stations to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Jakarta, early morning rains did not discourage
the people from going to the polls. Malls and markets, such as the
textile center in Tanah Abang, were closed.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, capital of Maluku province, people trooped to the
polling stations, as security officers monitored the situation in
anticipation of possible unrest.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christians groups
since mid-January, which have left at least 127 people dead and
caused massive property damage.
</P>
<P>
In Aceh province, no riot has occurred as some people went out
to vote. Some groups in Aceh have recently been actively
campaigning for an election boycott.
</P>
<P>
The province, which has a population of 374,600, was reportedly
quiet although some people chose to stay at home.
</P>
<P>
In Kendari, capital of Southeast Sulawesi province, activities
in some traditional markets were sluggish as only a handful of
traders opened for business. Not many public transportations were
operating.
</P>
<P>
In Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya province, most voting
stations opened 45 minutes late due to the lack of facilities.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary election will choose 462 members of the
500-seat House of Representatives. The remaining 38 members have
been allotted for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,500 candidates from 48 political parties are
running for the election. Major parties that might get enough
votes to form the next government are the National Mandate Party,
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, National Awakening Party
and Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected between 24 and 72 hours after
the balloting.

<HEADLINE> Improved Crop Strains Increase China's Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's grain output increased by
250 million tons over the past 20 years thanks to more than 200
improved wheat, corn, potato, and rice strains.
</P>
<P>
They were produced from species imported from an international
branch of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR), according to Wang Hongyi, the vice-president of
the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The organization was
established in 1971. It is run by the World Bank, and has the Food
and Agricultural Organization and the U.N. Development Program as
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
China has got 45,000 crop species from the international
organization over the past two decades and has supplied it with 25,
000 species since becoming a donor country in 1984, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
Wang says CGIAR's purpose is to arrange financial support for
international agricultural research and training programs to
improve the quantity and quality of food in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn Against Plant Extinction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yunnan Yew, an endangered
species under state protection, was a commonly found in the
mountains in southwest China in the early 1990s but is rarely seen
today.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates indicate that only 100-odd Yunnan Yew exist
today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists working in the early 1990s discovered a special
extract in the species offered an effective cure for cancer. Local
farmers scrambled to harvest the trees to take advantage of good
prices American companies paid for stems and leaves.
</P>
<P>
"The destiny of Yunnan Yew is far from a isolated case, and
extinction of plant species no longer remains a problem for a
specific island or piece of rain forest. Plant species worldwide
are feeling the threat of unscrupulous human exploitation," said
Li Yanhui, a botanist who has studied endangered plant species for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The world loses at least one plant species on a daily basis,
and any failure to introduce immediate measure could exacerbate
the problem even further, according to the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
Between 50,000-60,000 species will face threat of extinction by
the end of this century, and some 4,000 of 30,000 plant species in
China are currently threatened by extinction.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced endangered species to natural reserves and
set up gene banks in an effort to prevent the worst scenario from
happening, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has established over 920 natural
reserves, some 400 breeding centers and gene banks for plants of
rare and endangered species, and hundreds of botanical gardens and
wooded areas.
</P>
<P>
"More than 300 species of rare and endangered plants under
state protection have been transplanted," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Some endangered plants have been successfully rescued from the
edge of extinction. The Chinese Parashorea, the tallest tree in
southwest China's rain forest, is currently thriving due to
increased state protection. In addition, the wide-spread
plantation of Ginkgo has expanded greatly and in turn reduced the
pressure on wild ginkgo trees.

<P>
China continues to expand natural reserves and 20 million yuan,
or double the 1998 figure, has been allocated to support the
efforts of environmental protection administrations to demarcate
and maintain nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to approve an additional 20 state-level nature
reserves during 1999, with the total number of reserves expected
to hit 156 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, botanists complain of the level of protection and
neglect of plants when compared to state efforts to protect
endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
The Beshanzu Fir fully demonstrates the lack of attention given
to endangered plants, according to Fu Liguo, a researcher with the
Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that a mere seven fir trees were discovered in the
late 1970s in Zhejiang Province, east China, and the species has
since been listed as one of the 12 most endangered plant species
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The Beshanzu Fir is no less rare than the Giant Panda which is
a protected species regarded as state treasure. Nonetheless,
protection of the fir has been neglected and only three tree exist
today," said Fu.
</P>
<P>
Annual state allocations for plant protection include limited
funds for nature reverses and meager amounts for surveying plant
resources. "No special funds are available for plant protection,"
according to an official with the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Human beings may not feel the impact of the extinction of plant
species in the short term, but the disappearance of any species
limits future choices, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Our hopes for curing AIDS, or developing virus-resistant crops
may also die with the continual extinction of various species," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Botanists and officials agree that society as a whole should
exhibit greater concern for plant protection rather than simply
depending on government efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Public awareness concerning the need for plant protection is
extremely important, and economic development must be an integral
part of the project," said Li. "Mankind should bear in mind that
development carried out at the cost of the ecological environment
cannot be sustainable, and will in fact lead to self-destruction."

JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In his first full interview since being elected prime
minister three weeks ago, Ehud Barak said on Israel's Channel
One Sunday night that he is working toward the establishment
of a narrow coalition of 66 legislators, while keeping the
option open for Shas and the Likud to enter the government
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Sources in One Israel said that Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak has decided that he prefers Shas to the Likud as a
coalition partner, because the positions presented by Likud leader
Ariel Sharon are guaranteed to obstruct any progress on the
peace front, while Shas will be a loyal partner in a coalition
aimed at making a breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's effort to include
Shas in his government ran into difficulty because of the veto of
the left-wing party Meretz. Sources in One Israel said if Israel
misses opportunities for peace, Meretz should be responsible.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Form Economic Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) will soon appoint a committee comprising
monetary and fiscal experts to work toward creating a real
economic union within the region, and an eventual common currency.
</P>
<P>
The committee would comprise central bank governors, and experts
from ministries of finance and other stake-holders, COMESA advisor
for regional integration, Mark Pearson has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Monday quoted Pearson as saying
that the economic union would, however, take long to be realized.
</P>
<P>
"There is first an important need to stabilize the
macro-economic environment in all member countries and a horde of
other monetary regulations that must be harmonized before the
implementation of the economic union and common currency," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA advisor said there would also be need to first test
the success of the program through implementing optimal currency
areas, citing the east African block which has advanced economic
integration and nearly practising currency convertibility on the
open market.
</P>
<P>
Pearson said that the COMESA has also embarked on various
program that would set the stage for a real common market.
</P>
<P>
So far, efforts are being made to replace the old clearing
house with the cross-border exchange system.
</P>
<P>
The system would allow exporters and importers to make payments
through commercial banks rather than central banks of member
countries they are trading in.
</P>
<P>
Pearson said the COMESA, which is concentrating on trade and
investment, wants to make it easier for businesses to operate
within the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional body is also putting in place the African
Guarantee Facility.
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to offer both commercial and political risk
for any business operating in any of the COMESA member countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pearson noted that the program to create a common
currency have a number of hurdles to overcome, pivoting on the
infancy of member countries' economies.
</P>
<P>
He said currently, most of the countries are undergoing change
from command economies to a liberalized situation which has left
industrial gaps.
</P>
<P>
COMESA member states must get out of the dependency on one or
two commodities for their export receipts, Pearson stressed,
saying that this made them vulnerable to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
The advisor noted that the region has tremendous potential in
water, land, mineral, energy and human resources that have not
been fully utilized.

<HEADLINE> Barak Works Toward a Narrow Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak has said that he is working toward the establishment of a
narrow coalition, while keeping the option open for Shas and the
Likud to enter the government at a later date.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israeli Television Channel One Sunday
night, Barak said he will be happy with the widest government
possible, but at the moment he is working in the direction of a
government of 66 Knesset (parliament) members.
</P>
<P>
Although the details still need to be worked out, the narrow
government will include One Israel, Meretz, Shinui, Yisrael
Baaliya, the Center Party, Am Ehad, the National Religious Party
and United Torah Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Those parties have a total of 66 seats in the Knesset. The
three Arab parties, controlling another 10 seats, are expected to
support the government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Barak sidestepped the issue of whether Shas has fulfilled his
condition for entry into the government, repeating that Shas
leader Aryeh Deri, who was sentenced to four-year prison terms for
bribe-taking, must cease leading the party and not take part in
the coalition negotiations in order for Shas to be considered a
possible coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said that Shas has to be prepared for the
possibility that it will not get the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to One Israel sources, Barak will use former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres as a conduit to Shas spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, to seek his support for Shas' participation in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 seats in the May 17 parliamentary elections,
becoming the third largest party in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The sources in One Israel also said that Barak has decided he
prefers Shas to the Likud as a coalition partner, because Shas
will be a loyal partner in a coalition aimed at breakthrough in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak met with Likud's acting leader Ariel Sharon Sunday
afternoon over the coalition issue, but nothing has been worked
out.
</P>
<P>
Barak also for the first time met One Israel Knesset members
Sunday after the elections and a majority indicated they would
support the inclusion of Shas into the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to meet Monday evening with dovish Meretz
Party leader Yossi Sarid to ask him to change his anti-Shas
attitude.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli election law, Barak has to form his
government before July 9 and submit the list of his cabinet
ministers to the Knesset one week before that date.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Fighting Trafficking In Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Public Security Ministry
official said here today that Chinese police will have a massive
war against trafficking in human beings along the eastern and
southern coastal lines of the country.
</P>
<P>
They will focus on smuggling, criminal gangs, and "snakeheads"
(people who traffic in human beings), according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of or trafficking in human beings has been on the
rise since last October. In the first four months this year,
police dealt with 437 such cases that involved 3,545 persons.
China's border guards have been asked to place great importance on
this war.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the fight against snakeheads is the most
important part of the battle and that they need to be given harsh
penalties in accordance with the law instead of just being fined.
</P>
<P>
He said that the battle will be waged in coastal parts of
Liaoning, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's New Overseas Research Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has issued new policies
encouraging overseas companies to set up research and development
institutions in the city, according to Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Beijing's Mayor Liu Qi as saying that his city
welcomes more research and development centers opened by big
companies from foreign countries or Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy gives preferential treatment to new overseas
R&AMP;D institutions with duty-free equipment imports and a 25 percent
reduction in land tax. They can also cooperate with municipal
research organizations and universities in the city.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded research centers can also charge for scientific
services and run higher education organizations jointly with
universities and research organizations. They can also sign
research contracts for municipal programs and have special foreign
exchange accounts in certain banks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, at least 70 foreign research institutions
had been opened in China by big corporations or organizations from
the United States, Britain, Canada, Japan, Germany, and other
western countries, with a large number located in Beijing and
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> News Feature:  Voting Runs Smoothly in Jakarta, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian voters turned out in
droves to cast their ballots at polling stations across the
country on Monday to elect members of the House of Representatives
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
Braving heavy rain which began pouring down shortly before
voting started at 08:00 a.m. local time (01:00 GMT) in Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, voters flocked to the polling stations at
many roadside polling places covered by striped awnings and lined
up to exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie and First Lady Ainun Habibie cast their
ballots in polling station number 12 in East Kuningan, South
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he hoped the election would be honest,
fair and the best one.
</P>
<P>
According to election regulations, electors received three
ballot papers -- white for the House of Representatives (DPR),
brown for the provincial House of Representatives (DPRD i) and
yellow for regional House of Representatives (DPRD ii) -- which
contain party symbols. Voting is done by piercing one of the party
symbols on the ballot sheet.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, where there is no regency, voters only get two
ballot papers -- one for the city council and the other for DPR.
There are 22,983 polling booths throughout greater Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station in Menteng district, Central Jakarta,
Xinhua correspondents witnessed the procedure which was conducted
orderly: voters individually entered the polling booths and, using
a big nail or other sharp object, pierced the symbol of the party
of their choice on two ballot papers in a small tent and then put
them into the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian election system does not advocate direct
election. Voters do not choose candidates but choose the symbols
of the political parties contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
Some people may choose the "banyan tree" of the ruling Golkar
Party while some others may choose the "buffalo head" of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. As many as 48 political
parties are contesting the election this year, compared to only
three parties in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what he might expect of the election, Andi, a
young voter at a polling station in Menteng, central Jakarta, said
this year's general election was free and fair and he no longer
felt nervous. "I hope the election will bring about changes to the
country and reforms could be continued," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
A woman voter told Xinhua that she hoped a new government after
the election would create safety and stability for the country
where many violent incidents have taken place since last year.
</P>
<P>
"We can not enjoy the achievement of economic development and
prosperity, if it is not safe," she added.
</P>
<P>
Monday's voting was tightly guarded by troops and policemen
around the polling stations. It was reported that the Jakarta
Military Command has deployed a 62,000-strong security force to
maintain law and order in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 61 domestic and 13 international election monitoring
organizations supervised the process of the election.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, as an international
observer, Monday supervised the process of the election in
Tanggerang, about 30 kilometers south of Jakarta. He said he
believed the ongoing election would be fair and free.
</P>
<P>
He said there was little possibility that violence could occur
in Indonesia after the general election.
</P>
<P>
The voting is expected to close at 14:00 local time. Counting
of votes will then commence at the polling booths and continue
until sunset, under the supervision of local as well as
international monitoring officials.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected some 24 to 72 hours after the
voting. Final official parliament results may be announced in one
month.

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Insults China: CASC Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China has evidence to prove that
charges in the Cox Report leveled against the China Aerospace Corp
(CASC) were sheer fabrications prompted by ulterior motives, says
a front-page article carried by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Without any substantive facts, the Cox Report on May 25
subjectively dished out the claim that China's space sector had
illegally acquired so-called 'sensitive technologies' from the U.S.
ever since the 1950s," Zhang Lihui, spokeswoman of the CASC, was
quoted by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The groundless assertions have severely damaged the image and
commercial reputation of the CASC, and constitute a gross slander
of China's high-tech undertakings, to which Chinese aerospace
scientists and engineers have dedicated more than 40 years' effort,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"CASC authorities and the corporation's scientists and
engineers feel insulted by the despicable attack," she said. "From
the very beginning, China has relied on its own strength to
independently develop its space sector. Its space technology now
ranks among the world's top levels."
</P>
<P>
By 1964, or 15 years before China and the United States
established diplomatic relations, China had developed intermediate
and short-range missiles. China successfully launched its own man-
made earth satellite in 1970, followed by the sending of a
recoverable satellite into space five years later.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for the alleged technology leaks to have
occurred," said Zhang when commenting on the Cox Report's claim
that China had acquired so-called U.S. "sensitive technologies"
through commercial launch service provided for U.S. satellites.
</P>
<P>
China conducted its first international commercial satellite
launch in 1990, during which a Long March-III rocket was used to
place the Hughes Corp's "Asiasat I" into orbit, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Well before the commercial launch, China had already developed
long-range rockets, submarine-launched solid-propellant rockets,
recoverable satellites, the technology to launch multiple
satellites atop a single rocket, high-energy-low-temperature fuel
technologies and a precision guidance system, she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. satellites entered China free of customs checks, and
were stored under the around-the-clock protection of a
sophisticated United States surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
"Launching U.S.-manufactured satellites atop Chinese rockets
benefits both China and the U.S.," Zhang said. "Since last April,
however, some anti-China politicians in the U.S. have been
dreaming up stories about the issue."
</P>
<P>
"They deliberately confuse the technology needed for satellite
launch vehicles with that used for missiles, and blur the
distinction between necessary co-ordination and divulgence of
sensitive technologies, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The politicians' biased posture on normal international
commercial activities serves their Cold War mentality, and
promoted the fallacy that China's missiles pose a threat to U.S.
national security, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The CASC will publish more details and facts via the Internet
and other media to prove that China's space undertakings have been
developed based wholly on the country's own strengths, and that
China has never acquired so-called U.S. 'sensitive technology',"
Zhang said, offering the CASC website as .

<HEADLINE> Profile: Habibie - Ruling Golkar's Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, the
incumbent president of Indonesia, is the sole presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 term of the ruling Golkar Party which
is a major party contesting in the parliamentary elections
scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is the third of four children. He began reading
newspapers when he was a child. His lifelong religious devotion
continues in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Jali Habibie from the South Sulawesi town of
Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his Javanese
mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, West Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of deep sea submarine and a
high-pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto called Habibie home and assigned
him to be his technological consultant. He was state minister of
research and technology from 1978 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The strengths of Habibie, who was elected as vice president on
March 11, 1998 at the general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly, include his popularity among the majority Muslim
community, the esteem he holds among youths and his long service
as state minister.
</P>
<P>
B.J. Habibie was sworn in as president on May 21, 1998 after
Soeharto resigned amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the past year since he assumed the presidential office,
Habibie and his government have launched several political and
economic reforms including the release of political prisoners,
press freedom and the holding of a multi-party election to push
forward the political and economic democracy process in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Abdurrahman Wahid - Leader of Indonesia's Largest Muslim Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Abdurrahman Wahid is the general
chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Muslim organization
in Indonesia with around 30 million members.
</P>
<P>
He has been nominated by the National Awakening Party as the
presidential candidate to contest the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Born in Jombang, East Java, on August 4, 1940, Abdurrahman
Wahid, affectionately known as Gus Dur, is the eldest of six
brothers. His farther A. Wahid Hasyim was a religion minister.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman Wahid studied at a number of Pesantren, or
traditional Islamic boarding schools, in Java before undertaking
tertiary level studies at the Al-Azhar Islamic University in
Cairo, Egypt, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
He went on to further studies in the field of literature at the
University of Baghdad in Iraq in 1966 and returned to Indonesia in
1970.
</P>
<P>
From 1972 to 1974, he was dean of the Faculty of Theology
(Ushuludin) at the Hasjim Asyari University in Jombang. From 1974
to 1980, he was secretary-general of the Tebuireng Pesantren in
Jombang. In 1978, he took up the leadership of Pesantren Ciganjur
in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Having moved to Jakarta in 1978, Abdurrahman Wahid became
increasingly involved with the national leadership of NU. He was
made first secretary (Katib Awal) of the NU Supreme Religious
Council (Syuriyah) in 1979 in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In December 1984, at a five-yearly National Congress meeting of
NU, Abdurrahman Wahid was elected NU general chairman. In 1989 and
1994, he was re-elected NU general chairman and he still holds the
post.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of his chairmanship of NU, the government
welcomed Abdurrahman Wahid's presence as a voice for moderation
and stability. In recent years, however, he has increasingly been
seen as an opposition figure after he, together with some leading
public intellectuals, launched the ginger group "Forum Demokrasi"
(Democratic Forum) to campaign for democratic reform. His public
criticism of former president Soeharto resulted in him being
placed under considerable political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman Wahid upholds Islamic education and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He was married to Nuriyah in 1968 and has four children.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Dyah Permata Megawati Setyawati
Soekarno Putri is the eldest daughter of late founding president
Soekarno and the general chairman of the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI Perjuangan), a major party contesting in
the ongoing general election.
</P>
<P>
Megawati Soekarno Putri was born in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, on January 23, 1947. After finishing her primary and
secondary education in Jakarta from 1954 to 1963, she studied
agricultural subjects at the Padjadjaran University in Bandung,
West Java, from 1965 to 1967. Then she studied philosophy at the
Indonesian University in Jakarta from 1970 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
Nurtured in the political atmosphere of her family, especially
the influence of her farther Soekarno, Megawati was very
interested in politics as she was young. However, she had been
suppressed from being engaged in political activities for about
20 years after Soeharto replaced her father as the second
president of Indonesia in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Megawati shot into fame when she helped the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) obtain votes in the 1987 general election.
In 1993, she was elected general chairman of the PDI.
</P>
<P>
However, Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a
government-backed group in 1996 at a congress held in Medan, North
Sumatera. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year and
helped secure her position as a leading proponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Megawati was elected general chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle when most PDI members
separated from the government-backed PDI led by Budi Hardjono.
</P>
<P>
Megawati has become the most popular political figure in the
country and been nominated by her party as the presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 period.

JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Muhammad Amien Rais is general
chairman of the National Mandate Party (PAN), one of the five
largest political parties contesting the ongoing general election
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Born in Solo, Central Java, on April 26, 1944, Amien Rais, the
second of five children, was brought up in strictly religious
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
He had his primary and secondary education in Muhammadiyah
schools in Solo from 1956 to 1962. Then he studied social and
political subjects at the Faculty of International Relations in
Yogyakarta, Central Java. He continued the same subject in Egypt
and was known as a political expert. From 1974 to 1981, Rais
studied political science and medical science in Chicago
University, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Early in the 1980s, he became general chairman of the
Muhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim organization in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Rais became chairman of the experts commission of the
Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) headed by
B.J. Habibie. In February 1997, he withdrew from ICMI and took an
active part in the struggle against former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, 1998, Rais established the National Mandate Party
and was elected its general chairman. He was a leading critic of
the Soeharto regime and kept a high profile during the student
protests in May last year that triggered Soeharto's fall from
power.
</P>
<P>
As the single presidential candidate of the PAN, Rais has the
most Western-style approach to election campaigning. He upholds a
more democratic system and promises to treat all racial and
religious groups equitably.

<HEADLINE> Italians Demonstrate Against NATO Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 Italians demonstrated
Sunday afternoon in front of an American military base in Aviano,
northern Italy, demanding an immediate halt to NATO's airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration that lasted about three hours was organized
by some anti-war parties and organizations including the Communist
Re-establishment Party (CRP).
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators held slogans and banners reading "Stop bombing
immediately" and "We Oppose the governments that make the war."
</P>
<P>
Many demonstrators were flying kites over the military base to
show their determination to prevent any plane from taking off for
the bombing mission.
</P>
<P>
No plane took off from the military base during the
demonstration. Italian Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said
that was the result of negotiations between the Italian government
and NATO authorities.
</P>
<P>
Fausto Bertinotti, General Secretary of the CRP, said in Milan
that the Italian government should demand NATO end the bombing
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was aimed at establishing NATO's hegemonic position
in Europe and a U.S. new empire position in Europe, he said. "
Europe is one of the main victims of the war," he said, adding, "
The main goal at present should be rebuilding Europe's
independence."

<HEADLINE> Thailand, ADB to Hold Talks on Agriculture Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Agriculture Minister Pongpol
Adireksarn will hold high-level talks with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) this week to try to break a deadlock over tough
conditions attached to a proposed 600-million-U.S. dollar loan,
The Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand badly needs the loan to overhaul its ailing farm
sector, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol is scheduled to hold talks with ADB President Tadao
Chino during the two-day talks that start Wednesday at the bank's
headquarters in Manila.
</P>
<P>
A compromise is expected over the sticky issues of credit
subsidy and water pricing that have held up an agreement on the
huge loan.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding to proceed with the Agriculture
Sector Program Loan (ASPL) was signed in February by the Thai
government and the ADB to pursue a sweeping reform program that
would fundamentally change Thailand's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
However, differences over conditionalities have held up an
agreement on the huge loan.
</P>
<P>
On the credit subsidy, the Agriculture Ministry wants
flexibility to fix interest lower than the market rate which it
says could seriously distort the rural capital market.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry plans to spend 200 million dollars
from the ASPL on an economic-stimulus package for the agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has already made a number of concessions on a national
water-resources law.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also agreed to abandon all reference to
politically-sensitive water-pricing measures and replace it with a
cost-recovery for irrigation investment in the Development Policy
Letter and Policy Matrix on condition that small-scale farmers are
exempt from any planned imposition of water rates.
</P>
<P>
The Thai ministry said several groups of farmers have expressed
willingness to pay for the cost of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the ASPL will be signed at the end of this
month if negotiations are successfully concluded and approved by
the ADB board of directors and the Thai cabinet.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Yugoslavia Peace Talks Collapse, Air Strikes to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Monday that it will
intensify its air campaign against Yugoslavia as negotiations
aimed at putting the Kosovo peace plan into action broke down.
</P>
<P>
NATO has "no alternative but to continue and intensify the air
campaign until such time as the Yugoslavs are prepared to
implement the agreement fully and without ambiguity," Lt. General
Michael Jackson, the commander of NATO troops in Macedonia, said
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson blamed the failure to reach agreement on Yugoslavia's
insistence on a proposal which NATO said would not "guarantee the
safe return of all the refugees" or the full withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslav spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said after the talks
that "We came here in good faith to achieve a technical agreement
based on the political document adopted in Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
"We have a mandate to negotiate a technical agreement based on
the principles ... of respect for Yugoslav territorial integrity
with Kosovo as an integral part and also the deployment of an
international security presence under UN auspices or of an
international presence established by a decision of the Security
Council," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks were aimed at translating a political deal
agreed to late last week by the Yugoslav government and NATO into
a workable "reality on the ground," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
"Our job here at the military to military talks has been to
translate the political agreement into a workable reality on the
ground. The Yugoslav delegation presented a proposal that would
not guarantee the safe return of all the refugees or the full
withdrawal of Yugoslav forces (from Kosovo), " he said.
</P>
<P>
He also added that the Yugoslav proposal, the content of which
he did not disclose, was "inconsistent with the text produced by (
Finnish) President (Marti) Ahtisaari and (Viktor) Chernomyrdin,
the Russian Balkans envoy."
</P>
<P>
He said, "NATO therefore has no alternatives but to continue
and intensify air campaign until such time as the Yugoslav side
are prepared to agree to implement the agreement fully and without
ambiguity."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Assistant Foreign Minister Davo Shevnovic, a member of
the Yugoslav delegation, said in his statement that the Yugoslav
delegation came here in good faith to achieve a technical
agreement based on the political document adopted in Belgrade in
direct trilateral talks between Ahtisaari, Chernomyrdin and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We pursued a good faith and we will continue to do so.
We have a mandate based on the decisions of the parliament and
government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a technical military agreement must be based
on the principles put forth in the Belgrade meeting, which include
full respect of Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and sovereignty
and a deployment of international security presence under the
auspices of the United Nations or a presence established by the U.
N. Security Council decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue with our constructive efforts and we are
ready to talk further," the Yugoslav assistant minister said.
</P>
<P>
He described as "not correct" some media reports which said the
Yugoslav delegation had no mandate.
</P>
<P>
"We have a clear mandate in accordance with the political
documents established in Belgrade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that the Yugoslav delegation
was opposed to the NATO proposal that a 25-kilometer long safety
zone be established along border between Kosovo and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, pointing out that the establishment of
such a safety zone violates the sovereignty of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav side was also opposed to the NATO demand that the
landmined areas be marked out. In addition, it said that because
of the shortage of fuel, the withdrawal of the Serb troops from
Kosovo would take two weeks instead of one week, as required by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO insists the talks are only to spell out terms of a
withdrawal and are not negotiations. The Yugoslav side reportedly
was seeking more time to extract its troops, along with guarantees
that convoys would not be ambushed by ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the seven industrial powers and Russia
were to begin negotiating a draft U.N. resolution Monday.
</P>
<P>
NATO said it would persist in its air campaign, which was in
its 75th day Sunday, until it verifies Yugoslav army and special
police units are pulling out of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indonesia Kicks Off Multi-party General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian people in all walks of
life went to polls to elect a new parliament Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The general election, the eighth one since Indonesia obtained
independence in 1945 and the first multi-party election in 30
years, is described as of strategic importance for the country's
efforts to establish a new and credible government and is expected
to bring the country out of prolonged economic crisis and social
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide televised speech Sunday night, President B.J.
Habibie called on all eligible voters to use their intelligence
when casting their votes Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president said this year's election is the first democratic
experience for Indonesians since the New Order era (when Soeharto
was in power), because all voters can now freely choose their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We all hope for a global community which will make the
Indonesian nation a model of how a big nation could free itself
from conflicts and the trap of authoritarianism," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy and the culture of democracy can only be built by a
nation that is capable of restraint. Accept victory without
harassing those defeated, and accept defeat without turning the
winner into an enemy," noted Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Voters gathered at each polling station at 08:00 local time
(0100 GMT) waiting patiently in their turn to cast votes.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia with about 10 million people, was
almost empty of traffic as Monday was declared a holiday and many
people went to polls or stayed at their homes.
</P>
<P>
Out of the country's 209 million people, approximately 128
million eligible voters, with 6.5 million first-time voters, go to
some 320,000 polling stations throughout the scattered islands of
the tropical archipelago to choose 462 members of the 500-seat
House of Representatives (DPR) for the 1999-2004 term of office.
The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the military whose members
do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The election will decide who will sit in the DPR (central),
provincial legislative councils and district or mayoralty
councils. Each of the members elected will represent 400,000
Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
These 500 members as well as 200 other regional representatives
and community figures will form the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), the highest decision-making body, who will elect a
president and vice president in November this year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian election system does not advocate direct
election. Voters do not choose candidates but choose the symbols
of the political parties contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
This year's general election is different from the previous
ones, with as many as 48 parties contesting. In the past 30 years,
only three parties were allowed to contest.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar Party, the political vehicle of former
president Soeharto, had won each of the elections since 1971 and
its representatives dominated the legislative assembly that the
executive became so strong.
</P>
<P>
However, Golkar is facing fierce challenges from some newly
established reformist parties, such as the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle, the National Mandate party (PAN) and the
National Awakening Party (PKB).
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with 48 political parties contesting, this
year's election will neutralize the dominance of the government
over the DPR.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the contesting parties have claimed that they will
win large numbers of vote in the current election and put forward
their presidential candidates, but observers said that neither of
them will win majority votes.
</P>
<P>
In the past elections, voter turnout has always been more than
90 percent. But it remains to be seen if this year's 112 million
registered voters, or 91 percent of the eligible voters, will vote
Monday and who will win the election.
</P>
<P>
The voting is expected to close at 14:00 local time. Counting
of votes will then commence at the polling booths and continue
until sunset, under the supervision of local as well as
international monitoring officials.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected some 24 to 72 hours after the
voting. Final official parliament results may be announced one
month later.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Takes Measures for Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been taking measures for
 the protection and management of the country's environment,
successfully formulating Myanmar Agenda 21 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Incepted in early February 1990, the Myanmar National
Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) formulated the agenda
which is a program for sustainable development and is currently in
the process of drafting two environmental laws, namely, the
Environmental Protection Law and the Environmental Impact
Assessment Rules to strengthen the related management in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While expanding agricultural lands to boost production or
setting up new industries and factories, the government takes
special care to avoid negative impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The care is also exercised in granting foreign investment
projects to ensure that the projects meet strict environmental
standards or keep with the existing environmental rules and
regulations and environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
To protect and preserve the environment including soil and
water resources and to provide the basic needs of the rural people
for forest products, the Myanmar government has embarked on a
program for greening of the country's dry zone.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will enhance the sustainable development of
socio-economic conditions of the rural community in the dry zone,
was initiated in nine districts in Sagaing, Mandalay and Magway
divisions and has now been expanded to a total of 13 districts.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, school children, local community and
non-governmental organizations took part in planting 11 million
seedlings annually.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar's endeavors to protect the environment, the
importance of public awareness and public participation is
stressed and there has been increased environmental awareness
acquired.
</P>
<P>
The country is also participating actively in a number of
regional programs and projects designed to prevent environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, Myanmar has signed a number of
international environmental agreements and conventions such as the
U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on
Biological Diversity, the Vienna Convention and the Montreal
Protocol for Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is still green with more than 50 percent of its land
covered with forest. The land area of reserved and protected
forest amounts to more than 104,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China's Housing Prices to Head Downward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Housing prices will spiral down
throughout the year as China distances itself from hectic
institutional buying, officials and economists have predicted.
</P>
<P>
"On average, the prices in real estate may drop by about 7
percent compared to last year," Ouyang Yonghua, vice-president of
China Real Estate Index Services, told China Daily over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the expected price drop to an oversupply of
houses and to the cautiousness of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies and State-owned companies crowded the
housing market at the end of last year at the news that the four-
decade-old welfare housing system would end in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The welfare system allowed employees to live in government-
allocated houses rented at a low rate.
</P>
<P>
A new housing system would require people to buy the house they
live in. Last year was said to be the last chance for government
employees to buy at the discount price of 1,450 yuan per square
meter.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, real estate developers will face a buyer's market
comprising mainly individuals," Ouyang said, adding that the
market has matured, no longer affected by abnormal factors, such
as fast-come-fast-go group purchasing.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice-Minister of Construction Liu Zhifeng said there
is still a long way before individuals really could constitute a
real estate market.
</P>
<P>
"High prices, even for ordinary houses, have stunned most
individuals out of the market," Liu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In Ouyang's view, individuals tend to be more cautious than
institutions when spending a large sum of money, especially when
their wages are low.
</P>
<P>
"As institutional buyers fade out, the market enters a rational
period," Ouyang said. Prices in Shanghai, Shenzhen and certain
other coastal regions will drop faster than the national average,
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
China's total investment in real estate grew 26.24 percent in
the first quarter of the year, slower than that at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, investment in residential houses accounted for 66
percent, the highest proportion in recent years.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Beats Portland to Enter NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The San Antonio Spurs stormed
into the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history,
capping their second straight series sweep with a 94-80 victory
over the Portland Trail Blazers today in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
"Twin Towers" David Robinson and Tim Duncan again were dominant
as the Spurs methodically pulled away for their 10th straight
playoff win, one shy of the single-season record. They held the
powerful Trail Blazers to just 304 points, an NBA record low for a
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio ended years of conference finals futility that
began shortly after it entered NBA from the defunct ABA in 1976.
The Spurs became the first NBA team to reach the Finals and will
host Game One on June 13 or 16.
</P>
<P>
Conference finals losses in 1979, 1982, 1983 and 1985 gave San
Antonio the most visits without reaching the NBA Finals. The Spurs
put an end to that today and are looking more and more like the
next NBA champion.
</P>
<P>
"We'd be disappointed with anything less," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs established the NBA Finals as their goal in preseason
and that seemed unlikely when they stumbled to a 6-8 start. But
they are 42-6 since and have not lost in six postseason road games.
</P>
<P>
Duncan had two three-point plays, a spectacular slam dunk and a
series of big defensive plays to help the Spurs pull away.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs buried the Blazers with a 70 percent shooting
performance in the fourth quarter (12-for-17).
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, finally in the NBA Finals in his 10th season,
had 20 points and 10 rebounds. Duncan had 18 points and eight
rebounds, while Sean Elliott scored 16.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Factsheet (5) - Brief History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A brief history of Indonesia
</P>
<P>
In the 14th century, a Hindu kingdom of Majapahit was
established on the islands of Indonesia and had its capital in
eastern Java. The Portuguese arrived in the 16th century and set
up trading posts. Beginning in 1602, the Dutch slowly established
themselves as rulers of all the islands comprising present-day
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist opposition to colonial rule began early in the 20th
century. During the Second World War the territory was occupied by
Japanese forces starting from March 1942. On August 17, 1945,
three days after the Japanese surrender, a group of nationalists
proclaimed the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The first president of the self-proclaimed republic was Dr.
Soekarno, a leader of the nationalist movement since the 1920s.
After four years of intermittent warfare and negotiations between
the Dutch authorities and the nationalists, an agreement was
reached on a formal transfer of power. On December 27, 1949 the
United States of Indonesia became legally independent, with Dr.
Soekarno continuing as president.
</P>
<P>
In August 1950, the federation was dissolved and the country
became the unitary Republic of Indonesia. Under President
Soekarno, Indonesia played a leading role in the Non-Aligned
Movement. But inflation and widespread corruption provoked
opposition to his rule. In September 1965, there was an abortive
military coup and in March 1966 President Soekarno was forced to
transfer executive powers to Gen. Soeharto, chief of staff of the
army.
</P>
<P>
In March 1967, the People's Consultative Assembly removed
Soekarno from office and named Gen. Soeharto acting president.
Soeharto became prime minister in October 1967 and after his
election by the assembly, he was inaugurated as president in March
1968. He was re-elected in 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1988 until May of
1998, when Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie succeeded him as president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It May Accept Delay in Serb Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said Sunday that it might accept a short delay in
the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo as Belgrade has
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, Cohen said NATO may be
willing to accept a three-day extension of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks as military officials from the alliance
and Yugoslavia are meeting in Macedonia over the withdrawal of the
Yugoslav troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The time frame is not significant," Cohen said. "What we have
to be concerned about is no slow-rolling here. We're not going to
allow a kind of deliberate policy of delaying day by day."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "minor technicalities" were prolonging talks.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav parliament and President Slobodan Milosevic
accepted an agreement negotiated by Russia and the West, under
which Belgrade shall have to pull out its forces from Kosovo and
allow an international force with NATO at its core to enter.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sets a seven-day timetable for the withdrawal,
but there have been reports Yugoslavia was seeking 10 days to pull
out.
</P>
<P>
The military talks between the alliance and Yugoslavia were
stalled early Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy refused to characterize the talks, saying only they were "
ongoing and we will continue to go over in detail what's required
for compliance, and bombing will continue until there's a
verifiable beginning of a Serb withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone Sunday
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien about
the Macedonia talks, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"He talked about the situation and discussed where we are,"
Leavy added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Public Health Minister Korn
Dabaransi ordered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
examine all meat imported from Belgium after reports that meat and
poultry from that country may be dioxin-laced surfaced last week,
The Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a kind of carcinogen, formed as a by-product during
the manufacture of some herbicides and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Korn, who is also deputy prime minister, said in the central
province of Nakhon Pathom Sunday that he will order the FDA to
take action on the matter as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Last week, it was reported that dioxin-laced fat was used to
feed poultry in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
As for whether to ban the import of Belgian meat, Korn said he
would study the results of the examination before making a
decision.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have already blocked the import of Belgian food.
The United States banned the import of European Union (EU) pork
and poultry. Singapore blocked the import of all EU meat products,
while Switzerland and South Korea took similar measures against
Belgian products.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Factsheet (3) - Key Political Parties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- There are 148 political parties in
Indonesia of which 48 are contesting in the parliamentary election
now in progress.
</P>
<P>
The following is a sketch of several major parties with the
best chance to win in the polls:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Development Party (PPP)
</P>
<P>
As one of the only three political parties allowed to contest
the general elections in the past 30 years when former president
Soeharto was in power, PPP has returned to its founding principle
of Islam since the advent of the present reform era. This is
marked by the use again of the Kabah (the small cubicle shrine in
the Great Mosque of Mecca which contains the famous Black Stone of
Mecca) as its party symbol.
</P>
<P>
The party was set up in 1973 as a fusion of four Islamic
parties -- the Nahdlatul Ulama Party, the Indonesian Muslimin
Party, Partai Syarikat Islam Indonesia and Perti Islam Party. Most
of the party's constituents are Ulema (Muslim scholars) and
students of Pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in the rural
areas, mainly in Java.
</P>
<P>
There is no official information about the size of the party's
membership.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has been weakened since many members of the Nahdlatul
Ulama Party, the country's largest Muslim organization, withdrew
from it in 1998. Obviously, the existence of other Islamic parties
as participants of the 1999 general election, constitutes a
competition in obtaining votes. Moreover, several prominent
figures of those Islamic parties used to be well-known figures of
PPP.
</P>
<P>
The firm stance that PPP showed in the 1998 extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly is viewed as one of
the factors that have increased the party's popularity. At the
session, PPP urged the assembly to abolish the political function
of the Armed Forces by dismissing military membership in the
parliament and pushing forward the investigation into the wealth
of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In its program, PPP has decided that in the future it will
continue to fight for a democratic national life by putting in
proper place the functions of the Armed Forces, the House of
Representatives, the president and other state institutions. With
an Islam base, PPP wants to fight for a democratic political order
based on Akhlakul Karimah (generous morals) and develop an Islamic
life.
</P>
<P>
-- The Golkar Party
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party is the continuation of the ruling Golongan
Karya (Golkar, Functional Group), which since the establishment of
the New Order administration in 1967, has been dominating the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, set up by a group of military and civilian leaders
in 1966, claims a membership of 36 million out of a population of
207 million in the country.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which has won the last six elections, won more than 74
percent of the votes in the general election held in May 1997 as
it enjoyed full backing from the military, government bureaucracy
and leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
However, Golkar has split since former president Soeharto
stepped down last year and some leading members have formed their
own parties.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the new situation, Golkar has repositioned itself.
Through the Special National Consensus in July 1997, Golkar has
produced a new paradigm. This was shown in the existence of a more
democratic process of the election of its chairman, and the
abolition of the Supervisory Board Institution and the three ABG
(Armed Forces, Bureaucrats and Golkar) lines. Besides, Golkar has
also admitted and apologized for its past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Golkar was officially declared a political party in March this
year. Golkar says it observes the necessity of developing the
people's economy which has a strong potential to strengthen
fundamentally the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Former KR Commander Tried for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The public trial of ex-Khmer
Rouge commander Nuon Paet started Monday at Phnom Penh Municipal
Court on charges of the 1994 kidnapping and murder of three
Westerners.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses including two high-ranking Royal Cambodian
Armed Forces (RCAF) officers Sam Bet and Chhouk Rin were present
at the trial.
</P>
<P>
The father of the French hostage who was one of the three slain
took part in the trial as well as some diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Paet is facing the charges of kidnapping and subsequent
murder of Briton Mark Slater, Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet and
Australian David Wilson.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the three men were grabbed from a train on its
way to Sihanoukville in July 1994 during a Khmer Rouge hijack that
also left more than 10 Cambodians dead.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Paet, the commander of the rebel group believed
responsible for the attack, was arrested last August.
</P>
<P>
But during the interrogations, Nuon Paet placed responsibility
for the attack and the deaths on his former commanders Sam Bet and
Chhouk Rin, both high-ranking officers in the Royal Cambodian
Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the train ambush was commanded by Chhouk Rin and
the murders were ordered by Sam Bet. Chhouk Rin and Sam Bet both
defected from the Khmer Rouge to the government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen has already assured a thorough and fair
trial, "in order to ensure justice for the victims."

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Mia Hamm had a goal and two
assists as the United States beat Canada 4-2 in the final
exhibition on Sunday in Oregon before the third women's World Cup
begins in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team struggled with its timing and organization for
much of the game. Canada led 1-0 and it was 2-2 late in the first
half, but Kristine Lilly's goal in the 45th minute gave the United
States the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
Charmaine Hooper scored both goals for Canada, which lost its
13th straight game to the United States, a streak dating to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Forward Tiffeny Milbrett, playing in her hometown for the first
time with the U.S. national team, had a goal and assist. Former
University of Portland teammate Shannon MacMillan added an assist
on Cindy Parlow's goal, the only one of the second half.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team has 15 victories, two losses and a tie this year,
including nine victories and a loss in a "Road to Pasadena" tour.
Its only losses came to China, which along with Norway will be one
of United States' toughest challengers in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The team will take a week off before traveling to New Jersey to
prepare for their World Cup opener June 19 against Denmark at
Giants Stadium. Canada opens against Japan the same day in San
Jose, California.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said the increased investments will be the key factors in
the Philippines' quest for a sustainable economic recovery, the
Manila Bulletin newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
IMF resident representative to Manila Henri Lorie was quoted as
saying that "a sustainable recovery in investment, both domestic
and foreign, remains the key for further pick-up in growth."
</P>
<P>
The IMF expected a return of investor confidence, spurring
capital inflows that will further propel the country's economic
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Lorie said the first quarter performance of the economy "was
very encouraging, reflecting a faster than expected recovery of
the agricultural sector."
</P>
<P>
He believed that private sector demand will strengthen in the
coming months "with the return of confidence and the continued
policy focus on structural reforms."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police to Prevent Election-related Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan police are taking
all precautions to prevent election-related violence and
violations at the upcoming Southern provincial council election
due on June 10, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
With election incidents relatively low, there was every hope
that this election will be free from the kind of violence by
hundreds seen in North Western province and to a much lesser
degree in the second round of five provincial council election in
April.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, all progaganda meetings, canvassing,
pasting of posters and distribution of hand bills must cease by
midnight Monday, 48 hours before the poll.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the police have set up four fully
equipped operational centers at Galle, Elpitiya, Matara and
Tangalle to combat election-related violence and unruly behavior
by party members and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
On election day five policemen will be deployed at each polling
booth where violence could possibly erupt. Other booths will have
two policemen each.
</P>
<P>
There will also be mobile armed patrols covering every three
polling booths.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. women's soccer team
beat Canadian national team 4-2 Sunday in the Americans' final
exhibition before the third women's World Cup begins on June 19.
</P>

The Americans dominated the game throughout but failed to score

"They did a good job of disrupting us from the beginning," said
Hamm, whose 109th international goal extended her own record. "
They played a very distinct style and won a lot of first and

<HEADLINE> Jones Wins 100m in TFA ProChampionships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- With the withdrawal of Gail
Devers and the strong wind, world champion Marion Jones of the
United States could not clock impressive time but well enough to
win the women's 100 meters Sunday at the inaugural U.S. TFA
ProChampionships in New York.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the fastest woman in the world, easily beat Inger Miller
with a time of 11.33 seconds while running a strong wind.
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to come here and get a victory," Jones said. "It
was a little disappointing that not more people were here, but it
will take some time to get spectators out to an event such as this.
"
</P>
<P>
The meet drew a sparse crowd of 3,184 after Michael Johnson and
Devers pulled out last week. Johnson, the Olympic gold medalist
and world record-holder in the 200 meters, withdrew because of the
death of his grandmother. Devers has hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
The association and its ProChampionships were established in
April in an attempt to generate track and field interest in the
United States and to give American athletes the opportunity to
perform at home.
</P>
<P>
The TFA is the first established outdoor pro league and plans
to have a full schedule of events next year.
</P>
<P>
Without Johnson, Maurice Greene, the world No.1 sprinter, won
the 200 in 20.37 seconds. Obadele Thompson won the men's 100m in
10.29, and Larry Wade won the men's 110m hurdles in 13.39 to beat
Olympic and world champion Allen Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Watchdogs Ready to Monitor Election in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of poll monitors across
Indonesia are ready for Monday's general election, billed as the
most democratic in over 40 years despite mounting reports of
election violations, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 students across West Java province have joined the
Rector's Forum, and thousands more have joined two internationally
respected domestic poll watchdogs: the University Forum for Free
and Fair Elections (Unfrel) and the Independent Elections
Monitoring Committee (KIPP).
</P>
<P>
In Riau, 4,500 Unfrel volunteers will observe the polls in the
province. Unfrel national coordinator Todung Mulya Lubis urged
police and security authorities to guarantee the safety of Unfrel
volunteers, saying unnamed groups could use force to disrupt the
monitors.
</P>
<P>
In Bandar Lampung, the Joint Forum for Monitoring Elections in
Lampung held a ceremony at Saburai Enggal sports hall to mark the
deployment of more than 10,000 poll monitors to some 7,000 polling
stations across the province.
</P>
<P>
Foreign poll monitors grouped in the International Republican
Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) have
arrived in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya province, for Monday's
election.
</P>
<P>
Five foreign observers from IRI and the International
Foundation for Elections Systems have arrived in Banjarmasin,
South Kalimantan. They will join more than 6,000 domestic poll
monitors.
</P>
<P>
European Union Ambassador John Gwyn Morgan said in Bandung that
the international community would not hesitate to impose sanctions
on Indonesia if Monday's elections were not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will bear some consequences for failing to meet the
expectations for a free and fair general election," Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jakarta Police Chief Major General Nugroho
Djajoesman said there will be three categories of security at the
city's polling stations Monday.
</P>
<P>
Security level number one is for polling stations in areas that
are considered safe. In this category, there will be one
policeman, and four civilian guards to guard four polling booths.
</P>
<P>
Security level number two is for polling stations in areas
susceptible to crime and riots. In this category, two policemen
and eight civilian guards will guard two polling booths.
</P>
<P>
The third level is for polling stations in areas highly
susceptible to crime and riots. There, four policemen and 12 civil
guards will guard one polling booth.
</P>
<P>
Of the 22,983 polling stations in Jakarta, 18,000 are
considered safe; 3,183 must receive extra protection because they
are in regions susceptible to crime and riots; and 1,800 are in
places highly susceptible to violence.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Juli Inkster celebrated her
first major LPGA title in a decade and eclipsed the US Women's
Open tournament record to a five-stroke victory at the U.S.
Women's Open in Mississippi, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Inkster fired a one-under par 71 to finish at 16-under par 272
for the event, keeping runner-up Sherri Turner and third-place
Kelli Kuehne at bay to capture the 315,000-dollar top prize.
</P>
<P>
The former US Women's Open record was 10-under par 278 by
Britain's Alison Nicholas in 1997 and the record for 72 holes over
a par-72 course was nine-under by Pat Bradley in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Both marks shattered easily as Inkster won her fourth career
major and became one of only seven women to capture the US Amateur
and US Women's Open titles. Her most recent prior major title came
at the 1989 Dinah Shore Classic and her three titles this year are
one more than her past six seasons combined.

props used in making the Hollywood block-buster movie "Jurassic

</P>
<P>
However, it seems most of the dinosaur exhibits were not the

The show, which was opened last month, is being staged by
Xiangyu Cultural Development Center of the Chinese Ministry of

The three month long show is in three parts: a corridor on the

</P>
<P>
It cost 15 million yuan to organise and stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter
said Monday that the possibility for violence to occur in
Indonesia after the general election is very little.
</P>
<P>
As an international observer who came to Indonesia several days
ago to supervise the process of the campaign and election, Carter
told reporters in Tanggrang, about 30 kilometers south of Jakarta,
when looking around the voting, said he believed the ongoing
election would be fair and free.
</P>
<P>
He praised the lack of violence during the 17-day campaign
which concluded on June 4. Indonesians had shown their commitment
to democracy through a peaceful campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a glorious demonstration by the Indonesian people so
far that they are not only committed to democracy and freedom but
also committed to having a peaceful campaign," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Now everything is going well on schedule, he added.
</P>
<P>
Carter said if problems are found, he will report to the
General Election Commission (KPU) and hoped they will be corrected
soon.
</P>
<P>
He also said if the general election is successful, foreign
investors will think Indonesia is a good country for investing.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing election, which started at 08:00 local time and
will end at 14:00, will elect 462 candidates to the 500-seat House
of Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 members are reserved

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Wearing smart navy blue T-shirts
and white shorts, well-tanned, and conversing in English now and
then, students of Beijing's Huijia Private College look exactly
like those upper middle class teenagers in a Hong Kong TV soap
opera, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that in addition to annual tuition and boarding
fees of over 20,000 yuan (2,400 U.S. dollars), their parents need
to pay another 40,000 yuan so-called "sponsorship" for their
education in this elite school. Many of the students will end up
in foreign universities after high school.
</P>
<P>
China's economic boom in the past two decades has enabled
nouveau riche parents to provide their children such an education.
</P>
<P>
Beijing approved the establishment of private schools in
September 1992. Now it has 49 private high schools, primary
schools and kindergartens. About 20,000 students are attending
these schools, according for one percent of all school-aged
children.
</P>
<P>
Classes of private schools are much smaller than public schools,
so that each student can get more face-to-face guidance from
teachers. School management encourages introduction of new
teaching methods to enhance the interest of students and teaching
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's private schools emphasize computer literacy, English
skills and creativity. Education officials said that to a cultural
center like Beijing, it is within reasonable limits to have 5 to
10 percent of the school-aged children attending private schools.
Private education needs to develop at a faster rate.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has made it a national policy to
encourage private investment in the education sector, the paper
reports.

The match was just a formality for the reigning champions of
China league after they Saturday brushed aside Samsung Fire &AMP;
Marine Insurance club of South Korea which was the biggest
challenge on their route to the title.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, with four internationals in the line-up, cruised to a
25-15, 25-20, 25-21 win over the lowly Al-Rayyan, which was yet to
win a match, although they started mainly rookies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jian'an, head coach of Folan said at the postmatch
conference that they have reached what they planned.
</P>
<P>
"We have planned to win the title and give a chance for rookies
to improve their skills. Now the two motives are all realized."
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Samsung pounded Chengdu Army of China 25-19, 25-14, 25-21 but
they still came in second as they lost the only match to Sichuan
Folan.
</P>
<P>
Shin Chi-Yong said that the Samsung did not "fulfill their
tasks".
</P>
<P>
"We feel a little disappointed for we came here just to win the
title." said the coach.
</P>
<P>
Samsung looked too good to the spiritless Chengdu whose attack
was blunted and defense was torn to pieces.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu, who finished third in the 1998-99 season of China
League, only wrapped up with two wins and finished fourth in the
Asian premier club competition.

</P>
<P>
Paykan attacking power was sapped as its regular setter Madani
Gh Hosswin was sidelined and the substitute failed to gel with the
other spikers while Japan displayed their characters and fought

<HEADLINE> Agassi Claims French Open, Completes Grand Slam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi came from behind to win
the French Open title and become the fifth man to complete a
career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first two sets, Agassi rallied to beat Andrei
Medvedev in five sets 1-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I'd ever be back here after so many years, I'm
so proud," Agassi said with tears.
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget this, I'm very blessed," said the 29-year-
old American said.
</P>
<P>
The 13th-seeded Agassi became only the fifth man to win all
four major events. He also won the 1992 Wimbledon, the 1994 U.S.
Open and the 1995 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
The others to accomplish the feat were Fred Perry, Don Budge,
Roy Emerson and Rod Laver. Budge and Laver (twice) did it in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
The No.100 Medvedev, the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the
French Open final, hugged Agassi after the match.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, ranked as high as No. 4 in 1994, said he lost to a "
great player".
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say that losing to him is an honor, but it's an honor
to stand here with him because he made history," Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say I did anything wrong, he just played unbelievably,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"I left my heart and soul on the court. I had nothing left,"
said Medvedev, who will now jump to mid-20s in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev led the first two sets before Agassi found his old
fire in the last three sets and turned the match around by coming
more to the net.
</P>
<P>
Twice a loser in the French Open final, in 1990 and 1991, the
victory will help rising 10 spots to No. 4.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who captured his fourth Grand Slam and his 41st career
title, was the first man to complete the Grand Slam on three
different surfaces - clay, grass and hard courts.

<HEADLINE> Capirossi Banned for One Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua)-- Loris Capirossi, the reigning 250cc
motorcycling world champion, was suspended for one race for
dangerous riding at the start of the Italian Grand Prix in Mugello,
Italy, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Honda rider will now miss the Catalan Grand Prix in
Barcelona on June 20.
</P>
<P>
Capirossi veered violently across the front row of the grid at
the start of the 250 race at the track north of Florence, swerving
back again and into the side of compatriot and pole-setter
Marcellino Lucchi.
</P>
<P>
He said afterwards that he thought he heard Lucchi's engine
falter and so had moved over to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
Lucchi fell into the path of the oncoming grid and was
fortunate to avoid serious injury. His Aprilia meanwhile knocked
Japan's Toshihiko Honma off his Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
Capirossi then appeared to ignore a black flag excluding him
from the race for six laps before coming in to the pits.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very strange decision," ANSA news agency quoted the
rider as saying angrily after hearing of his ban.
</P>
<P>
The Italian won the title in controversial circumstances last
season, shunting rival Tetsuya Harada off the track and out of the
final race on the last lap in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
He was disqualified from that race but later reinstated when an
International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) disciplinary court
ruled in his favor, accepting that he had not deliberately caused
the accident.

MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon "Etang" blew out of the
Philippines Sunday after roaring across Northern Luzon, killing at
least four people, the Philippine Star newspaper said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Jury System Key to Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A top judge in Beijing has appealed
for improvement of the people's jury system in China, saying "it
is very important to safeguard the country's judicial fairness."
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme
People's Court, as saying that it is also necessary for perfecting
socialist democratic politics. Xiao commented over the weekend at
a working conference on people's jurors, which was held by the
People's Court of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese laws, people's jurors can enjoy the same
rights as judges when involved in trials of cases. In practice,
however, few jurors enjoy such rights.
</P>
<P>
All judges, especially leaders of courts across the country,
must fully realize the importance of insisting on and perfecting
the people's jury system, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
To further emphasize the people's jurors' role, and to better
regulate their work, the Beijing Higher People's Court (BHPC)
issued the Decisions on Enforcing People's Jurors' Roles and the
proposed Managerial Measures on People's Jurors' Work on the
People's Courts.
</P>
<P>
As an important judicial system of China, the people's jury
system has functioned effectively in Beijing, said Shi Jinping,
vice-president of People's Court of Haidian District.

<HEADLINE> URGENT - NATO To Intensify Raids As Talks Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) said early Monday that it would intensify its air
raids against Yugoslavia as it failed to strike an agreement with
Yugoslavia on a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Kumanovo, Macedonia,
Lieutenant-General Michael Jackson, head of the NATO military
delegation, said early Monday that NATO, therefore, "has no
alternative but to continue and indeed intensify the air campaign
until such time as the Yugoslav side are prepared to agree to
implement the agreement fully and without ambiguity".
</P>
<P>
Talks on putting the Kosovo peace plan into action broke down
early Monday after NATO accused Yugoslav generals of failing to
agree to the formula accepted by President Slobodan Milosevic to
end the Western air bombardment.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Focuses on Debt After Equity Infusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Having met the deadline to raise 200
million U.S. dollars for an equity infusion, the Philippine
Airlines (PAL) has taken the first step towards rehabilitation by
making peace with its creditors and settling its 2.4-billion-U.S.
dollar debt.
</P>
<P>
The Business World newspaper said Monday that a team composed
of PAL officials and financial advisers from Chase Manhattan Asia
has begun drafting documents on "restructured loan agreements."
</P>
<P>
A PAL official was quoted as saying that the restructured loan
agreements would enable the flag carrier to free itself from the
jurisdiction of the country's Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC).
</P>
<P>
"Once all the agreements with the creditors have been
finalized, the interest payments will be regular again and this
means the company's operations are back to normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last April 15, PAL resumed interest payments of about 9 million
U.S. dollars to its aircraft-secured creditors led by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and the European export credit agencies.
</P>
<P>
Since then, interest payments to other secured creditors have
also resumed after each group submitted its conditional acceptance
of the rehabilitation plan to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
The PAL official said getting the creditors to sign the
restructured loan agreements is expected to be "relatively easier"
as the majority had already "agreed in principle" to the new
terms.

<HEADLINE> Railway Sector Wants to Enter Telecom Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to hold a strategic
position in the country's profitable telecommunications service
industry, China's railway sector will commercialize a special
nationwide communication network.
</P>
<P>
The Railway Communication Center (RCC), which used to provide
special services to the railway sector, will establish a
telecommunication company catering to the public.
</P>
<P>
"We have adequate telecommunication resources and can provide
extra service like China telecom and China Unicom," Peng Peng, an
official with the RCC, was quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's telecommunication services are only
provided by the paramount China Telecom and emerging China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
The railway communication network, with a history of more than
120 years, is the country's largest network able to provide
nationwide communication services along railway routes.
</P>
<P>
The RCC already operates a paging company using its
communication network.
</P>
<P>
Peng said it will take about eight months to restructure the
network for commercial services once the State Council approves
the project.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that China should use special
telecommunication networks to provide services such as cable TV
and a power network.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of China United Telecommunications Corp (
China Unicom) in 1994, which was co-financed by various ministries
in the railway sector and the power and electronics industry, was
motivated by the use of the special network to compete with China
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
"China should introduce more telecom service providers,
including those special network operators, to compete for a well
developed telecommunications market," said an expert with the
China Academy of Telecommunication Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Boca Juniors Takes Second Consecutive Argentine Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Boca Juniors would claim their
second consecutive Argentine championship and 19th overall Sunday
with two games remaining in the season.
</P>
<P>
Despite Boca's first loss in 40 games as they dropped a 4-0
decision to Independiente, a loss by second-place River Plate to
Racing Club assured Boca the title with two games ahead.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after kickoff, news quickly spread of the River loss
among Boca fans and a huge roar welled up, indicating no matter
the outcome, Boca would be crowned champions.
</P>
<P>
Independiente's Jose Calderon scored three goals and Victor
Lopez added another as Independiente salvaged an otherwise
unimpressive season knowing it was the first team in two seasons
to defeat the league champions.
</P>
<P>
Winning the league title overshadowed the fact that Boca
suffered its first loss in 40 games. On Wednesday, the team set an
Argentine league record for maintaining the longest unbeaten
streak, dating to the beginning of last season.
</P>
<P>
The title is the second for Boca under coach Carlos Bianchi,
who took over last summer after the team struggled through several
disappointing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
As champions, Boca will represent Argentina in the 2000 Copa
Libertadores, a tournament of South America's best club teams.

<HEADLINE> India Joins Foreign Investment Line-Up in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- India joined the line-up of foreign
investment in Myanmar as a new investor beginning February this
year with 4.5 million U.S. dollars invested in a manufacturing
project, according to the latest Economic Indicators issued by
Myanmar's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
With India's involvement, the number of countries and regions
investing in Myanmar has come to 24.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar received a total of 247 million dollars of foreign
investment in 1998, accounting for only 19.6 and 10.73 percent of
the sum in 1997 and 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, foreign investment in the manufacturing sector
made up the highest with 181 million dollars in 10 projects in the
year, followed by that in hotels and tourism with 40 million
dollars in one project.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Myanmar in 1998 was the most adversely
affected sector due to the Asian financial crisis, with
investments from the Southeast Asia region falling by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted the open-door market-oriented economic
policy in late 1988, it has absorbed 7.1 billion dollars of
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Hughes and Southall to Charge Wales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Mark Hughes and Neville Southall
have taken temporary charge of the Wales team, following Bobby
Gould's resignation as manager.
</P>
<P>
The international veterans have been appointed as joint
caretaker managers after talks with Welsh Football Association
officials.
</P>
<P>
They were recommended by Gould when he decided to step down
after the 4-0 Euro 2000 qualifying defeat against Italy on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hughes was in the team that lost in Bologna, while Southall has
been a goalkeeping coach with the Welsh side.
</P>
<P>
Gould ended his four-year reign close to tears, before laughing
and joking with friends and supporters as he left the final scene
of his 24th international.
</P>
<P>
It ended a colorful, controversial spell that many critics and
ex-players felt he was never quite up to.
</P>
<P>
Gould had been the subject of constant campaigns to oust him
from office by fans and critics alike, and he finally ended it all
after the 13th defeat of his international reign.

<HEADLINE> Vialli Retires from Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea's player-coach Gianluca
Vialli has announced that he is to retire as a player, according
to local reports here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vialli said his decision will allow him time to concentrate on
his career as a manager, saying: "I'm not playing anymore... from
now on, I will only be a coach.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for me become a more conventional coach,
Italian-style, someone who goes more deeply into things."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted: "Obviously, every time I think about it, my
heart twinges."
</P>
<P>
Vialli, who turns 35 next month, can look back on a 19-season
pro-career which started in 1980-81 with Cremonese, where he spent
four seasons before an eight-year stay at Sampdoria, winning the
league in 1991 and losing the 1992 European Cup final to Barcelona
in his last match with the club.
</P>
<P>
However, he lifted the coveted trophy four years later at the
very end of his four-year stint with Juventus during which he also
won the league in 1995 and the UEFA Cup in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1996 he joined Chelsea, where he eventually
replaced Ruud Gullit in the coaching role, and won the 1997 FA Cup,
the 1998 League Cup and the 1998 European Cup Winners Cup.
</P>
<P>
Months later, Chelsea also won the European Super Cup after
beating Real Madrid in Monaco.

<HEADLINE> Scotland to Face UEFA Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish Football Association
are set to hold showdown talks with European soccer governing body
UEFA over the timing of their postponed home European championship
qualifying match with Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Scots, whose Euro 2000 hopes were dealt a serious blow on
Saturday when they could only muster a draw against the Faroe
Islands, were originally set to take on Bosnia in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the escalating problems in the Balkans meant the
Bosnian team were unable to play the fixture and UEFA have now
insisted the game will be played at Ibrox on August 18.
</P>
<P>
But the SFA are extremely reluctant to have it played on the
specified date as it clashes with the early rounds of Scottish
league matches, European ties and the League Cup.
</P>
<P>
SFA president Jack McGinn feels it would be more logical to
play the Bosnia tie on October 13, just four days after the Scots
are scheduled to entertain Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
But it seems European football's governing body are not
prepared to discuss the matter, meaning clubs could be forced to
lose key players for vitally important matches.
</P>
<P>
SFA President Jack McGinn said: "We've told UEFA that August is
totally unsuitable. It would then be played in the middle of our
League Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
"Also, all being well our top clubs will still be involved in
the major European competitions. We've suggested October because
we are scheduled to play Lithuania at home on October 9.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia could come along and make it a double-header the
following week, that seems the sensible thing to do from
everybody's point of view. But I must say we're having great
difficulty persuading UEFA for that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Crushes Austria 5-0 in Euro 2000 qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel hammered Austria 5-0 in a
Euro 2000 qualifier Sunday, significantly boosting its chance of
finishing at least second place in Group Six.
</P>
<P>
Amid cheers of about 45,000 audience at the national stadium in
Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, the aggressive host team appeared
superior in almost all areas, taking a firm lead in the first half
by 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Eyal Berkovic scored twice, first in the 25th minute and then
the 47th, and helped Najwan Grayeb strike at the 75th minute. Haim
Revivo and Alon Mizrahi scored one each.
</P>
<P>
The results leave Israel with 10 points in five games, the same
as Austria which has played one more game. Spain topped the group
with 12 points from five games.
</P>
<P>
Israel's victory in what the local media called "the most
important soccer match in the past decade" almost certainly
ensured it a second-place in Group Six.
</P>
<P>
This would bring it a playoff chance to compete with other
seven second-place finishers for four spots in the 2000 European
Championship finals.
</P>
<P>
The only major success for Israel in the past came in 1970,
when it reached the World Cup finals in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the national team in 1992, Coach Shlomo
Scharf has led Israel in climbing about 100 places to stand at 32
nd in the FIFA rankings.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Hopes for Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- European and Commonwealth 400m
champion Iwan Thomas is hoping Britain's athletics selectors
recognize his achievements of last year when they consider the
team for the summer's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Thomas is suffering from a foot injury picked up during warm
weather training in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He has admitted he will not be ready to compete in the British
World Championship finals in Birmingham next month.
</P>
<P>
But he hopes to be able to compete with the world's best in
Seville, Spain on 20 August - provided the selectors keep a place
open for him.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been good news so far but I haven't ruled out
competing in the World Championships," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll definitely not be ready for the trials and at the moment
I don't think I will be running within the next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Many regard Thomas as the first Briton since Roger Black
capable of challenging the Americans at the one-lap event.

<HEADLINE> Greater Effort Promised to Promote NZ-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROTORUA, New Zealand, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand-China
Friendship Society held its annual meeting from June 4 to 6 in
Rotorua, a scenic city on New Zealand's North Island, pledging
greater efforts to promote friendship and mutual understanding
between the two peoples and friendly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
About 50 representatives including national and regional
leading members of the society took part in the three-day meeting.
They exchanged their work experience, discussed the future work
and elected a new leadership of the National Committee of the
society.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Chen Wenzhao made a special
trip to Rotorua and addressed the opening session. He spoke highly
of the work and achievements the friendship society had made since
it was established 42 years ago and expressed his thanks and
appreciation to a large number of devoted New Zealand friends.
</P>
<P>
Bill Willmott, who was re-elected national president of the
society at the annual meeting, said in an interview with Xinhua,
"The economic and political reforms continue to advance rapidly in
China, making its culture and society ever more attractive to New
Zealanders. In New Zealand, interest in China grows as our
relations become broader and more people experience China
first-hand or through contact with new immigrants."
</P>
<P>
"China is no longer beyond the orbit of most New Zealanders'
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting, Willmott said, have promised
to double their efforts in expanding membership and setting up new
branches. They will carry out various kinds of exchange activities
in the political, cultural and economic fields to further deepen
friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples and
two countries.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesians are going to polls
Monday morning in the first multi-party general election in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties are vying for 462 seats in the
500-seat House of Representatives (parliament), with the remaining
38 seats reserved for the Armed Forces whose members do not vote
in the election.
</P>
<P>
About 112 million voters, or 91 percent of the 128 eligible
voters, are expected to cast their ballots in 320,000 polling
stations across the tropical archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Legislature election is held every five years in the country,
but this year's general election is advanced from 2002 because
former president Soeharto stepped down in May last year amid the
country's worst political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's last general election was held in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Voting begins at 08:00 local time (0100 GMT) and will end at
14:00 (0700 GMT). The first batch of voting results may come out
around 15:00 (0800 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD Wins Regional Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua)--The Social Democratic Party, Germany's
ruling party lead by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Sunday won the
regional election of Bremen state.
</P>
<P>
According to partially counted ballots released by Germany's
ZDF television, the Social Democrats won about 43 per cent votes,
nearly 10 points more than last election 4 years ago.
</P>
<P>
SPD's regional chief Detlev Albers hailed the victory, saying,"
This is a spectacular growth of support."
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) also increased their share
of votes. It won 36.4 per cent according to projections, up from
32.5 per cent last time.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats were main opposition in Germany's
national political stage. But in Bremen, it was governing the tiny
state in a so-called "grand coalition" with SPD.
</P>
<P>
SPD leaders have expressed the willing to keep their alliance
with CDU for another 4-year term.
</P>
<P>
Another winner in the election is the ultra-Right German
People's Union (DVU), which got 5.8 per cent votes and was to hold
a seat in the state parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the DFU entered a state parliament.
The party already had legislators in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.
And in the state parliament of Baden-Wuerttemberg, there is
another ultra-Right party, the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Two losers in the election were the Greens and the Free
Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which shares power as junior partner in Bonn's
cabinet, barely won 8.8 per cent votes, down from 13.1 per cent in
1995. The Greens' loss in February's Hesse state election has
caused Schroeder lost the control over the Bundesrat, upper
chamber of Germany's federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
The liberals won only 2.6 per cent ballots, and remained
outside the Bremen state parliament. According to Germany's
election law, only a party with more than 5 per cent votes can
hold parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the FDP was pushed out of the sate parliament
with 3.6 per cent votes in state election.
