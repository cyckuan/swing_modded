<HEADLINE> Damming Continued on China's Second Longest River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China started to dam the
Yellow River this afternoon for construction of the Xiaolangdi
Water Control Project, China's second largest.
</P>
<P>
At 4:15 p.m., six trucks driving abreast on the river's
southern bank simultaneously dumped the first load of stones into
the river.
</P>
<P>
In Luoyang, an ancient city in central China's Henan Province,
where the project is located, the Yellow River was calmly flowing
east under a blue sky.
</P>
<P>
The river, which is well into the dry season, is ready for the
damming, with small discharge and a slow flow speed.
</P>
<P>
China has already completed more than 160 reservoirs on the
river, but Xiaolangdi will have the highest flood-prevention
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The damming operations will continue round-the-clock. Before 10
a.m. on October 28, the earth and stone dam stretching into the
river will completely block the 106-meter gap between it and the
northern bank, and will in turn force the Yellow river to run down
to the lower reaches through artificial water channels.
</P>
<P>
During a short but elaborate ceremony before the damming,
Massimo Malvagna, a damming project manager, told the Chinese side
that they were well-prepared for the damming.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting three years for this moment," he
said. "We will proceed toward the opposite bank with high
efficiency and will not disappoint the people concerned both in
China and abroad."
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, project manager of flood-discharge T. Krause
reported the smooth progress of the current separating work on the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is one of the most challenging projects of its kind
in the world, said Zhang Jiyao, vice-minister of water
resources. He attributed the ultimate success of the project to
the support of the central government and the State Council and
the joint efforts of the Chinese and foreigners involved in
the work.
</P>
<P>
The damming should be completed within 42 hours, according to
Li Qiyou, general engineer of the project.

Russia is expected to present the offer also to leaders of the
other two Baltic states.

Brazauskas said he will study the document, but Lithuania's
foreign policy priorities now remain unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: No Russian Missile Know-how to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Visisting Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here today that Russia has never
transferred missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign
Minister David levy, Primakov said the reported Russia's
involvement in Iran's missile buildup is groundless.
</P>
<P>
"Those reports are rumors and Russia did not involve itself in
helping Iran to build missiles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here today from Damascus on a two-day visit as
part of his Mideast tour to revive Russia's role as a co-sponsor
of the peace process. He had visited Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival, local reports said that Russian firms are
exporting missile propulsion systems to Iran, and its experts are
involved in Iranian attempts to acquire missiles capable of
striking Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted this
morning with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Levy and other
key cabinet ministers on this issue and decided to express
Israel's concern to Primakov on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that during his meeting with Levy he explained in
detail Russia's missile policy and asked Israel not to worry.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he was satisfied with Primakov's explanation that
Russia will implement a policy that will not endanger Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Middle East peace process, Primakov said Russia
supports a comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem and
is swilling to hold a round of Palestinian-Israeli Steering
Committee meeting to help speed up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov plans to meet with Netanyahu later today and
Mordechai tomorrow. He is also going to hold discussions with
officials of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in Ramallah
tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
THREE GORGES, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A battle to balance the
damming and the flow of the Yangtze River occured today in the
ongoing damming operation here, a senior engineer said.
</P>
<P>
"We expected the seesaw battle, and it can be completely
controlled," said Huang Huaping, deputy commander of the damming
operation.
</P>
<P>
As the dam was built out into the river, the river course grew
narrower, causing a mightier river flow. Sand and small stones
were washed away, but boulders remained on the riverbed, Huang
explained.
</P>
<P>
"The damming has entered its most difficult stage," Huang
said. "Although the extension of the dam is not yet visible on
the water surface, that does not mean there is no progress."
</P>
<P>
The battle will eventually subside as the work continues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The damming operation began at 8:45 a.m. (Beijing Time). By 11
p.m., the river flow width was reduced to less than 80 meters.

<HEADLINE> Construction Costs Escalate in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction costs continue to
escalate in Zimbabwe as shown by the rise in prices of building
materials.
</P>
<P>
It edged up 6.7 percentage points to 19.7 percent during the
12 months ended June this year, the Central Statistical Office
said today.
</P>
<P>
The largest change was in the cost of flooring material which
increased by 51.3 percent, followed by cement which spiraled 33.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The other large movement was in the cost of bricks which
jumped 27.4 percent while paint and glass, at 5.6 percent, had
the smallest increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (FINHOLD) said despite
fairly high construction activity during the first three quarters
of 1997, prospects for a turn-around in 1998 are likely to be
low.
</P>
<P>
The group attributed this to the fact that the commercial
sector takes its cue from general economic activity.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, as economic growth in 1998 is expected to be
relatively low due to the expected decline in output from the
agricultural and mining sectors, growth in construction is also
likely to be dampened as a number of construction projects are
likely to be stopped or delayed,'' FINHOLD said in its latest
economic update.

<P>
HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps today launched a malaria
awareness week in Chitungwize near Harare.
</P>
<P>
The minister said between four and five million Zimbabweans
live in malaria areas and are at risk of contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said malaria ranked as one of the six top killer diseases

Stamps added malaria was a public health problem in more than
90 countries, while 40 percent of the world's population was at
risk. Some 500 million clinical cases of malaria occurred every

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, British FMs Discuss EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides and his British counterpart Robin Cook today
discussed Cyprus' bid to join the European Union (EU) and the
role of the British EU Presidency, beginning January next year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two foreign ministers took place in
Edinburgh, Britain, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting, the Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told reporters he was satisfied with the meeting and
the British government "genuinely understands" issues of concern
to the Cypriot government, such as the Republic's EU accession
course and the need for a solution to the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion focused on the upcoming accession talks with
the EU and especially the British Presidency's role," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
EU accession talks with Cyprus are scheduled to begin early
next year, as the Cyprus Republic is among the first several
countries included in the EU enlargement framework.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Turkish Cypriot participation in the
accession talks, Kasoulides said he raised the issue during the
talks with Cook, and explained the parameters from which Cyprus
cannot transgress.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has proposed that Turkish Cypriots could
participate in the official delegation to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides stressed the talks should be carried out by the
government of the Republic and that the persons participating in
the delegation should back Cyprus' bid to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has said he will not
consider Cyprus' entry before Turkey joins the Union.
</P>
<P>
He has also said he will not participate in negotiations for a
settlement of the Cyprus problem unless the EU withholds Cyprus'
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides stressed that it is important for the Turkish side
to realize it cannot "trap itself" into positions which lead to a
deadlock and that unconditional negotiations for a settlement
should begin immediately after the presidential elections, due to
take place in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-led efforts to settle the Cyprus problem have been going
on for the past 23 years, since Turkey landed its troops and took
over 37 percent of the island following a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> GCC Official Expects Unified Tariff in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) said today that he expected a
unified GCC tariff in 1998 despite current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla Saleh al Khleifi, GCC's assistant secretary-general for
economic affairs, told reporters that a unified tax will pave
the way for the GCC states to create a common market and sign a
free trade pact with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at the end of a two-day GCC customs seminar
which concluded today in Dubai, the second largest city in the
United Arab Emirates, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
As part of a long-standing plan to create a common Gulf market,
the customs project has eluded the GCC states for more than a
decade due to differences on the level of the tariff.
</P>
<P>
It also prevented the Gulf countries from striking a free trade
pact with the EU, the GCC's main trading partner, which considers
a single GCC tariff as a prerequisite for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Custom duties in the GCC countries, which include the UAE,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, varied widely,
ranging from the lowest 4 percent to the highest 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich UAE imposes the lowest tariff in the 16-year-old
Gulf alliance although it has quadrupled duties on most imports to
four percent in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, which has little crude oil reserves, levies 20 percent
on the bulk of foreign imports. Its income heavily relies on taxes.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia also has a 20 percent duty on selective items to
protect its burgeoning national industries such as petrochemicals
and steel casting.
</P>
<P>
Though the GCC has classified some 95 percent of over 1,200
imported products for unified taxation, the classification of the
remaining vital ones such as steel and petrochemicals has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
GCC officials said that some countries fear the nascent
industries in the Gulf region might be swamped by foreign
competition if duties were lowered on these items.

ATHENS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today criticized Athens' Western allies for
applying double standards in the country's dispute with
neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki, Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece's major allies,
unable to contribute to respect for international law, had for 22
years restricted themselves to seeking from Athens a solution with
Turkey, even when Greek sovereign rights were in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Greece must provide a reply itself, he said, adding that an
economically strong Greece with powerful armed forces might
respond effectively and victoriously to any threat whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkish Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit also said that
if Turkey and Greece were left alone, they might come to agreement
and establish close cooperation.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Some residents and service
giving institutions in Addis Ababa complain that they endure
great hardship due to the dwindling water supply in the city,
Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The residents and institutions said they are unable to keep
personal hygiene and serve their customers properly owing to a
protracted disruption in the water supply," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some residents who interviewed with the news agency said, "the
supply of water which they need for cooking, washing, drinking
and medical treatment purposes has stopped for nearly two
months," adding that "they have appealed to the concerned
authorities for immediate solution, but to no avail so far."
</P>
<P>
"We are wasting our time and money traveling long distances in
search of water," they added.
</P>
<P>
Executive of the St. Gabriel General Hospital, Amare Beyene
told the news agency that his hospital is forced to buy 36,000
liters of water for about 140 U.S. Dollars following the
disruption in tap- water supply.
</P>
<P>
A hotel manager was quoted by the news agency as saying that
his hotel is losing its guests who could not be provided with
bathroom and shower services.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the water and sewerage authority have declined to
comment on the situation, Ethiopian news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa is a water-shortage city and the water supply is
only about two-thirds of the portable water demand, according to
an earlier announcement made by the city's water and sewerage
authority.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Syria Has key Role to Play in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeni Primakov said here today that Syria had a key and
principal role to play in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to Israel, the Russian foreign minister
said at a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq al-sharaa that though the Palestinian track is important,
the collapse of the Syria track will mean the undermining of the
whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he exchanged views with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad on a number of issues during their three-hour
meeting today. He described the talks as "important, useful and
fruitful."
</P>
<P>
The target of his Mideast tour is to bring about rapproachment
between Israel and Syria, he said, adding that "all that I can
confirm is President Assad's desire, in case bilateral
negotiations are resumed, to start from the point the negotiations
have been suspended, and on the basis of what has been achieved
with the previous Israeli governments rather than from a blank
sheet or from square one."
</P>
<P>
On the Russian-Syrian relations, Primakov said that they have
been based on the principle of equal rights and on Russia's
awareness of the prominent role undertaken by Syria in the
region. He expressed Russia's interest in working with Syria with
the object of achieving progress towards a peaceful settlement to
the Middle East problem.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived here Saturday from Beirut
and left for Israel later today. He will also visit Jordan, the
Palestinian self-rule territories and Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said here today that he had to postpone his scheduled
trip to Washington due to unclear instructions on peace talks
from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Levy announced the postponement to reporters after his meeting
with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that he scheduled to leave Israel for Washington
Saturday night for peace talks with Abu Mazen of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Monday, but could not go there before having clarified
policies of the government concerning the peace talks,
particularly the instructions from the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was glad that during today's inner cabinet
meeting the Prime Minister has accepted his idea of formulating
a guiding principle for conducting peace talks.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued after today's inner cabinet
meeting which as attended by Netanyahu, Levy and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said that Netanyahu agreed to hold another
inner cabinet meeting next Wednesday to further discuss this
issue.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu told the inner cabinet today that there will be
no changes about the Israel's policies towards the PNA, and no
lands will be handed over to the PNA until Israel security is
guaranteed, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also urged the PNA to make more efforts in fighting
terrorism, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Levy was not happy with Netanyahu recently, blaming the Prime
Minister for keeping him in the dark while making important
government decisions.
</P>
<P>
Levy's delay of visit to Washington might badly affect the
atmosphere of the Palestinian-Israeli talks and no new date has
been fixed so far for that talks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Channels Nile Water Flows to Irrigate Sinai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
pressed a button in the northern tip of the Suez Canal today
sending Nile water to the parched Sinai desert for the first time
in history.
</P>
<P>
This signals the completion of the first phase of a mammoth
canal project to conduit Nile water to irrigate Sinai in the hope
of creating dozens of communities in the peninsula which are
expected to attract 1.5 million residents.
</P>
<P>
The 242-kilometer Al Salam Canal, or Peace Canal, is designed
to add 620,000 feddans (260,400 hectares) of arable land in both
flanks of the Suez Canal, a strategic waterway linking the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The project is carried out in two phases, with the first taking
the water from the outlet of the Nile in Domietta to eastern bank
of the Suez Canal, and the second relaying the water for 155
kilometers to the coastal city of Al Arish in northern Sinai.
</P>
<P>
The first stage, which includes four 42-meter-deep ducts under
the Suez Canal, was completed after three years of construction.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will cost 5.7 billion pounds (about 1.7
billion dollars), mainly financed by Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, according to Mahmoud Abu Zeid, minister of
public works and water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president witnessed the water flowing to Sinai and
then drove to the pumping stations in the peninsula that will push
the water to areas that are planned be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Mubarak described the Peace Canal and
other giant projects being carried out in Egypt as a gift for the
future generations.
</P>
<P>
Another, even more ambitious project is the Toshka Canal in
southern Egypt, which is designed to channel Nile water from near
the Nasser Lake to soak the Western Desert into agricultural farms.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak dismissed speculations that the water pumped to Sinai
could be sent so far as to reach Israel or other countries, saying
the Egyptian project leaves no room for such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
With scarce rainfall, human existence in Egypt depends closely
on the Nile, the only source of fresh water, resulting in acute
concentration of nearly 98 percent of the population in the Nile
Valley, which accounts only 4 percent of the country's vast area.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Canal is part of the government's effort to ease
population pressure, expand cultivable land and build new
communities.

and restoring peace in Sudan.

for achieving peace and an end to the civil war in the country.
</P>

number of peace agreements with a number of smaller opposition
groups in south Sudan, but has so far failed to persuade the main

BAGHDAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) today approved several recommendations on Iraq's
relations with the United Nations, that might urge the government
to take a tougher stand.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said that the parliament submitted
the recommendations to the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, but
the agency declined to elaborate on the nature of the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the recommendations mainly deal with ties
with the Special Committee of the U.N. Security Council and Iraq's
attitude towards Council resolutions, particularly the recent
resolution 1134 threatening further sanctions in case of Iraq's
obstruction of the U.N. inspectors works.
</P>
<P>
The agency report adds that the Iraqi National Assembly has
requested that its recommendations be adopted and a related
official decree be issued.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the Assembly speaker Abdel-Karim al-Saadoun
as having said this evening the assembly recommendations reflect
the unity of stance on the part of Iraq's legislative and
executive powers. He called upon parliament members to pursue
their services to Iraq and to put an end to designs of the enemies
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had threatened to cease all kinds of cooperation with
the inspectors of the Security Council Special Committee in charge
of dismantling Iraq's banned arms, should the Council decide to
intensify its sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Promises Free Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government today
pledged that the upcoming Parliamentary elections would be free
and fair, despite repeated eruption of scandals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said that the Lower House
elections scheduled for November 4 would be "free, neutral and
transparent," Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
He invited local and foreign journalists to monitor the
election process to ensure "its neutrality and transparency."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament is made up of the Upper and Lower
houses. All the 40 Upper House members are appointed by the king
whereas elections are held for the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
So far, 548 people have registered as eligible candidates to
compete for the 80 seats in the Lower House, as against 559 in the
last elections in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, a major force in
Jordan's political arena holding 22 seats in the outgoing Lower
House, and nine other left-leaning opposition parties have
announced to boycott the elections in protest of the government's
tightened grip on press and publication.
</P>
<P>
Scandals have surfaced long before the elections unfold. Last
week, Toujan Feisal, Jordan's first woman parliamentary member
elected in 1993 and now a candidate for the coming elections,
accused the government of registering 9,000 people from the
military, security and intelligence services for the elections in
violation of the kingdom's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Hashem Sabbagh, a director general in Ministry of Interior, on
October 22 confirmed that forged voting cards have been
discovered, which led to two arrests and a further investigation
is now under way.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the pro-government National Constitutional Party,
Jordan's largest political party with the prime minister's brother
as secretary general, was found to have fielded secret candidates
- those who will expose their party affiliation after being
elected.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is ruled by the monarch King Hussein, and the
constitution. Political parties emerged in 1952 and were soon
banned. The prohibition was lifted in 1991 to allow the existence
of a multi-party system.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Primary and high-school teachers
walk off jobs today in Canada's largest province of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The strike came following the collapse of talks between
teachers' unions and the government Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Despite falling snows, teachers in this city set up picket
lines in front of many schools and vowed to fight the proposed
education reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
The teachers say the legislation would dramatically alter the
education system and allow the government to cut spending on the
system by about 667 million dollars (480 million USD).
</P>
<P>
The government insists that the reforms would make the system
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Unions representing Ontario's 126,000 teachers say the protest
could last at least a week.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.1 million students and 800,000 families would be
affected by the strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The five-year China Diabetes
Education Program, sponsored by Project HOPE, began here today.
</P>
<P>
The program, to be carried out in six major medical
universities and hospitals in China, aims to train at least 250
medical personnel in the field through training centers to be set
up in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
It will also teach the patients and their family members ways
to manage the disease.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Chen Minzhang attended the opening ceremony
held today.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Health will do its utmost to work together
with Project HOPE to carry out the program so as to control the
increase in the number of people who suffer from diabetes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Teaching both medical workers and the public about the
seriousness of the disease has been an urgent need," said Zhu
Xixing, member of the Chinese Diabetes Society.
</P>
<P>
He added that diabetes is no longer only a hereditary disease
in China. "It is most commonly caused by the changes in life
customs and diet brought by the country's economic development,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has about 20 million people
suffering from diabetes, three times the number 15 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Minister Calls for Control of Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister for
Population Welfare Abida Hussain stressed here today the role of
parliaments and parliamentarians in South Asia in dealing with the
issues of population and development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Conference of Speakers and
Parliamentarians from the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), Abida hoped the conference will play an
important role in translating the underlying concepts of SAARC
cooperation into reality.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which began here on Sunday, is expected to be
concluded on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abida said population control is no doubt an unpopular issue
but a strong political will is required to achieve the desired
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"We can learn a lot from the experiences of Bangladesh and Sri
Lanka who are successful in realizing the objectives," she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Rasheed Choudhury, speaker of the
Bangladesh National Assembly, said population and development are
subjects which need to be dealt with by a fundamental approach.
</P>
<P>
He said the population of SAARC countries could be contained
through education, information and motivation.
</P>
<P>
Choudhury noted that, through motivation, Bangladesh has been
able to bring the population growth rate down from 3.7 percent to
1.72 percent in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka
also spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions today, the delegates expressed the
belief that SAARC countries must fix their priorities, learn from
each other's experiences, cooperate with each other and formulate
national programs and strategies to improve their people's health,
sanitation, nutrition and quality of life.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Revitalizing Light Industry in Collective Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that light industrial enterprises in the collective
ownership should adapt themselves more adequately to the market
economy by deepening reforms and strengthening management.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with representatives from collective enterprises
in the light industry attending a national conference in Beijing,
Zhu, also standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that those firms
constitute an important part of the national economy. They
played a significant role in the past and will play a bigger role
in the process of the country's modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, some of the enterprises are mired in financial
difficulties, for they cannot adequately keep up with the changes
in the market, Zhu said. "However, we should have the confidence
to overcome the difficulties."
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful operation of collective enterprises in
the light industry, Zhu noted that there must be a real separation
of government administration and enterprise management, and
governments at all levels need to reduce the burdens of the
enterprises, which should strive to be oriented to the market.
</P>
<P>
With solid work done in line with the policy set by the party
central committee, the collective enterprises in the light
industry will undoubtedly break away from the difficulties in
three years, thus achieving revitalization of the entire industry,
Zhu said.

BONN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- French scientist Philippe J.
Sansonetti was today in Bonn granted one of world's top medicine
awards, the 100,000 mark (57,000 U.S. dollar) Robert Koch Prize,

<HEADLINE> Gap at Three Gorges Dam Narrowed To 40 Meters, Success Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THREE GORGES, October 27 (Xinhua) -- With the gap of the Three
Gorges dam narrowed to 40 meters this morning, the most difficult
phase of the damming of the Yangtze River was finished.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the site of the damming project, Lu Youmei,
general manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation (CTGPC), said: "The success of the damming
of the river is guaranteed by now."
</P>
<P>
The final phase of the damming began at 8 a.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Huacai, deputy chief of the project
headquarters, the plan was to first narrow the gap between the two
sides of the river to 40 meters, then continue till the opening
was completely filled in with stone.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the 40-meter goal was the trickiest part of the
entire project, because the damming work had to be done along the
main course of the Yangtze River, which is 26 meters deep and has
a flow speed of 4.4 meters per second. The highest water drop at
the gap is 0.8 meters.
</P>
<P>
The damming was stopped at one point yesterday and the gap was
widened to accommodate the powerful water flow. The opening was
finally reduced to 40 meters at 7 a.m., using 150,000 cubic meters
of stone.
</P>
<P>
The gap is to be completely closed on November 8.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Help Indonesia Overcome Monetary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that it
will provide Indonesia with financial aid to help it overcome the
monetary crisis that has hit the Southeast Asian region recently.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told
the press after meeting with Indonesian President Soeharto here
that his country has yet to decide on the exact amount of the aid
for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Early estimates put the amount to 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, said he will meet with his
Indonesian counterpart, Mar'ie Muhammad, to decide on the exact
amount of the aid.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Indonesia had something to do with the
monetary crisis occurring in some Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) member countries, including Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, along with other regional currencies,
have been under speculative attacks since the devaluation of the
Thai baht in July. The rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent
against the dollar since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, the Indonesian government decided to seek
long-term loans from international bodies including the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian officials and an IMF team are negotiating on the
financial aid package.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Japan also pledged last week to help handle
Indonesia's monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Anwar expressed his confidence over Indonesia's strong economic
foundation and said he believes that some measures taken by the
Indonesian government could solve the monetary turmoil.

<P>
TOKYO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today welcomed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
the United States, saying that it will contribute to the stability
of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to meet in
Washington to exchange views on Sino-U.S. relations, the
international situation and other major issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told reporters that sound Japan-U.S., Japan-China and
Sino-U.S. ties are conducive to the development of the region.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of improving
Sino-U.S. relations in the process of developing stronger ties
between the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin arrived in Honolulu Sunday morning, the first
stop on his nine-day state visit to the United States. His visit
is the first to the U.S. by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
On Japan-U.S. ties, Hashimoto commented that "relations have
some individual problems but are stable."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seen to Suffer Shortfall of Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
experience a big shortfall of some 19,000 metric tons of rubber by
the year 2005 unless immediate measures are taken to revive the
downstream rubber industry, the Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest data released by the National Rubber
Congress, the report said a supply shortfall of rubber will be
inevitable by the year 2005 if the industry's production continues
to decline at a 5-percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, whose rubber industry has been at a standstill
since 10 years ago, has only 92,000 hectares of rubber plantation,
which produce about 66,000 metric tons of dry rubber content
annually, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country will have to expand its rubber areas by 7,000 to
19,000 hectares by 2005 to cover the projected shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Basilisa Ho, president of the Philippine Rubber Industry
Association, was quoted as saying that while local rubber
consumption is on the upswing, local rubber production is dropping
significantly as a result of rising number of senile rubber trees.
</P>
<P>
Because most rubber trees have become senile, about 40 percent
of the 92,000-hectare rubber areas have already been unproductive,
according to Ho.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture has taken measures to save the
ailing rubber industry by encouraging the planting of rubber trees
and creating a fund to finance the rehabilitation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department is negotiating with the Asian
Development Bank for a possible loan of 300 million U.S. dollars
to revive the rubber industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Community groups from three
continents will participate in a pioneering initiative to fight
the spread of HIV/AIDS in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The new global initiative, the "Community Lessons, Global
Learning" program, was launched today by the International
HIV/AIDS Alliance at the Fourth International Congress on AIDS in
Asia and the Pacific being held here.
</P>
<P>
The program will help groups from different countries to learn
through a systematic approach about each other's expertise in
reducing the number of new HIV infections and improving the care
of people living with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
HIV is the human immuno-deficiency virus that can cause AIDS,
acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome. It can be transmitted through
sexual contact, drug use by injection and blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
The three-year program will center around a series of direct,
intensive country and regional training seminars, bringing
together local groups and experts.
</P>
<P>
The program will initially involve community-based
organizations from six countries -- Bangladesh, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Ecuador, Senegal and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
These countries were chosen because they have a potential
dramatic increase in the number of HIV infections and have
relatively underdeveloped community-based care and prevention
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the program's activities will be widely disseminated
to community groups, international agencies and funding
organizations to help develop integrated and community-centered
approaches to the global response to HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The International HIV/AIDS Alliance, a non-governmental
organization, was established in December 1993 to support
community action on HIV and AIDS in developing countries, which
have been hardest hit by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 21 million people worldwide estimated to be living
with HIV or AIDS in 1996, nearly 19 million were in developing
countries, according to figures released by the World Health
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Trade Chamber Boycotts Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain's Chamber of Trade
and Industry today decided to boycott the fourth Middle East and
North Africa economic conference to be held in the Qatari capital
Doha next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bahraini News Agency, the chamber rejected a
call for its participation, in protest of Israel's hardline
policies in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel "remains thwarting the peace process, occupying Arab
lands and practicing plans of expanding settlement in Arab
lands," the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
It has boycotted all the previous three conferences held in
Casablanca in Morocco, Amman in Jordan and Cairo in Egypt due to
Israel's presence.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini government has not announced its stand so far, but
observers here said that considering its territorial disputes with
Qatar, it would most likely follow some of the other Arab states
in boycotting the Doha conference.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authority, the UAE and
Saudi Arabia have refused to attend the meeting which is
traditionally participated by Arab states, Israel and their major
partners from the world over.
</P>
<P>
The conference has been lowered from a summit to a ministerial
level representation due to most Arab countries' outcry over
Israel's intransigence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qatar had sent invitations to 92 countries and the Foreign
Ministry said last week that more than 50 countries have signed up
their participation.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Urges Muslim World to Get Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today urged the Muslim world to use their resources for
the acquisition of knowledge, enhancement of literacy and
promotion of science and technology to meet the global
competition.
</P>
<P>
"We will be standing nowhere without acquisition of such
knowledge and fast advancement in the field of science and
technology. Although we still stand nowhere but we have the
potential to come up to the world competition," Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in Karachi at a meeting jointly
organized by the Islamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the
Federation of Pakistani Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Board of Investment.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is attended by representatives from 56
Muslim Countries.
</P>
<P>
The president called upon the Islamic countries to invest their
resources for the achievement of the cherished objective instead
of having to depend on the West.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will change unless we take appropriate steps
individually and collectively to fill the widening gap of
technology between us and the developed countries," said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
This underlines the urgent need to increase resource allocation
to acquire and apply modern technology and attain a higher level
of mutual cooperation in this vital field, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Muslim world accounts for about one-fourth of
the world population, occupies one-fifth of the globe and have
roughly one-third of the world's total economic resources.
</P>
<P>
Much of these resources flow to the West and directly
contribute to the overall advancement of the developed countries,
he observed.
</P>
<P>
Leghari underscored the urgent need for economic cooperation
among the Muslim countries which, he said, have common historical,
religious and cultural heritage and are bound by brotherly ties.

<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A medical team sponsored by the
Red Cross Society of China has enabled 508 cataract patients in
the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China to regain their
sight.
</P>
<P>
The team returned to Beijing a few days ago at the conclusion
of a 40-day, six-county medical tour of Tibet. Their return was
celebrated at a ceremony today
</P>
<P>
During the period, doctors from medical institutions in Beijing
and Harbin also treated more than 1,500 people suffering from
other eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors, high altitude, strong sunlight and
the lack of oxygen and vegetables are the causes of the large
number of cataract patients in Tibet. The incidence rate in some
areas is as high as 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are at least 50,000 Tibetans
suffering from cataracts who need treatment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mandela to Brief Gaddafi of Commonwealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will visit Libya again tomorrow to brief Muammar
Gaddafi on Commonwealth leaders attitudes over Lockerbie dispute.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the decision here today, South African government
officials said that Mandela, during his forthcoming visit to
Libya, the second in six days, will give Libyan leader Gaddafi an
official decoration and report back on attitudes of Commonwealth
leaders to sanctions against the north African country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who now is in Edinburgh, Scotland, attending a
Commonwealth summit which will end later today, visited Libya
five days ago and discussed with Gaddafi the possible resolutions
for the Lockerbie dispute.
</P>
<P>
The officials said when Mandela is returning to Libya, he has
no plans to make any major announcement on ending the deadlock
over the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
They dismissed a report that Mandela, who discussed the issue
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair yesterday, would be making
such an announcement in Tripoli, capital of Libya.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader has been trying to help mediate an
end to the four-year stand-off between Libya on the one hand, and
the United States and Britain on the other, over the 1988 bombing
of a Pan-Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in which
270 people died.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi is resisting British and U.S. demands that two Libyan
suspects in the bombing be handed over for trial in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman said yesterday the idea of a second visit
to Libya arose out of the first, adding that the president would
have a brief meeting with Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela supports positions of the Organization of African
Unity and the Arab League, both of which said the suspects should
be handed over to a neutral country for trial.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli wants the two to be tried in a neutral court, a demand
rejected by both London and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who last week hailed Gaddafi as "my fried" who
supported the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, has
backed Libyan demands and urged the United Nations sanctions to
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought it is correct for any country to be
complainant, prosecutor and judge," he told a press conference at
the Commonwealth summit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the families of the Lockerbie victims said
yesterday South Africa would be acceptable as a neutral venue for
the trial of the two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
But Blair had rejected again the option of a neutral venue at
the meeting with Mandela, his spokesman Alistair Cambpell told
the press. The two Libyan nationals would receive a fair trial in
Scotland, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An official British statement issued in Edinburgh yesterday
said that Blair had been hoping to outline an alternative plan
which could win Mandela's support.

<HEADLINE> Bank Sees Bright Economic Prospects for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) has envisioned bright prospects for the country's economic
growth in 1997-98 and called for pursuit of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies to achieve economic targets.
</P>
<P>
In an overview for 1997-98 in its annual report published
today, the SBP said prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
reinforced by a flexible exchange rate policy, will remain the key
to moderation of inflation and improvement in the balance of
payments in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The bank maintained that the pursuit of these policies is
required not only to improve market confidence and attract foreign
direct investment, but also to continue and accelerate the
momentum of economic growth within the framework of relative
financial stability and balance of payments viability.
</P>
<P>
The target for real economic growth is fixed at 6 percent while
inflation is expected to be moderated to 9 percent and the current
account deficit reduced to 5.3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Savings are expected to increase from 11.8 percent to 13.5
percent of the GDP and exports and imports to grow by 15 percent
and 5 percent respectively, the bank report said.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, budget deficit is to decline to 5 percent
of the GDP while government borrowings for budgetary support are
to be below 58 billion rupees (about 1.32 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The domestic credit is expected to go up by no more than 13.5
percent after meeting the genuine private sector credit
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Bank borrowings for budgetary support so far are within the
target, domestic credit expansion is under control and interest
rates are falling.
</P>
<P>
The report said a modest export growth coupled with slowdown in
imports and increased remittances inflows have narrowed the
current account deficit in the first quarter and the recent
exchange rate adjustment will reinforce the trend.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary data of the SBP indicate that prospects of
agricultural growth are good and industry recovery seems to be
under way.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

a necklace of Hawaiian flowers at Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton will announce on Monday that the Federal
budget deficit has fallen to $2.6 billion, its lowest level in
decades, largely as a result of strong economic growth that has
created a surge in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin arrived in the United States on
Sunday to launch a week-long visit that includes a Washington
summit meant to highlight what he called a "new Stage" in

</P>
<P>

keeping oil prices surprisingly firm. Even though economic
activity in Asia has flagged in recent months, an unusually
hearty appetite from major energy-guzzling nations has helped
prop up world crude oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Sudan Peace Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sudan peace negotiations,
set for tomorrow here under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental
Authority of Development (IGAD), have been postponed to October 29,
a Kenyan Foreign Ministry official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was due to the current absence of Kenyan
Foreign Minister Kolonzo Musyoka, who is now attending the
Commonwealth meeting in Scotland and will come back as early as
Wednesday morning, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace talks are surely to be held on Wednesday
and representatives from the warring sides in Sudan, as well as
foreign ministers from IGAD member states are coming, he
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka is expected to preside over the IGAD ministerial
meeting just before the talks between the Sudanese warring
parties. Kenya now chairs even-member IGAD, a regional forum also
comprising Uganda, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Commander Salve Kiir, chief of staff of Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) will lead the rebel team and
Foreign Minister Hussein abu Saleh will head the Khartoum
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The set talks will be successful as long as it can start
rounds of talks in the near future for finding solutions to the
14-year-old civil war in Sudan, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Nobody can end Africa's most protracted conflicts in the
continent's largest country with one round of talks, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and made
tens of thousands displaced in Sudan since 1983 when the SPLA
rose to fight against Islamic-back Khartoum power for a secular
state and more autonomy in the Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation on
anti-drought and economic development among the member countries.
Regional political affairs have been on its agenda since 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Flow of Yangtze River Reduced to 40 Meters at Damming Section </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THREE GORGES, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The most difficult stage
of the damming of the Yangtze River at Three Gorges has been
completed successfully, with river flow being reduced to less than
40 meters by 7 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The damming operation began at 8:45 a.m. Sunday, with the
primary objective to reduce the river flow from 130 meters to 40
meters.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation experts around the world say that to
decrease the flow from 90 meters to 60 meters is the toughest and
most critical part of the task of damming the longest river in
China.
</P>
<P>
As the dam was built out into the river, the river course grew
narrower, causing a mightier water flow. Both the left and right
sides of the dam progressed steadily out into the river as Sunday
wore on.
</P>
<P>
"We had expected the seesaw battle," said Huang Huaping, deputy
commander of the damming operation, referring to the ongoing
attempt to maintain a workable balance between construction and
water flow regulation. He noted that the damming would enter its
most difficult stage overnight.
</P>
<P>
A total of 127 large dump trucks were hauling stone at the
damming site, and boulders as large as four to five meters in
diameter were dumped into the river.
</P>
<P>
Following about 23 hours of strenuous work, the river flow was
finally reduced to 40 meters by 7 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
"We have full assurance in the success of completely damming
the river on November 8," said Lu Youmei, general manager of the
Yangtze River Three Gorges Development Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Meets Indonesian Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, said today that China will work to
strengthen the long-term cooperation with Indonesia in economy,
trade, science and technology for common development.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a meeting today with Bacharudin Jusuf
Habibie, Indonesia's state minister for research and technology.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China and Indonesia have a long history of
bilateral trade and, after the resumption of bilateral diplomatic
ties, Sino-Indonesian trade has shown rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume reached 3.7 billion U.S. dollars last
year, she said, and the figure for the first eight months of this
year has amounted to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars. Indonesia has
become China's second largest trade partner in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral trade volume does not match bilateral
friendship and their national strengths, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the two economies are complementary to a certain
extent, saying that the two sides should carry out diversified
cooperation in various fields in the future.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said that exchanges between Indonesia and China date
back to ancient times, and bilateral trade is on the rise in
recent years although it accounts for only a small proportion of
Indonesia's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to China is aimed at promoting long-term,
planned bilateral cooperation of mutual benefit, with a particular
view to furthering information exchanges and technological
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Businessmen Blame Problems on Taxes and Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian entrepreneurs are
accusing the Ukrainian government of treating small businesses
unfairly, the local media reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Instead of nurturing private enterprise, government
officials more often suffocate business people with regulations
and excessive taxes, said Alexander Khriakov, executive director
of the Small Business Union.
</P>
<P>
The union was established earlier this year to provide legal
and social support to small businessmen. The union is currently
drafting pro-business legislation. The union also appeals to state
authorities on behalf of businessmen who claim they have been
treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the union say taxes remain a crippling force for
independent entrepreneurs, who pay 87 percent or more of their
income to the state. Businesses involved in imports and exports
are often required to pay up to 120 percent of their income to the
state due to high customs duties.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen also claim that some regulations are designed only
for the purpose of collecting fines.
</P>
<P>
These taxes and regulations are often directly responsible for
ruining many small businesses, warned union lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Prospects of Hong Kong Stock Market to Remain Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite temporary financial
turbulence, Hong Kong's stock market is sure to rebound and its
prospects will stay bright, experts here said today.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the economy in Hong Kong has stayed strong
and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) is capable of bringing the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index, the key indicator of Hong Kong's blue
chips, stood at 11,144.34 points last Friday, a strong comeback
with a rise of 718.04 points after the four-day fall from October
20 to 23.
</P>
<P>
The soar was attributed directly to the local government's use
of its abundant foreign currency reserve to defend the Hong Kong
dollar. The reserve, registering 88.1 billion U.S. dollars by the
end of September, ranked third worldwide next to Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
The experts also pointed out that in addition to the measures
taken by the SAR government, Hong Kong's strong economy will also
contribute to the stability of stock market, with most of the
listed companies in Hong Kong enjoying double-digit profits on
average.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary of the SAR, Donald Tsang, pointed out that
the recent fluctuation on the Hong Kong stock market was caused by
the profiteering activities of some international speculators.
</P>
<P>
"I believe very strongly in defending our dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the SAR has witnessed steady growth after July
1, and it remains fundamentally prosperous, he said.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa said: "I believe the
fluctuation on the stock market will be short-lived."

<HEADLINE> WTO: No "Global" Trading System Without Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero said here today that the
world can never have a truly "global" trading system with the full
integration of the least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero was speaking at the opening session of an inter-agency
meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least Developed Countries'
(LDCs) Trade Development.
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormously important meeting," Ruggiero told
participants from WTO members and representatives and ministers
from 39 LDCs, present at the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
He called on the participants to produce meaningful results,
results that will be of real and practical significance to the
LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was jointly sponsored by WTO, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the
International Trade Center (ITC), a joint subsidiary of UNCTAD and
WTO, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Participants will have a series of roundtable sessions during
the meeting. The secretariats of the six agencies taking part in
the meeting will offer assistance in their respective areas of
expertise to the 12 LDCs for which roundtable sessions have been
organized.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, WTO members will have a chance to announce
steps they are taking to enhance their market access for imports
for LDCs.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Recommends Freezing Iraq's Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
(Parliament) has recommended that the government freeze Iraq's
relationship with the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM), Iraq New
Agency (INA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Several other similar recommendations for a tougher stand in
relations with the U.N. were made in the parliament for the last
few days and have been submitted to the Revolution Command
Council, Iraq's main decision-making body, according to the INA.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM was set up to monitor the program of getting rid of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But it has complained of a
lack of cooperation from the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations came after the U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution last Thursday on imposing more sanctions on
Iraq if no full cooperation is in place.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, Iraq must prove that it has destroyed
all its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. sanctions
imposed after the 1991 Gulf War can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charges of non-cooperation, parliament members said
relations with the UNSCOM should be frozen until Iraq's
cooperation efforts are recognized.
</P>
<P>
The INA report said the parliament demands the government's
briefing on measures taken in regard of Iraq-U.N. relations.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also agreed that the situation should be
explained to Arab and foreign parliaments to get support.

MAPUTO, October 27 (Xinhua) --Mozambique's Inflation in the
six months this year registered 3.2 percent, an eight percentage
lower than it has been targeted by the government, local paper

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice FM on 5th Sino-Russian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin will pay a
state visit to China next month, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
Zhang Deguang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the coming fifth Sino-Russian summit have been
completed, Zhang said. During Yeltsin's visit, he said, the two
sides will issue a joint statement and sign several agreements on
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state will summarize experiences and
achievements of the development of bilateral relations, and confer
on major international issues and the promotion of all-round
development of Sino-Russian strategic partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since President Jiang's visit to Russia in April, the two
countries have seen a smooth development of cooperation in all
realms, including international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regular meeting system between heads of state, prime
ministers and foreign ministers of the two countries has played an
important role in promoting the development of bilateral ties, the
vice foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
In June of this year, Russia's Prime Minister visited China and
held the second regular meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng, he
said, adding that special committees under the commission of
Sino-Russian regular meetings have conducted a series of meetings
to discuss specific cooperative projects in economy, trade and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
The vice foreign minister disclosed that during Yeltsin's
coming visit, the two sides will make an announcement on the
breakthrough made in eastern Sino-Russian border survey.
</P>
<P>
The two chairmen of the Sino-Russian Friendship Committee for
Peace and Development held working talks in Moscow recently to
prepare for the committee's first session to be held during the
summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Sino-Russian summit will further strengthen bilateral
ties and produce a positive impact on the current world situation
and international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian strategic partnership, oriented toward the
21st century on the basis of equality, mutual respect and trust,
will abide by the generally recognized principles governing
international relations and march on the path set by the two
sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is not only in the fundamental interests of the two

<HEADLINE> China Trains 21st 21st Century Science and Technology Elites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out an
ambitious project to train an elite group of experts who can
contribute to the country's science and technology development in
the 21st century, said Xu Songtao, vice minister of the Ministry
of Personnel, at today's forum on talent training in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that 683 sci-tech personnel, all under 45, have passed
a nationwide selection process to enter the project, jointly
initiated two years ago by his ministry and six other state
departments.
</P>
<P>
The six others include the State Science and Technology
Commission, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of
Finance, the State Planning Commission, the China Science and
Technology Association and the China National Nature Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The project, included in the national plan for science and
technology development, aims to attract a number of outstanding
scientists with worldwide prestige by the end of this century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to prepare a group of academic and technical
researchers who can lead the country in their own fields for the
coming century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The project is still in its initial stage, and the key work we
are to do is to take certain measures to foster the talents
chosen, and create conditions needed for their research work," Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
The talents chosen are given preferential treatment for
academic or scientific research funds, acquisition of professional
titles, job changes and living conditions. Statistics show that
more than 60 million yuan (about 7 million U.S. dollars) has
been devoted to the project.
</P>
<P>
The seven departments will continue the once-a-year selection
process for two more years, and introduce a competitive mechanism
into the management of those people who are chosen, while
eliminating those no longer qualified for the project.
</P>
<P>
Three sub-forums, including the science of agriculture,
high-technology and the geosciences, have been set up. The forums
provide a place for academic exchanges and opportunities and to
explain one's thoughts. Xu said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Combat Indecent Materials on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government and
the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers Association (HKISPA)
jointly announced today their measure to combat indecent and
obscene materials transmitted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference jointly held by the government's
Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) and the
HKISPA, the HKISPA made public a Code of Practice and Practice
Statement to regulate the problem of obscene and indecent
materials transmitted through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the government's initiatives to address the
community's concern over the accessibility of indecent and obscene
 articles on the Internet by children and young persons, TELA
Commissioner Eddy Chan told the conference.
</P>
<P>
The code provides detailed guidelines and procedures in dealing
with complaints relating to the transmission of obscene and
indecent materials through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The code requires that the members of the HKISPA should take
reasonable steps to prevent users of their services from placing
or transmitting through the Internet materials likely to be
classified as Class III (obscene) under the Control of Obscene and
 Indecent Articles Ordinance of the government.
</P>
<P>
It also requires ISPA members to advise content providers and
distributors to provide warning notices to materials likely to be
classified as Class II (indecent) under the Control of Obscene and
Indecent Articles Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Subscribers will be informed that such materials should not be
made available to young persons under age 18.
</P>
<P>
Upon receipt of a complaint, an Information Service Provider
(ISP) will look into it and ascertain the problem. If obscene
materials are published, the ISP will block the web site concerned
 so that other subscribers would not be disturbed by the offending
 site.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep in view the implementation and effectiveness of
the code with the HKISPA and review it in a year's time," Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the code is the result of many months of hard work
 by the government and the HKISPA. The adoption of this
self-regulatory code of practice and practice statement achieves
the balance of maintaining the free flow of information on the one
 hand and safeguarding the interests of the young people on the
other.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ng, chairman of the HKISPA, said that all the members of
 the association agree that they have an important social
responsibility to fulfill. The HKISPA has 40 members whose
services cover some 95 percent of the Internet market in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the promulgation of the code, the TELA has
launched a series of publicity and public education programs,
leaflets and a list of filtering software to help parents exercise
 guidance.
</P>
<P>
These publicity leaflets have been distributed to the Internet
users through the Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department has also issued guidelines to schools
on the proper use of the Internet. A list of filtering software is
posted on the home pages of TELA, the Education Department and the
HKISPA in a concerted effort.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail Jiang Zemin's U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Local newspapers hailed
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States
as a major event in Sino-American ties, with far-reaching
significance for bilateral and international relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which began on Sunday, is the first by a Chinese
head of state to the U.S. in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in an editorial today that Sino-American
relations are the most important international relations in the
world today.
</P>
<P>
Bilaterally, it is in the interests of China and the United
States to maintain a friendly and mutually beneficial relationship
and to promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two
countries, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Sin-American relations play a key role in
maintaining security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
And politically, as permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China and the United States have an important
responsibility for promoting world peace and development, the
newspaper commented.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao commented in an editorial that the forthcoming
summit between the heads of state of China and the U.S. will be a
new milestone in the history of Sino-American relations and will
further promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that China is the largest developing country
while the U.S. is the largest developed country in the
world. Sino-American relations are of key importance as they
relate to the vital interests of the Chinese and American peoples
as well as world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, China and the U.S. share an
important responsibility for the solution of such pressing world
issues as environment and ecological balance, population and food,
terrorism and drug trafficking. The two countries are capable of
making further contributions to finding solutions for such issues,
the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Volcano Erupts for 660 days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Karymskoye volcano,
located at the country's eastern Kamchatskiy peninsula, has been
spewing out fire and lava for 660 days and nights, Itar-Tass news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1996 when the Karymskoye first erupted, the
volcanic ash column reached as high as 2,500 meters. On the
following day, the lava spewing out from the bottom of Karymskoye
lake killed almost all lives in the lake, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the volcano erupted about 70 times every day and
night, with the gushing lava flew as far as five kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the volcanic ash scattered the surrounding area
within a radius of 10-20 kilometers, and the volcanic smog floated
400 kilometers away to the sky over the Pacific Ocean, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Bank Issues Floating Rate Certificates of Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank today signed
its inaugural issue of 4-billion-HK dollar (513 million U.S.
dollars) Floating Rate Certificates of Deposit (FRCDs), under a
ten-year 30-billion-HK dollar (3.8 billion U.S. dollars) issuance
program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 prestigious financial institutions from nine
countries participated in the signing.
</P>
<P>
The three-year inaugural issue was oversubscribed by more than
50 percent and as a result was expanded from the originally
underwritten amount of 3 billion HK dollars (385 million
U.S. dollars) to 4 billion HK dollars (513 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The issue is the third-largest Hong Kong dollar FRCDs offering
in Hong Kong and the largest offering by Hang Seng Bank. Hang Seng
 Bank and HSBC Markets are the joint arrangers.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Alexander S. K. Au, vice chairman and
chief executive of the Bank, said: "We are very gratified by the
favorable market response, which signifies substantial investor
confidence and the quality of the bank's credit standing."
</P>
<P>
The issue has been assigned a rating of A2 by Moody's Investors
Service. It is also the bank's first FRCDs issue to be recognized
as eligible collateral for the Liquidity Adjustment Facility
operated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
The FRCDs, which mature in the year 2000, will be issued on
November 5. They will bear a coupon rate of 22.5 basis points per
annum above the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate
(HIBOR). This is 7.5 basis points less than the rate of the
2.1-billion-HK dollar (269 million U.S. dollars) FRCDs issue which
 was launched by the bank in 1994 and expired in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Au said that the ten-year Certificate of Deposit program has
been established "as part of the bank's long-term strategy to
enhance asset and liability management". "Hang Seng's operations
have always been guided by its prudent financial management. This
includes the maintenance of strong capital and liquidity, a
prudent lending policy and strict expense discipline," Au
added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's trade deficit has been
reduced by 40.5 percent in the first 10 months of this year, local
press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit fell by more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars to 2.071
billion dollars by October. The trade deficit of the first 10
months last year was more than 3.482 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's General Department of Statistics (GDS) attributed the
drop to an increase in exports and restrictions on imports of
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, Vietnam earned more than
7.064 billion dollars from exports, an increase of 20.1 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam spent 9.14 billion dollars on imports, a
drop of 2.4 percent, according to the GDS.
</P>
<P>
However, the export of Vietnam's two traditional items -- coal
and ground nuts -- dropped by three and 38 percent, respectively,
said the GDS.

<HEADLINE> Damming of Yangtze River Approaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- In 12 days the Yangtze River
will be blocked, a key step in the birth of the world's largest
water conservation project.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a trip from downtown Yichang took two or three
hours to the Three Gorges construction site. Now a 28-kilometer
special highway has reduced that time to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
At the construction site, muddy paths have been replaced by
cement streets with buildings such as offices and hotels on either
side.
</P>
<P>
The structure and shape of the Xiling Yangtze River Bridge,
which connects the southern and northern parts of the project, are
similar to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
At the southern end of the bridge are 2,000 cement pyramids
weighing 21 tons each which will be used to stabilize the dam when
peak flooding occurs, said Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of
the China Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
Stones used to block the river are piled on two temporary dams
connected to a wall built on the Zhongbao Island. To the south of
the wall runs a diversion channel 3,700 meters long and 300 meters
wide for navigation.
</P>
<P>
Providing Three Gorges with material is the Gezhouba Group,
which has prepared 60,000 cubic meters of stones with a diameter
of 0.5 to 1 meter each, and 30,000 cubic meters of those with a
diameter of 1 to 1.2 meters each, according to Huang Huaping
deputy general director of the Gezhouba dam headquarters.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 forklift trucks and bulldozers are converging on
the river's mouth from the four dikes of the temporary dams.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8 the river's mouth will be narrowed to about 50 meters
wide, Wang said, and the river will be blocked in seven or eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
Excavators and drilling machines are pounding the granite
mountain that faces the Yangtze River to build a permanent ship
lock.
</P>
<P>
Two 100-meter deep valleys have been dug into the mountain.
</P>
<P>
One valley will act as the shaft for the largest ship elevator
in the world when it is completed in 2003. The 40-story high
elevator will be able to raise ships of 10,000-tons and larger
more than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
The other valley will be used as a five-level shaft, raising
and lowering ships by stages.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Macao Drop 12.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists coming to
Macao during the first eight months of the year dropped 12.3
percent from the same period last year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that the tourist arrivals between January and August were
4,843,560, down 12. 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals plummeted for the past several months from the
second quarter when a rising crime rate around casino profits,
among other factors, kept tourists from coming.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of tourists from Taiwan increased 35.8
percent, those from Japan dropped by 29.4 percent, from Hong Kong
by 18.3 percent, from the Republic of Korea by 13.3 percent, from
Australia by 13.1 percent and from Southeast Asia by 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the latest move to woo tourists back to Macao, the
government tourist office has decided to invite foreign media to
Macao to give "positive" news coverage of the territory. It also
promotes Macao as a "safe travel destination" and "a city with
unique culture."
</P>
<P>
A pillar industry in the city of 420,000, tourism and casinos
contribute to about half of the government's revenue. Tourist
arrivals topped 8.15 million last year.

<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone executed 10 people at the weekend by firing squad
after they were alleged found guilty of crimes ranging from
murder to looting.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted a military official as
saying that the execution was to send a signal to the unruly
soldiers and to reassure the civilian population of their
allegiance to the peace accord signed last Thursday with west
African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the military junta which seized
power in the May 25 coup this year will hand over power to the
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on April 22 next year.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that it is a major task of the military junta
to keep social order during the six-month transition period when
the sanctions imposed by the United Nations and west African
countries remain effective.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have resulted in shortage of food items, fuel
and other daily necessities in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
With a ceasefire and improvement of security, aid agencies are
expected to return to the troubled country and humanitarian
materials be sent there soon.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations Urged to Push HIV Vaccine Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Nations in the Asia-Pacific
region were urged today to commit themselves to rapid HIV (human
immuno-deficiency virus) vaccine development in order to halt the
lethal HIV epidemic, a growing threat to the populous region.
</P>
<P>
The call was voiced by experts from the International AIDS
Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) attending the five-day 4th International
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, which opened here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution to the AIDS pandemic -- for Asia and the
world -- is a vaccine," Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the IAVI,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"With 8,000 to 10,000 people being infected worldwide every
day, any delay in vaccine development is not an option," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an Asian issue to press the development of vaccines
forward, including potentially manufacturing and testing candidate
vaccines that may only be suitable for use in Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Berkley said it is a great tragedy that no vaccine for efficacy
had been developed 17 years after the HIV-caused AIDS (acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome) was detected in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Despite 40 candidate vaccines having been tested for safety,
no vaccine has yet been tested for efficacy in 1997," Berkley
said.
</P>
<P>
Listing lack of funding and incentives as the main reasons for
the slow pace of developing HIV vaccines, Berkley called on Asian
governments, research institutes, scientists, companies and
doctors to push for increased vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
"Vaccine is not going to occur without political leadership and
political will," said Berkley, citing Thailand as an example for
its enormous efforts to push HIV vaccine development forward.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the few Asian countries taking part in the HIV
vaccine development drive, is leading Asia and the world due to
the government's support, according to Berkley.
</P>
<P>
"This leadership will need to be taken by other countries in
the region, need to be taken by APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation) and other political bodies," Berkley said, "because
only this will guarantee that Asia will have the first access to
vaccine."
</P>
<P>
According to Berkley, an estimated 18 billion U.S. dollars were
spent annually in the campaign against AIDS worldwide in recent
years, but only 2 percent of the money was used for vaccine
development.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Margaret Johnston, the scientific director of the IAVI,
told reporters that scientific advances in recent years suggested
an effective AIDS vaccine is feasible.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the many uncertainties about how best to design a safe
and effective HIV vaccine," Johnston said, "it is now clear that a
concerted worldwide effort can be successful."
</P>
<P>
The IAVI, set up in 1996, is an independent research funding
and advocacy group dedicated to ensuring the development of safe,
effective, accessible and preventive HIV vaccines for use
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The current Asia-Pacific AIDS congress, co-sponsored by the
AIDS Society of Asia and the Pacific and the Joint United Nations
AIDS Program (UNAIDS), is being attended by more than 2,500
delegates.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda were the status of HIV/AIDS in the
Asia-Pacific, socio-economic impacts of HIV/AIDS on the region and
ways to check the quick spreading of the deadly disease in the
region.

CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar plunged
to four year lows today, driven down by a hefty fall in the gold
price, as the ongoing crisis of confidence over struggling
Southeast Asian economies also continued to impact.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 68.64 U.S. cents, down sharply
from 70.58 U.S. cents last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In morning trading, the local unit slipped through support at
68.50 U.S. cents to hit 68.35, a new four year low from the

</P>
<P>
However, the local unit quickly fell back against the U.S.
dollar, trading in a range of 68.35 to 69.38 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Darrin Stewart, IBJ Australia Bank senior foreign exchange
trader said a combination of factors was driving the Australian
dollar down.
</P>

"Gold is obviously still under pressure, the Southeast Asian
flu is still weighing quite heavily on us, and countries that
Australia exports heavily to are coming under a lot of internal
economic pressures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Australian dollar shed more than 3 U.S. cents in
as many days as Southeast Asian economic woes weighed on the
market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investors led the rush to dump the Australian dollar as a
series of reports highlighted Australia's proximity to the
economic crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
At close in Sydney today, the Australian dollar was at 83.69
Japanese yen from 85.45, and against the Deutsche mark it was at
1.2140 from 1.2531.

<HEADLINE> Damming of Yellow River Attracts Worldwide Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xiaolangdi, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The damming of the Yellow
River by the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project has attracted
attention from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council have closely followed the progress of the project
and have sent telegrams of congratulations to headquarters at
Xiaolangdi after the river damming started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Major Beijing-based newspapers ran front-page articles and
photos of the damming of the Yellow River, the second longest in
China. The articles say that the Xiaolangdi Project, second only in
size to the Three Gorges Project currently under way on the
Yangtze River, will play a unique role in controlling floods on
the Yellow River, a long-cherished hope of the area's residents.
</P>
<P>
The damming signifies that the multi-billion yuan project has
entered its second phase.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 journalists from all parts of the world are in
Xiaolangdi to cover the story of the river's damming. The largest
group of journalists, more than 110, was a team from China's
Central Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of Germany, Italy and France as well as
representatives from the World Bank will be guests Tuesday at a
ceremony marking the completion of the damming.
</P>
<P>
The crush of thousands of spectators from other parts of the
country resulted in an overflow at hotels and serious traffic
problems in Luoyang City, site of the project.

<HEADLINE> HK Post Launches New Speedpost Marketing Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Post Office,
which handles a daily average of over 3.2 million items, started a
new TV commercial here today, emphasizing that its Speedpost is
committed to on-time delivery of documents and packages for
customers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are print-related advertisements in major
newspapers, big posters at metro stations and posters at post
offices.
</P>
<P>
A reliable and efficient postal service has been an important
factor in Hong Kong's development as a leading commercial,
financial and industrial center. The Post Office premium service,
Speedpost, which provides door-to-door collection and delivery
service for customers sending time-sensitive documents, samples or
merchandise, continues to play an important part in the business
community.
</P>
<P>
"We are using 'We Put Time On Your Side' as the overall
creative theme to emphasize that Speedpost is committed to on-time
delivery of documents and packages for customers all over the
world," said Postmaster General of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Robert Footman Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a first version of the TV commercial, a Speedpost man is
seen collecting a parcel from a busy Hong Kong office. From the
moment he touches the parcel, everything around him starts moving
backwards. As the reverse action continues, he walks forwards
through the streets of Hong Kong and ends up in Beijing, where he
delivers the parcel to a kite factory.
</P>
<P>
"The moment he hands over the parcel, the action starts going
forward again, signifying that Speedpost puts time on your side,"
Footman explained.
</P>
<P>
In a second version of the commercial, the parcel is delivered
to a fashion studio in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing and Paris versions are aired alternately to
reinforce the message that Speedpost operates an international
courier service with an extensive global network and with the
widest courier network in China's inland covering more than 1,500
cities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Continue Intervening in Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Le Duc Thuy, deputy governor of
the State Bank of Vietnam said his bank will continue intervening
in the currency market to ensure stability in foreign exchange
rates, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.S. dollar was sold for 13,000 Vietnamese dong
as against the 11,175-11,180 rates set by the bank. The stronger
dollar also pressed up gold prices on the Vietnamese market.
</P>
<P>
Le Duc Thuy told a press conference on Saturday that he
expected the dong's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and gold
prices would soon stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Saying the rise was essentially of a psychological nature, he
noted that the state bank earlier this month widened the trading
band between the dong and dollar to plus or minus 10 percent,
replacing the previous band of plus or minus 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was described as a necessary response to the current
monetary crisis in the region which has seen a sharp rise of the
U.S. dollar against Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 days of the new trading band, the bank sold 75
million dollars to the various commercial banks to ensure normal
business, Thuy said.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Vietnam had enough reserves to help bring the
situation to normal, he added.
</P>
<P>
By late Sunday afternoon, the rate had dropped in the free
market in Hanoi, with one U.S. dollar being bought at 12,250
Vietnamese dong and sold at 12,550 dong.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Red Cross Proposes Family Reunion Site to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Red
Cross (KNRC) Monday proposed to Pyongyang the opening of a place
inside the truce village of Panmunjom or anywhere else on the
Korean Peninsula where displaced family members can meet.
</P>
<P>
Chung Won-shik, president of the KNRC, made the proposal in his
speech at a ceremony commemorating the 92nd anniversary of the
KNRC.
</P>
<P>
He said the KNRC will make efforts to pave the way for an
earlier realization of reunions which the separated families are
earnestly wishing.
</P>
<P>
The KNRC will also push for continued food aid to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the forthcoming
third round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South side, offering a place inside Panmunjom or in a
Southern city near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), is willing to
include the DPRK as possible place for family reunions, but will
exclude cities in China and any other countries, according to the
KNRC officials.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the Korean peninsula agreed to open a place
for family reunions in their basic agreement signed in 1992 but
have not implemented the plan.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of divided family members in South
Korea vary widely. While some researchers say there are about
500,000 surviving first-generation divided family members, other
estimates put the number of people directly affected by the
problem at as high as 10 million.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Labor Sector Urged to Put Off Wage Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' labor sector
has been urged by a government agency and local industries to put
off the demand for wage increase until next year, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Socorro Zingapon, office-in-charge director
of the National Economic and Development Authority, as saying that
the benchmark of the wage increase should be the inflation rate
and not the foreign exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, the Philippine currency peso has
devaluated by more than 30 percent to the present level of 34.8
pesos against the U.S. dollar in the financial crisis sweeping the
region.
</P>
<P>
The labor sector, complaining that oil prices and transport
fares have risen due to the peso's depreciation, is asking for a
wage increase of 100 pesos (2.87 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The ensuing oil price and transport fare hikes are not
expected to result in an inflation rate beyond the full year
target of 6 percent to 6.5 percent," Zingapon said.
</P>
<P>
This inflation target, she added, is attainable given the
average inflation from January to September this year remaining at
4.7 percent, notwithstanding the depreciation of the currency
starting in July.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Raul Concepcion, president of the Federation
of Philippine Industries, said the wage increase issue should be
addressed when things stabilize.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no basis for the increase this time as
inflation remained stable despite the continued deterioration of
the peso.

<HEADLINE> Israel Regrets Russia's Stance on Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai expressed regrets today over Russia's refusal to
halt the alleged nuclear and missile cooperation with Iran, which
he said poses dangerous threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here after meeting with visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Mordechai said Russia
only agreed to check the evidence handed over by Israel on
Russia's alleged assistance to Iran's missile and nuclear weapon
development programs.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear that, after what we discussed today,
Russia unfortunately (is) still supporting Iranian projects to
produce non-conventional weapons and long-range missiles,"
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
"Those projects are too dangerous for Israel. And it's hoped
that the Russians will stop supporting military subjects to Iran
because it is too dangerous for Israel, and for all the region
and too dangerous for all the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov did not speak to reporters after his meeting with
Mordechai, a sign of a possible failure to solve the differences
over Russia's military cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the current situation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the conflicts in South Lebanon
and the deadlock in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has welcomed Russia to play a bigger role in mediating
the peace process, to which Russia is the co-sponsor together
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed that it is important to break the impasse in
the Israeli-Syrian peace process, which they called as a key to
reaching regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit after
visiting Lebanon and Syria, has already held talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy
and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister strongly denied that Russia has been
assisting Iran's ambitious ballistic and nuclear missile
development programs with technology transfer, despite what was
called "undeniable evidence" provided by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to hold talks with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat late today in the West Bank city
Ramallah to discuss Russia's role in advancing the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Minister On Constitutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Justice and
Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris today explained the
government's new constitution proposals which he said would
restrict the power of the executive presidency and give more power
to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Peiris described the new constitution draft as "a document
which will enable us to move forward into the 21 century," and
said his country has reached a critical stage as the text of the
new constitution has been placed before the parliament for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said the principal feature of the document is its
practicality.
</P>
<P>
"The executive presidential system is not good for our country.
It allows too great concentration of power in one institution. The
constitution we are proposing is based on a balanced system which
will restrict the exercise of the executive power," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the essential institutions in a functioning democracy,
such as the parliament, the courts, the media and the public
service are overshadowed by the executive presidency under the
current constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution proposals, a large proportion of
power of the executive presidency will be transferred to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the executive president will be replaced by a prime
minister, an elected head of government. There will be a
ceremonial president, who acts on advice given to him or her by
the prime minister, Peiris said.
</P>
<P>
The second feature, according to the minister, is the
introduction of executive committee system at the level of
regional administration. Extensive power will be devolved to
those regional councils, which will include not only the ruling
party, but also parties that are out of power.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution will also be devoted to strengthening
human rights with new provisions for the rights to life,
information and privacy added into it, Peiris pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new package also emphasizes the social and
economic rights of people.
</P>
<P>
After two and a half years of intensive discussion by all
parties concerned, the Parliamentary Select Committee finally
authorized the justice minister to submit the report of the new
constitutional reform, as well as some riders proposed by
political parties, to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reform package, a major peace initiative of
the current government, contains proposals for the establishment
of a Union of Regions with more autonomy given to local
authorities in view of ending the ethnic conflict of the country.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said he expects steps to implement the proposals can be
taken early next year.
</P>
<P>
But before that, the parties in the parliament have to reach
consensus on the proposed constitutional reform. The major
opposition party, the United National Party, has asked for six
more months to consider the package.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister said that his ministry will issue 1,500
copies of the government's proposals on constitutional reform
before the budget speech is delivered in the parliament on
November 5.
</P>
<P>
The copies will be made available to all members of parliament
and to the public so the entire country will have a very clear
idea of the provisions of the reform, said the minister.

reiterated its commitment to normalize the country's economic
imbalance, Secretary to the Government of the Federation Alhaji Gidado
Idris said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The official did not elaborate on the economic imbalance, but said:
"This administration is committed to providing an enabling environment
for business to grow."
</P>
<P>
Idris made the remarks at a gathering organized by the Nigerian
Stock Exchange, a local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Idris, the government has received the report
of a
panel set up in March 1996 to look into market operations in the
country and will soon come out with its policy in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the Nigerian government has succeeded in the
macro-control over the economy particularly since the beginning of
this year, with inflation rate declining, foreign reserves increasing
and exchange rate being stable.
</P>
<P>
However, all this has come side by side with a stagnation mainly
characterized by lack of consumption, increasing unemployment and poor
performance of other industrial sectors than the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alhaji Anthony Ani expressed fears not long ago
that unless appropriate measures are taken, the 5.5-percent economic
growth rate targeted by the government for this year could hardly be
met.

<HEADLINE> Fund Guaranteed for 2nd-Phase Construction of Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The fund for the second-phase
construction of the Three Gorges Project has been guaranteed,
according to Li Yong'an, deputy general manager of the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation (CTGPC).
</P>
<P>
Li said today that the extra bonds issued for the Three Gorges
Project and promised loans from some of China's powerful financial
institutions will provide a stable financial guarantee for the
dam's completion.
</P>
<P>
After blocking the Yangtze River, the Three Gorges Project will
have to raise 76 billion yuan (about 9.5 billion U.S. dollars) for
building the dam and hydropower station from 1998 to 2003,
according to Li, who is in charge of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
Fifty billion yuan (about 6.2 billion U.S. dollars) has come
mainly from four sources: the Three Gorges Construction Fund,
profits from the Gezhouba power plant, annual loans of 3 billion
yuan (about 200 million U.S. dollars) from the State Development
Bank, and the export credit and foreign business banks loans for
buying the first group of 14 generating units. In addition, the
Three Gorges Project will need 20 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars) for the next phase.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank has promised to provide additional
loans for the project. China's two biggest business banks, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Construction Bank
of China, also have expressed interest in loaning funds for the
project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The CTGPC plans to issue some of its enterprise
bonds and prepare for listing the stock of the Gezhouba plant,
which will ensure that the corporation maintains a realistic
liability structure.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the liability rate of the CTGPC has been
controlled at 40-to-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1993 prices, static investment for the project is 90
billion yuan (about 11 billion US dollars) with dynamic investment
projected at 203 billion yuan (about 25 billion U.S. dollars).
Half of the dynamic investment, which includes inflation and
unforeseen expenditures, will be made up with the Three Gorges
Project Construction Fund and income from the electricity
generation of the Gezhouba power plant.
</P>
<P>
Li said that after the Three Gorges Power Plant begins
generating electricity in 2003, the construction fund will reach a
break-even point in 2006 and begin earning profits which will be
used to pay off debt and interest. The expected profits have
earned the CTGPC bonds a rating of AAA-, the second highest
possible rating.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the project will mainly depend on domestic
funding, but that the CTGPC also will seek some overseas support,
including export credits and foreign business loans.

YINCHUAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Changxiao, head of the
Kelong Bioengineering Development Research Institute in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has bred 42 varieties of
plants using high-speed propagation technology.
</P>
<P>
Li selected a plant leaf, treated the cells around a cut with a
special liquid, and then put it in sand or bags containing
nutrients and let it sprout. Within 11 days, new plants can
be produced.
</P>
<P>
At this speed, several million plants, meaning from 8 to 12
generations, can be propagated in a year.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said Li's new technology can be applied not only to
rapid breeding of cash crops, but also to protection of endangered
plants.
</P>
<P>
The vegetative propagation technology now in use in the world
is expensive and difficult to use. Li's simpler technology has the
advantages of using more traditional technologies at low cost.
</P>
<P>
Li has bred 42 varieties of plants like the Chinese wolfberry,
elm, cotton, grapes, potatoes, and tomatoes.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Governor Hosts Dinner for Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONOLULU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that both China and the United States
"carry weight in the world today" and "shoulder common
responsibilities for peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and
the world at large."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his toast at a dinner hosted by Hawaii
Governor Ben Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here this morning for a state visit to the United
States. The ongoing visit is the first by a Chinese head of state
to the country in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
"A stable, sound and growing Sino-U.S. relationship not only
serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the rest
of the world, but also conforms to the trend of the times toward
peace and development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was "looking forward to discussions with
President (Bill) Clinton on developing China-U.S. relations
oriented toward the 21st century and major international and
regional issues so as to usher our relations into a new stage."
</P>
<P>
Hawaii, renowned for its picturesque tropical scenery and the
hospitable people and strategically located in the Pacific Ocean,
is an important bond linking China and America, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, China and Hawaii have enjoyed
increasingly closer exchanges and cooperation in the economic,
trade and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The linking of sister cities between China's Hainan Province
and the State of Hawaii in 1992 and the successful visit to China
by Governor Cayetano are not only part and parcel of the Sino-U.S
friendship and cooperation, but also a force propelling the growth
of the bilateral relations between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Governor Cayetano said the people of Hawaii and the Chinese
community here are honored that the Chinese president has made
Hawaii his first stop in the United States, on his way to an
historic meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important summit for our great nations," Cayetano
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of Hawaii's people trace their heritage to China," he
said. "We are very proud of their contributions. Both Hawaii and
China are beneficiaries of strong, enduring ties forged over the
years which have enriched lives of our peoples."
</P>
<P>
The dinner proceeded in a friendly and cordial atmosphere while
children and women presented the local Hula Dance to the unique
music of the indigenous Hawaii people.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs New Law on Squatting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
here today signed into law a bill that no longer views squatting
as a criminal act in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law repealed an old decree issued by the late president
Ferdinand Marcos, stipulating that all cases filed based on
Marcos' decree are dismissed and those serving jail terms must be
freed.
</P>
<P>
The anti-squatting law is a victory for the urban poor,
especially those who face lawsuits or were put behind bars merely
because poverty forced them to squat on property not their own.
</P>
<P>
Squatting has hounded the government for several decades. It
has become a serious problem particularly in Metro Manila, where
police have had a number of violent clashes with squatters when
demolishing the illegal houses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ramos said the repeal of the
old directive does not mean the government is condoning squatting,
warning professional squatters and squatting syndicates that they
will face the full force of law.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to landowners to find productive use for their
idle lands in order to prevent squatting, saying "it is the
landowners' moral obligation to utilize their assets efficiently."
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress led by Senate President Ernesto Maceda and
House Speaker Jose de Venecia witnessed the signing ceremony.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Apolo Kironde Kadumukasa, a
former minister under former presidents Milton Obote and Idi
Amin, has returned to Uganda, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kironde had been leader of a rebel group, the London-based
Uganda Democratic Alliance (UDA) before his return here on
October 24. The 72-year-old lawyer now lives in Mengo, central
Uganda.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Kironde served as minister of works and transport before the
country's independence. Between 1961 and 1968, he was Uganda's

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombia today

every three years.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's latest official statistics, 32 new
provincial governors, 1,004 mayors, 502 provincial senators and
18,000 government officials of various levels will be elected in
the elections. The winners of the elections will assume office on

</P>
<P>
To ensure the elections proceed smoothly, the Colombian
government deployed 280,000 soldiers and policemen patroling
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at preventing the guerrillas from disrupting
the elections, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano announced a series of
awarding policies to encourage turnouts, including a half-day off
for workers and employees who went to vote, a reduction of young
voters' length of active service in the army, and a 10 percent
discount of college registration fee.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 of the more than 1,000 towns in the country failed to
hold elections as scheduled, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Engineers Cut Short Holidays for Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
recalled works officers, roads engineers, inspectors and
supervisors who are currently on annual leave to repair
roads damaged by floods, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Permanent Secretary for Public Works and
Housing Ebdullahi Sharawe as saying on Sunday that various
sections of roads throughout the country had been washed by
floods, hence the need for engineers to address the problem
urgently.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a tour of flooded areas in the port
city of Mombasa and its environs where roads have seriously been
damaged by heavy rains in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains in Mandera District in northeastern Kenya in
the past three weeks had caused heavy losses in the area with
some 2,000 hectares of crops, five water pumps and some sections
of roads washed away, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented heavy rains, the highest in the district in
the past 16 years, have made roads impassable and created an
acute shortage of essential drugs and food.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper noted that water supply in Mombasa had
been restored after repairing the 36 centimeters supply pipe at
Kibarani, a major supplier of water to the Mombasa Island which
had been dislodged in a landslide last week.
</P>
<P>
The busy main road from Mombasa to the tourist resort town of
Malindi was reopened to traffic last Saturday after being closed
for a week.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent study in Shanghai,
China's leading manufacturing center, showed that the city's
citizens have become more aware of the need for environmental
protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 people asked about "the main problem humanity will
face in the 21st century", 42.7 said the environment. Next came
energy and population.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that most of the city's people have a good
understanding of the relation between the environment and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Almost 70 percent said that "economic development should go
together with environmental protection", 24.7 percent agreed that
"environmental protection is more important than economic
development", and only four percent thought that "pollution is
inevitable during economic development".
</P>
<P>
Citizens are more willing to get involved in environmental
protection, according to the survey. More than 60 percent say they
are confident about the pollution control of the Suzhou River that
flows through Shanghai by the municipal government, and only 4.4
percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution, limited green space, declining water quality,
and noise are what the residents most complained about, so experts
say, "Underestimating the environment awareness of the people of
Shanghai hinders environmental protection."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urged to Diversify Export Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has suggested
that Bangladesh should diversify both export products and markets
and exploit fully the opportunity of exporting gas in the region,
the independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
Besides, economists also rang the warning bell, saying that
markets access problems and high level of concentration, both item
and market-wise, may lead to a sharp decline in export earnings in
the medium term, the UNB added.
</P>
<P>
The WB, in its recently released Annual Economic Update,
identified that export growth in fiscal year 1996-97 was led by
raw jute, knitwear and woven garments, which showed a narrow
export base.
</P>
<P>
The export base continues to remain vulnerable to shocks and
threats such as the ones Bangladesh is currently facing in the
European, U.S. and Japanese markets, UNB quoted the WB as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leather exports declined nearly eight percent due to a
weakening in global demand for leather products and a continuing
decline in the supply of high grade hides in Bangladesh, the WB
noted.
</P>
<P>
Export of jute goods fell 3.5 percent, reflecting to some
extent the increasing production bottlenecks arising from worn
plant and equipment in Bangladesh jute mills, the WB observed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Export Promotion Bureau,
Bangladesh fetched an export income of 4.418 billion U.S. dollars
in fiscal year 1996-97, which is 13.8 percent higher than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, woven ready-made garments earned more than half
-- 2.238 billion dollars, followed by knitwear with 763 million
dollars, frozen foods with 320.7 million dollars and jute goods
with 317.9 million dollars, the UNB noted.
</P>
<P>
Shares of other exportables like raw jute, leather, tea,
chemical products and other primary commodities in the export
incomes remained very small compared with these four major
products.
</P>
<P>
The WB predicted a fall in import demands of petroleum, oil and
lubricants and fertilizer due to the expanding domestic production
of gas and power, giving some relief to the foreign exchange
reserve situation.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the WB said, Bangladesh would still face an
increasing pressure on foreign exchange reserves in the near term,
which is already being felt with the recent decline in the levels
of aid inflows.
</P>
<P>
Fostering diversification into new items and markets, and
exploring fully any emerging opportunity for exporting gas and
urea, especially in the region, will be important, the WB pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export industry performed well in the last fiscal
year, but some major problems pose formidable challenges to the
sector's continued robust performance in the future, noted Prof.
Mustafizur Rahman, a fellow at the Center for Policy Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a relatively high rate of export growth of 13.8
percent, he said, the export sector itself has encountered some
major crises in 1998-97, which are expected to have serious
implications for its future performance.
</P>
<P>
Lack of export diversification and growth concentration,
challenges to global market access and inadequacies in the
incentive regime are the major problems identified by Rahman for
the export sector.
</P>
<P>
"The problems were compounded because of the narrow base of
Bangladesh's exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
he also pointed out that the European Union countries account
for 40 percent of Bangladesh's total export while the USA accounts
for 35 percent. Only six products accounted for 90 percent of the
total export accruals in 1996-97, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ali Rashid, Prof. of Economics at Dhaka University,
gave similar views, saying that diversification of export would
be the "only solution" to the problem, the UNB said.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists in China Find New Longshan Culture Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-American group of
archaeologists has discovered the ruins of the Longshan Culture in
central China that go back more than 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists, from the Anthropology Department of
University of Missouri in the United States and the Henan Cultural
Relics Research Institute, found the site while doing excavation
work along the upper reaches of the Yinghe River.
</P>
<P>
They got help in locating the 40-square-meter site in a village
in Henan province from the Global Positioning System (GPS), group
members say. It had been destroyed by water erosion, but many
relics from the late Longshan period, like pottery kilns and
ancient tombs of the Erlitou Culture of nearly 4,000 years ago,
were still intact.
</P>
<P>
Also helpful in the exploration was an infrared laser range
finder, a new type of archaeology tool.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that this is the first time for the
province's relics protection people to co-operate with foreign
academics. The team will publish a paper on their
discoveries.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Business Community Urged to Look at "Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka Mayor Fisho Mwale has
challenged the business community in the capital city to look at
the lack of adequate sanitary infrastructure as a business
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Fisho as saying that the
business community should not just complain but should look at
"trash as cash".
</P>
<P>
Lack of infrastructure is a problem that has been there and
Council alone could not afford, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the business community to see this as a business
opportunity, especially now that the government is encouraging
private sector participation in all sectors of the economy and
development.
</P>
<P>
"We have some public toilets we have leased out to private
operators in the city center," he said.
</P>
<P>
On garbage collection, he said "in the western countries they
say 'trash is cash'. This garbage lying about is money. If
someone has a truck they can easily collect garbage for whoever
would want to have garbage removed in their area, and people are
ready to pay for a good service."
</P>
<P>
For sustainability of a business venture and quality service,
it is important for the public to realize the need for cost
sharing, Mwale said.
</P>
<P>
Councils across the country and Lusaka City Council in
particular, have come under attack for their failure to provide
the most deserved service to the people.
</P>
<P>
Despite mushrooming of restaurants and fast food shops, and
the increasing population in many towns in Zambia, sanitary
infrastructure and collection of garbage have not been improved.

But the sustained slowdown in industrial and export growth and
other problems being faced by exporters here would end the year

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has
provided a new uniform for its 3,200 security guards as a

SHENYANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out a nationwide
study to locate disabled people living in poverty so as to help them
improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is to be done by the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, will look for handicapped people living below the
poverty line in urban areas and those in rural areas who
earn less than 580 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
It will also try to find out that how many of them can be
helped out of poverty by providing them with jobs and how many
have to rely on welfare support.
</P>
<P>
China has some 17 million disabled people living in
poverty, or half the total number of poor people in the country.
</P>
<P>
A special loan program that started in 1992 has managed to help

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Newspapers: Chinese President's US visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian newspapers said
today that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's current visit to the
United States is a great opportunity to pave the way for better
understanding and the long-term preservation of peace in
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The editorial of the Indonesian Observer said Jiang's visit to
Washington will improve bilateral relations between China and the
United States, "a relationship that is a key factor in the
preservation of peace in the Asia-Pacific region now and in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin left Beijing Sunday on a state visit to the United
States, the first by a Chinese leader in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the Sino-U.S. relations have been heading in
a positive direction recently, although there are some problems
such as U.S. ties with Taiwan, a multi-billion dollar trade
imbalance and the question of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The editorial quoted economists as predicting that China will
become the most powerful economic force in the world by 2030, a
fact not lost on the United States poised to tap the market, rich
as it is in natural resources and populated by more than one
billion people.
</P>
<P>
Kompas daily newspaper said in its editorial that the leaders
of China and the United States are seemingly taking a looking
ahead attitude for getting along with each other and they realized
that the two countries have many issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
It held that the summit meeting between Clinton and Jiang Zemin
will be critical. Its results will not only become a guiding
policy for the relations of the two countries which has a great
influence in the Asia-Pacific region, but could also make it clear
that how the two big countries deal with their differences, said
the editorial.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Firms to Be Main Players in Defense Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said today that his ministry plans to select
Malaysian companies with the required capabilities to be the "main
players" in the manufacturing of several defense equipment and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama, the
minister said at a seminar on Rapid Deployment Force: Applications
for Defense Equipment and Support here that the companies would
participate in the field of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding,
arms and ammunition and electronics and also be invited to
participate as prime contractors in major defense procurements.
</P>
<P>
He said the appointment of Naval Dockyard Sdn Bhd (NDSB) as the
prime contractor to undertake the building of patrol vessels for
the navy in collaboration with a foreign shipyard was an example
towards that end.
</P>
<P>
The NDSB in cooperation with a German consortium -- German
Naval Group (GNG) comprising four firms -- will build the initial
six ships locally at the NDSB dockyard at Lumut, some 300
kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to encourage private sector involvement in
the defense-related industry, the Malaysian government has
encouraged local companies to undertake prototype development of
specific defense equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure the development of a viable defense
industry and taking cognizance of Malaysia's limitations, the
government had decided to focus on only a few specific areas,
namely, in composites, aerospace, maritime, communications and
automobile.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Boost Housing Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
work out new policies next year to stimulate the currently stagnant
housing market, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The new policies will concern permits to sell State-owned
houses, the control of prices and the supply of bank loans, the
paper quoted Xie Jiajin, director-general of Real Estate Industry
Department of the Ministry of Construction, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Real estate investment has not been growing since May because
of market problems. The Ministry of Construction reported that
investment had decreased 1.97 percent to 134.6 billion yuan (16.3
billion US dollars) in the first eight months this year, compared
with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The present paradoxical co-existence of large inventory and
large potential demand indicates that the investment in this
sector is suffering from distortion.
</P>
<P>
"The government is making efforts to stop providing housing free
of charge on a large scale," Xie said. Cheap rents of
government-allocated houses reduce people's incentive to buy their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
She went on: "It's crucial to have measures inspiring people
to buy houses and make the prices affordable to wage-earners."
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, unreasonable price rises must be kept under
control, and the mortgage loan system must be workable with the
help of commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Ahead Of Rest Of China in Household Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The average income of urban
households in Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, is
considered well-to-do now and four or five years ahead of the rest
of the country, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 500 families done by a local institute, showed
that, in 1996, the average household income was 25,100 yuan, 3.15
times the 1991 figure, and the number of durable goods families
have are up by a big margin from 1991.
</P>

Every family has at least one color TV set, refrigerator, and
electric cooker, and there are 50 air conditioners, 82 washing
machines, 15 sets of component stereo equipment, 51 video
recorders, and five computers for every 100 families. Average
living space had grown from 6.9 sq.m. to 8.7.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Consider Cyber Court for Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries
may consider establishing an ASEAN Cyber Court of Justice and an
ASEAN Cyber Law Institute as part of the region's initiatives to
address the legal aspects of electronic commerce, a Malaysian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would like to see cyber courts established on an
international level and an ASEAN Cyber Court would be the first
step towards it, Malaysian Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Minister Leo Moggie said after opening the ASEAN Roundtable
Conference on Electronic Commerce here today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters, "Transborder transactions in electronic
commerce require Cyber laws to be enforced internationally, but
ASEAN will take the first look at how this can be established."
</P>
<P>
He said the roundtable conference, a follow-up of
recommendations made by the 30th ASEAN ministers meeting in July
for ASEAN to carry out a roundtable discussion on E-Commerce and
other multimedia applications, was an ASEAN response towards the
United States Framework of Global Electronic Commerce released
early July, which proposes tariff-less and non-regulated private
sector transactions across borders.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the roundtable discussion among ASEAN senior
officials and private sector representatives and attended by
technical, financial and legal experts was expected to come up
with some concrete ideas on the promotion of E-commerce in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier in his speech that ASEAN may need to examine
the idea of an open ASEAN Communications Network and ASEAN also
needs to promote global smart partnership among its private sector
and move rapidly to build up leadership and share the
opportunities of E-Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Duty-free Access to Indo-Pak Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is trying to obtain
duty-free access to markets in India and Pakistan in a bid to
boost its exports and bridge the trade gaps with the two
neighbors, said a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
"What we are now aiming at is duty-free entry into Indian and
Pakistani markets on non-reciprocal basis," Commerce Secretary
Farrouk Chowdhury Sunday told a meeting of the Foreign Investors'
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
He said that following the two rounds of successful trade
negotiations under the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA), the third round is going on and likely to be
concluded shortly.
</P>
<P>
Tariff concessions were suggested on 226 items in the first
round and 815 in the second, he said adding Bangladesh was granted
concessions by India on 513 items, which cover a considerable
amount of tradable goods.
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretary said that as a step to boost export
further, Bangladesh has proposed the SAPTA members reduce the
value-addition requirement for qualifying for the tariff
concession to 25-30 percent from the existing 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another step, he said, Dhaka is thinking about reducing the
value-addition requirement for the high-fashion-wears to 25
percent, which will increase the exports of ready-made garments.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury also told the FICCI members that the country's next
export and import policies were at the final stage and would be
announced next month.
</P>
<P>
The policies are being formulated for five years with provision
for annual review, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK's Growth Hinges on Human Health, Education: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior local official said
the healthy growth of Hong Kong's economy depends on both the
health of Hong Kong people and education, according to a press
release available here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner to celebrate the 110th Anniversary of the
Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Financial
Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Donald Tsang stressed that Hong Kong's economy, indeed, thrives on
the dynamism and vigor of human resources.
</P>
<P>
"The health of our economy hinges on the health of our people.
The first wealth is health," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The health of our economy also depends on education," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For those who have read the Chief Executive's (Tung Chee
Hwa's) Policy Address delivered just over a fortnight ago, I need
not stress the emphasis Mr. Tung places on education," he
added. "It is through education that doctors have the skills and
knowledge to prevent and cure diseases. Through education they
acquire the mind to think independently and the heart to serve the
community and humanity."
</P>
<P>
Tsang reiterated that "education is the key to the future" of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, the financial secretary continued, the SAR
government will continue to invest heavily in upgrading the
quality of the SAR's school education.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We will invest heavily in emerging centers of
excellence which will enable our institutions to achieve and
maintain recognition as world-class researchers in the
international academic community. We must keep pace with rising
international standards and serve the future economic and social
needs of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has accorded high priority to education and
has been implementing its targets for improving the quality of
education since Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Educational opportunities in Hong Kong encompass kindergartens,
primary and secondary schools, technical institutes, technical
colleges and tertiary institutions. Now, over 1.2 million
students, or over 20 percent of the total 6.3 million population,
are in full-time education. They attend 2,400 institutions and are
taught by some 59,000 teachers assisted by a large number of
support staff.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Share Common Interests, Says Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONOLULU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
share broad common interests and major responsibilities in peace
and development, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in his toast at the luncheon hosted in
his honor by Honolulu Mayor Jeremy Harris.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here this morning on the first
stop on his nine-day state visit to the United States at the
invitation of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Jiang visited the Arizona
National Memorial where, Jiang said, he "acquired more firsthand
knowledge of the Pearl Harbor Incident which shocked the world."
</P>
<P>
In World War II, which brought untold sufferings to mankind,
Chinese and Americans fought shoulder to shoulder against
fascists, and safeguarded world peace with other peoples of the
world, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Honolulu is a familiar name for the Chinese people. At the end
of last century, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner of China's democratic
revolution, set up China's first revolutionary organization -- the
Revive China Society, in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred years later, Zhongshan city, the hometown
of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, became a sister city of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was confident that through the joint efforts of
China and the United States, the friendship and mutually
beneficial cooperation between the two countries would develop
further.
</P>
<P>
Harris said it is significant that President Jiang chose
Honolulu to start his first state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Honolulu's cultural and historical ties with China serve as a
bridge for the city to be China's gateway to the United States, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that for more than 200 years, Honolulu residents
of Chinese ancestry have played a vital role in the development of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
After the luncheon, President Jiang met representatives of
overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans in Hawaii, and briefed them
on China's reform and opening up as well as economic
achievements.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An international industrial
exhibition, Techno Myanmar'97, sponsored by the Myanmar Industrial
Development Committee (MIDC), was inaugurated here today.

</P>
<P>
The MIDC, formed in July 1995 with nine key ministries to
promote Myanmar's industrial development, held the first
international industrial exhibition in Yangon in May last year.
</P>
<P>
With the market-oriented economic system introduced in the late
1980s, Myanmar has been inviting local and foreign investors to
develop the country's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar set the year 1997 as a pivotal year for the country's
economic and technological development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Myanmar's industrial growth was registered
at 5.2 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year. The target for the

<HEADLINE> Healthy Sino-American Ties Conducive to World Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's major dailies
today spoke highly of the significance of the current visit by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the United States, saying that
healthy Sino-American relationship is conducive to the world
peace.
</P>
<P>
Sin Chew Jit Poh, a major Chinese daily in Malaysia, said in
its editorial that the forthcoming summit between Jiang Zemin and
his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton will lay a foundation for the
development of Sino-American relations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Jiang Zemin's Historic Visit to U.S.,"
said that if the Sino-U.S. summit can map out "guiding principles"
for the 21st century relations between China and the U.S., it will
be "conducive not only to bilateral relations, but also to the
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and peace all over the
world."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nanyang Siang Pau, another major Chinese Daily here,
said in an article that Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. and his
forthcoming talks with Clinton are apparently significant for the
development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The article said, "the establishment of stable and healthy
relations between China and the United States will be beneficial
to the promotion of regional cooperation and development in
Asia-Pacific and to the consolidation of the world peace."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Classical Document Collection Needs Financial Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A collection of Dunhuang
documents that is the most significant work in the study of this
treasure house in Gansu province in northwest China is in need of
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Professor Huang Zheng, director of Hangzhou University's
Dunhuang Research Center, says that a collection of classical
works from Dunhuang had been planned, which involved collating,
sorting, and punctuating of documents scattered in many
countries. The center would publish the 30 million-character
collection in a book in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang yielded 60,000 volumes of historical records,
scattered in libraries all over the world. The documents are
mostly in Chinese, but some are in the languages of ethnic
minorities. They touch on topics related to language, sociology,
economics, astronomy and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that departments had allocated money to his
center. A fund set up by Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, also gave the center
money . "But, the money collected amounts to only 300,000 yuan and
that's far from enough," Hang noted. The amount of money needed
for the 35-volume book is estimated at three million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A large part of that is needed to buy books and documents in
public or private libraries in Britain, France, Russia, Japan and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The editors are hoping that some books and documents will be
donated. They will be stored in the reference room of the
university's Dunhuang Research Center. Huang said that donations
will be used in accordance with the donor's wishes.

ROME, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy became the eighth full
member of the Schengen accord today when it opened its borders to
European air travellers without demanding passports or visas.
</P>
<P>
But Italy will not open its land and sea borders under the
provisions of the accord until April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The air borders move came after Italy succeeded in soothing
German worries over flooding in of Albanian refugees via Italy and
Austria, which had agreed to join the pact on October 26 and December
1 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Travelers on German flight "LH3847", arriving here this morning
from Frankfurt, were told to keep their passports in their pockets
at the airport, becoming the first passengers to benefit from the
policy.
</P>
<P>
In the 22 months of its technical preparation, the Italian
government has spent about 40 billion lira (23.5 million
U.S. dollars) in making itself ready for membership.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Current Account Deficit to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current account
deficit will rise to six billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from this
year's estimated five billion dollars, local newspaper the
Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting a recent Asian Development Bank study,
said the country's current account deficit will swell due to the
sharp rise in the importation of capital goods.
</P>
<P>
The current account records payments arising from trade in
goods and services and from income in the form of interest,
profits and dividends arising from capital investments.
</P>
<P>
To arrest the current financial meltdown, the Philippines
decided to curb imports. However, its fast growing export industry
needs the importation of capital goods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The situation will be further aggravated by a decline in the
amount of remittances by overseas contract workers (OCWs), it
said. Last year six million OCWs sent home 7.5 billion U.S.
dollars. But in the first half this year, their remittances fell
sharply.
</P>
<P>
Like other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines
experienced a slowdown in export growth last year. As a result,
its current account deficit jumped to 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, or
4.1 percent of the gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, Yugoslavia Increase Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has become Macedonia's biggest trading partner, with an
expected trade volume between the two countries of 500 million
U.S. dollars by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with Yugoslavia news agency Tanjug on Sunday,
Dose Kotevski, a Macedonian commercial representative in Belgrade,
gave an overall review of the development of economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kotevski said cooperation had gone smoothly in recent years,
with an expected trade volume of 500 million U.S. dollars this
year. Last year's trade volume was 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, Yugoslavia's fifth biggest trading partner, mainly
exports agricultural, textile, and chemical products to
Yugoslavia, and from there imports copper, furniture and leather
products.
</P>
<P>
The trade between the two countries is balanced, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the economic revival of Yugoslavia, trade
between the two counties would further expand, especially in the
auto and electronic industries.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia became independent from the former Yugoslavia in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Road Discovered Along China's Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The traces of a 1,600-year-old
roadway built along a rock face on China's Yellow River in Shanxi
province, were discovered recently.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that that stretch of the Yellow River has
long been a difficult one and in ancient times, when boats were
going upstream, they had to be pulled by people on the bank. The
roadway was built for that.
</P>
<P>
The roadway is about 5,000 m. long and 1.2 to two meters wide,
but was eroded in parts, over the centuries. Most of it was built
about halfway up the rock face.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say, however, that inscriptions from the Eastern
Han Dynasty (25-220) and the Tang Dynasty (618-907) can still be
made out. About 40 inscriptions and some ancient coins and iron
nails were found along it.
</P>
<P>
Findings suggest that it was used from the Eastern Han to the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but a large part of the construction
work seems to have been organized by the Eastern Han and Tang
governments, according to the inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
The oldest stone inscription is in Yuanqu County and dates from
36 A.D.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China Investment Bank (CIB) is
undergoing some major changes -- being restructured into a
shareholding bank and renewing its operational-outlet network,
the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the recently concluded autumn conference of branch bank
presidents, CIB decided to concentrate efforts on building
well-performed, efficient branches in large cities and coastal
regions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it intends to withdraw or reduce branches in
small- and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
These outlets, under direct administration of local branch
banks and the headquarters, are independent in management.
</P>
<P>
Administrators will examine their performances regularly --
examining various aspects like profits, costs and risk controls.
</P>
<P>
The outlets will be urged to increase technology input while
improving staff quality. They will also be encouraged to tap into
new banking products and innovations.
</P>
<P>
The bank's feature service -- acting as a consulting agency for
businesses -- will be available at each outlet.

<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical enterprises
are being urged by senior officials to improve their market
development and strengthen their after-sales services provision,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, minister of the Chemical Industry, said that sales
are even more important than production, under the conditions of
the socialist market economy, during a seminar on the development
strategy of the Lutianhua Oleochemical production base in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With total assets of 43.5 million US dollars, Lutianhua
Oleochemical Co. Ltd under the Lutianhua Group Inc, established in
Sichuan Province in 1994, is now the country's largest oleochemical
production plant.
</P>
<P>
The firm imported advanced technology and equipment from Italy
and Britain to establish two production facilities, with an annual
production capacity of 30,000 tons of fatty acid and 5,600 tons of
fatty amine respectively.
</P>
<P>
To date, the company has established business relations with
more than 60 foreign firms and exported products internationally.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the company to conduct market surveys,
suggesting it launch cross-province mergers, which will enlarge
its market share and enhance its competitiveness. Gu also pledged
strong support for its development.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that Chinese chemical enterprises should develop
market-oriented products and develop both domestic and foreign
markets as the domestic market will continue to be open to foreign
products.

<HEADLINE> Hydrological Conditions Favorable for Damming Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of unfavorable
hydrological conditions during the blocking of the Yangtze River's
main channel is very remote, according to one veteran hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
"Although November is a period when hydrological conditions are
complicated, the chances are remote that the river will exceed a
safe range for construction to proceed," said Guo Yibing, chief
engineer with the Bureau of Hydrology under the Yangtze Water
Conservation Committee.
</P>
<P>
After years of research, Chinese scientists claim they have
overcome all technical problems for damming the deep-water river,
but Guo stressed that the hydrology of the Yangtze River still has
a vital bearing on blocking the river and timeliness is essential.
</P>
<P>
The current water speed and direction are both favorable, he
said, and even if the worst happens, it is impossible to surpass
the conditions encountered in constructing the Gezhouba Dam
Project on the Yangtze River 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, extra precautions have been taken in case of
unexpected water discharge, and the Yangtze Water Conservation
Committee has emphasized surveillance of the river's hydrological
changes in such areas as water flow, speed, silt movement and
underwater topography, Guo said.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy to Be Boosted in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region is working on measures to boost private
economy in this relatively underdeveloped area.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice chairman of the Tibet regional government,
said the steps are intended to give private businesses
preferential treatment in the use of electricity and land, loans,
taxation, and in the hiring of talented people.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no limit set on the number of such businesses or
their scope, nor will we impose a growth rate on the development
of private economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had less than 500 self-employed people in 1980 with a
registed capital of some 500,000 yuan. However, the
number of self-employed people in the region shot up to some
39,000 and their registered capital reached 375 million yuan by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
There are over 180 private enterprises in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhogza Doje, head of the Tibet Industrial and
Commercial Bureau, private economy in Tibet has been expanding at
an annual rate of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that retail sale volume from private businesses
accounts for about 40 percent of the region's total. They also pay
about 60 million yuan in taxes a year, exceeding those paid by
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"And the figure keeps growing," stressed the official.
</P>
<P>
These private businesses are also playing an important role in
helping others get rich, said Zhogza, who also pledged to stem the
practices that impede the development of private economy.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Munkaspart Calls for Vote Against NATO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Munkdaspart
(Workers' Party) held a mass rally in the city of Eger today to
call on the people to vote against the nation's entry into the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the coming referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of Munkaspart, Thurmer Gyula, said Hungary's
entry into the NATO would mean Hungarian armies sent abroad, NATO
forces stationed in Hungary and nuclear weapons deployed on
Hungary's territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hungary's military spending would be drastically
increased.
</P>
<P>
He viewed it as necessary for Hungary to strengthen its
national defense. However, defense spending would be controlled in
the hands of other countries if Hungary took the road to join
military organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was Munkdaspart that first advocated holding a referendum on
the NATO issue, he said, calling for people's active participation
in the referendum scheduled for November 16 and their vote against
entry into the NATO.

<HEADLINE> Food Gap Widening in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Specific actions are needed
to avert the growing food gap -- the difference between developing
world production and demand, the International Food Policy
research Institute (IFPRI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Food production could fail to keep with increases in the demand
for food by growing population in many developing countries and
the food gap will more than double by then, making some of the
world's poorest countries even more vulnerable to hunger and
possible famine, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, the food gap in wheat, rice, corn and other cereals is
expected to grow from its present 94 million tons in 1993 to 228
million tons, said the IFPRI, one of the 16 research centers
within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
While the number of children who are malnourished or
underweight is projected to drop worldwide in the next 20 years,
the percentage of malnourished children in Sub-Saharan Africa is
expected to jump by 45 percent to 40 million. And two out of five
children in South Asia will still go without enough to eat by
2020.
</P>
<P>
During the next 25 years, an increasing share of food in
developing countries will have to come from developed countries
and many of the low-incoming nations will not be able to generate
the necessary foreign reserves to buy the food in the world
market, the IFPRI said.
</P>
<P>
Although the world food stocks have been building up gradually
since it hit a 20-year low of 250 million tons in 1995-1996, the
ratio of stocks to consumption remains below the level to provide
a margin of safety necessary for world food security, it said.
</P>
<P>
The research center called on the developing countries to
ensure that their policies promote broad-based economic growth,
especially agricultural growth, to produce either enough food or
enough income to import food.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the policymakers in developed countries to
reverse the decline in aid flows and redirect aid to the most
vulnerable developing nations.

<HEADLINE> UK to Unveil Proposals for More Women in Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson disclosed today that the number of women in the British
armed forces is to be increased.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC television that he planned to give details of the
plan at the start of a two-day House of Commons debate on the
government's strategic defense review Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be able to make an announcement in the defense
debate tomorrow about expanding the armed forces to allow more
women to come into the services," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether women would be allowed to serve in the front line,
he pointed to the use of women on Royal Navy ships.
</P>
<P>
He said that traditionalists had seen that initiative as heresy
but that it had worked "extremely well."
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary added that more members of ethnic
minorities should also be attracted into the British military and
he would make more army posts accessible to women compared with
the current less than half of those jobs open to them.
</P>
<P>
"Strong defense of the country does not just equate with big
ships or big guns. It means people," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Reluctant to Finance Southeast Asia's Rescue Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin today pledged U.S. backing for troubled Southeast
Asian economies but would not take up another Mexico-style
bailout by the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Hong Kong stock market plunge which shook the
financial world, the treasury secretary said the key to a lasting
solution is in the hands of the region. He also noted that outside
help must be directed mainly through multinational agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The countries themselves have to re-establish sound policy
regimes," Rubin said on ABC's program "This Week."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to help neighboring Mexico get rid of the currency
crisis, the United States initiated a 50 billion U.S. dollar loan
package in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I think the world community is clearly strong enough to
overcome this problem," Rubin said. But he said more money from
international financial agencies, most noticeably the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, financed by
the United States and others may be needed.
</P>
<P>
The United States is "part of a much larger process," Rubin
said, and is working on a "multilateral response that will be
focused around the IMF and World Bank."
</P>
<P>
Thailand received a 17.5 billion dollar internationally
sponsored aid package in July, the second largest of its kind
after bailout that helped Mexico solve its peso crisis.

CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting was held
here today among Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat and Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks centered on the latest developments in the
Arab-Israeli negotiations, with special attention being given to

</P>
<P>
The three leaders also discussed a number of Arab, regional and
international issues of mutual concern. No further details were
available.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak hosted a dinner in honor of Arafat and Saleh in which
they continued their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president arrived here this evening for a two-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Concerned over Russia's Aid to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed his concern to Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov about the alleged Russian assistance to
Iran in developing missile and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after a two-hour meeting with
Primakov, Netanyahu said he had discussed with the visiting
Russian minister Israel's concern about the threat posed by Iran
in developing various weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
"We are, as you know, concerned with the issue of Iran's
various weapon systems. And we are trying to have a common basis
of the fact in order to try to address something
that ... concerns Israel a great deal," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu praised Russia for its role as the co-sponsor,
together with the United States, of the Israeli-Arab peace
process since the 1991 Madrid conference and for its mediation
efforts in defusing the tension between Israel and Syria last
year. He added that Israel is looking forward to such positive
contributions from Russia to advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is one of main concerns of his government
to turn a new page in the Israeli-Russian relationship by
developing it in the spirit of friendship and promoting mutual
interests.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Primakov, who arrived here today from Damascus,
denied once again the reports that Russia had transferred any
technology that could promote Iran's massive destructive weapon
systems.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the same denial at his meeting earlier today
with his Israeli counterpart David Levy. Speaking to reporters
after his meeting with Levy, he denounced the reports about
Russian arms sales to Iran as rumors.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister said he had discussed with Netanyahu all
aspects of the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process, including the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the
deadlock in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks. He expressed the
hope that the Middle East would achieve a stable peace, to
which Russia would continue making its contributions.
</P>
<P>
On his talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Primakov
said that Assad had reaffirmed his commitment to continuing the
peace process with Israel, but the Syrian leader insisted that
the talks would be restarted from the point where it was broke
off last year with Israel's previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been
deadlocked since early 1996, especially after the access to
power by Netanyahu's hardline government in May last
year. Although Israel has repeatedly called for the unconditional
resumption of the peace talks, Syria has been insisting that the
talks should not be resumed anew but start from the point when
they were suspended, namely on the promise made by the Labor
government to totally withdraw Israeli troops from the occupied
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The issue of South Lebanese conflict was also discussed during
the Netanyahu-Primakov meeting. Primakov said the Lebanon issue
was very important to achieve peace in the Middle East, adding
that Russia is ready to send its forces to South Lebanon to
participate in the peacekeeping efforts there.
</P>
<P>
His remarks confirmed earlier reports that Primakov, during his
talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-sharaa, reacted
favorably to the idea of Russia's participation of the
international monitoring committee observing the ceasefire
agreement between Israel and Hezbollah reached in April last
year. The current members of the observing committee are the
United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is to hold a meeting with Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon this evening, which is
believed to focus on a big deal on Israeli purchase of natural gas
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to award Moscow with some financial benefits
as a way to discourage the cash-strapped Russia from assisting
Iran's missile and nuclear programs for economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Primakow is also to hold further discussions
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Israeli
security concerns. He then will travel to the West Bank city
Ramallah to hold talks with officials of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) on advancing the peace process. It is not clear if
he would meet with PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is currently on a week-long Middle East tour that aims
to strengthen Russia's role in the Middle East peace process. The
tour has taken him to Lebanon and Syria, and will take him to the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and Egypt.
