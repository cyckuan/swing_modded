<HEADLINE> Iran Combats Drug Traffics at Great Cost: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian anti-drug official
said on Saturday that Iran pays a heavy price every year in combating
transit of narcotic drugs to Europe via Iranian territory, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Iranian anti-drug headquarters Mohammad Fallah
told a delegation from the International Narcotic Control Board (INCB)
that 80 Iranian policemen were killed and 200 others disabled in
anti-drug actions in the last Iranian calendar year (ended March 20).
</P>
<P>
Iran prevented transit of at least 25 tons of narcotic drugs to
Europe last Iranian year, Fallah said, adding that 195 tons of
different types of drugs have been seized across the country during
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that Iran deployed 30,000 security
personnel on its eastern borders and the Iranian army and the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps also joined them recently.
</P>
<P>
He said some 8,000 foreign nationals are now held in Iranian
prisons for involvement in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Head of the INCB delegation, whose name was not revealed, said that
the international community supports Iran in its anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the INCB can launch an effective cooperation with
Iran and that the international community would play an appropriate
role in anti-drug campaign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes 5.9 Bln Dlr Budget for Kosovo Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
worked out details of an emergency 5.9 billion dollar budget for
its operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The spending package will cover the cost of U.S. participation
in the NATO airstrikes and relief operation for refugees, AP
reported Saturday, quoting a senior government official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will formally present the request to
the Congress early next week, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected
to ask President Clinton to approve the call-up of some 33,000
military reservists, including up to 25,000 Air National Guard
members in units that fly aerial refueling missions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the
administration would probably ask for 3 billion to 4 billion
dollars for the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress are reportedly pressing for spending
of from 10 billion dollars to 18 billion dollars to beef up the
armed forces in the military operation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cost of the air war in Yugoslavia so far is likely to
be more than 2 billion dollars, perhaps far more, House
Appropriations Chairman Bill Young said.
</P>
<P>
"You know, you just can't go to war and take it out of petty
cash," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the Pentagon has offered no cost estimates, an
independent research group estimated the cost of the war so far
at 450 million to 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group says the costs will grow roughly half a billion
dollars every 10 days the air campaign continues, and will
explode if ground forces are deployed.
</P>
<P>
"You are looking at between 40 million and 55 million dollars
a day," said Leisl Heeter, analyst at the Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments.
</P>
<P>
Cruise missiles run 1 million to 2 million dollars apiece,
depending on the type. The precise bombs dropped from warplanes
vary greatly in cost, from 6,000 dollars to 320,000 dollars each
while unguided munitions are from 300 dollars to 47,500 dollars
each.

<HEADLINE> Over 200 Protesters Rally Against NATO Outside White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 demonstrators rallied
outside the White House Saturday, protesting NATO's airstrikes
against Yugoslavia and calling the Western media to stop telling
lies about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At about noon, the protesters gathered at the pavement of
Pensylvania Avenue outside the White House, raising signs "No
NATO's Aggression of Yugoslavia" and chanting slogans like "Stop
the bombing now."
</P>
<P>
They then marched onto the 14th Street, where the National
Press Club (NPC) is located.
</P>
<P>
While passing by the building of the NPC, the protesters
shouted slogans against influential TV programs in the United
States. "ABC (the American Broadcasting Company), shame on you,"
"Stop lies, tell the true!" they shouted.
</P>
<P>
"Those TV programs always tell big lies on Kosovo," said a
woman who refused to be identified, adding that the refugee crisis
in Kosovo was caused by NATO's airstrikes, not by the Serb
authorities.
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. and its NATO allies started bombing Yugoslavia
on March 24, miserable images of refugees escaping from Kosovo
were shown on TV screens across the country and the Serbian
authorities were blamed of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
Sherin Cesi, who works for the International Action Center,
said both the Albanians and the Serbs were killed in NATO's
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"If you go there to protect humanity, why should you (NATO)
bomb the refugees who are returning home?" she asked, referring to
NATO's bombing on a refugees convoy Friday with dozens of refugees
killed.
</P>
<P>
Another angry protester, Alex Renko, told Xinhua that the
American people need know the truth of the war. "The war is
against the United Nations Charter, against international law,
against NATO's charter and against the U.S. constitution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"What is the real purpose of NATO's bombing? NATO wants to
expand eastward and threaten Russia next. NATO needs to test its
weapons. The U.S. military-industrial complex wants the budget
surplus spent its way, regardless of lives lost, or burden to the
tax payers," Renko said.
</P>
<P>
Renko called the audience to go to the website:
www:iacenter.org, to find truth about the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Anti-war flyers were distributed to pedestrians. One of them
read: "Stop the bombing and killing of innocents, support our
troops by bringing them home."
</P>
<P>
"Bombing is a massacre of innocent lives and a war crime! Our
pilots should not be made into cold-blooded killers!" read the
flyer.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria not to Withdraw From S. Leone without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo said Saturday that the west African peace-keeping troops
ECOMOG would not be withdrawn from Sierra Leone without adequate
security provisions for that country.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the head of state (General Abdulsalami Abubakar) nor
myself will withdraw troops without making sure that there are
sufficient and adequate security to safeguard smooth democratic
governance in that country," Olusegun emphasized, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Accra shortly before he left the
capital of Ghana for Lome, Togo on the last leg of his global
tour.
</P>
<P>
However, he intimated that ECOMOG, which is dominated by
Nigerian troops cannot remain in Sierra Leone forever, saying that
arrangements must be made for them to return home "sooner or
later."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sierra Leone requires a permanent solution
and not military solutions, which he termed as "temporary
solutions".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president-elect said he has had the occasion to
consult with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who indicated that
something positive will be done to bring a lasting solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who told journalists during his visit to Ghana last
September that he was not going to contest the elections, said he
reversed the decision to satisfy the will of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Nigeria called on me as an experienced
statesman to intervene and reconstruct with reconciliation. You
may say never but cannot do otherwise if the people say ever."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who will take office next month said he does not
anticipate the problem of ethnicity as was with some past
governments because his victory cuts across ethnic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most African leaders whose support come from their
tribe, he said, he was fortunate to have enjoyed a massive support
from outside his home province.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes he would sustain the balance. "The
support will continue to come through performance... by showing
that we are a government for all the people of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Obasanjo and his entourage held talks with
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings and met with traditional rulers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leone Rebels to Hold Peace Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Sierra leone rebels are expected to
hold peace talks with the government of President Tejan Kabbah in
a bid to end the nine-year civil war in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Final preparations for the travel of jailed rebel leader Foday
Sankoh to Togo were ready Friday when the United Nations lifted
the travel ban on him, a day after the Sierra Leone Appeal Court
agreed to release him temporarily.
</P>
<P>
A Sierra Leonean government spokesman said Friday that Sankoh
would be flown to Togo Saturday accompanied by U.N.
representatives and was expected to consult his followers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Following the face-to-face meeting with his followers, Sankoh
would hold peace talks with the Kabbah government to try to bring
peace to the war- ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The decision to release him and allow him to travel to Togo for
meeting with his supporters are described as the most important
step toward peace in the west African country for several years.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has been in detention since he was picked up on arms
offenses in Nigeria in early 1997 and was sentenced to death last
October as his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) briefly shared
power with renegade army officers in Freetown between May 1997 and
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The RUF invaded Freetown early last January, and some 6,000
people were reportedly killed in the ensuing violence between the
west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Kabbah government welcomed the Appeal Court's decision, and
called Sankoh's travel to Togo "a mission of national importance"
and "another important milestone in the peace process" in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Since the RUF took up arms in 1991, at least 20,000 people have
been killed in Sierra Leone where almost every infrastructure,
especially those outside the capital, has been crippled by the
war.
</P>
<P>
The Togo meeting is scheduled to be held in Kara, the birth
place of President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who is to host
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The eventual meeting is seen as a crucial precursor to
full-scale peace talks between the rebels and the Kabbah
government, coming at a time when Sierra leone's security
situation is precarious.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said Thursday that Kambia on the border with
Guinea in the north was now free of rebels while the northern town
of Makeni, Sierra Leone's third largest city, remains a rebel
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
In the east, the sources said, rebels still control Kailahun
which is the main base of the rebel movement while the Freetown
peninsula remains in the hands of the ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff Air Marshal Al-Amin
Daggash announced in capital Abuja Thursday that the ECOMOG would
begin to pull its 15,000-strong troops out of Sierra leone later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Defense chiefs of countries with troops in Sierra Leone ended a
one-day extraordinary meeting in Abuja Thursday with a call on
ECOWAS members to support the on-going rebuilding of the Sierra
Leone armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's former army, which sided with the RUF, was
demobilized by ECOMOG last year when the latter reinstated the
democratically elected President Kabbah after he was overthrown by
the military junta.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild the army, 500 officer cadets have been
sent for training in Nigeria while the rest of the 5,000-strong
army is being trained locally by Nigerian and British officers.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the Kabbah government is desperate for a peace
pact with the rebels in the upcoming peace talks next week.
</P>
<P>
Unless the talks succeed, the capital city of Freetown could be
laid open within weeks to a new rebel assault, they added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Holds Talks with Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
held talks with his Libyan counterpart Muammar Gaddafi in the town
of Sirte in Libya Saturday evening on the Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office said here that
the discussions focused on the situation in the Great Lakes
region, especially that in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila, who arrived at the Sirte air base
a few minutes before Museveni, also attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest effort made toward ending the
eight-month-long war in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila had long refused to talk face to face with the Tutsi
rebels fighting to oust him before showing some willingness to do
so recently.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi rebels, allegedly backed by Uganda and Rwanda, have
made some gains in the front line, exerting more pressure on the
Kabila administration.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, accompanied by State Minister of Defense Steven
Kavuma and State Minister of Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi,
left here for Libya Saturday morning for a short official visit to
the northern African country.

WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party of the
United States announced that it will hold its national convention
for the 2000 presidential election in Los Angeles on August 14-17.
</P>
<P>
"On August 17, 2000, a new Democratic candidate will answer his
party's call to lead America into the next frontier," party
Chairman Joe Andrew said here Friday in announcing the convention
dates.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee announced last month that Los
Angeles had been chosen as the convention city. It is the first
time that the convention will be held in this city in 40 years.
The last Democratic convention held there was in 1960, when John
F. Kennedy was nominated as president.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party will hold its 2000 national convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the 2000 presidential election are expected
to be nominated from both parties at their national conventions.

<HEADLINE> 4 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S., British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that 10
formations of enemy warplanes of F-14, F-15 and F-16 coming from
Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace from 12:35 local
time (0835 GMT) to 15:45 local time (1145 GMT) and attacked civilian
facilities as well as military sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defenses fired surface-to-air missiles at the enemy
planes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases also violated
Iraq's southern airspace earlier in the day, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, two Iraqi civilians were killed and nine others
injured when U.S. and British warplanes attacked civilian and military
targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's United States-British airstrikes against
Iraq, U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly zones in Iraq have
clashed with Iraqi air defenses almost on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shitte Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed to continue confronting any allied planes violating
its airspace.

LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The consultative committee meeting
on the implementation of a cease-fire agreement in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) ended here Saturday morning with the
committee expressing disappointment at rebels' decision to walk
out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft statement released by Zambia's State
House, delegates of the Congolese rebels fighting to topple
President Laurent Kabila who were attending the meeting for the
first time walked out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement states that the delegates requested to hold
bilateral talks with the delegation from the DRC and that this
forms the only agenda item.
</P>
<P>
Their request was turned down by the chairman of the talks who
said the committee had no mandate to facilitate the talks within
that framework.
</P>
<P>
The statement further states that delegates from the DRC had
however agreed to hold a meeting with the rebels in a different
framework.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which started Thursday went ahead without the
rebels and the committee hoped that the rebels would be involved
in the peace process in future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both the rebels and the delegation from the Congolese
 government expressed their commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Countries that sent representatives to the talks included
Angola, DRC, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) were
also present while Chad was represented by the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
the United Nations were not represented at the meeting.

TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Supreme Commander Wesley
Clark arrived Saturday morning in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, to
discuss the Kosovo crisis and issues related to NATO troops
stationed in the neighboring country of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for NATO troops in Macedonia, Verdock Dirk, was
quoted by the Albanian news agency ATA as saying that Clark had
requested meeting with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and
Prime Minister Ljubko Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
Clark will also meet with officers of the 12,000 NATO troops
currently stationed in Macedonia, which borders Kosovo, the
southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia had maintained that it would not allow NATO troops to
launch a ground offensive against any of its neighboring countries
from its soil. But it said now it needed parliamentary approval to
allow foreign troops to enter Kosovo in case of a NATO ground
operation.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian Defense Ministry spokesman said that from Skopje,
Clark will travel to Tirana, capital of Albania, later Saturday to
meet with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko and Defense
Minister Luan Hajdaraga.
</P>
<P>
During his short stay here, the 54-year-old U.S. general was
also scheduled to visit NATO troops deployed in the military

<HEADLINE> Clark Pledges to Protect Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The NATO supreme commander, Wesley
Clark, said Saturday that the Western military alliance will give
protection to Albania and other neighboring countries of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general made the pledge during his talks here Saturday
afternoon with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the meeting that NATO will continue and
intensify its on-going air campaign against Yugoslavia and make
every effort to help maintain stability in Yugoslavia's
neighboring countries including Albania.
</P>
<P>
He accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of threatening
security in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it is a very important matter for
NATO to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
countries surrounding Yugoslavia, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO knew Yugoslavia has a plan to threaten
Albania and other countries and it will try every means to prevent
these countries from being attacked by Yugoslavia, which has been
subject to intensive NATO air strikes for more than three weeks
now.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that he discussed with Majko and Albanian Defense
Minister Luan Hajdaraga what he said the artillery shootings by
Serbian troops at northern Albania, especially the Serbian
infantry's threat against Albania.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that Yugoslavia halt these actions.
</P>
<P>
The NATO supreme commander said that NATO has two kinds of
forces in Albania -- one carrying out humanitarian tasks and the
other manning and supporting the Apache military helicopters,
which he said will arrive in Albania "very shortly."
</P>
<P>
Clark, who arrived here earlier Saturday from Skopje, capital
of Macedonia, also denied that NATO has made any coordination or
communication with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which has
been fighting Serbian soldiers and paramilitary police for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia saw the KLA as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
During his short visit to Macedonia, Clark threatened to
destroy whatever Milosevic regards important to him if the
Yugoslav president does not change his current policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said here Saturday that military action by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia has not
resolved the problems in Kosovo, but has made them worse.
</P>
<P>
"Military intervention has not solved problems. It has made
them worse and will not solve any problems in future," Simitis
said while addressing a meeting of his ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the developments in Kosovo as a potential threat to
peace and stability in the Balkan region, he said that Greece will
not participate in military operations against Belgrade and
stressed Athens' opposition to any act which may lead to a change
of existing borders.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that his government will continue its efforts
in seeking a political solution to the crisis not only at next
week's NATO summit in Washington but also through visits by Greek
ministers to other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prolonged crisis in Kosovo has already had
repercussions for Greece by reducing this year's growth rate from
3.5 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that
it is now time for political initiatives to bring an end to the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The European Union must work to safeguard the role of the
United Nations so that efforts to replace the U.N.'s role with a
new role for NATO do not bear fruit, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club to Reduce Zambia's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Club meeting has agreed
to reduce and restructure a major part of Zambia's external debt,
the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a statement from the Paris Club meeting, which ended
Friday, as saying that the amount of debt to be treated under the
agreement is close to one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of creditor countries also agreed to recommend
writing off 67 percent of debt service obligations due under
eligible loans and credits.
</P>
<P>
The other option will be a consolidation at concessionary rates
so as to reduce by 67 percent in net present value the payments
due on eligible loans and credits with a payment period of 33
years.
</P>
<P>
The representatives noted that Zambia's low per capita income
and heavy debt burden call for strong adjustment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Resumes Urgent Food Aid to W. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP)
</P>
<P>
announced here Saturday that it has resumed sending relief food
convoys to Western Uganda after a temporary halt to the operation
last week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food aid agency began dispatching food to the area 12
days ago, but had to suspended last week due to an increase in
attacks and ambushes on commercial transporters.
</P>
<P>
"We have been forced to arrange military escorts to accompany
our food convoys to ensure that transporters can travel safely and
the food reaches those who need it," said Michael Jones, WFP's
deputy country director for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of trucks carrying 70 tons of WFP food supplies
arrived safely in Bundibugyo town in Western Uganda early this
week.
</P>
<P>
The aid agency estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 Ugandans living
in the Western district of Bundibugyo have become displaced over
the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the area indicate that Ugandan rebels from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been violently attacking
villagers, killing people and burning houses before retreating to
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming increasing difficult to find transporters
willing to risk their lives to carry relief supplies to this
area," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
WFP is currently sending to the area a total consignment of 200
tons of maize, beans, oil and corn-soya blend, which will be
enough to feed 30,000 of the neediest people for one month.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the food has now arrived in the area. The WFP
plans to send the remaining supplies over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been operational in Uganda for the past 35 years.
The agency also currently provides support to development projects
in the areas of education, vocational training, food security and
agricultural activities.

<HEADLINE> Drug Situation Much Improved in Singapore Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE April 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Home
Affairs Wong Kan Seng said here Saturday that the number of drug
abusers in Singapore has shrank significantly from its peak in
1994 as a result of efforts and measures undertaken by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Wong told a national seminar on drug abuse that the number of
heroin abusers fell by 37 percent in 1998 compared to 1994 when
6,165 of drug abusers were arrested.
</P>
<P>
New heroin abusers fell by even greater percentage, Wong said,
comparing the 428 abusers arrested in 1998 and the high of 1246 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The relapse rate has fallen to 54 percent in 1998 from a high of
81 percent in 1994, Wong added.
</P>
<P>
Wong attributed the good results to tough law in tandem with
intensive enforcement efforts as well as to community involvement
</P>
<P>
One of the key ideas in the Singapore 21 vision, which Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong will be launching next week, is "Active
Citizenship", he said, adding that it is getting Singaporeans to
actively contribute their time and energy to build a better
Singapore and entails citizens taking ownership of society's
problems and sharing responsibility, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the community in drug prevention has paid
dividends, Wong Said, citing the Malay self-help groups have
managed to bring down the number of Malay heroin abusers by 36
percent from 3,209 in 1994 to 2,059 last year.
</P>
<P>
Wong also said one of the challenges Singapore is facing is the
fight against new drugs of abuse, in particular Amphetamines-Type
Stimulants or ATS such as "Ecstasy" and "Ice".
</P>
<P>
The number of "Ecstasy" abusers has decreased to 180 last year
from 661 in 1996 while "Ice" abusers increased from 5 in 1996 to
117 last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged harder work and closer cooperation in a bid to sustain
and extend the achievements made in the heroin situation to new
challenges ahead.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Pledges Coop with Incoming Nigerian Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
Saturday pledged Ghana's cooperation with the incoming Nigerian
government for the sustenance of peace and stability in the west
Africa sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Nigerian president-elect Olusengu
Obasanjo would pay attention to the challenges facing the region,
notwithstanding domestic issues, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not live in isolation, therefore the peace and stability
of others in the region should be of equal concern to us,"
Rawlings said in his welcoming remarks for Obasanjo shortly before
they went into closed-door talks.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo arrived in Accra, Ghanaian capital, early Saturday
with a team of politicians and businessmen for a one-day visit as
part of his global tour.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said it is necessary for leaders of the sub-region,
particularly those of Ghana and Nigeria, to provide the right
leadership to create the appropriate atmosphere to sustain
stability.
</P>
<P>
He commended Nigeria for its consistent commitment to the
challenges over the years, saying the country has never abdicated
its responsibility not only to its people but also to the entire
continent.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings congratulated Obasanjo, who will assume office next
month, for winning the honor and confidence of his people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that he is assuming the mantle with a
great deal of goodwill and determination to overcome the
complexities that go with it in order to build on the foundation
laid by General Abdusalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said he has always ''regarded Ghana as a true friend
and a brother of Nigeria,'' hence the visit.
</P>
<P>
"My visit is a friendly one and a goodwill one to a brother,"
he told Rawlings, adding that he decided to visit Ghana before he
assumes the hectic office.
</P>
<P>
He said he credits every opportunity he has had in life to
Ghana as his "beginning place''.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo commended the government and people of Ghana for
supporting his country throughout its (Nigeria's) turbulent
period.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Ghana's leadership role in the search for
peace and stability in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said while in Ghana, he would discuss bilateral and
multi- lateral issues with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
James Victor Gbeho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed the
hope that consultations with the president-elect will boost
efforts of Ghana and Nigeria for the advancement of the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo and his entourage will meet with the Nigerian
community in Accra before leaving for Lome, Togo.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal on
Saturday called for further expansion of bilateral ties and
cooperation in their first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal, who arrived here on Saturday morning for a three-day
official visit, said that the political systems in Yemen and Iran, the
peoples' increasing role in the economic, political and cultural
arenas and their commonalties are grounds for further expansion of
mutual cooperation and understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen's foreign policy is based on maintaining good
relations with neighbors and establishing peace and stability in the
region, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Tehran-Sana relations and regional cooperation
between the two sides would be upgraded in light of their religious
and historical commonalties.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Gulf is a highly sensitive and strategic
region and that Iran strongly believes security and stability in the
region should be preserved by regional states.
</P>
<P>
Detente, confidence-building and cooperation among regional states
have been given priority in Iran's foreign policy, the Iranian
minister said, adding that exchange of talks among regional states
would foil conspiracies of those who are against friendship among
regional nations.

Calling for efforts to ease tensions and hold dialogs, he said
that good relations among regional states would help the peace
process, stability and economic development in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top legislator
Li Peng on Saturday called on Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej
and Queen Sirikit Kittiyakara and discussed with them bilateral

</P>
<P>
This was the fourth meeting between the King and Li Peng,

Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
The King said Thailand and China have maintained friendly

visited China are greatly impressed by the achievements China has
made, the King said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for the achievements made by
China at a time when crises are hampering the region and the world
as a whole. This was because China was able to properly adapt
itself to the changing situation, therefore enabling itself to
achieve economic development, he added.
</P>

government and the National Assembly for the warm reception
extended to him during his stay in Thailand. He said he had held
fruitful talks with Thai government and parliament leaders.

His visit, Li Peng said, had promoted friendship between the
NPC and the National Assembly and boosted bilateral relations as a
whole.

Li Peng voiced belief that Thailand, with its economic
potentials and natural advantages, could overcome the current
difficulties and achieve economic recovery through painstaking
efforts.

with and supported each other, and maintained consultations and
cooperation on international and regional issues, Li Peng said.

developed in the future.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says No Fresh Information On Incidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A NATO spokesman said here
Saturday that no further information about the bombing tragedy of
civilian convoys could be provided so far as related investigation
is still going on.
</P>
<P>
NATO civilian spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters that he had,
during the last 24 hours, received no new information on the
convoy incidents.
</P>
<P>
"I'v made clear that if I have fresh information, I will pass
it on. But the investigation to put the effects on the table
continues. So that is the best and most honest answer that I can
give you."
</P>
<P>
However, a journalist still asked "quite simply questions"
about how many attacks that NATO plains made on the road west of
Djakovica Wednesday and how many bombs they dropped, he also asked
how many Yugoslav fielded forces and armored forces in Kosovo have
been damaged by NATO forces. NATO military spokesman Giuseppe
Marani said the answer is no for both questions. "I cannot tell,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea explained that military commanders will be going to make
overall assessment in the next few days "as we begin to prepare
for the Washington summit."
</P>
<P>
"So once the assessment had been put together, obviously we'll
share the result with you that we can share, that exercise is on
going and will be submitted to the NATO ambassadors in the course
of the week before they leave on Thursday for Washington," Shea
told a daily news briefing at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Usually, NATO gives relatively detailed information about the
development of air strikes against Yugoslavia. But many
journalists here were frustrated by NATO's reluctance to provide
information on the attack on civilian convoys, in which more than
70 civilian Albanian refugees were reportedly killed by NATO's
laser-guided missiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, Northeast China, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Asian
Games triple gold medalist Chen Hua won her second gold here when
she grabbed an individual title at the Chinese National Swimming
Champions Meet entered the second day here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She won the 800m freestyle event Saturday evening by clocking
eight minutes 41.46 seconds, much slower than her 10th-ranked 1998
time of 8:39.40.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a 17-year-old freestyle specialist from East China's
Zhejiang Province, was a member of her native team which won
Friday's women's 4x200 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who won the 400m and 800m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle
relay events at the Bangkok Games last December, qualified for the
finals here with the fastest time from Friday's heats.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying from the People's Liberation Army's Guangzhou units
won her specialist event of 50m freestyle in 26.14 seconds. She
was ranked fourth in the world last year with a personal best time
of 25.36 of the year.
</P>
<P>
Asian Games champion Zeng Qiliang from south China's Guangdong
Province also won a second gold when he triumphed in the men's 100
m breaststroke in 1:01.89.
</P>
<P>
That time was 13 hundredths of a seconds slower than his best
time last year, which was ranked third in the year-ending world
rankings.
</P>
<P>
Zeng was chased neck-to-neck almost all the way by Asian Games
200m breaststroke champion Zhu Yi. Zeng only managed to edged his
closest rival in the final splash, winning by a narrow margin of
11 hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
Zeng has won Friday's men's 4x100 meter medley relay along with
his Guangdong teammates.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Yingjuan from Guangdong took the women's 100m backstroke
title in 1:03.53, beating triple gold-medalist Wu Yanyan into
second place.
</P>
<P>
Both Zeng Yingjuan and her coach Zhao Ge were not happy with
the result. She failed to sleep well for the last two weeks, which
might be blamed for a less impressive performance at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The team of Shandong added two more gold medals Saturday to
their opening triumph on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fu Yong won the men's 200m backstroke in 2:01.02 and Hao ping
took the women's 200m breaststroke with 2:32.98.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's Zheng Shibin and Guangzhou's Qin Caini split honors
in the two other individual events -- men's 400m freestyle and the
women's 200m freestyle, while the city of Xi'an won the day's only
relay event, the men's 4x200m freestyle relay.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Party to Help Yugoslavs in International Fora </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition party in Cyprus
Saturday expressed its willingness to speak on behalf of Yugoslavia in
international fora.
</P>
<P>
Two parliament deputies of Cyprus' Progressive Party of Working
People (AKEL), Nicos Katsourides and Doros Christodoulides, held a
press conference Saturday on their two-day visit in Belgrade earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
AKEL, winning 33 percent of the votes in the 1996 parliamentary
elections, is the main opposition left-wing party in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Katsoulides, also AKEL spokesman, said Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic told them his government is willing to accept a
"political, peaceful settlement" by conceding Kosovo self-government
that will take into consideration the rights and interests of all
ethnic groups living in the region.
</P>
<P>
It is also ready to accept the presence of political observers
during peace negotiations on condition that they are not from member
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations (NATO), he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO started its air strikes against Yugoslavia last month to
punish what they called Belgrade's refusal to accept a peace deal
with the independent-seeking Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Katsoulides said the Yugoslav government re-asserted it will not
accept foreign military presence in the country, a stance that has led
to the collapse of its peace talks with Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people consider the ongoing NATO attacks against their
country is only a beginning and the Western military bloc will
also target other nations in the future, the AKEL deputy said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Yugoslavs do not rule out the possibility of a
NATO ground operation in their country soon and believe that such a
move would lead to an overall conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If a land operation begins, they believe that the hostilities will
last for years," Katsoulides noted.

<HEADLINE> OAU Should End Eritrea-Ethiopia War: Eritrea Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) must speed up the implementation of last year's peace plan
to end the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Eritrean
special envoy Kashai Ambemicael said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to end the conflict since it has claimed many
lives," Ambemicael, who is Eritrea's Minister of Foreign Affairs,
told reporters here, after delivering a special message to
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe from Eritrean President Isayas
Afewerki.
</P>
<P>
Ambemicael updated Mugabe, who is chairman of the OAU conflict
resolution committee, on the fighting between the two neighbors
and diplomatic efforts that have been going on to end the war.
</P>
<P>
The conflict, Ambemicael said, should be solved through legal
and peaceful means by the demarcation of a boundary.
</P>
<P>
Since last May, the two countries have been fighting over a
1,000-km- long border strip both sides claim.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is part of a heads-of-state group tasked with seeking a
diplomatic solution to the war. The group includes presidents of
Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Citizens In Zimbabwe Protest Against NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Yugoslav citizens in
Zimbabwe's capital Harare Saturday protested at the U.S. embassy
against continuing air raids on Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Nikola Vukman, spokesman for the demonstration, said the
protest was part of an international day of protest being carried
out in several other countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He said the protesters were particularly irked that NATO
targeted the entire population of Yugoslavia, and such civilian
infrastructure as schools, hospitals and industry had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"More than 600 civilians have been killed and 3,000 wounded
since March 24 when the bombings began," he said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters brandished placards with such messages as
"Clinton, thank you for ethnic cleaning" and "Stop NATO raids".

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urged to Protect Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 320 Iranian journalists on
Saturday urged President Mohammad Khatami to protect journalists in
the country after a moderate daily was closed down by the conservative
revolutionary court.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Khatami, the journalists called on the Iranian
president to provide special legal services and protection to
journalists and to investigate press violations in accordance with the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Iranian revolutionary court ordered to
close down the daily Zan (Women) until further notice for publishing a
letter of Farah Diba, the ousted Iranian queen and a caricature making
fun of "blood money" -- a compensation paid by killers to the victim's
family.
</P>
<P>
However, Managing Director of the moderate Persian-language daily
Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, rejected the accusation that the publication of Farah's
message on March 21, the begining of the new Iranian year, was
publicity for the former Iranian shah regime.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the closure of the daily was a political campaign
initiated by the hard-line conservatives against the moderates, the
main supporters of President Khatami's open-minded policies.
</P>
<P>
The journalists said in their letter that the ban on the Zan
newspaper by the revolutionary court violated Article 168 of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, press violations should be looked into in
an open court session and in the presence of a jury, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
They called for an immediate end to "illogical and illegal methods"
in dealing with the press and asked Khatami to clearly define the
categories of press violations so as to prevent anyone taking
advantages of the ambiguities in the definition.
</P>
<P>
This will safeguard the independence, freedom and diversity of the
press, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Eight newspapers and weeklies were forced to close in the past year
and two other publications were on the verge of closure, the letter
noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers to Reform Economic Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the 15
European Union (EU) members Saturday called for a push to create
new frameworks for dealing with the economic problems in Europe
and to strengthen the financial systems for confronting the global
market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending a two-day informal meeting in Dresden,
Germany, sketched up a new structure that would draw governments,
the European Central Bank (ECB) and the unions together to solve
the common European economic problems, notably the high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers are considering a report for steps
aimed at avoiding the turmoil that recently hit the world money
markets, officials said. The report was issued by Hans Tietmeyer,
president of the German central bank Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, president of the ECB, together with heads of
the EU's 15 national central banks, also attended the meeting
chaired by the new German Finance Minister Hans Eichel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was not expected to make any decisions and was
aimed at building the foundation for the EU leaders' meeting and
the summit of the Group of Seven (G7) in the next months.
</P>
<P>
With this goal ahead, the ministers took a further step toward
the creation of a jobs pact and the moves to ensure closer
consultations between Europe's monetary authorities, national
governments and the social partners.
</P>
<P>
The proposed increased economic coordination would not hurt the
independence of the ECB, Eichel and Duisenberg ensured.
</P>
<P>
The ECB would not cooperate with any proposals which might
impinge on its performance, Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the success in promoting economic structure reform,
there were few signs at the Dresden meeting that any compromise
had been made on controversial plans of imposing a Europe-wide
saving tax cut with Britain and Luxembourg in opposition.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 50 Injured in London Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 people were injured in a
bomb blast in a busy shopping street in south London Saturday,
police said.
</P>
<P>
There was no warning before the bomb exploded around 5.30 p.m.
(1630 GMT) near an Iceland supermarket in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
Commander Hugh Ord told reporters 48 people were taken to three
hospitals for treatment, including a police officer. Two of the
victims, one of them a child, were seriously injured, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There was no warning from any of our recognized sources and it
is too early to speculate about the nature of the bomb," Ord said.
</P>
<P>
Shops and flats near the Iceland supermarket were damaged and
glass was scattered over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
One witness said the explosion happened when a boy moved a bag
that had been left between market stalls. The boy was said to have
suffered only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the New Scotland Yard said the bomb did not seem to be
related to any of the terrorist groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Home Office Secretary Jack Straw condemned the blast.
</P>
<P>
"This is an outrageous and mindless act. Our sympathies go out
to those injured and their families and the family of the injured
police officer," he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE>   Chen Hua loses in Chinese National Swimmig Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, Northeast China, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Asia
Games champion Chen Hua walked out of the swimming pool empty-
handed on Sunday for the first time since the Chinese national
swimming champions meet opened on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old native in east China's Zhejiang Province and
triple gold-medalist from last December's Bangkok Games had had
two titles from the first two days of the four-day event, which
also serves as a qualifier for the National Cities Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
But in Chen's speciality event of the women's 400 meters
freestyle Sunday night, Qin Caini representing southern Chinese
city of Guangzhou edged Chen by 34 hundredths of a second,
clocking four minutes 13.51 seconds to Chen's 4:13.85.
</P>
<P>
Although Qin's time was slower than her personal best, her
coach Wu Jicai looked happy. "It's obviously not her best
performance, probably because she has had various competitions
ever since the Asian Games. Her triumph was much owed to Chen's
sub-par performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Hua competed too much in recent months and is really
exhaulsted. What else can I ask for her?" said her coach Zhu
Zhigen.
</P>
<P>
Men's 200m breaststroke final was widely open, as predicted by
Chen Yunpeng, former head coach of China's national team, after a
surprisingly poor show in this morning's heats cost Asian Games
champion Zhu Yi's chance for the finals. Tao Rong, a fairly
unknown from Zhejiang Province took the title in 2:18.73.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xufeng from Guangdong, silver-medalist from the Asian Games
in Bangkok, won his specialist event of the men's 200m butterfly
in 2:01.09, which is 2.02 seconds slower than his national record.
</P>
<P>
Deng Qingsong from Heibei Province, 22, won the men's 100m
freestyle in 51.97 seconds. The event's Asian and Chinese national
record is 50.51, still held by Chinese Shen Jianqiang.
</P>
<P>
Pang Ran, a 18-year-old Beijing native but competing here for
central Chinese city of Wuhan, won the women's 100m butterfly in 1:
00.34, beating Asian Games silver-medalist Ruan Yi to second. Ruan,
ranked 17th in the world last year for the 100m event, won the 200
m butterfly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Asian Games champion Li Wei of a Shanghai native but entered
the event here in individual status, won the women's 100m
breaststroke in 1:01.03, much slower than her 1998 personal best
and seventh-ranked time of 1:08.76.
</P>
<P>
And a Wuhan city team completely formed with Beijing-native
swimmers won the day's only team event women's 4x100m freestyle
relay in 3:51.07. The swimmers are competing in the champions meet
since Beijing, as a municipality under central administration, is
not eligible for the Cities Games.
</P>
<P>
The national champions meet closes after eight more finals
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges U.N. Security Council to Help End NATO Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting top Chinese legislator
Li Peng has expressed the hope that the U.N. Security Council
would take effective measures to bring an end to the NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"China has always maintained that the Kosovo issue can only be
solved by peaceful means and political negotiations," Li Peng,
Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) of China, said here late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Security Council to help bring all parties
concerned back to the negotiating table to defuse the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
But he added that only through the acceptance and cooperation
of the Yugoslav government can all proposals for a peaceful
solution be successfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Of the various proposals aimed at solving the issue, we are
aware of Yugoslavia's position that calls for an end to the
airstrikes prior to the start of negotiations," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the argument advocating "human rights over
sovereignty" was in fact providing an theoretical excuse for
aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Such an argument was totally ridiculous, he told Chinese
reporters at a press conference before ending a four-day official
goodwill visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue, despite its complexity characterized by
ethnic contradictions, was an internal affair of Yugoslavia and
should be left for the Yugoslavian people to solve by themselves,
he said.
</P>
<P>
While expressing sympathy with the large numbers of Kosovo
people driven from their homes by the NATO airstrikes, Li Peng
reiterated China's opposition to the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"China staunchly opposes NATO's military interference," Li Peng
said, accusing the alliance of launching military strikes against
a sovereignty state without U.N. authorization, setting a very bad
precedent.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic problems in some Balkan countries have been left over
from history and should be resolved on the basis of respect for
each country's sovereignty, Li Peng said, stressing that "
sovereignty cannot be violated."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng pointed to the facts that NATO, despite its strikes by
sophisticated weaponry, has failed to force Yugoslavia to submit.
"This is out of NATO's expectations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was the last leg of Li Peng's six-nation tour which
also took him to Greece, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Police Begin Hunting for London Bomber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Police started on Sunday to hunt
for the bomber who was behind the explosion on shoppers in south
London on Saturday evening, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Commander Hugh Orde, Metropolitan Police head of crime for
south-west London, said officers were keeping an open mind about
who planted the device, but he branded those responsible as "
disturbed."
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people remain in hospital following Saturday's nail-
bomb attack at a busy Brixton market, which injured 48 shoppers,
four seriously.
</P>
<P>
The street remains cordoned off on Sunday as police continue
searching for evidence.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Northern Ireland paramilitary groups has
been ruled out by Scotland Yard, but the motive of the blast
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
Police said the device appeared to be aimed at harming people,
not property. It was planted next to a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources say two of the most seriously hurt patients
may be blinded because of injuries to the eyes from flying nails
and glass.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw condemned the blast, describing the
incident as "an outrageous and mindless act."

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Protect Yellow River Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A green project aimed at improving
the ecological environment of the fountainhead of the Yellow River,
was launched today in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The 20 million yuan project is the first in a series of actions
to protect the "mother rivers", which will be launched by the
Chinese government this year.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Plateau is the place where the Yellow, Yangtze and
Lancang rivers arise. Experts said that the ecological changes on
the plateau will have a major impact on the water volume and
quality in the middle and lower reaches of those rivers.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the bad weather conditions and human activities,
the ecological environment in the area is degrading.
</P>
<P>
The Longyang Gorge, where a major hydropower station on the
Yellow River is located, will be the first area targeted by the
project, which is jointly sponsored by the Communist Youth League
of China, the National Greening Committee, the Ministry of Water
Resources and other organizations.

GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's longest suspension
bridge, the Humen Bridge over the Pearl River in Guangdong
Province in south China, which opened to traffic on a trial basis

</P>
<P>
Completion of the bridge, with a total length of 15.76
kilometers and a center span of 888 meters, and at a cost of 3.6
billion yuan (about 361 million US dollars), indicates that

<HEADLINE> China Hopes Pakistan, India Solve Disputes Through Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China always hopes that Pakistan
and India can solve their disputes through peaceful negotiations
instead of resorting to force, Li Peng, China's top legislator,
said here late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China does not want to see an arms race between the two
countries, since it is not in the interests of the peoples in the
South Asian region and is by no means conducive to the peace,
stability and development of the region, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China (NPC), made the remarks at a press conference
held on the eve of the ending of his six-nation tour, which has
brought him to Greece, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan and Bangladesh
before Thailand.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the medium-range missile India launched on
April is directed against China and how China deal with its
relations with Pakistan and India, Li said China holds peaceful
diplomatic policies of independence and self-reliance and
maintains good relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Helping each other whenever needed, China and Pakistan enjoy
time-tested friendship. "We are friends of all weathers," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China and India share a long border line, on which
the two countries have some disputes.
</P>
<P>
But bilateral relations between China and India have improved
since both sides made common efforts so that agreements could be
signed to guarantee peace in the border area.
</P>
<P>
As for the nuclear issue, Li said though China is a country
with nuclear weapons, it firmly sticks to the commitment not to
conduct further nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
China is very much concerned on the nuclear tests conducted by
India and Pakistan last year, which aggravated the tension in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We noticed that in both cases it was India that conducted
nuclear tests and launched medium-range missile first before
Pakistan followed suit," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the recent meeting between Indian and Pakistani
prime ministers in Lahore, Pakistan, at which the two prime
ministers expressed their willingness to solve all their disputes.

<HEADLINE> UN Staff Return to Afghan City of Kandahar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An eight-member team of U.N.
international staff Sunday returned to the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar, the stronghold of the Taliban militia, to monitor relief
activities.
</P>
<P>
The News Network International quoted Stephanie Bunker, a U.N.
official here, as saying that the team will stay in Kandahar till
Wednesday (April 21) and will hold meetings with the local U.N.
staff and non-governmental organizations about the relief
operations there.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. international workers were pulled out of war-torn
Afghanistan in August last year following killings of three U.N.
staff including two local workers and an Italian military
official.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Taliban signed a security agreement
for the return of the U.N. international staff in October last
year. Under the agreement, the Taliban are asked to provide
protection to the U.N. staff, its premises and to investigate into
the killings of the three U.N. staff members.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the U.N. announced plans to gradually send
humanitarian workers back to Afghanistan after reaching an
agreement with the Taliban to ensure safety and security of the
U.N. international and national staff.
</P>
<P>
Bunker said that the next team of the U.N. international staff
will proceed to the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad shortly to
review relief activities there.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said last week that he would
consider withdrawal of the U.N. staff from Afghanistan for the
second time if the Taliban leadership does not ensure their
safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. sources here said that the U.N. World Food
Program also plans to resume its relief operations in the northern
Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif, which it left in 1997 after massive
looting of its food stocks.

<HEADLINE>   African Runners Dominate London Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco
produced a superb display of front-running to win the London
Marathon in two hours seven minutes and 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a gritty little Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya grabbed
the second victory in her marathon career in the women's race with
a course record time of two hours 22 minutes and 21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Behind the elite runnners, a race-record total of 31,582 took
part in the 19th running of the gruelling race around central
London in a sunny but cold day.
</P>
<P>
El Mouaziz improved on his second place last year to cross the
finish line in the Mall in two hours, seven minutes and 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
With more than 14 kilometers to finish, the Moroccan began to
make a break and his gamble looked to have paid off as he forged a
two-minute lead over an illustrious pack.
</P>
<P>
But two-time champion Antonio Pinto of Portugal staged an
amazing late bid for victory, powering over the final stretches in
pursuit of the leader.
</P>
<P>
The gap proved too much for course record-holder Pinto, however,
as Mouaziz held on to win.
</P>
<P>
"After finishing the first half, I knew I was in the leading
group and I was almost sure at the moment that I will win," said
the Moroccan, who looked very tired at the finishing stage.
</P>
<P>
Abel Anton of Spain finished third at 2:09:41.
</P>
<P>
Josia Thugwane, the first black runner from South Africa to win
a gold medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games, was forced to drop out
after 35 kilometers due to bad chest and Kenyan Esther Kiplagat
retired after starting off of the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Chepchumba, who was third last year having
won in 1997, secured 125,000 U.S. dollars for running the "world
best time", after bettering the previous best by one second.
</P>
<P>
"I did not know it was a world best, but now I believe it," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan will collect a total of 235,000 U.S. dollars from
the race, according to organizers.
</P>
<P>
She shaved just three seconds of Romanian Lidia Simon's mark of
2:23:24, which the London organizers consider to be the world
record.
</P>
<P>
They had refused to recognize the official world best of 2:20.
47, clocked by Chepchumba's compatriot Teglas Loroupe in Rotterdam
last year, because it was set in a mixed race.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is better to run in women's only race," said the
Kenyan, who increased her speed after about 25 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"But I had some problem with my stomach then, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba was involved in an early tussle for the lead with a
group including favorite Elana Meyer of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Adriana Fernandez of Mexico then moved ahead of the field going
into the final stages - but Chepchumba forced her way to the front
three miles from home and never looked like being caught.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was second in 2:24:06 with Manuela Machado of
Portugal third at 2:25:08.
</P>
<P>
Heinz Frei of Switzerland won the men's wheelchair event for
the third time. He missed out on his own London record by seven
seconds but held off a determined challenge in the final stretch
to secure another victory.
</P>
<P>
And Monica Wedderstrom secured the spoils in the women's
wheelchair race for the second time.
</P>
<P>
She failed to improve on her course record but was well clear
of the field, with four times winner Tanni Grey of Britain
finishing in second spot.

the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

General Political Department, General Logistics Department and
General Armament Department said that President Jiang Zemin's call

healthy ethics is a strategic decision conducive to the prosperity
of the country, the construction of the Party and ensuring correct
guidance for troops.
</P>

They asked all the military area commands, the navy, air force,
second artillery force, and the armed police force to regard
education as an important measure to improve the Party's spirit
and work style.

<P>
They believe that the new situation of the opening up and
reform means that the army should be politically firm and should
give more emphasis to hi-technology.

</P>
<P>
The Briton parred the par-five 18th to beat American Andrew
Pitts, who had forced the additional holes with a birdie at the
last in regulation play.
</P>
<P>
Westwood, who finished sixth at the U.S. Masters last week,
scored the final round one-under-par 70 for a nine-under total of
275. It was Westwood's 14th career victory, his sixth in Asia and
his sixth in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
Pitts matched Westwood's birdie from 18 foot at the first
playoff hole but three-putted the second time around from 40 foot
for a bogey and defeat.
</P>
<P>
"I do all right in playoffs," said Westwood. "I have been in
seven and won six but this was the hardest to win."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Reigning champion Satoshi Oide closed with a 70 to tie
for third place with South Africa's James Kingston (67).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liangwei, China's number one, finished fifth for a five-
under-par total of 279 with four other players.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, Northeast China, April 18 (Xinhua) -- World champion
Chen Yan has withdrawn from the on-going Chinese national swimming
champions meet, her coach Han Bingyan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Chen has just resumed training for two weeks after a lay-off
for almost four months, due to medical treatment for her stomach
problems," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Chen, world record holder of women's 400 meters individual
medley, had entered for the 200m discipline scheduled for Monday,
which would have been her first race after the long rest.
</P>
<P>
"She is still quite weak although she is now four kilograms
heavier than before, with the weight put on during the treatment.
Her current weight of 63 kilograms is still not satisfactory for a
world-level swimmer standing 1.79 meters," Han said.
</P>
<P>
The national champions meet is the first qualifying tournament
for this September's National Cities Games in Xi'an. Now she has
to compete in the second such qualifier meet slated for June in
her native town of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for her is to get recovered, so as to
start real preparations for next year's Olympic Games in Sydney,"
Han added.

<HEADLINE> Defense Ministry Employees Demonstrate Over Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred representatives
of the Israeli Defense Ministry employees demonstrated in front of
the Prime Minister's residence Sunday, urging the government to
strike a wage deal with them.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moshe Arens met the demonstrators, saying he
supports their demand for wage increase.
</P>
<P>
But Arens called on them to cancel their demonstration and strike
which has lasted for weeks, and solve the problem through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry employees demand equal wage treatment with
other military services, threatening to continue strikes till their
demands are met.
</P>
<P>
The employees have refused to release military goods at Israeli
ports and airport, to arrange activities for ministry officers and to
handle the daily business at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The work stopage has badly affected the operations of certain
defense agencies in the country, which has also caused some worries
among the senior military brass.
</P>
<P>
But so far, the Finance Ministry has rejected to increase their
wage scales and reach any agreement with them.
</P>
<P>
In March, some 400,000 Israeli public sector workers launched a
nationwide strike, forcing the government to increase their wages by
about 4.8 percent.

<HEADLINE>   Sixers Iverson Blasts Barkley over His Magazine Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson minced no words
when asked to comment about Charles Barkley's assertion in this
week's Sports Illustrated that he "can't standed that guy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking with CNN, Iverson said, "I can't stand his fat ass
either. He needs to go lose some weight, then come back and try in
the next lifetime to win a championship."
</P>
<P>
Iverson was responding to remarks that Barkley made during an
interview in which Barkley mentioned his disdain for Iverson.
</P>
<P>
Barkey attacked the league's leading scorer. "He's showing no
respect to anyone, least of all the game," Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
Iverson apparently has mutual disrespect for its second-leading
rebounder.
</P>
<P>
"He's nobody," Iverson said. "How many years has he been in the
league, and he hasn't even won a championship. To me he hasn't
done anything. Right now, to me he's stealing money."
</P>
<P>
Iverson has come under fire recently for outwardly shunning
coach Larry Brown, even refusing to play the entire second half of
a game. While Barkley is not known as much for controversial
actions on the court, he is hardly understated off it.
</P>
<P>
"I've never criticized him before, but, now it's getting out of
hand," Iverson said. "Why am I on his mind? Why is he thinking
about me? Why is he worrying about me?"
</P>
<P>
"I've said it before, If Michael Jordan criticizes me, Magic
Johnson, Larry Bird, Isiah Thomas, then all right, maybe I'd have
to listen and do some soul searching. But Charles Barkely? He's
never won anything. He's been in this league this long and hasn't
won a championship."
</P>
<P>
Barkley said: "Iverson has to show up for practice every day.
He has a responsibility to cut the crap and not have some drama
with the coach every day.
</P>
<P>
Iverson's 76ers currently stand eighth in the Eastern
Conference, Barkley's Rockets fourth in the West.

WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chanda Rubin, who replaced
injured Lindsay Davenport, and Monica Seles beat their rivals
respectively Saturday to give the United States a 2-0 lead over
Croatia in the first round of the Federation Cup Tennis
Championship in New Jersey, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin used three hours to beat Iva Majoli 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 10-8,
while Seles needed just 63 minutes to oust Silvija Talaja 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The contest was shifted to the United States from Zagreb,
Croatia, because of NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough match," Rubin said. "I didn't feel like I was
playing really good tennis at the beginning, and both sets were
really tight. And going into the third I wanted to get some kind
of a rhythm."
</P>
<P>
Seles, the world's No. 3 player, controled the match throughout.
The players switch opponents Sunday. A doubles match between Lisa
Raymond and Seles and Majoli and Talaja will conclude the best-of-
five series.
</P>
<P>
In other World Group I matches Saturday, Slovakia took a 2-0
lead over Switzerland at Zurich. Russia and France were tied 1-1

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Construction of Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to ease the increasingly
acute energy shortage in the Yangtze River Delta, which is a
direct result of the rapid economic development, the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has announced that it is
stepping up efforts to build a 55 billion yuan gas pipeline
between Xinjiang and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The 4,200-kilometer pipeline, which will run through 10
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, will be
completed in the year 2007, Shi Xingquan, assistant general
manager of CNPC, revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline in the western part of the project
has been finished while it is estimated that it will cost a
further 100 billion yuan to build the eastern sections.
</P>
<P>
Once completed CNPC and the Chinese government believe it will
form a new growth point for local economic development and will
certainly boost the development of iron, steel, cement, machine-
building, electronics and the building industries in central and
western China.
</P>
<P>
Gas consumption in western China is negligible although it has
abundant oil and gas resources with proven gas reserves in the
area amounting to 1.5 trillion cubic meters. Annual gas production
capacity has already reached 18 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the central government has invested
heavily in the exploration of such resources in the area in a bid
to narrow the economic gap between eastern and western parts of
China. Gas will also play a major part in China's 21st century
plans to reduce the high pollution levels in its major cities and
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
To date four big gas fields have been discovered in China and
are fully operational in terms of extraction. They are located in
the Tarim and Qaidam basins, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region and
in eastern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, the Yangtze River Delta's annual demand for
gas is expected to reach 12 billion cubic meters within the next
five years. It says that with the completion of the pipeline, the
four fields will reportedly be able to supply 25 billion cubic
meters of gas a year to the Delta, much higher than its present
and near future needs, with the reserves calculated to last 30
years.
</P>
<P>
In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, gas reserves totaling 230
billion cubic meters have already been verified while in Sichuan
there is a further 200 billion cubic meters. Total gas reserves of
160 billion cubic meters have also been verified in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The State has approved construction of over 30 large gas
related projects in these areas as well as eight natural gas and
petrochemical bases which are variously located in Urumqi and
Yinchuan, the capitals of Xinjiang and Ningxia, and in Yulin in
Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The government is also keen that this project will also
encourage the industrialization and urbanization of western China
and help improve the environment and economies of medium-sized and
small cities in the region.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire in Sichuan Province Put out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Sterling efforts by more than 1,
000 firefighters have successfully put out a major forest fire in
southwest China's Sichuan Province that broke out on April 13 and
was finally extinguished this morning.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties and the cause of the fire
is as yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
The fire, in forests in the Muli Tibetan Autonomous County,
about 500 kilometers southwest of Chengdu, the provincial capital,
is the third in the area this year and spread over nearly 100
hectares, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shengxian, vice-director of the State Administration of
Forestry, said that the recent spate of forest fires in Sichuan
have attracted the close attention of local officials and were put
out in a short time to minimize the economic loss.
</P>
<P>
The forest fire, 3,300 meters above sea level, was first
spotted by a local aircraft on April 13, and local officials and
firefighters rushed to the scene, but poor transport
infrastructure made the logistics and movement of supplies
extremely difficult and the dry weather and very low humidity made
things even worse, according to official sources.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses PNA of Intervention in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu accused the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Sunday of
intervening in Israel's upcoming elections in May by trying to
influence Israeli Arab voters and candidates.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly plenary session of the cabinet, Netanyahu confirmed
remarks made earlier in the day by Amos Malka, head of the military
intelligence, who said the intervention was "incendiary."
</P>
<P>
But Malka, who made the accusation while briefing an inner cabinet
meeting, refused to discuss the matter at the full cabinet session,
saying it is "too sensitive," according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The radio said PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat has been reportedly
trying to persuade Azmi Bishara, Arab legislator in the Israeli
parliament as well as head of the National Democratic Alliance, to
drop his candidacy for the next Israeli premiership.
</P>
<P>
Arafat feared that Bishara's participation in the race would harm the
chances of other pro-peace candidates, such as One Israel alliance
leader Ehud Barak and Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai, by taking
away their votes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 18 percent of Israel's population, Israeli Arabs
have become a key voting bloc in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
As the first-ever Arab running for the top government office in
Israel, Bishara admits that he has a very slim chance of being
elected.
</P>
<P>
He said he joined the race only in order to draw attention to
issues important to the Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
But he has been criticized by other Arab parties competing in the
elections, including the United Arab List, which holds four seats in
the current Knesset (parliament), for splitting the Arab votes.
</P>
<P>
They said the division of Arab votes would not only hamper Arab
parties in Knesset elections but also eventually narrow the chances of
moderate candidates for prime ministership to beat hard-line
Netanyahu.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has confirmed his intention to run for the next
presidency in the coming presidential and parliamentary elections
this October.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly newspaper Domingo which
publishes on Sunday, Chissano said Saturday that "I know that some
members in the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front are trying to
choose me as the candidate for the second term, though the party
has not declare such withes".
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that he could not refuse the wishes of the party,
saying that it is evading his responsibility if he refuse to run
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
On the question of postponing the elections to 2000, Chissano
said that his government believes that it should be held within
this year, adding that the national electoral commission is
preparing for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The African affair section of the Association of European
Parliamentary Members said in a recent report that Mozambique
faces a lot of difficulties, like the voters' registration and the
approaching of rainy season which may bring difficulty to the
elections, though theoretically the election is feasible in
October.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the voters' registration time would have
to be reduced to 60 days from the planned 75 days, and the
campaign reduced to 30 days from 45 days if the election is to be
held this year.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, the report said, that the election would
have to be held in mid-December which marks the start of the rainy
season, which is to last till March.
</P>
<P>
It is also worried that some scandal within the European Union
may impact its timely financial aid to Mozambique for the
election.
</P>
<P>
The election in Mozambique needs 42 million U.S. dollars, of
which 21 million is to be offered by EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming 80th anniversary
of the historically significant May 4th Movement was given an
early boost today by the opening of a photo exhibition in the
Museum of the Chinese Revolution which will last until April 23.
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement began in 1919 and was organized by
university students in Beijing and other cities to protest against
the post First World War Versailles peace conference decision to
grant Japan the right to take over the special privileges enjoyed
by Germany and China's acceptance of that controversial decision.
</P>
<P>
The movement is considered to be a landmark in China with
university students and the intelligentsia demanding democracy for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Xinhua News Agency and the Communist Youth
League of China (CYLC) Central Committee, 220 photos selected from
the rich historical archives are on display in the exhibition,
which also commemorates China's ongoing 80 years of struggle for
democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 students from Beijing University, Qinghua
University, Beijing Normal University and China Youth Political
College and other young delegates attended today's opening
ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China Radio International (CRI)
awarded here Sunday prizes to 125 Nepalese winners of a knowledge
contest on the '99 International Horticulture Exposition to be
opened on May 1 in Kunming, Yunnan Province of Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zou Zhaojun, chief of the CRI's Nepali section, gave away 20
first prizes, 40 second prizes and 65 third prizes at a function
organized by the National Council of CRI Listeners Clubs Nepal.
</P>
<P>
She said that CRI received more than 50,000 answer sheets; the
radio organizes such contests one or two times every year for its
Nepalese listeners.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese listeners show keen interest in the contest
program.
</P>
<P>
"I take part in every competition of CRI," said Nagendra
Pahadi, who was elected Saturday general secretary of the National
Council of CRI Listeners Clubs Nepal at the second national
convention of the clubs.
</P>
<P>
He won a first prize in the knowledge contest on the Kunming
horticulture exposition. "This contest gives information on how
China protects the minority groups. China has made great efforts

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Manufacturers Urge Govt to End Cheap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Association of
Manufacturers (KAM) has warned its government that the economy
cannot grow fast due to the dumping of cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
"By encouraging the importation of second-hand cars, another
name for dumping, the government has succeed in destroying the
domestic assembly plants," said KAM chairman Chris Kirubi.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Sunday quoted Kirubi as
saying that when these facts are ignored, a vicious chain
reaction is triggered off and ends up with the current state of
infrastructure and stunted growth.
</P>
<P>
"The Kenyan economy has an expansion base that can only be made
possible by strengthening the agriculture sector," said Kirubi on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there was no way Kenya would realize its 2020
industrialization goal if Kenya continued to import cheap
products.
</P>
<P>
Kirubi also noted that most products such as eggs, butter,
milk, juices, tomatoes and oranges are imported from South
Africa, New Zealand and the Far East, which are cheap due to
subsidies provided by their governments.
</P>
<P>
"The cheap imports only benefit a minority of Kenyans, and the
 government should concentrate on the manufacturing industry by
promoting sugar, cotton and rice farming that could benefit many
Kenyans by creating employment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Rules out Referendum on Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Sunday ruled out a referendum on the death
penalty, saying the majority of people in the country supporting
the ruling African National Congress' (ANC) stand against capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed live on an E-TV Phone-In Program, Mbeki, who is ANC
chairman and set to become the country's new president in June,
said that his government would not entertain the idea of a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
"As the ANC, we are opposed to the death penalty. We believe
that this society is so violent. Levels of violence in South
Africa really horrible... It would be incorrect for the government
to join that process of encouraging the killing of people.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite sure that the majority of the people in this
country will support the ANC and they'll vote for the ANC," Mbeki
said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy president said there was no proof in terms of South
African history that the death penalty was in fact a deterrent
against crime.
</P>
<P>
"Tens of thousands of black people were hanged in this country.
it did not do anything to reduce levels of that sort of crime."
</P>
<P>
Apartheid and death penalty were abolished in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On whether the ANC government would do anything radically
different to combat crime, Mbeki spoke about toughening some
legislation, including the country's gun laws.
</P>
<P>
The illegal possession of firearms, for example, ought to be
punished with very heavy sentences, he said.

<HEADLINE>   African Runners Dominate London Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco
produced a superb display of front-running to win the London
Marathon in two hours seven minutes and 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya won the second victory in
her marathon career in the women's race at a course record time.
</P>
<P>
The gritty little Kenyan was clocked two hours 23 minutes and
21 seconds for the win.
</P>
<P>
Behind the elite athletes, a race record total of 31,582 took
part in the 19th running of the gruelling 26-mile run around
central London.
</P>
<P>
El Mouaziz improved on his second place last year to cross the
finish line in The Mall in two hours, seven minutes and 58 seconds
-missing out on the course record by just one second.
</P>
<P>
With more than 14 kilometers to go, the Moroccan began to make
a break and his gamble looked to have paid off as he forged a two-
minute lead over an illustrious pack.
</P>
<P>
But two-time champion Antonio Pinto of Portugal staged an
amazing late bid for victory, powering over the final stretches in
pursuit of the leader.
</P>
<P>
The gap proved too much for course record-holder Pinto, however,
as Mouaziz held on to win.
</P>
<P>
Abel Anton of Spain finished third at 2:09:41.
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Chepchumba, who was third last year having
won in 1997, secured 125,000 U.S. dollars for running the "world
best time", after bettering the previous best by one second.
</P>
<P>
She shaved just three seconds of Romanian Lidia Simon's mark of
2:23:24, which the London organisers consider to be the world
record.
</P>
<P>
They had refused to recognise the official world best of 2:20.
47, clocked by Chepchumba's compatriot Teglas Loroupe in Rotterdam
last year, because it was set in a mixed race.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba was involved in an early tussle for the lead with a
group including favorite Elana Meyer of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Adriana Fernandez of Mexico then moved ahead of the field going
into the final stages - but Chepchumba forced her way to the front
three miles from home and never looked like being caught.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was second in 2:24:06 with Manuela Machado of
Portugal in third at 2:25:08.
</P>
<P>
Heinz Frei of Switzerland won the men's wheelchair event for
the third time.
</P>
<P>
He missed out on his own London record by seven seconds but
held off a determined challenge in the final stretch to secure
another victory.
</P>
<P>
And Monica Wedderstrom secured the spoils in the women's
wheelchair race for the second time.
</P>
<P>
She failed to improve on her course record but was well clear
of the field, with four times winner Tanni Grey of Britain
finishing in second spot.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday lashed out at the Iranian outlawed Mujahideen Khalq
Organization (MKO) for asassinating deputy chief of the joint staff
of the armed forces Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at the Azadi Square to mark the Army Day,
Khatami said that the wicked remnants of the same groups, which
could not stand dignity of the people in the early days of the
victory of the Islamic revolution, again proved their grudge against
the people and the army by assassinating Shirazi.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi was assassinated on April 10 by the MKO members in front
of his home in northern Tehran. The iraq-based MKO also announced
responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a famous armed group which fought against the former
Iranian shah regime before the islamic revolution in 1979, but it was
outlawed in 1981 following sharp differences with Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Following khatami's speech, various units of the iranian armed
forces staged a parade at the square while air force parachutists
performed acrobatic operations in the air.
</P>
<P>
the Iranian army put on display its tanks and personnel carriers
designed and manufactured by Iranian specialists. However, it did
not show the missiles claimed to be developed by Iranian experts.
</P>
<P>
Iran said on Wednesday that it had "successfully" tested a
ground-to-air missile named after Sayyad Shirazi. Last July, it
test-fired the Shahab-3 (Metero-3) missile with a range of 1,300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The test-fires have caused grave concerns of the United States
and Israel about Iran's military capabilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
The ICRC delegates held a private talk with him and registered
his personal details in order to notify the Yugoslav authorities,
the ICRC said in a press release. The prisoner wrote a Red Cross
Message which the ICRC will forward to his family.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to visit him while he is being held," said
ICRC spokesman Nicholas Sommer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC has the right to make
further visits to the POW for as long as he is detained.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav prisoner, a lieutenant aged about 20, was
reportedly captured in Kosovo by the rebel forces Kosovo
Liberation Army on the night of April 13-14.
</P>
<P>
He was subsequently delivered to the Albanian government and
then delivered to U.S. custody in northern Albania and flown to

</P>
<P>
He is the first Yugoslav captive to be held by NATO forces
since they began air strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. soldiers in Serb captivity for the past three
weeks have not yet been visited by the ICRC. The ICRC spokesman
said the Geneva-based body was working on trying to obtain
clearance for a visit.

<P>
Referring to what it called a radical rethinking of NATO
strategy, the paper quoted one source as saying last week that "we
are no longer talking about simply sending peacekeeping troops
into an entirely permissive environment."
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about the use of ground forces in a way that
would have been complete taboo a month ago. That is sending troops
in, semi-opposed," the source said.
</P>
<P>
As NATO bombing campaign persists, there has been growing
speculation about the use of ground troops. On Saturday, however,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that a ground invasion was
still not an option.
</P>
<P>
The paper Observer said planning for a limited ground campaign
was being rushed ahead, for an invasion force of between 75,000
and 80,000 soldiers to be preceded by an advance guard of 20,000
including reconnaissance and special forces, mine sweeping and
explosives experts. An artillery and tank spearhead would then cut
a narrow way into the heart of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a U.S. official as saying the invasion could
not take place until the weather settled down and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's defenses were crippled further.
</P>
<P>
"Say, no sooner than six weeks but not necessarily later than
two months," the source said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 8,000 troops had been earmarked to secure
the border between Albania and Kosovo with a further 200,000
needed to secure Serbia's other borders with Bosnia, Hungary and
Romania.

<HEADLINE> UK Denies Plans for Ground Campaign in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook denied a press report on Sunday that NATO planned to invade
Kosovo by the end of May with up to 80,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention and no plans to send in ground troops,"
Cook told Britain's GMTV television, noting it would take two to
three months to build up an effective invasion force but NATO
could not wait that long
</P>
<P>
"If we were to get involved in a ground campaign, it would
involve far more casualties on both sides -- on the Yugoslav side
as well as on our side," he added, warning that if an invasion
took place, "when it was over you would probably be there for a
very long time as an army of occupation".
</P>
<P>
Britain's Observer newspaper quoted senior sources in London
and Washington as saying NATO was making plans for an invasion as
early as the end of May and that 80,000 troops had been earmarked
for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Cook's denial was echoed by NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, who did not rule out a ground force but stressed that the
alliance's military leaders were concentrating on defeating
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with an air campaign,
according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether NATO would send in ground troops, Solana
was quoted as saying: "We are not going to change the policy now,
the strategy now. But if the moment comes that it is necessary, I
am sure that the countries who belong to NATO would be ready to do
it."
</P>
<P>
"But at this point I would like to emphasize the air campaign
is our strategy," Solana told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"At this point we think the air campaign is enough ... the
military authorities think it is enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Sets Low-key Olympic Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, NORTHEAST CHINA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Swimming Association (CSA) has set a surprisingly low-key target
for its swimmers at 2000 Olympic Games, but it is vigorouly
pushing forward a well-schemed training program which will tune
the swimmers up for an expectedly heated Olympic competitions in
next year's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The national swimming association's medal target for Sydney
requires the country's representatives to win one gold medal from
the women's events and one medal of any color in the men's
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Sports observers believed that such an expectation was mainly
based on Chinese swimmers' poor performance at the 1996 Olympic
Games -- one gold, three silver and two bronze medals, all from
women's events -- and fairly low world rankings last year.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials admmitted that China is lagging considerably
behind such swimming powers as the United States, Australia,
Germany and Russia. "China faces a very serious situation in its
preparations for the 2000 Olympic Games," said a leading CSA
official.
</P>
<P>
But the estimation did not stop the national association from
carrying out its three-stage, nationwide program starting next
month and taking a reformed formula in the selection of Olympic
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
All of China's qualified Olympic swimmers are required to tune
up for the Sydney Games in Beijing-based CSA training camp, except
for an expectedly small number of swimmers, who, once approved by
CSA, will take training sessions out of the Chinese capital for a
certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
But priority of the preparations is obviously focused on
bringning to Sydney a "clean" squad. Absolutely no drugs, at any
costs even including hopes of gold medals, a top-ranking official
had so required.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers are keen on rebuilding in Sydney their image
compromised ever since some Chinese swimmers were tested positive
for drugs in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bringing all the qualified Olymic swimmers to Beijing will have
a double-edged function. Better facilities and accommodation at
the CSA camp will easier bring swimmers to the peak form. And a
special task force set up last year and backed by a group of top-
class sports medical professionals and sophistigated research gear
is set to provide timely, high-tech assistance to the elite
athletes.
</P>
<P>
The group has also to guarantee the Olympic swimmers healthy
and drugs-free. Doping tests are compulsory and blood tests have
been added even before the short-course world championships
earlier this month in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> IMF Used by Westerners to Punish "Unfriendly" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is being used by some western governments as an instrument
to effect political changes in countries not popular with the big
nations, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Sunday Mail Saturday that the Bretton Woods
institute had lost its orientation completely. "Here in Zimbabwe
we have had more years without it than with it and I don't see any
reason why we can't turn our back to it."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "But the World Bank, unless it proves to be
exactly like the IMF monstrous creature. I think we should remain
associated with it because we can point to very good developmental
results."
</P>
<P>
He cited various programs that had been assisted by the World
Bank which had become a source of resources that the people used
such as dams, electricity, roads and municipal houses, among
others.
</P>
<P>
The IMF on the other hand has been dilly-dallying with the
Zimbabwean government for several years promising it balance of
payments support only to come up with new demands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several "high level" delegations have been sent to Zimbabwe
from Washington to evaluate the country's progress in implementing
economic reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite meeting most of its demands, the IMF has refused to
release the funds, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian High-tech Professionals Lured Into U.S., Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 1 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Jordanian high-tech
professionals have been lured into the United States and Canada for
better jobs and wages every year, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of emigrants to the U.S. and Canada held degrees in
computer programming, graphics and animation, software developing
and engineering in civil, mechanical and electronic fields, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The number of immigrant visas issued in Jordan for the U.S. were
3,683 in 1996, 3,620 in 1997 and 2,922 in 1998, said a spokesman for
the U.S. Embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed most of the visas his embassy issued in 1998
were family reunion visas and only 3 percent were employment
immigrant visas.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian embassy in Amman issued 508 immigration visas to
Jordanians in 1998, the Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the would-be immigrant workers in the U.S. and Canada
were hoping for better jobs and higher wages, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Economic recession in the desert kingdom and political
uncertainty in the Middle East also prompted Jordanian professionals
to look for a better future in North America, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan registered a negative economic growth in 1998, and estimates
over the unemployment rate of the country ranged from 16 to 25
percent.

NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-president George
Saitoti has appealed its ruling party Kenyan African National
Union (Kanu) to stop internal strifes in order to help the
government reach its objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot meet its obligations when those in Kanu

complaining would only divide the party.

Saitoti was reappointed as Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's
deputy in early April after a 14-month interval. He was sacked in
early 1998 following serving the number two post for eight years.

Saitoti did not mention any names among those fighting within

<HEADLINE> Bao Zheng Remembered in Central China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kaifeng, a historical and
cultural city in central China's Henan Province, has decided to
arrange a number of activities this month to mark the 1,000th
anniversary of the birth of Bao Zheng, an ancient Chinese famed as
an honest and upright official.
</P>
<P>
These activities include different symposiums and drama
episodes. The city government of Kaifeng has also planned to
earmark 28 million yuan to rebuild the office building of Bao
Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Bao Zheng (Bao Gong), who was born in April 999 A.D. in present-
day Hefei City of Anhui Province, used to be the magistrate of the
capital Kaifeng in the period of Northern Song Dynasty (A.D. 960-
1127). He was highly esteemed for his strictness in upholding
justice in performing his duty and unyielding to the misconduct of
the powerful officials. Bao died in 1062.
</P>
<P>
Bao Zheng, eulogized in Chinese literary works in many forms
through ages, has always been presented as a person with a black
face suggesting the impartial and upright feature of the ancient
Chinese official, though Bao was actually an handsome man with
fair complexion according to historical records.

NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The wrong policies pursued by
India's 13-month-old Vajpayee multi-party coalition government
were the main cause of its own collapse in a vote of confidence in
the Lower House of Parliament Saturday, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The major challenge facing the Vajpayee government when it came
into power on March 19 last year was poverty alleviation and
further economic reforms needed to achieve fast economic growth in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, one-third of the country's
population are living below the poverty line and over a half of
the population are illiterate. Find solutions to these problems
should have been the new government's main preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, had focused its attention on
development of nuclear and missile weapons. In its last year's
budget, nuclear and space development funds had increased sharply,
by 67 percent and 62 percent respectively. The then Finance
Minister Jashwant Singh has said defense expenditure could be
increased any time if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Vajpayee government conducted five underground nuclear
tests in May last year, causing widespread concern and drawing
condemnation both at home and abroad. Just days before its ouster,
the government test-fired short-range and intermediate ballistic
missiles with ranges of 50 to over 2,000 km, prompting India's
major rival Pakistan to follow suit, intensifying an armed race in
the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Vajpayee government had
made a lot of promises to the public during the general election
last year and since then, but few of them had materialized.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, both the industry and the public were also deeply
disgruntled with the fact that the country's economy showed no
sign of recovery while the fiscal deficit and inflation were
rising. Crime rates are rising fast, and communal forces again
ignited racial and religious hatred flames with some of lower
caste and minority people becoming victims of such hatred.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Vajpayee coalition was strife-laden and its
allies with various ideologies and interests had never ceased
infightings among themselves. Many charged that what they really
cared about were their own affairs and benefits, but never the
people's welfare and the country's progress.
</P>
<P>
The government had spent so much time on infighting, but little
time on how to run the country well, and more and more people have
become disillusioned with it, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of the Vajpayee administration, the Congress
Party, the biggest opposition in Parliament, is expected to form a
new government on its own with the support of other opposition
parties from outside or to form a Congress-led coalition
government with some of opposition parties joining it.
</P>
<P>
Yet any form of government will face new difficulties and
challenges, as the strength of the new government is balanced with
new opposition parties, who are expected to fight back soon.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new government would face similar problems as the
Vajpayee government had, as Congress and its supporting parties
hold different views and their priorities could also be different.
</P>
<P>
The industry and the public are now eager to see a stable
government formed as soon as possible and the Finance Bill and
other bills adopted so as to put the country's economic
development back on track.

JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah has warned that
Israel's actions in Arnoun village just north of the security zone
would not save the lives of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon. The
Israeli army moved into the village last Thursday and fenced off the
village again.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police detained Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
minister Ziad Abu Ziad Saturday and escorted him outside the
Jerusalem city limits after he was spotted driving near the
Rochefeller Museum in East Jerusalem. Abu Ziad and several other PNA
officials were prohibited last month from entering the municipal
borders of Jerusalem after meeting with European diplomats at the
Orient House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Ehud Barak, leader of One Israel, said he would not hold
coalition talks with Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who was sentenced last
Thursday to four years in prison on conviction of taking bribes and
fraud. While attacking Netanyahu on his low-key reaction to the
sentencing of Deri, he said Deri should step down from politics.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Castigates U.S. Bombing in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has castigated the United States for bombing in Kosovo, saying it
is "wielding power" in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Mail on the eve of
the country' s 19th independence anniversary (on April 18), Mugabe
expressed outrage at how the Americans arbitrarily interfered with
the affairs of other sovereign countries in complete disregard of
the U.N Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Americans have become the world's Titan and in
the absence of the Soviet Union you can see how they are wielding
power across the world and in some cases in a very reckless
manner."
</P>
<P>
"To carry out those bombings arbitrarily in Kosovo is highly
objectionable in light of the fact that we have the U.N. Security
Council that is charged with the responsibility of enforcing
international security and stability and a matter like that should
be a concern of and for the U.N. security organ," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But no! America decides that they want to bomb a particularly
country and willy-nilly. Sheepish Britain follows wherever
American goes on these bloody adventures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he supports the Americans to fight
terrorism, But America itself , in fact, use terrorism or such
methods to get rid of leaders they do not like, even if those
leaders have been elected democratically by their own people, so
that they put leaders they like.
</P>
<P>
"This has, in my view, to be raised at the highest
international levels such as the U.N. and we, as the Non-Aligned
Movement, must consider this matter at our summits as frankly and
blatantly as we can and register our objection," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of this fact, we have to improve on our defenses and
peace strategies. It means we have to build up our defence and
security forces and strengthen our intelligence services whereas
it would have been better to deploy our resources in improving the
social status of our people," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "We now have to ensure that peace and stability and
the security of our nation are given adequate resources."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Toronto Raptors snapped a

21 points, including a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute, for
a 93-90 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After Patrick Ewing put in two free throws to pull the Knicks
81-84, Carter drilled a 3-pointer with 71 seconds to go, keeping
the Raptors away from squandering its 21-point second-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston responded with a 3-pointer to halve the deficit,
but Carter made another 3-pointer with 44 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
Toronto (19-20), which never make the playoffs, remained tied
with Charlotte and moved within one game of New York (21-20),
which is ninth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell scored 22 points off the bench and Houston
added 17 for the Knicks, who have lost three in a row, and would
miss the playoffs should being tied in the eighth place with the
Raptors as the latter held a 2-1 away advantage.
</P>
<P>
In Utah, John Stockton savored his 13,000th career assist and
Karl Malone scored 27 points as the Jazz routed the Los Angeles
Lakers 109-93 for their 10th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
As Dennis Rodman was waived Thursday, J.R. Reid and Travis
Knight split the power forward position and combined for one point
and six rebounds in 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
With the longest winning streak in the NBA this season, the
Jazz, at 31-8, are 1 1/2 games ahead of Portland for the league's
best record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (25-16) have lost three straight and are fifth in
the West, two games behind Houston.
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Greg Anthony scored 17 of his season-high 23 points
in the fourth quarter, including all four of his 3-pointers, as
the Portland Trail Blazers pulled out a 101-92 victory over the
Dallas Mavericks for their seventh straight win over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, David Wesley scored 24 points as the surging
Hornets extended their season-high winning streak to seven games
with a 90-82 victory over the Cavaliers in a key Eastern
Conference battle.
</P>
<P>
Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones, traded from the Lakers, helped
the Hornets close to within one game of .500 (19-20) and within 1
1/2 games of the Cavaliers for the Eastern Conference's final
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Corliss Williamson scored a season-high 29
points and Chris Webber added 24 as the Kings recorded a 119-97
rout of the Denver Nuggets and climbed within 1 1/2 games of

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (37) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 37 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
How many tiers of courts will the MSAR establish? Who will
appoint or remove judges for the MSAR's Court of Final Appeals?
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law grants the MSAR independent judicial power and
power of final adjudication once Macao is returned to China. MSAR
courts will have complete and exclusive power of adjudication over
all cases in the region, with the exception of matters of acts of
State such as national defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides for a three-tiered court system --
primary, intermediate courts and the Court of Final Appeals, to
ensure a high degree of independent judicial power in the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The power of final adjudication will be vested in the MSAR's
Court of Final Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Judges on the MSAR's Court of Final Appeals, just as for other
courts, will be appointed by the Chief Executive on the
recommendation of an independent commission composed of local
judges, lawyers and prominent citizens.
</P>
<P>
A Court of Final Appeals judge can only be removed due to an
inability to perform duties or for behavior incompatible with the
post.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive will decide on the removal of a Court of
Final Appeals judge based on the suggestions of a review committee
consisting of members of the MSAR's Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law further stipulates that appointments and removals
of the President and judges for the Court of Final Appeals will be
reported to the National People's Congress Standing Committee for
the record.

<HEADLINE> German Kiefer Wins Japan Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Nicolas Kiefer of Germany captured
his second career title by beating Wayne Ferreira of South Africa
at the Japan Open tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old German, who scored his first ATP title at
Toulouse in September 1997, fought for a 7-6 (7/4), 7-5 victory in
only his fourth career final.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here for the first time and I won the tournament. I'm very
satisfied with my play today," said Kiefer who won the title with
low but accurate strokes and a sudden array of hard-hit shots.
</P>
<P>
After exchanging breaks in the second and seventh games of the
first set, Ferreira hit a service return winner to trail 4-5 in
the tie-breaker which Kiefer eventually won by making Ferreira
commit errors twice.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, playing his first final in three years, changed the
rhythm and the speed and again came back from service break down
to even it at five-all.
</P>
<P>
But his chances of winning his first title since August 1996
were bleak as he hit a backhand shot into the net at 15-40 to go
down 5-6, giving Kiefer a second chance to serve out for the match.
</P>
<P>
The victory brought Kiefer close to breaking inside the top 20
for the first time in his career.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (38) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 38 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
How should the MSAR conduct judicial assistance with other
parts of China and foreign countries?
</P>
<P>
Judicial assistance refers to instances when a judicial
department provides facilities and assistance to a department from
a different jurisdiction, including transfers of fugitives,
delivery of judicial documents, summoning witnesses, and
acceptance and implementation of outside judicial decisions.
</P>
<P>
Article 93 in the Basic Law stipulates that the MSAR will
maintain judicial relations with and render assistance to judicial
departments in other parts of China through consultations and in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Judicial assistance between the MSAR and other parts of China
by nature involves local assistance.
</P>
<P>
Article 94 in the Basic Law stipulates that the Central
People's Government will assist and grant authorization for the
MSAR to make appropriate reciprocal judicial assistance
arrangements with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Judicial assistance between the MSAR, a local administrative
region of China, and foreign countries is by nature an
international act directly related to foreign affairs. Therefore,
the MSAR must request assistance and obtain authorization from the
Central People's Government in accordance with the principle of
State sovereignty.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was wounded
Sunday Morning in an Israeli bombardment on a village in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Jawadi Mohammed Mousa, 35, was moderately injured when Israeli
shelles hit the populated areas at the village of Arab Salim on the
fringe of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombing came as a retaliation for earlier attacks
made by Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli positions in the nearby
villages of Surud and Suwida.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust
the Israeli forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army out of
the country.

URUMQI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- All 1,101 pilgrims from the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have returned home safely as a

<HEADLINE> Round-up: S. Leone Rebels Expected to Hold Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra leone rebels are expected to
hold peace talks with the President Tejan Kabbah government in a
bid to end the nine-year civil war in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Final preparations for a travel of jailed rebel leader Foday
Sankoh to Togo were ready on Friday when the United Nations lifted
the travel ban on him, a day after the Sierra Leone appeal court
agreed to release him temporarily.
</P>
<P>
A Sierra Leone government spokesman said Friday that Sankoh
would be flown to Togo on Saturday accompanied by U.N.
representatives and was expected to consult his followers on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Following the face-to-face meeting with his followers, Sankoh
would hold peace talks with the Kabbah government to try to bring
peace to the war- ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The decision to release him and his travel to Togo for meeting
with his followers are described as the most important step
towards peace in the West African country for several years.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has been in detention since he was picked up on arms
offences in Nigeria in early 1997 and was sentenced to death last
October as his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) briefly shared
power in Freetown with renegade army officers between May 1997 and
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The RUF invaded Freetown early last January, and some 6,000
people were reportedly killed in the ensuing violence between the
West African peace- keeping force of ECOMOG and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Kabbah welcomed the appeal court's
decision, calling Sankoh's travel to Togo "a mission of national
importance" and " another important milestone in the peace
process" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the RUF took up arms in 1991, at least 20,000 people have
been killed in Sierra Leone where almost every infrastructure,
especially outside the capital, has been crippled by the war.
</P>
<P>
The Togo meeting is scheduled to be held in Kara, the
birthplace of President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current chairman of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who is to
host the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The eventual meeting is seen as a crucial precursor to
full-scale peace talks between the rebel RUF and President Kabbah
government, coming at a time when Sierra leone's security
situation is precarious.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said Thursday that Kambia on the border with
Guinea in the north was now free of rebels while the northern town
of Makeni, the country's third largest city, remains a rebel
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
In the east, the sources said, the rebels still control
Kailahun which is the main base of the rebel movement while the
Freetown peninsula remain in the control of the ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Al-Amin
Daggash announced Thursday in capital Abuja that the ECOMOG would
begin to withdraw the 15,000-strong troops in Sierra leone later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Defence chiefs of countries with troops in Sierra Leone ended a
one-day extraordinary meeting in Abuja on Thursday with a call on
ECOWAS member countries to support the on-going rebuilding of the
Sierra leone armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's former army, which sided with the RUF, was
demobilized by ECOMOG last year when it reinstated the
democratically elected President Kabbah after he was overthrown by
the military junta.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild the army, 500 officer cadets have been
sent for training in Nigeria while the rest of the 5,000-strong
army is being trained locally by Nigerian and British officers.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the Kabbah government is desperate for a
peace pact with the rebels during the peace talks next week.
</P>
<P>
Unless the talks succeed, the capital city of Freetown could be
laid open within weeks to a new rebel assault, they added.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: Talks With Canadian Prime Minister Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CALGARY, Canada, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji said Saturday that his talks with Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien in Ottawa Friday were frank, friendly and
fruitful, which promoted understanding and increased common ground
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner hosted by Minister of Justice and Attorney
General of Canada Anne Mclellan, Zhu said he came to Canada to
implement the common ground reached by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Chretien during the former's state visit to Canada in
1997. "I believe we have accomplished a lot," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in St. John's on April 14 to start his seven-day
official visit to Canada following his successful visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his visit is to deepen understanding, expand
common ground, enhance friendship and promote cooperation so as to
advance the 21st century-oriented China-Canada partnership of all-
round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canada is willing to see China's access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Zhu said, adding that China's WTO membership
will give a bigger market for Canadian entrepreneurs and business
people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zhu said both the United States and Canada have
resolutely supported China's entry into the WTO and China's
negotiations with the two countries are near completion.
</P>
<P>
It has been 13 years since negotiations started on China's
resumption of the General Agreement on Trade Tariff (GATT)
membership and later on its access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China's entry into the WTO can not only widen Sino-
Canadian economic and trade ties but also improve the trade
imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that more and more Canadians will do business and
invest in China so as to further promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Mclellan, who welcomed Zhu's visit, said relations between
Canada and China are established on the basis of mutual respect
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that the two countries will increase
mutual visits to further enlarge bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here from Toronto Saturday afternoon to continue
his visit, a return one to Chretien. This is his first trip to
Canada in the capacity as Chinese premier.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh President Urges Parties to Reach Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed has urged the country's ruling and opposition parties to
make concessions to reach an understanding on political issues,
the New Nations newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Not confrontation, compromise is essential. Everybody needs to
give some concessions and shift from one's respective stances to
create an understanding," Ahmed was quoted as speaking at a
discussion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"But in our country, no politician or party will ever confess
their faults so long alive, never budge an inch. There will be no
recognition even if the other party did a good job," he said.
</P>
<P>
As people are the source of all power, he said, it "can't be
possible to sail through election all the time by misleading,
deceiving or bluffing them."
</P>
<P>
He deplored that although 28 years had passed since the
country's independence, efforts to fulfill the people's basic
rights were yet to succeed. "It is the most urgent tasks of all to
make a united effort disregarding party to resolve national
problems. It requires a consensus by all political parties on
major national issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in lieu of unity, we now see extreme disunity, serious
conflict and confrontational politics," he said, adding that the
cornerstone of democracy was tolerance and cooperation between the
government and the opposition for resolving the country's
fundamental problems.
</P>
<P>
"This is unfortunate that such an environment has not been
created in our country yet. The main feature of the government and
the opposition is to blame each other, abuse each other in harsh
language and invoke the bitter past all the time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the basic problems would not be solved by
abusing each other or shifting all the blames to others.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to make error in governing the country. But
rule or administration is not the monopoly of any individual or
party... The lesson of history is that a good ruler first detects
his own mistake and corrects himself before finding fault with
others," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our misfortune that in our country no leaders confess
their own mistakes. Their motto: our party is right and our
actions unchangeable. Whatever others do is wrong. Our party is
patriotic, others traitors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All will have to work unitedly so that economic development
work does not suffer. The country's interest will take precedence
over personal interest and the path of vendetta must be replaced
by mutual understanding," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been gripped by political uncertainty in recent
years. The ruling and the opposition have often tried to shift
blames to each other for any failure in governing the country, by
confronting each other both in parliament and on the street.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Gulf War Victims to Get More Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission for
Compensation (UNCC) will give an additional 45 million U.S.
dollars to Sri Lankan expatriates who lost their jobs due to the
1990-91 Gulf War, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth time Sri Lankan Gulf War victims are to
receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18,000 Sri Lankan expatriates will receive
compensation this time, Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said about 90,000 Sri Lankan workers had returned
from Kuwait since August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the United Nations established a special
commission on compensation known as the UNCC, to pay an allowance
to those who were compelled to return.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has received four installments so far -- 48.8 million
U.S. dollars in December 1996, 15.9 million dollars in March 1997,
33 million dollars and 48 million dollars in April and August last
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reinsurer Fights for Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The newly founded China
Reinsurance Company (China Re) is facing severe competition from
overseas counterparts, which took over 90 percent of China's non-
compulsory reinsurance business last year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with China's Insurance law, all insurance
companies must reinsure their business at China Re, the only
reinsurance company in China, with 20 percent of their premium
income (compulsory reinsurance), today's Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
As to non-compulsory reinsurance, or commercial reinsurance,
domestic companies are free to choose between China Re and
overseas reinsurance firms, the English newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Many direct insurance firms have played tricks to avoid
compulsory reinsurance and handed out non-compulsory reinsurance
abroad, according to Dai Fengju, general manager of China Re.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory reinsurance rate was only 19 percent, while the
claim settlement rate was 3 to 5 percent higher than it should
have been.
</P>
<P>
The picture for non-compulsory reinsurance looked even worse.
In 1998 alone, 500 million U.S. dollars in reinsurance premiums
went to overseas companies, wasting much of the domestic
underwriting capacity.
</P>
<P>
Formed on the basis of the former People's Insurance (
Reinsurance) Company of China, which was set up in 1995, China Re
had a registered capital of 3 billion yuan (362 million U.S.
dollars) and a long-term liability reserve fund of 6 billion yuan
(723 million dollars) at its founding on March 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
China Re has mapped out a plan to become one of the top 10
reinsurance companies in the world in terms of scale, quality,
management, and profit, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog of China's insurance industry, the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission, will step up its efforts this year to lay
down a reinsurance management regulation, said Wu Dingfu, vice-
chairman of the commission, at the first national reinsurance
conference held since the founding of China Re.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will set up detailed principles on the position
of China Re, the administration of compulsory reinsurance, the
operation of the domestic reinsurance market, and the punishments
for violating companies, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Basin States Hope for Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 leaders of
government of the Caribbean basin discussed Saturday its economic
integration in the American continent, in the Second Association
of Caribbean States (ACS) Summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by the leaders of small islands in the
Caribbean east and Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba, ended
Saturday with the signing of a document that basically contains
political declarations and intentions of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ACS member states have a population of more than 200
million and a 500-billion gross domestic product. Leaders were
proposing to set a regional tariff system to prepare for the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and its target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
There were also expected Cuba to join the FTAA negotiations,
calling the United States to end its nearly 40-year-long embargo
on the island, especially the Helms-Burton law against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they will promote the Caribbean's vital
tourism industry, which created jobs for the one fifth of their
population and earned 18 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, the host of the summit,
said in the first working session that the United States must
extend the benefits of the free trade agreement in textile matters
to the Caribbean, and the Lome Accord with the European Union (EU)
should be extended for 10 years more.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hotels Looking Forward to Birthday Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Tourists usually have no problems
finding hotel rooms in Beijing. The occupancy rate of the city's
star-rated hotels averages about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, they will be unable to reserve a well-positioned room
at the Beijing Hotel and Grand Hotel Beijing during the days close
to October 1, the 50 anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China, today's Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 98 percent of the two hotels' rooms are booked, said
hotel sources, even though the room rates had been nearly doubled
for those days.
</P>
<P>
"The central government's decision to hold a grand ceremony to
celebrate the 50th National Day brings enormous business
opportunities for star-rated hotels along Chang'an Avenue,
especially the Beijing Hotel and the Grand Hotel Beijing," the
newspaper quoted Yu Debin of the Beijing Tourism Administration (
BTA).
</P>
<P>
Tourists and State guests want to get a close view of the
century's last grand ceremony held in Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Meng Xuenong, deputy director of the Beijing
Preparatory Committee for the 50th Anniversary, a review of troops
and a grand parade will be held in Beijing on October 1.
</P>
<P>
China last held a military parade in 1984 to mark the 35th
anniversary of the founding of New China. Following the review on
October 1, there will be a grand parade involving tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 people will participate in the celebrations, troop
review, and grand parade in the heart of Beijing, which are
scheduled to last about two hours on National Day.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of October 1, there will be a gala event
involving 100,000 people at Tian'anmen Square. At the same time,
there will be various galas hosted by workers, farmers,
intellectuals, soldiers, cadres, students, and people of different
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Tian'anmen Square will be lit by fireworks, as Party and State
leaders gather on the Tian'anmen Rostrum to watch performances
together with representatives from many walks of life.
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of the event, many star-rated hotels,
especially those situated along Chang'an Avenue, began seeking
tourists through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Local media have declared that Beijing's hotel rooms will be in
short supply during those days.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate of Beijing star-rated hotel dropped to less
than 50 percent in 1998 from 59 percent in 1997 and 63 percent in
1996 as an adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Indignation at Anti-China Speech by Japanese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China expressed its indignation
today at an anti-China speech made by newly elected Governor of
Metropolitan Tokyo Ishihara Shintaro.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today
that "we are indignant at the fact that Ishihara wantonly made a
speech which hurts the feelings of the Chinese people and impairs
the Sino-Japanese ties."
</P>
<P>
He said this when asked to comment on anti-China remarks
Ishihara made on a public occasion recently.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's act of openly spreading the views of beautifying the
aggression history of Japan's militarism and the absolutely absurd
anti-China views goes against the historical trend while the
governments and peoples of China and Japan are pushing forward the
development of the bilateral relations in the spirit of taking
history as a mirror and gearing towards the future, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He added that to pursue Sino-Japanese friendship is not only in
the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, but
also reflects their common aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"Ishihara's clumsy performance is unpopular, and will certainly
be opposed by the peoples of the both countries," he noted. "We
warn him not to continue on his erroneous track," Sun added.

<HEADLINE> Leather Firms Urged to Develop Famous Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's leather firms are called
on to make efforts to foster famous brands nationwide in the face
of current difficulties in the sector, the Business Weekly said
today.
</P>
<P>
China is short of real famous brands for its leather garments,
although it dominates the world leather production after years of
development, the Beijing-based English language newspaper quoted
an official with the China Leather Industry Association (CLIA) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are dozens of locally famous brands in provinces or
major cities, but we cannot say we have brands recognized by
people nationwide," said Li Yuzhong, deputy secretary-general of
the association.
</P>
<P>
China's leather products exports totaled 10 billion U.S.
dollars last year and exports were expected to increase 7 percent
annually, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Small scale production and lack of famous brands in the
international market are the major problems the leather firms are
facing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized firms account for 97 percent of the
industry, and most of them are located in the coastal provinces in
east and south China.
</P>
<P>
Design and manufacturing techniques also need to be upgraded in
accordance with international trends as leather garments are no
longer a luxury for many Chinese people with the improvement of
living standards, according to Ying Zecong, manager of the Tianjin
Yingdak (Taiwan) Leather and Fashion Co Ltd.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Raps Tokyo Governor's Anti-China Ravings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese newspaper
warned Sunday that the anti-China remarks by newly-elected Tokyo
governor Shintaro Ishihara are both shocking and deserve
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Japanese media on April 12, Ishihara
flagrantly attacked the Chinese government and its policy on Tibet
and uttered provocative words on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article entitled "Unpopular Ravings", the People's
Daily said that it was not the first time that Ishihara made anti-
China remarks. In the early 1990s, he flatly denied the crimes
committed by Japanese aggressors in the Nanjing massacre, saying
that the criminal act was a "fabrication". In the just-ended
gubernatorial election, he again defended Japan's crimes of
aggression. All these remarks attempting to reverse historical
verdicts were strongly criticized by both Chinese and Japanese
public opinions.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily article said: "The fact that a public office
holder repeatedly made such anti-China ravings will inevitably
have very bad political implications and cause serious
consequences."
</P>
<P>
The article noted that Ishihara's understanding of China and
historical issues not only is totally wrong but also lacks common
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
It is the choice of the Chinese people that the Communist Party
of China has been leading them in building a prosperous,
democratic, civilized and modernized socialist country, the
article said. "How could Ishihara, as a foreigner, be in a
position to vilify the fact?"
</P>
<P>
It is a historical fact that Tibet has been an integral part of
China since the ancient time, the article said. "On what basis
could he claim that Tibet was 'annexed' by China?"
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is a major issue of principle that concerns
China's internal affair and sovereignty, a position that has been
accepted by the Japanese government, the article went on. "If
Ishihara disregards the Japanese government's solemn commitment
and engages in 'one China, one Taiwan' activities in his capacity
as the Tokyo governor, he would badly hurt the feelings of the 1.
25 billion Chinese people and seriously undermine the Sino-
Japanese relations. The consequences would be ghastly to
contemplate."
</P>
<P>
The article said, "The friendly relations between China and
Japan are hard won and their further growth allows no interference
whatsoever." It added that any remarks and actions against the
historical trend of Sino-Japanese friendship will certainly come
to no good end.
</P>
<P>
"We advise Mr. Ishihara to give an overriding consideration to
the Sino-Japanese friendly relations and the regional stability
within his tenure of office and to refrain from making any more
remarks that will undermine the fundamental interests of the
Chinese and Japanese people and damage the relations between the
two countries." the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> At Least 20 Killed in clash in East Timor, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were killed
following a clash on Saturday between pro-integration and
pro-independence groups in Dili, capital of Indonesia's East
Timor, national newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dili police chief Col. Timbul Silaen said 12 bodies were found
in the house of pro-independence figure Manuel Carrascalao, the
brother of former East Timor governor Mario Viegas Carrascalao.
</P>
<P>
Five others were found in the house of David Ximenes, deputy
chairman of the National Council of Resistance of East Timor
(CNRT), an umbrella group for the pro-independence movement. In
addition, three people were killed on streets in clashes between
pro-independence supporters and the pro-Indonesia militia.
</P>
<P>
But Mario Viegas Carrascalao said about 30 people were killed
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that pro-Indonesia militia went on the rampage
after holding a rally in Dili on Saturday morning. Around 1,500
militiamen drove round the city's deserted streets in a convoy of
some 25 trucks, firing in the air and attacking the homes of known
pro-independence activists.
</P>
<P>
Some opened fire and pelted rocks at the home of Manuel
Carrascalao. There were about 150 refugees in the house.
</P>
<P>
Scores of pro-integration East Timorese youths ransacked the
offices of The Suara Timor Timur (The Voice of East Timor)
newspaper, which they accused of biased reporting against their
cause.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's violence came after weeks of bloodshed from fighting
among various pro- and anti-independence groups as well as the
Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest show of force by anti-independence fighters
since a new wave of violence hit the troubled territory a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor, with a population
of some 800,000 and an area of 15,000 sq. km, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
On January 27 this year, the Indonesian government announced it
was ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide
wider autonomy was refused by the people in the region and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Violence has heightened since the announcement.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to find a peaceful solution to the thorny
issue, Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations have agreed to
hold a U.N.-supervised ballot on autonomy in East Timor in July,
one month after Indonesia's planned elections on June 7.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas is expected to
present his government's final autonomy proposal during a two-day
meeting with his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama in New York on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indonesian government rejected mounting calls for
some kind of U.N. presence in East Timor, even as critics charged
it with failing to arrest the rising violence in the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said on Saturday that he is willing to mediate between the
guerrillas and the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
Chavez made the offer to his Colombian counterpart Andres
Pastrana in Santo Domingo during a recess in the Second Summit
Meeting of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS).
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president vowed that his country will "
contribute as much as we can in the peace process, without
meddling."
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that Chavez "is taking part in the Colombian
peace process in the measure the Colombian government asks him to
do." He revealed that Chavez "offered his home" for the peace
dialogues with the guerrillas .
</P>
<P>
Pastrana once again condemned the hijacking of an Avianca
commercial airliner by five National Liberation Army (ELN) members.
The plane was taken to an abandoned runway in the Caribbean
department of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the ELN has released nine of the 41 hostages on
board.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Most of the newspapers report on the frontpage that visiting
top Chinese legislator Li Peng on Saturday paid a visit to
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit Kittiyakara
and discussed bilateral relations with them.
</P>
<P>
And they also report that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Friday issued a joint
statement on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO).
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been
intensifying readjustment of industrial structure, and over four
billion yuan of assets have been transferred to local advantageous
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
-- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met with Governor-
General of Canada Romeo LeBlanc in Ottawa Friday and both sides
shared the view that Sino-Canadian relations should be much
furthered.
</P>
<P>
-- Ninety-four foreign countries and international
organizations will attend China '99 Kunming International
Horticultural Exposition (Expo '99) that will run from May 1
through to October 31.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji urged the Canadian
business community to raise Sino-Canadian economic and trade
cooperation to a new level while delivering a speech at a dinner
hosted by the Canada-China Business Council in Ottawa at Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
-- Tangshan, an old industrial city in north China's Hebei
Province has made efforts to bring its advantages into full play
in developing local economy while increasing adjustment of basic
industries.
</P>
<P>
The city's economic performances have shown encouraging
prospects since last year and was placed higher in the province
for economic operations in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing tax revenues by 6.4 percent this year is
achievable, even though the base figure set last year is already
very high, experts say.
</P>
<P>
-- China is likely to impose a fuel tax in the second half of
this year to replace road maintenance fees as part of a scheme to
abolish illegal charges and random fees imposed by local
administrations.
</P>
<P>
-- Tourists usually have no problems fining hotel rooms in
Beijing. The occupancy rate of the city's star-rated hotels
averages about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- China's imports have grown strongly since the beginning of
this year, and analysts say that this is likely to be a blessing
for the export sector as well.
</P>
<P>
However, they will be unable to reserve a well-positioned room
at the Beijing Hotel and Grand Hotel Beijing during the days close
to October 1, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
-- An enforcement group of 130 representatives of the State
authorities has been sent to eight coal mining provinces to
supervise the closure of small coal mines and reductions in coal
output.

<HEADLINE> Rambis Made Recommendation to Fire Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers coach Kurt
Rambis decided it was time for Dennis Rodman to leave, and never
return.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time where we need an ultimate focus and
concentration," Rambis said after Friday's practice. "I just think
this is better for the team. The in-and-out just got to be too
much. I felt we needed everyone to be on the same page. I gave my
recommendation to management, a minimum of a suspension. It was my
belief we should waive him at this time."
</P>
<P>
Rambis sent Rodman home and later had a pointed conversation
with club executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
Kupchak said the move probably wouldn't have been made at this
time had Rambis not spoken up.
</P>
<P>
"Kurt and our staff keep us apprised daily," Kupchak said. "
This was a culmination of acts that led to the waiver. Yesterday's
act alone would have never led to this kind of action. It's
another in a series of actions."
</P>
<P>
Bob Steiner, a spokesman for Lakers owner Jerry Buss, said
Buss' reaction to the move was, "They did what they had to do."
</P>
<P>
O'Neal declined to speak with reporters after the move.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant said: "When a guy shows up continuously late... it
was definitedly justified."
</P>
<P>
However, Bryant also said: "I'm a little disappointed. I wanted
Dennis to hang around. He's very unpredictable. Winning cures
everything. He helped us out, to be honest with you. When he was
here, he did provide us with a lot of energy. I would love to have
Dennis right now. If we had won the last two games, he would still
be here."

<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan political leaders
believed that their country's bilateral ties with India would
remain strong despite the collapse of India's Vajpayee government
which lost a confidence motion by just one vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, the impact is none at all,
because the desire of Sri Lanka is to have good relations with
whatever party is in power," the Sunday Times quoted acting
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kiriella as saying.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition United National Party leader Ranil
Wickremesighe also believed there would not be a major impact on
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) General Secretary
Douglas Devananda said: "It is too early to comment. And as far as
I am concerned it would not have any impact on Indo-Sri Lanka
relations, which will continue to be as strong as ever."
</P>
<P>
But Colombo's security establishment is closely watching
developments unfolding following the defeat of India's Bharatiya

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Exploiting the absence of Martina
Hingis and Patty Schnyder, Slovakia surged to a 2-0 lead by
winning both singles matches in its Fed Cup World Group I
quarterfinal over runners-up Switzerland in Zurich on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 57th-ranked Karina Habsudova rallied to begin Slovakia's
assault with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-0 victory over Emmanuelle Gagliardi
before Henrieta Nagyova who ranked 24th, prevailed over 468th-
ranked Caecilia Charbonnier 6-2, 5-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Switzerland is facing elimination from the
tournament after Hingis skipped due to a squabble over money and
Schnyder was kicked out for her failure to show up for training.
</P>
<P>
Hingis reportedly demanded a 1 million Swiss franc (about 600,
000 US dollars) appearance fee, which organizers refused to pay,
and 10th-ranked Schnyder failed to appear at team practice earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder later explained that she would not compete in Fed Cup
until her controversial relationship with 42-year-old Rainer
Harnecker had been accepted by colleagues, family and the media.

<HEADLINE> Salamander Fries Returned To Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists in the city of
Lanzhou, the capital of China's Gansu Province in northwest China,
recently returned 30,000 salamander fries that had been stolen by
smugglers back to nature.
</P>
<P>
They were believed to have been stolen from somewhere in the
southern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists first put 10,000 of the fries into a
stream in the Xinglongshan Nature Reserve, 30 kilometers south of
Lanzhou, but stopped when they saw that the small fish looked
uncomfortable. The remaining 20,000 are now being raised in a 0.13-
hectare pond in the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Local fishery department officials say that the small
salamanders may be moved to other places if they do not adjust to
the environment and climate in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
The theft of the salamanders is still under investigation,
according to local judicial sources. The salamander is considered
an endangered species and is protected by the State. It makes a
crying sound like that of an infant in the evening and has been
given the Chinese nickname "wawa yu", or "baby fish".

MADRID, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Karim Alami of Morocco
continued his surprising run by upsetting eighth-seeded Todd
Martin of the United States on Saturday to enter the final of the
950,000 US dollars Open Seat Conde de Godo in Barcelona.

"My serve was my best weapon today, it was working particularly
well and you need that against Martin," Alami said and was

sure the public will be for Felix, but I like that, it makes me
more motivated...I'll have to be playing at the top of my game."

LIMA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- 80.5 percent of Peruvians say that
unemployment is a main problem facing the country, while 25.5
percent express that they are affected seriously by poverty and
hunger, a poll revealed on Saturday.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has been increasing the
restructuring of its industries in the past few years and now has
more than 13,000 joint-stock enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The share-holding system has been introduced to many small
State-owned businesses, collective enterprises, rural enterprises,
and private businesses, local authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are small-scale businesses. One study has found
that 44 percent of the city's industrial joint-stock enterprises
have fewer than 50 employees. Most have done better after being
turned into joint-stock companies, and 84 percent of them in the
Yangpu District have increased profits by big margins.

<HEADLINE> Americans Lead Croatia 2-0 in Fed Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States prevailed
over Croatia 2-0 as Chanda Rubin beat Croatia's No. 1 Iva Majoli
in the Fed Cup World Group I quarterfinal in North Carolina on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While Monica Seles needed 63 minutes to beat Silvija Talaja 6-3,
6-1 with ease, Rubin, who replaced injuried Lindsay Davenport, had
to battle for nearly three hours to subdue Majoli 7-6 (7-5), 4-6
and 7-6 (10-8) by winning two tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
The match was swifted to the United States as Zagreb was under
the shadow of NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After splitting the first two sets with Majoli, Rubin led 3-1
and 5-3 in the third, but Majoli seemed to retake momentum when
she hit her first ace to win the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
Rubin broke Majoli and served for the match four times before
she finally was able to subdue her 32nd-ranked opponent who
suffered her first defeat in the first day match of the Fed Cup
history.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Seles, ranked third by WTA Tour, took
control early, placing her shots well and frustrating the 21-year-
old Talaja with backhand and forehand winners.
</P>
<P>
After going ahead 5-2 in the first set, Seles had a harder time
with Talaja in the next game. Talaja broke Seles three times and
finally won after a Seles shot went long.
</P>
<P>
But Talaja couldn't find many ways to beat Seles, who sent
winners past Talaja for the final two points of the second set to
win the match.
