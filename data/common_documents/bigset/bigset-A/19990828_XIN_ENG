hke -- Greene Wins Men's 200m Gold Medal
</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene of the United States
made an unprecedented achievement at the 7th World Athletics
Championships here on Friday by winning the sprint double.
</P>
<P>
The American runner, who won the men's 100m on Sunday, proved his
sprinting power Friday night, winning the 200m at 19.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The American champion ran a good curve and kept his advantage until
he finished the final line, improving his season's best in two
hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
"It is not as good as I expected," he said. "For me, it is just an
icing on the cake."
</P>
<P>
"But I am still very happy to win two gold medals here," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Claudinei da Silva, third in Athens '97, was the toughest
rival of Greene, even if he did not seem to worry him. The Brazilian
clocked a personal best at 20 seconds to take the silver.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Francis Obikwelu had the bronze medal at 20.11, far from
his 19.84 which he clocked at heats two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Frank Fredericks, the runner-up in Athens, pulled out of
the race due to an injury which he has been suffering since last May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Friday, Fredericks' manager said the 1991 world
champion had an infected nerve in his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
In women's 200m final held earlier, American Inger Miller, with
absence of her teammate Marion Jones, stormed ahead to win the title at
21.77 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Beverly McDonald and Merlene Frazer, both from Jamaica, finished
second and third, at 22.22 and 22.26 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the women's 100m on Sunday, suffered a lower back
pain and cramped to the track in 200m semi-final race Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Accuses Congo Rebel Leader of Dodging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has accused Congolese
rebel faction leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba of dodging the
cease-fire agreement reached in Lusaka on July 10 by six African
countries directly involved in the conflicts in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Rwanda News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Wamba is trying to dodge going to Lusaka to sign the
cease-fire deal,'' Rwandan government spokesman, Wilson
Rutayisire, was quoted as saying. "He is trying to exploit the
unfortunate incident which took place last week in Kisangani to
refuse to sign with other founding members."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman has categorically rejected as "pure lies"
allegations by Wamba that 3,000 Rwandan Patriotic Army troops are
planning to attack Kisangani and rout out forces loyal to his
faction of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD).
</P>
<P>
While addressing reporters in Ugandan capital Kampala Thursday,
Wamba had accused his rival Rwanda-backed RCD Goma faction led by
Emile Ilunga and the Rwandan Patriotic Army troops of having
hatched a plan to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
Rutayisire said that the Rwandan Patriotic Army troops are at a
stand- still after hostilities with the Uganda People's Defense
Forces were stopped following a cease-fire agreed in Mweya by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice-President and
Defense Minister Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that Wamba is complaining about
attempted assassination, or physical elimination, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Congolese rebel sources in eastern town of Goma have indicated
that two planes will airlift the RCD founding members from Goma
Sunday and Monday, while Wamba and his six people will take off
from Kampala where they are staying.
</P>
<P>
To break the impasse caused by the power wrangle within the
RCD, the heads of the Southern African Development Community,
spearheaded by South Africa, had proposed that instead of one man
signing for the two RDC factions, all the 50 founding members
should ink the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the region believe that even though the rebels will
go to Lusaka to sign the cease-fire agreement, this is not
definitely the end of all the obstacles on the road to peace for
the chaotic Congo.

<HEADLINE> USDA Monitors no Sign of Russia Diverting Food-Aid Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Friday refuted a report which alleged that a 1
billion dollar food-aid program to Russia was entangled in a
Russian money-laundering scandal, saying it had detected no signs
of any diversion of the funds.
</P>
<P>
"Our monitoring has not shown any diversion," Agriculture
Department General Sales Manager Richard Fritz said, adding that
food-aid shipments would continue.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper USA Today, quoting unnamed U.S. investigators,
reported Friday that tens of millions of dollars were missing
from a special bank account set up by the Russian government for
earnings from the sale of U.S. grain donated to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The article was the latest in a series of news reports claiming
that Russian mobsters, businessmen and senior officials had been
laundering billions of dollars of money, including aid from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov has denied that the
government had any role in diverting the loan money.
</P>
<P>
Fritz said that since there was no proof to show that funds
have been divered, the United States would not stop its food-aid
package.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason to halt the program now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the United States provides Russia with
low-interest, long-term loans to buy U.S. grain and meat. The
United States also is donating wheat, pork, nonfat dry milk and
seeds to be sold by Russia to its people. In all, more than
two-thirds of the commodities have been shipped out of the 3.1
million metric tons offered, the Agriculture Department said.
</P>
<P>
Fritz said U.S. monitors -- far from being alarmed -- actually
had been impressed with the way the program has been operating.
</P>
<P>
"We're showing that we're ahead of expectations in deposits to
the pension fund," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Calls for Halt to Haphazard Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has called on livestock keepers not to drive
their cattle to graze grassland haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
"The government is ready to issue land titles without any
hesitation," Sumaye said in Simanjaro district of the northern
region of Arusha Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who is on a six-day official tour to four districts in
the region, told the Simanjaro residents who are predominantly
pastoralists that the government is prepared to issue them land
titles.
</P>
<P>
"You must own land to do your activities in an organized way
instead of moving north to south with your cattle," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Haphazard cattle grazing causes environment destruction that
would bring grave consequences to future generations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Livestock keeping is like any other economic activity and must
be engaged in within a confined land area," Sumaye stressed.
</P>
<P>
Overgrazing in Tanzania, with more than 30 million head of
cattle, sheep and goat, has become a concern of the government by
making barren large tracts of grassland in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that desertification is
threatening the livelihood of 57 percent of the country's
population.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Airways to Reduce Fares to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Airways Friday announced
new lower fares for flights to Greece as of September 1.
</P>
<P>
The new fares were announced by Chairman of Cyprus Airways,
the island's national carrier, Takis Kyriakides at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is considered as another step to Cyprus' full
liberalization of air transports.
</P>
<P>
New prices depend on the time of the flight and the time
interval between reservation and flight.
</P>
<P>
A return ticket to Athens on morning or afternoon flights now
costing 144 Cyprus pounds (259.2 U.S. dollars) will cost 129
pounds (232.2 dollars) as of September 1, while the price in
the evening flights will be 99 pounds (178.2 dollars). Taxes are
not included in the above prices.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides said the increased number of passengers due to lower
fares will cover the loss of revenues.
</P>
<P>
In case this is not achieved, Cyprus Airways will try to deal
with the loss of revenues by curbing its costs and improving
productivity, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides said the fares from Greece to Cyprus will be equally
reduced, a move which is expected to lead to more Greek tourists
visiting the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Airways carried 1.35 million passengers in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Water Workers Stop Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- After a nearly one-month strike,
water workers in Lebanon's northern, eastern and southern areas
Friday announced that they suspended the action temporarily to
give the government time to address their plights.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by the head of the water unions
Kamal Moulad after his meeting with Lebanese State Minister for
Administrative Reform Hassan Shalak, who was charged by Prime
Minister Salim Hoss to deal with the country's on-going wave of
labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
Moulad said the government was given a deadline of September 10
to consider the workers' demand for higher pay after which the
union will decide if they will continue the strike or not.
</P>
<P>
The government's compromise followed another one with the
country's seven public utilities which are also demanding a pay
rise.
</P>
<P>
The utilities, including the state-subsidized telephone,
electricity, public transport and tobacco company, had put off a
plan to stage an open-ended strike after the government approved
most of their demands at the regular weekly cabinet session on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But, these utilities unionists are still waiting for the
government's clarification for the implementation of the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Albright Meets Palestinian Officials Before Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, before starting her trip to the Middle East
next week, Friday met with two senior Palestinian officials as
part of stock-taking the possibility of reviving the peace process
on the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to the conclusion of this aspect of the
peace process," she said standing outside her home in the
Georgetown section of the capital with negotiator Saeb Erekat and
Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, widely known as abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that we will be able to do so," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But when asked about the release of Palestinian prisoners held
by Israel, Albright admitted the issue has yet to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is not yet concluded," she said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's deputy Abbas said the prisoners issue is vital to his
side.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reach in the near future an agreement," he said. He
also said there were other issues "which are still under
discussion," and he hoped these important issues could be
"overcome."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said there is a memorandum of
understanding between Israel and the Palestinians that could be
signed on Sept. 2 in Alexandria, Egypt, with Albright on hand.
</P>
<P>
The agreement now taking shape calls for Israel to resume a
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank that was promised last
October but halted after 2 percent was surrendered. Israel would
relinquish 7 percent this October and the remaining 4 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the two sides would begin negotiations on the
thorniest issues that have divided them for decades -- the future
of Jerusalem, whether the Palestinians are to be granted a state
and what to do about refugee and water problems.

The government did not intend to politicize the matter, instead
it would seek to identify those responsible, and take legal
actions against them individually, said Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi at a press briefing here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The law exists to be complied with," said Mocumbi, adding that
 "we shall act to create a culture of respect for the law, and a
culture of peace. Citizens must understand that their freedom ends
where the freedom of others begins."

The latest Renamo violence took place in Manica province last

Renamo is an illegal armed force in its strongholds of Maringue

reveal any government plans to dismantle this force before the
general elections scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government in Favor of Validity of Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government is in favor of
 maintaining the validity of the Lusaka Protocol, but refuses to
talk with Jonas Savimbi, head of the country's rebel militants,
official news agency Angop reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aldemiro da Conceicao, spokesman for the Presidency of Angola,
said that "the Angolan government considers the Lusaka Protocol as
the unique valid document, susceptible of conducting Angola on the
way to peace and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan government maintains the Lusaka Protocol valid,
but it can' t advance with Jonas Savimbi," stressed the spokesman,
insisting on the destruction of the illegal forces of the
"terrorist leader", as one of the constant obligations in the
armistice signed in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, on November 26,
1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Conceicao, due to the maintenance of forces of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by
Savimbi, the government cannot but resort to military operations
and energetic combat for resisting the illegal troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, when the civil war broke out again, the
government has denounced Savimbi as a war criminal and said it
would not talk with Savimbi, but only with the Renovated
Commission of UNITA, which has announced its new leader for
replacing Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Rules out Agreement on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Friday denied reports on an agreement between the Palestinians and
Israel on the timetable of Israel's pullout from the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
"There are still differences and the talks are going on between
the two sides," said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, media adviser to Chairman
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
So far the Israeli side has not offered any clear or specific
propositions, he added, noting that there are still disputes on
the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal and the release of
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Foreign press reports quoted a Palestinian official recently as
saying that the talks, held by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Gilad Sher Wednesday evening,
reached an agreement on the timetable of further Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank under the Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides have not so far settled the issue of
Palestinian prisoners, said the anonymous official, noting that
Israel would pull out from another 7 percent of West Bank
territories in September and 4 percent by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that Israel implement the signed
accords with Palestinians literally. However, the Israeli side
goes on its manoeuvres to slow down the implementation of the
remaining provisions of the Wye Accord, said Rudeineh.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Accord implementation is in need of a political
decision from Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak should
make it immediately, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United States, the European Union and Arab
countries to take up their sponsorship for the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israel tried repeatedly to outdistance any third party role in
the peace talks, while a fair and comprehensive peace is in need
of the contributions of all parties, the Palestinian official
noted.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators held month-long talks on
the timetable of Israel's pullout from the West Bank and the
release of Palestinian prisoners without making any significant
progress. The talks are scheduled to resume Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Crisis Averted in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A second coalition crisis in
less than a month in Israel was averted Friday after a compromise
deal was reached between coalition partners over the transport of
heavy power-plant equipment on the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Minister without portfolio Michael Melchior, from the One
Israel alliance led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Labor Party,
said he and representatives from two ultra-religious parties had
agreed on a temporary solution over the transport of giant
turbine parts on Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, turbine parts, each weigh several hundred tons,
would be loaded before the Sabbath, unloaded after the day, and
transported primarily by non-Jewish workers on the nights of
Sabbath, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Jewish law forbids Jews from working or driving on
the Sabbath, which lasts from sunset Friday until sunset Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Barak authorized the transportation of the first of five
turbine parts from a factory near Tel Aviv to a power station in
the southern coastal city of Ashkelon on the evening of August 13,
the Sabbath, to avoid heavy traffic jams common in weekdays.
</P>
<P>
The move enraged the powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party and
United Torah Judaism (UTJ) party, which control 22 seats in
Barak's 73-member coalition. Although finally retreating from a
threat to quit the coalition, they pledged to leave the
government if Barak allowed similar transport on Sabbath in the
future.
</P>
<P>
After Israel's Supreme Court gave the go-ahead Wednesday for
the continuation of transporting the equipment on the Sabbath,
the UTJ issued an ultimatum threatening to leave the coalition
immediately if the court decision was carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Shas party also threatened to quit.
</P>
<P>
Before the compromise was reached, Barak called on all sides in
a statement to act with restraint, saying he hoped the issue would
not turn to a political one.
</P>
<P>
The sides would meet again Sunday in an effort to find a
permanent solution to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Backs Landmark Security Council Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Friday said it backs the move by the U.N.
Security Council to put the plight of child war victims on the
center-stage.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of a Security Council resolution on children in
armed conflict is a groundbreaking decision which puts the plight
of tens of millions of children victimized by war at the center of
the international peace and security agenda, the UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
"This remarkable achievement is a major boost to efforts to
protect the rights of millions of children who are killed, maimed,
orphaned and driven from their homes by conflicts around the
globe," Carol Bellamy, the UNICEF's executive director, said.
</P>
<P>
It is of particular important that the resolution, unanimously
adopted Wednesday after an all-day debate, condemns the targeting
of children in situation of conflict, including killing, maiming,
sexual violence and recruitment as soldiers, she said.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF has long fought to end the recruitment of some 300,000
child soldiers around the world," Bellamy said. "This resolution
strengthens our campaign to disarm, demobilize, rehabilitate and
reintegrate these youngsters."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has assisted in demobilization programs for child
soldiers in such countries as Rwanda, Eritrea, Liberia, Angola,
Mozambique and Sierra Leone. Former young combatants have been
reintegrated into their communities and have received trauma
counseling and training in basic skills.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy pledged the UNICEF's full support to recommendations
raised by the Security Council to protect girls from rape and
other forms of gender-based violence, and to intensify its ongoing
campaigns for children, such as immunization efforts currently
underway in Congo (K), Angola and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF will support all efforts that identify children as an
explicit priority in building peace and resolving conflicts,"
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Sierra Leone's peace agreement calls on the
UNICEF, as the lead agency for children, to ensure that the needs
of children are taken into full account throughout the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF is pursuing this, together with other U.N. actors,
through its support for the Sierra Leone Child Protection Network,
the leading national umbrella body for children, and through its
demobilization and reintegration programs for children.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Announces Recovery Plan for Turkey's Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Friday announced a series of new relief
measures aimed at speeding the recovery of children and families
in the wake of the earthquake in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after an exhaustive four-day assessment
of needs in the earthquake-devastated towns of western Turkey,
UNICEF officials said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery measures are based on a special assessment report
completed this week, and have been designed by the UNICEF with a
heavy emphasis on effective coordination and avoidance of
duplication or waste.
</P>
<P>
They include more than 4 million U.S. dollars for clean water
and sanitation projects, including rapid delivery of thousands of
showers, water tanks, latrines, and water purification tablets.
This aid will serve as an interim step while permanent services
are being restored.
</P>
<P>
The measures also mean a major initiative to address the
profound psychological impact of the quake on children, including
counseling programs in schools, training for parents and teachers,
and "child-friendly spaces" in the temporary encampments that have
become home for thousands.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF also announced a series of health initiative that
will focus on rehabilitating community health centers and the
acquisition of very specific medicines and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF recovery initiative will cost 7.3 million U.S.
dollars, and it is based on the assessment team's conclusion that
some 600,000 people have been left homeless.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Calls Zimbabwe to Join Hands in Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Botswana need to
collaborate in planning and implementing regional food production
programs and projects to avoid effort duplication, Botswana
President Festus Mogae said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 1999 Zimbabwe Agricultural Show in
Harare, Mogae said it is important for the two countries to work
closely in agricultural field to ensure that their activities are
harmonized and mutually complementary.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government, through the Ministry of Lands and
Agriculture, has given strong support to its scientists in this
field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Zimbabwe, Mogae said, Botswana is not endowed with
natural resources to venture into viable and sustainable farming,
especially crop and horticultural production. But it is suitable
for extensive livestock farming.
</P>
<P>
He said as a result of unfavorable climate conditions, Botswana
needs to import over 80 percent of her basic cereal and
horticultural requirements every year.
</P>
<P>
"It is only in sorghum that Botswana is sometimes able to meet
up to 70 percent of her domestic requirement from local
production," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mogae stressed that southern Africa as a region has an
immediate objective of intensifying and harmonizing efforts to
attract both local and foreign investment in exploiting its vast
resources.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Calls for Urgent Security Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Congo (K) Friday called
upon the U.N. Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to
authorize U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to designate special
envoys in Rwanda and Uganda respectively in a bid to boost the
peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
The request was contained in a letter, published here Friday,
to the Security Council president from Andre Kpapnga, permanent
representative of Congo (K) to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The special envoys are expected to secure from the two African
countries to "respect for the commitments which they undertook by
signing on July 10 the agreement on a ceasefire in the Democratic
Republic of Congo," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The designation of the two special envoys is useful to achieve
"the immediate halting of all the activities which these two
countries are carrying out in the territory of the Democratic
Republic of Congo," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) also wants to see "the immediate departure of their
invasion forces so that peace and national harmony may again
prevail" in the African country, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter came one day after the Congolese rebels said that
they will sign the peace accord next week aimed at ending the
year-long war in Congo (K).

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends U.N. Mission in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution extending
the mandate of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) for three
months to ensure stability after the poll on East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET's mandate will go on until November 30 during the
interim phase between the end of the referendum and the start of
the implementation of its result.
</P>
<P>
About 450,000 registered voters go to polling stations on
August 30 to choose between a wide rage of autonomy within
Indonesia or independence under the May 5 agreement among
Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides that if the majority of the voters want
autonomy, Portugal, ruler of East Timor until 1975, would help
remove East Timor from the list of non-self-governing territories
of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
If the voting result is the opposite, Indonesia would terminate
its links with East Timor which it annexed in 1976 for the
territory's transition towards independence.
</P>
<P>
The resolution authorized the UNAMET to include 460 civil
police to continue advising the Indonesian police and preparing
for the recruiting and training of the new East Timorese police
force.
</P>
<P>
Another component of the UNAMET will be a military liaison of
up to 300 personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council had a closed-door meeting at which council members
reaffirmed their view that the ballot "represents a historic
opportunity to resolve the question of East Timor peacefully."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the outcome of the consultation (ballot), members of
the Security Council strongly hope that the people of East Timor
will respect that decision and work together to build a peaceful
and prosperous future," the council president, Namibia's Martin
Andjaba, told the press.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Debt to Reach 160 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign debt will be
166.2 billion U.S. dollars by the beginning of next year,
according to a program on foreign borrowing for 2000 that was sent
to the State Duma along with the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt at the start of 1999 was 156.6 billion
dollars, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Debt on loans provided by foreign countries will be 71.8
billion dollars at the start of 2000, up from 68.9 billion dollars
at the start of 1999. Debt on loans from foreign banks and
companies is projected at 38.1 billion dollars, compared with
36.1 billion dollars on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Debt on loans from international financial organizations will
be 22.4 billion dollars, a slight increase from 22.2 billion
dollars at the start of 1999. Debt on Central Bank loans will be
6.8 billion dollars, up from 2.3 billion dollars on January 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Government securities denominated in foreign currency will
remain unchanged at 27.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the program submitted to the State Duma, or lower house
of parliament, foreign borrowing will increase to 177.6 billion
dollars by the start of 2001, and loans provided by foreign
countries will be 78.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia will provide 400 million dollars in loans to
foreign countries next year. They include 124 million dollars to
China, 110 million dollars to Vietnam, 50 million dollars to
Yugoslavia, 41.4 million dollars to Croatia, 16 million dollars to
India, 12 million dollars to Bulgaria, and 10 million dollars to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A separate document, accompanying the 2000 draft budget sent to
the State Duma, said Russia's internal debt will reach 648.3
billion rubles (27.65 billion dollars) by January 1 next year, but
the amount is expected to drop to 593.181 billion rubles (23.97
billion dollars) by the beginning of 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressional Staffers Leave for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The White House expressed
concern Friday over a trip by a group of Congressional staffers to
Iraq to investigate the effect of U.N. sanctions there.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council at
the White House, said the Clinton administration was concerned
over the trip because of "safety and security."
</P>
<P>
"One of the factors that we have to take into consideration is
safety and security and the well-being of American citizens," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Leavy indicated there would be no attempt to block the
trip.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, Congress members and their staff have the
prerogative to travel wherever they want. It's not for the
administration to make those judgments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four staff members were leaving Washington Friday and
planned to enter Iraq through Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Backed by several religious, Arab-American and peace
organizations, the four plan to meet with relief and U.N.
officials and gather information on the impact of Western economic
sanctions on Iraq. There were to stay about a week.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a request sent to National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger on Aug. 12 that the trip was to "examine the effect
of economic sanctions in Iraq on the civilian population,
governmental policy and U.S. economic and strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has blamed the sanctions for the death of hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis through malnutrition and the collapse of
medical services.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey issued by UNICEF (the U.N. Children's Fund)
found that child mortality rates have more than doubled in south
and central Iraq since the sanctions began in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The State Department opposing the visit forced the group to
cancel the trip last week, but in later discussion the State
Department conceded they could make the visit legally if they did
not enter Iraq on U.S. passports.
</P>
<P>
A fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies however said the
State Department "didn't have a legal basis to prohibit
representatives from the Congress from conducting an
investigation."

<HEADLINE> Unionists Threaten Court Challenge to IRA Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish unionists said
Friday that they are considering a court challenge to Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam's ruling which said the IRA had not
broken its ceasefire despite a recent murder and charges of
gun-running.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said Thursday that there was not sufficient basis to say
overall that the Irish Republican Army's two-year-old truce had
broken down, prompting widespread criticism from unionist
politicians and the opposition Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
They claimed she had failed to take proper consideration of the
relevant legislation on ceasefires.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of parliament for the pro-British
Ulster Unionists, told the Guardian newspaper, "We are considering
a legal challenge to overturn her ruling."
</P>
<P>
"If she lacks the moral courage to face up to the IRA, she
should leave and let someone else come in who will," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She has lost all credibility and she should go now," he added.
"She is sending a signal to the terrorists they can do as they
wish."
</P>
<P>
Mowlam has admitted that the IRA had murdered a taxi driver who
was an alleged police informer and was implicated in the alleged
smuggling of arms from the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, said Mowlam's
statement was the only decision available.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has yet to confirm that it will take part in the
review of the Good Friday Agreement, but is expected to reach a
decision in eight days' time.
</P>
<P>
The review of the Good Friday Agreement, headed by former U.S.
Senator George Mitchell, is due to start on September 6.

<HEADLINE> Athens Derivatives Exchange Launches in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday officially launched
the Athens Derivatives Exchange (ADEX), a big step made by Greek
capital markets towards maturity.
</P>
<P>
The new market would operate as a supplement to the main market
and it would contribute to upgrade Greece's capital markets
internationally, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted
ADEX Chairman L. Alexakis as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first trading session of the derivatives market closed with
a volume of 602 contracts, worth 3.4 billion drachmas (about 11
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect that traded contracts will exceed 5,000 by the
time the ADEX is fully operational.
</P>
<P>
Investment companies believe that the ADEX will contribute to
market efficiency in both bull and bear spells. Derivatives widen
the investors' options in hedging and portfolio management.
Hedging aims to cover or reduce risk through the correspondence of
derivatives with assets. In portfolio management, they can be used
for diversifying assets or improving overall performance.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, WMO Cooperate to Prevent Natural Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) have signed a Memorandum of
Understanding on closer cooperation in natural disaster
prevention.
</P>
<P>
At the core of this strengthened cooperation is the
establishment of a WMO-World Bank liaison in Washington to
facilitate the better use of climate information and forecasting,
according to a WMO press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WMO expressed hope that with the technical expertise of the
WMO and the global touch of the World Bank, the climate
information and forecasting can be more effectively and
expansively disseminated.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding will further
contribute to developing synergies between relevant programs of
the bank and those of the WMO and thus promote the development of
the capacity of nations in applying scientific and technical
advances to national sustainable development plans," said WMO
Secretary-General G.O.P Obasi.
</P>
<P>
"WMO's expertise and global network of national Meteorological
and Hydrological Services offers a distinct advantage to key
activities of the bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
Signing the memorandum on behalf of the World Bank, Vice
President Ian Johnson said, "The promise of this partnership is
the opportunity it offers to match the WMO's scientific and
technical expertise with the bank's economic know-how."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank vice president for environmentally and socially
sustainable development said that meteorology is central to
everything from agricultural production to mitigating the effects
of climate-related natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The WMO said that developing countries are likely to be
severely affected by climate change and water constraints, so they
will need help in developing the financial, technical, and human
capacity to adapt to a changing climate and increasing water
scarcity.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, the World Bank has provided almost 9
billion U.S. dollars in emergency loans to help countries recover
from the impacts of natural disasters, according to the WMO.

<HEADLINE> Two Planes Arrive in Somalia Despite Kenya's Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two planes from Kenya
transporting the narcotic leaves known as Khat arrived Friday at
the airstrip of Km-50 near the capital violating the Kenyan ban of
flight to the worn-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people rushed to buy the their desperately needed
chewing khat, which is very popular in eastern African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to khat business dealers, a large plane carrying
twice the amount of that of the two Nairobi planes has also
arrived from the capital of the break-away Republic of Somaliland,
Hargeisa.
</P>
<P>
One of the major khat dealers told the reporter that the ban
was wrong any way, adding that they had never engaged in exporting
weapons or contraband forbidden by Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya announced the ban of all flights, including humanitarian
flights, between Kenya and Somalia on Wednesday, saying this was
aimed at curbing smuggling and influx of illegal arms and
contraband goods from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"If Kenya doesn't stop the ban, we are turning to Ethiopia and
it will only be Kenya to loose the business," said a khat dealer
who asked not to mention his name.
</P>
<P>
The dealers would not speak straight away about how they got
the stuff back to Mogadishu. However, some say that the that the
planes leaving from Wilson Airport in Nairobi and it first
pretended to heading to Mandera, a Kenyan town on the border with
Somalia, and then flew over all the way to Km-50, the usual
airstrip near Mogadishu.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- King Ronald Mutebi II of
Buganda, the biggest kingdom in Uganda, got married with Sylvia
Nagginda here Friday, ending the kingdom's 32 years of being
without a queen.
</P>
<P>
The wedding ceremony, which lasted a whole day from the
morning, took place in Mengo, the palace of the king. It was
attended by thousands of invited guests from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and nearly all senior
government officials of the central government turned up to mark
the "millennium wedding ceremony".
</P>
<P>
After the wedding, the 44-year-old king and his 35-year-old
queen went to address his people behind the palace.

<P>
The Buganda Kingdom was restored in 1993 after it was abolished
by former Ugandan President Obote I. Ronald Mutebi was crowned on
July 31 of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The queen was born and educated in Uganda but she had been
working for the World Bank in Washington, before coming back for
the wedding in late July.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's High Court Tries 3 Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The trial in the Zimbabwean High
Court of three Americans charged with illegal possession of arms
continued in Harare Friday with the accused maintaining that the
weapons were solely for self protection.
</P>
<P>
Garry George Blanchard, one of the accused, said that as
Christian missionaries, they had taken arms to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) for hunting and self defense since the
country was in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Under cross examination by state counsel Michael Mujuru,
Blanchard said the weapons belonged to Bob Banks and that when
they were arrested at the Harare International Airport, they were
taking them back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Mujuru said evidence found in possession of the trio
such as weapons, combat caps and camouflage shirts suggested that
they were not missionaries but belonged to a military group.
</P>
<P>
The counsel argued that the state should disregard the
defense's claims that the trio were missionaries and concentrate
of the charges of illegal possession of firearm and violating the
Aircraft Act.
</P>
<P>
The trial will continue on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans were arrested on May 7 at the Harare
International Airport while trying to board the Swiss Air plane
with their luggage containing weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks New Ideas to Solve Afghan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
seeking new ideas and approaches to solving the 20-year old Afghan
conflict, according to Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs Kieran Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Security Council on the latest situation in
Afghanistan Friday, he said some 1,800 fighters have been killed
in the past month, including 1,200 from the Taliban movement and
600 from the opposition United Front.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, reignited by the Taliban's offensive on July 28,
has made little change in the military balance between the two
warring factions, but inflicted heavy suffering on the civilian
population, he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 110,000 internally displaced people have moved to
the capital of Kabul, Panjsher Valley and other places.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, there has been no direct contact or
meeting between the warring sides since the meeting of the group
of "6+2" in Tashkent on July 19-20, despite the behind-the-scene
diplomacy by the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan
(UNSMA), he said.
</P>
<P>
The "6+2" refers to 6 Afghanistan neighbors namely China,
Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, plus
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The group was originally assembled almost two years ago to seek
a joint strategy for a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, there is an apparent trend of growing disunity among
the members of the group and a new formula of Security Council
support for U.N. peace-making efforts in the west Asian country
may be required, Prendergast noted.
</P>
<P>
He drew attention to the outside support for the warring
factions, including ongoing deliveries of ammunition and
participation of thousands of non-Afghan nationals in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the senseless war in Afghanistan will
increasingly evolve towards an even more widespread and
destructive regional conflict," he cautioned.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
called on African states especially members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to strengthen their economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Special Representative of the Secretary of State to the
SADC, Ambassador Robert Krueger, made the call while addressing a
press conference in the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said that SADC states, united as one, can do a lot more than
standing as individual countries with limited resources in
economic advancement.
</P>
<P>
The special representative said most SADC countries, which were
front- line states for liberation of Africa, are facing a broader
social question - - to improve economic welfare of their people.
</P>
<P>
Within Africa, SADC region is endowed with potential for
political stability and economic growth, conditions which could be
used for the betterment of people's livelihood, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will cooperate with SADC countries to
promote global economy through increased inter-region trade which
will subsequently grow into international trade, he said.

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- At least five teenage boys in
Northern Ireland said on Friday that they have been ordered to
leave the province by midnight on Saturday, or face being shot.
</P>
<P>
At least two of the five have left Dungannon, County Tyrone,
the BBC reported. The others are also expected to leave.
</P>
<P>
Reports have suggested that the death threat has come from the
Irish Republican Army, but police has not confirmed the reports.
Police only said a "third party" issued the threat.
</P>
<P>
Vincent McKenna, of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Bureau,
said the warning was issued through a local Catholic priest in
Dungannon.
</P>
<P>
McKenna added that the men who spoke with the priest in Dung
were from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
If it were proved that the threat came from the IRA, it would
further fuel the controversy over Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam's announcement on Thursday that the IRA ceasefire was still
intact.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Western African countries Friday
condemned the resurgent fighting by the Liberian rebels and called
on Liberia and Guinea to restore their good ties through dialog,
according to a report from Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in Lome at the end of a ministerial
meeting of some western African states, the ministers said that
the attacks threatened Liberia's peace and could destabilize the
entire sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The assault could also undermine the good relations between
Liberia and Guinea, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the dissidents to stop their criminal activities with
immediate effect and to avoid a repetition, adding that no member
of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) would support them.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed the determination of ECOWAS member
states to find ways and means to restore a climate of peace,
security and confidence between Liberia and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for Guinea and Liberia to restore dialog
and cooperation at all levels, requesting the presidents of Togo,
Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone to
organize a meeting between the Guinean and Liberian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to create a commission composed of Guinea
and Liberia and ECOWAS secretariat to work out solutions to
common security problems, which threaten peace and stability
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers from Ghana, Liberia,
Guinea, Nigeria and Togo and representatives of Cote d'Ivoire,
Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, countries relevant to the Liberian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian troops are reportedly making significant gains in
recent days in combating the rebels believed to be loyalists of
Liberian President Charles Taylor's rival warlords during the
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
But fierce fighting is still going on, according to latest
reports from the ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Favorable Environment to Solve Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday appealed
to the international community for creating a constructive,
favorable and relaxed external environment for the peaceful
settlement of the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The approach was reaffirmed by Shen Guofang, Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations during a Security Council
open debate on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Countries having major influence on the various parties in the
west Asian country should work actively to persuade those parties
to sit down and conduct dialogue and negotiations in a calm and
reasonable manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, countries, especially those bordering on Afghanistan,
should immediately stop providing military assistance to the
various factions, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the U.N. may consider putting an arms embargo on
Afghanistan and formulating a specific monitoring mechanism in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan factions, majorly the Taliban and the United Front
have been engaged in a 20-year war which inflicted heavy suffering
on the civilian population, with recent clashes leaving some 1,800
dead and tens of thousands displaced.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the history and reality have testified to the truth
that military means will do no good to the final settlement of the
issue and the only way to achieve this end is for all parties to
return to negotiations under the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
China, a member of the "6+2" group comprisings 5 other
Afghanistan neighbors plus Russia and the United States, will
continue to participate actively in the peace-making efforts while
supporting the U.N. in playing the central and leading role in
solving the issue, the Chinese envoy emphasized.

<HEADLINE> A Fireman Killed in High-rise Fire in Italy's Palermo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An Italian fireman was killed when
a concrete beam smashed his head and eighteen were injured when
fire swept through a 13-floor apartment and shopping complex in
Italy's south city of Palermo, capital of island Sicily Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Fire teams, civil protection workers and army units from half
of Sicily were drafted in to fight the blaze, which left fifty
families homeless and gutted eleven shops.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, top investigators said they see little basis for
speculation that the fire may have been set by Mafia racketeers,
but firemen said the fire seemed to have several hotbeds well
separated from each other.
</P>
<P>
The flames were tamed at about 8 pm local time. The building's
stability - two floors below ground and eleven above - was said to
be seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently started in a toy shop where fire also broke
out eleven days ago. On that occasion, the flames were doused
immediately.

<HEADLINE> Record Numbers Caught Sneaking Into Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- British immigration officials
Friday urged tighter security at European ports after they caught
record numbers of asylum seekers trying to sneak into Britain in
August.
</P>
<P>
They said 1,000 people had been caught this month -- almost as
many as the whole of last year -- by a surveillance team
patrolling Dover and other Channel ports with sniffer dogs.
</P>
<P>
"The number of clandestines (smuggled immigrants) in August has
already matched last year, which was the highest on record," the
Reuters quoted immigration officer John Tincey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The surge in reported immigrant smuggling follows record asylum
applications in Britain, clashes between Dover residents and
refugees, and opposition charges that the government has turned
Britain into a "soft touch" for bogus asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
Tincey said many of the 1,000 people found in the back of
lorries entering England's southern ports were smuggled across
Europe from the former Yugoslavia by organized crime rings.
</P>
<P>
Some lorries trying to sneak their illicit human cargo across
the Channel carried 50 or 60 people. In other cases individuals
slipped into trucks without the driver noticing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dover surveillance team had evidence they were
fighting a highly organized network of trafficers.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office has said a record 6,600 people applied for
asylum in Britain in July, further swelling a backlog of asylum
applications to over 80,000.

<HEADLINE> Causes of Gulf War Illness Still Mystery: U S. Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. presidential panel
looking into Gulf War illnesses suggested Friday to further study
into whether there are genetic reasons for the illness after
failing to discover causes of the ailments.
</P>
<P>
The Special Oversight Board on Gulf War Illness, issued an
interim report, ruling out one suspected cause of exposure to
depleted uranium used in U.S. munitions.
</P>
<P>
The panel agreed with independent studies that found no
evidence for the uranium link.
</P>
<P>
The board, headed by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued a
series of recommendations designed to keep better track of those
with diagnosed and undiagnosed Gulf War illnesses, make clearer
information available to the public and lead to better federal
coordination.
</P>
<P>
While the Defense Department "has conducted a credible
investigation into the causes of Gulf War illnesses," the board
"has not been shy about pointing out areas needing further
improvement," Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
The board suggested declassifying certain intelligence reports
on the war that might bear on the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The panel called on the government to correlate signs and
symptoms of Gulf War illnesses with "an age- and gender-matched
general population sample."
</P>
<P>
As many as 30,000 veterans of the war have complained of
mysterious maladies, including fatigue, joint pain and memory
loss, that they claim are related to their service in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street socks fell sharply
Friday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed
concerns about the high-flying stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 108.28 at
11,090.17, adding to the loss of 127.59 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 13.74 at 1,348.27. The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 15.72 at 2,758.90.
</P>
<P>
The stocks dropped after Greenspan told his colleagues at the
Federal Reserve's annual retreat in Wyoming's Grand Tetons that
the Federal Reserve needs to pay closer attention to what happens
on Wall Street because Americans have reaped the rewards of the
high-flying stock market and used those paper profits to justify
their spending and other financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were interpreted by investors as a signal for
another interest rates hike this year. The Federal Reserve has
raised interest rates twice in the past two months in efforts to
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 6.63 at 625.71 ang the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.60 at 782.52. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 3.57 at 432.45.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,777 down, 1,133 up and 594
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 553.18 million shares from 709.17
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> At Least 2 Killed in Yemeni Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed
and 12 others injured when a car bomb exploded in a diplomatic
section of the Yemeni capital Sanaa in the small hours of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some embassies and diplomats' homes sustained damage, but no
diplomatic personnel were injured in the blast that took place
outside a supermarket in the Hadda area at 2:00 a.m. (2300 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The supermarket was destroyed in a fire caused by the
explosion. Authorities closed off the area and the injured was
rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Embassies of the U.S., Britain and Turkey, and some U.N.
offices are located in the section.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday explosion was one of the biggest to rock the
capital in years and it destroyed electricity lines in the area
and broke windows as far as one kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came hours after two bombs went off in southern
Yemen. No injures were reported there.
</P>
<P>
Authorities refused to speculate whether the three blasts were
related.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Importance of Chinese President's New Zealand Trip (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin's visit to
New Zealand next month is the first ever by a Chinese head of
state and will be important for the history of bilateral relations,
according to New Zealand's ambassador to China Peter Adams.
</P>
<P>
Adams told Xinhua recently that the government and people of
his country are looking forward to President Jiang's visit because
it comes at a good time when bilateral ties are getting stronger
and when China's reforms and opening-up is going very well.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral ties have grown in an excellent way and
have developed more quickly in recent years, as is reflected in
the political field, trade and economic cooperation, investment,
and defense. He expressed the belief that the visit will help push
bilateral relations forward to a new and more dynamic period.
</P>
<P>
Areas of cooperation like tourism and education have also given
new impetus to bilateral relations, he said.

<P>
China is a big market for New Zealand as it is now New Zealand'
s sixth or seventh largest export market and the fourth largest
provider of imports, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
China mainly spends on forestry products in New Zealand, which
spends mainly on breweries, tanneries, and the leisure industry in
China, he said, adding that more Chinese companies will be invited
to New Zealand to discuss ways to boost bilateral economic and
trade links.
</P>
<P>
Trade and mutual investment provide an important foundation for
bilateral relations, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
China recently approved New Zealand as a destination for
Chinese tourists, and more than 2,000 Chinese students have got
approval to study in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The two areas of tourism and education of course involve
ordinary people, Adams pointed out, and the enormous potential in
various fields needs to be tapped.

Prior to the beginning of his state visit, President Jiang will
attend an informal leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined APEC in 1991, President Jiang has attended
every informal leadership meeting it has held and China and New
Zealand have had good cooperation in APEC, according to Adams.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have always worked well together in APEC and
do not have any significant differences, he said, adding that they
have in fact been working in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
China will be the host country for APEC in 2001 and New Zealand
is happy to share its experiences in handling this large
responsibility with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams has worked in Beijing for 18 months as ambassador, a post
he considers to be a very welcome chance and big challenge, and
has so far visited 21 Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Through the trips, he said he can learn more about the ancient
Chinese culture and the vast and diverse country, and it is
interesting to witness the process of changes taking place in the
country.

<HEADLINE> 13 Iranian Jews Handed over to Judiciary for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Iranian Jews arrested
on charges of espionage for Israel and the United States have been
handed over by the Information Ministry to the Judiciary in order
to speed up their trail.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Saturday quoted an unnamed official as
admitting that investigations into the case have not completed,
and the hasty handover of the suspects is a result of both
internal and international pressure.
</P>
<P>
A representative of Iran's Jewish community at the Majlis
(parliament) has called for an early trial of the suspects
to clear people's suspicion. Jews are a minority in the
Muslim-dominated country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials complained the U.S., Israel and some
European countries are trying to politicize the case by saying the
Jews were arrested simply because they are Jews.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have denied the Iranian claim that
the 13 Jews were at their service and called for their
release.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Jews and a few Mulsims were arrested last April
for spying for Israel and the U.S. in Shiraz, Isfahan, and
Tehran, three major cities in Iran.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of sending information to Israel through
"advanced communication devices," dispatching members of their
network abroad for training, and assisting Iranians to illegally
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"The espionage network involving the arrested suspects was
very complicated. This is why the investigations have taken a
lot of time," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the arrested are the "executive members of the
espionage network," and "there are certain people who are
considered the brains of the network. They must be arrested as
well."
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear if the trial will be an open one.
But Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has promised that
Iran will respect the legal rights of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"They can have lawyers, and all the legal procedures will
be observed. Their families can visit them," Kharrazi said in
a televised interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that Iran will not bow to outside pressure and
release them without a trial.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Williams in Final Showdown before U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And Williams' straight-set semi-final win over Monica Seles in
the Pilot Pen in New Haven in Connecticut on Friday brought her up
one notch in the world to a career-best No. 3, one spot behind
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday in their fourth meeting of the year is the
final, the final tuneup before the U.S. Open, where Davenport is
to defend her title while Williams seeks her first Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
All of their meetings this year have been on hard courts. In
their most recent meeting, Williams beat Davenport in the semi-
finals at San Diego. Davenport holds a 8-2 edge in their career
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Davenport qualified for the final after straight-set wins over
Nathalie Dechy, Amelie Mauresmo, and a three-set win over Ruxandra
Dragomir, all unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
Williams, second seed in the New Haven event, reached the final
with straight-set wins over Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo, Magui
Serni and Seles, seeded third.
</P>
<P>
Confident in the fastest service game in women's tennis, the 19-
year-old Williams overmatched baseline specialist Seles with power,
range and booming serve in the 59-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Williams' 204 kph serve, clocked at Zurich last year, is still
unsurpassed on tour. She served five aces Friday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport won 11 straight games in her semi-final, rallying
from a set down to beat Dragomir 4-6, 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
She expects a tough match from Williams Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Williams said she'll have to return well and pounce on second
serves to get by the hard-hitting Davenport. "I am really into
attacking second serves these days. It is pretty much the fashion,
" Williams was quoted as saying. "She's improved the level of her
game, but so have I."

<HEADLINE> New China's First Store Opens for Business After Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 44-year-old Wangfujing
Department Store opened its doors again today after being closed
for half a year for renovation.
</P>
<P>
Known as was New China's First Store, it is the country's first
large retail store backed by the government after the People's
Republic of China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The store originally opened in September of 1955 and was one of
the capital's four largest stores, along with Dong'an Market, the
Xidan Department Store, and Longfu Mansion, all of which went on
to become modern shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
The store became a joint-stock company known as Wangfujing
Department Store (Group) Co., Ltd. and was listed on China's stock
exchange in 1994, with business scope expanded to cover retail,
processing, catering and export business.
</P>
<P>
It now has six branches in the cities of Guangzhou, Chengdu,
Nantong, and Wuhan, with assets hitting 2.3 billion yuan. Total
sales in the past four decades exceeded 12 billion yuan, or 250
times the original investment.
</P>
<P>
After the renovation project, the architecture of the store's
main part, in the style of the 1950s, has been preserved, while
its business area has been increased to 16,000 square meters.

The 3:22 a.m. (0122 GMT) blast rattled windows and woke people
across the city. No injuries were reported, and there was no
immediate indication who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
The base of the three-pronged concrete monument was badly
damaged, and NATO troops arrived at the scene shortly after the
explosion to remove remaining explosives.
</P>
<P>
Erected during the time of Josip Broz Tito, founder of
Yugoslavia, the monument is a symbol of "brotherhood and unity," a
Tito slogan for harmony among multiethnic Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
British KFOR explosive experts said the amateurish bomb was
made from aging military explosives, using an alarm clock as a
timing device.
</P>

Cars were stopped and inspected in downtown Pristina by U.N.
police in search for the culprits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The "one country, two systems"
principle has proven itself to be the most practical way to
realize the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
The evidence is the successful return of Hong Kong and Macao to
the motherland, Qian told the 10th plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Macao Special Administration Region
in Beijing today, where he condemned Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui for his
divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Central Government has committed itself to
peaceful reunification under the "one country, two systems"
principle, adding that only by safeguarding the sovereign and
territorial integrity of the country, can the topic of coexistence
of two systems and mutual respect be broached.
</P>
<P>
Qian warned Lee and the Taiwan authorities not to underestimate
the decisiveness of the Central Government in defending China's
sovereign and territorial integrity and not to underestimate the
will of the Chinese people and their strength in fighting
divisiveness and the independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one China" principle is the precondition for
stability and development of cross-Straits relations and peaceful
reunification.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Armed confrontations have
intensified between the forces of General Mohamed Saed Hirsi
Morgan and the Jubba valley alliance led by the Somali National
Front (SNF) faction in Hosingo village, about 90 Kilometers
southwest of the port town of Kismaio Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the forces of General
Morgan led by Colonel Abdi Nur Sid have attacked the village with
several battle wagons and nearly 100 heavily armed infantry
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The VHF radio reported that the exchange of heavy gunfire
between the two sides could be heard in all the villages in the
area including Badhadheh district which is the main town in the
area.
</P>
<P>
General Abdurahman Khalif Dhi'is loyal to Morgan, who contacted
 this reporter on the VHF radio, said Saturday that his forces
have attacked the town and claimed a landslide victory against
what he called the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Dhi'is said his forces have inflicted the coalition forces with
heavy losses and chased them out of the village towards Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that his forces have lost 12 fighters and five
others have sustained gunshot wounds during the fighting for
control of Hosingo village.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his forces have killed 22 from the alliance
forces and wounded seven others before taking control of the
village.
</P>
<P>
His forces will continue fighting up to the end to get the
forces of the Jubba Valley Alliance out of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ibrahim Jama Howleh, spokesman for the SNF in
Mogadishu, has denied that his forces were involved in any kind of
fighting in Hosingo village Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was between the Sheikhal and Ogaden clansmen for
control of the town, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Howleh said both sides claim the ownership of the town and
that his alliance forces have nothing to do with clannish
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Howleh admitted that his forces are currently
stationed outside Hosingo village, looking for General Dhi'is.
</P>
<P>
Only three days ago, the alliance forces led by the SNF took
control of his village in a bitter fighting against the forces of
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 people were killed from both sides three days ago.
The alliance forces are still after Morgan whose forces were
driven out of the southern port town of Kismaio in early June this
year.
</P>
<P>
Morgan and his forces have controlled Kismaio, 500 kilometers
South of Mogadishu, in the past six years during the presence of
the multinational forces led by Americans in the Restore Hope
Operation.

</P>
<P>
There were no new records set in the official competition
events on Saturday. The men's 100m butterfly final saw a heated
showdown between world champion Michael Klim fight and Australian

</P>
<P>
American Brooke Bennett finished 12 seconds ahead of Australian

66.
</P>
<P>
Perkins, who blamed his poor performance on a viral infection,

<TEXT>
<P>
The 18-year-old Taufik won 14-17, 15-13, 15-1 and now faces a
final against Heryanto Arbi, who ousted fellow Indonesian H.
Hendrawan 4-15, 15-11, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
While the men's final will be an all-Indonesian affair, the
Chinese will be contesting the women's title, with second seed Ye
Zhaoying playing third seeded Gong Zhichao.
</P>
<P>
Taufik, who lost to Christensen the last time they met in the
All England final earlier this year, came to an early 6-2 lead in
the first game but the Dane overturned the deficit and went on to
win the game with clever defensive play.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian increased the pace in the second game and
attacked with more variety to level the match. Christensen
started the deciding game well and was 5-0 up before Taufik came
back to level at 7-7. The Indonesian went on to seal his place in
the final.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first game by sixth seed Hendrawan, Heryanto
levelled the contest and continued in similar fashion in the final
game with well-placed drop shots.
</P>
<P>
The women's semi-finals, Gong beat Kanako Yonekura of Japan 11-
3, 11-9 in a tougher match and the losing finalist last year once
again faces fellow-Chinese Ye Zhaoying in the final.
</P>
<P>
Ye was taken the distance by Japan's Yasuko Mizui, who
surprised her opponent by taking the opening game 11-5. Once the
Chinese got her rival's measure, she produced a clinical finish to
close out the match 11-2, 11-8.

BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ping'an Avenue and three other
streets in Beijing opened for traffic today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government spent two billion yuan on the 7,026-

<HEADLINE> China Kicks Off Modest Start in Asian Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the stronger China did not live up to its fame when the
smaller Malaysians stunned the court and fans with a slam basket.
The 1.83-meter point guard Tan Kee Hian made a running dunk five
minutes 43 seconds into the second half to cap a 8-3 run to close
the game 38-30.
</P>
<P>
"My team played the best as it could," Malaysian head coach
Felton Sealey said.
</P>
<P>
The court burst into a wave of applause in an extremely
unbelievable manner to pay ovation to Hian's excellent basket.
Hian led Malaysia with ten points.
</P>
<P>
A slam attempt by his teammate Ng Yeo Seng was rejected by
Chinese Liu Yudong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xingquan, Chinese head coach who took the charge of the
team in May, was not satisfied with his squad. "My players did
not compete to the level as they should," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
But it seemed that Jiang was not worried. "It's not a bad game,
" Jiang said. "We could find out what our problems were and we'll
go back to solve them. We've learnt a lot from the game."
</P>
<P>
Forward Liu Yudong scored six of China's and the game's first
nine points with 17:20 left, while the experienced Malaysians
opened the mark on a free throw on the following possession.
</P>
<P>
But the smaller Malaysians boasted a brilliant start in an
expectedly one-sided game as they closed at 9-8 with 14:53 to go
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Opening with a full-court one-for-one trap, Malaysia, who
stepped into the shoes when the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea and Kazakhstan pulled off from the competition, soon found
the rhythm to counter back against the taller but slower opponents.
</P>
<P>
"China was sleeping," Sealey said. "We played one game a time,
and we get developed well."
</P>
<P>
But Chin's 2.29-meter center Yao Ming was too much for Malaysia
and two blocks, two boards and six points in two minutes from the
19-year-old pulled the game away.
</P>
<P>
Yao finished with a game-high 19 points.
</P>
<P>
Gong Xiaobin's slam gave China the biggest lead in the first
half at 30-18 with 4:02 to go before the break, when China led at
34-22.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's other matches at Fukuoka International Center,
hosts Japan routed Thailand 85-38 in the opening match of the
tournament, defending champions South Korea trounced Philippines
98-63, while Lebanon wrapped up the day with a 75-70 win over the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In the Fukuoka Civic Gymnastic, Kuwait came back from eight-
point deficit at the break to beat Hong Kong, China 88-62, Sau di
Arabia edged Bahrain 79-63 and Uzbekistan lost to Chinese Taipei
90-82.

<HEADLINE> American Nigerians to Raise 15 Mln for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua)(C Overseas Nigerians in the United
States are to set up a fund targeting the sum of 15 million U.S.
dollars to assist the Nigerian government's bid to re-build the
country, reported a Nigerian newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Olumide Adeleke, coordinator of the proposed fund-raising
ceremony, said Thursday in the U.S. that the event would be held
in some major U. S. cities, starting in New York on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Such fund-raising ceremony will then be shifted to Canada and
eventually London and other cities in Europe, said Abuja Mirror, a
major Newspaper in Nigeria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Many wealthy Nigerians living in the U.S. are spearheading the
fund- raising, which they predicated on showing their practical
commitment to the development of their country.
</P>
<P>
Adeleke said the ceremony would attract top-flight Nigeria-born
athletes,
</P>
<P>
professionals and businessmen including basketball super star,
Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
Another group, the Association of Nigerians Abroad (ANA), has
thrown its weight behind the proposed fund-raising and is
currently mobilizing ahead of the date of September 4.
</P>
<P>
Steve Michael, president of the association, said Nigerians
abroad have realized that they have a duty to assist their
less-privileged fellow citizens back home.
</P>
<P>
!0It is important for us to come together. It is important for
us to discuss ways that we can help our schools, and higher
educational institutions. I mean it is necessary for us to do
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. government gave Nigeria a 30-million-dollar
aid. The U.S. also promised to consider other areas of assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is currently down with very poor state of
infrastructure like bad roads, epileptic power and water supply
and poor health facilities, as a result of long mismanagement of
military regimes.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Payments For Laid-off Workers(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Millions of laid-off workers in
China will have their social security payments raised 30 percent
before October, according to Minister of Labor and Social Security
Zhang Zuoji.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said today that the basic living payments will go up 30
percent and a detailed plan has been drawn up by the finance and
labor and social security ministries.
</P>
<P>
On average, a jobless worker laid off the job at a state-run
enterprise is now given 170 yuan (20 U.S. dollars) for daily
living costs and 83 yuan for life, medical and unemployment
insurance each month.
</P>
<P>
Pensions will also be increased to varying degrees, Zhang told
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee
which is meeting now. Work was done previously to find out whether
allowances for laid-off workers and pensions for retirees had been
handed out.
</P>
<P>
Out of 7.42 million workers laid off in the first half of this
year, 5.4 million have not found jobs and 300,000 have not been

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Russian Vice-Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
in a meeting with Russian Vice-Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov here
today, said that China and Russia, as close neighbors and
permanent members of the UN Security Council, have the
responsibility for international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that increasing consultation and cooperation, pushing
the global multi-polarization forward, and striving to establish a
just and rational new political and economic order of the world is
in the common interest of both countries and could help maintain
the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
At this historical moment of the turning of the century, peace
and development are the major themes and the world is moving
toward multi-polarization which is irrevocable, he said. China and
Russia are developing a strategic cooperative partnership of long-
term stability, good-neighborliness, mutually-beneficial
cooperation, equality, and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Because the two countries hold identical or similar views on
many important issues and are reinforcing coordination and
cooperation in dealing with global and regional affairs, there are
a good basis and good prospects for the partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Klebanov's talks with Central Military Commission Vice-
Chairman Zhang Wannian on Tuesday, Jiang said the discussion will
help stimulate bilateral cooperation and hoped that such
cooperation will reach a new level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he met with President Boris Yeltsin several days ago
in Kyrgyzstan and had a candid discussion of bilateral ties and
many issues of common interest. He said that he is looking forward
to the second meeting with Yeltsin in China this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said that contacts and mutual understanding between
the heads of the two states are significant for bilateral ties and
he hoped that the two countries will further expand cooperation in
various fields to raise bilateral ties to a higher stage.

Al-Rawabdeh said he believed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
"was capable of delivering his peace pledges and implementing what
he was tasked with" the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is backing the Palestinians' struggle to secure their
legitimate rights and implementation of the peace agreements
signed with Israel, al-Rawabdeh told reporters after his meeting
with Mubarak. He later returned home.
</P>
<P>
Jordan "also stands by our Syrian and Lebanese brothers to
reach just solutions (with Israel)," the Jordanian prime ministers
said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been suspended since early
1996. Syria wants the return of the Golan Heights captured by
Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab states that have peace
treaties with Israel and play a key role in mediating the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rawabdeh said he also discussed with Mubarak the Arab
situation and the steps needed to unify Arab efforts "at this
critical stage."

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Payments for Laid-off Workers(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has asked central and local budget offices,
enterprises, and society to help raise money to pay the allowances,
but they are confronted by difficulties in collecting the funds
and in some places, laid-off workers don't have sufficient
allowances and there are still loopholes in fund management, Zhang
says.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that finding jobs is tough because of the labor
surplus, the failure in implementing some preferential tax and
loan policies meant to encourage employment and the general apathy
of some people in looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient life insurance funds and poor efficiency also make
it difficult to pay pensions to retirees on time, Zhang says, and
the ministry of labor and social security will urge more employers
to buy life insurance for their employees to bring insurance
coverage to above 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
There will also be more laws to safeguard the social security
system and a social security law and labor contract law will be
drafted by the ministry and submitted to the NPC for review as
soon as possible, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> India Shows No Sincerity to Peace Process: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Saturday regretted that India was not responding with
sincerity and seriousness to Pakistan's efforts to promote peace
and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat,
foreign minister of Nepal, who called on him to deliver formal
invitation to attend the 11th SAARC summit planned to be held in
Kathmandu on November 26 to 28, which was accepted by Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister apprised the visiting dignitary of the
efforts Pakistan had made and was making to promote peace and
stability in the region. He regretted that these steps were not
being reciprocated by India with sincerity and seriousness," said
an official statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's commitment to the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and expressed the
belief that South Asia had great potential which ensured a bright
future for the region.
</P>
<P>
He said socio-economic cooperation was a key to SAARC's
cooperative process.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that it is hampered due to lack of an
enabling environment of mutual trust and understanding.

<HEADLINE> New Reports to Be Discussed by Chinese Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Reports on economic conditions,
funds for people laid off the job at state-owned enterprises, and
implementation of the forest law were presented to China's
legislature for review today along with a bill on increasing the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), attended today's meeting of the Committee
's 11th session, where Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the
State Development Planning Commission, said that the Chinese
economy maintained growth in the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China's gross domestic product rose 7.6
percent to 3.62 trillion yuan in the January-July period, when the
country witnessed an increase in revenues, steady development of
the financial sector, continued trade surplus, a stable yuan,
growing foreign exchange reserves, and progress in invigorating
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate economic growth, the State Council submitted a
bill to the legislature proposing an increase in the nation's debt
this year and an adjustment in the central government's budget.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zuoji, minister of labor and social security, said in his
report on the laid-off workers that the central government decided
to raise payments to the jobless by 30 percent from July 1 and
this increase should be in the hands of workers by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, reported on
implementing the Forestry Law and said that the illegal cutting of
trees is still running rampant in many parts of China.
</P>
<P>
According to him, forest police dealt with 2,105 cases of this
kind in 1998, 11 percent more than in 1997.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China had 7.6 percent economic
growth in the first six months of this year and growth in revenues,
a stable yuan, and smooth finances, Zeng Peiyan, the minister in
charge of the Development Planning Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy maintained the growth that emerged in the
second of half last year, Zeng told the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and China still had a surplus in
foreign trade in the first seven months, with foreign exchange
reserves growing, and progress being made in invigorating state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
There are some serious problems, however, like declining
exports and foreign investments, slack consumer demand, a slow
increase of fixed-assets investment, and deflation.
</P>
<P>
Other data Zeng provided at today's meeting:
</P>
<P>
-- The summer harvest was the second biggest in history, with
118.5 billion tons, 5.3 billion tons more than last year.
</P>
<P>
-- In the first seven months, industrial production was
worth 1.1 trillion yuan, an increase of 9.4 percent over the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> FPDA Countries Conduct Marine and Air Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Five Power Defense
Arrangement (FPDA) countries started a twelve-day integrated
marine and air exercise Saturday in the South China Sea and in the
air space of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, according to a
joint news release from defense ministries of Singapore and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The news release said a total of 32 ships, more than 60
aircraft, two submarines and approximately 4,000 personnel from
the navies and air forces of FPDA countries, namely, Australia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom, are
participating in the exercise, code-named EX STARDEX 99, with an
aim to enhance inter-operability and mutual cooperation as well as
mutual understanding so as to further strengthen the relationship
between the navies, air forces and army components of FPDA
countries.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the exercise hosted by Malaysia will last
until September 10 and its main objective is to exercise FPDA
navies and air forces in conduct of combined joint marine and air
operations in a multi-threat, limited conflict scenario.
</P>
<P>
The news release noted that the joint maritime and air exercise
has evolved from the amalgamation of EX STARFISH, a maritime
exercise with the FPDA countries and one of the FPDA Air Defense
Exercises (ADEX), to expand the scope of training for air forces
and to enhance the training of all participants.
</P>
<P>
The first of the FPDA joint maritime and air exercises,
code-named EX FLYING FISH, was conducted in April 1997 and hosted
by Malaysia. EX STARDEX was mooted on a reduced scale for the FPDA
countries to provide training opportunities to participants
between FLYING FISH exercises, conducted every three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has signed an agreement with Benin
under which the latter will provide prison facilities for convicts
of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed earlier this week, making Benin the
second country after Mali to accept Rwanda genocide convicts.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by The African Saturday, Benin has
long-standing co-operation with the U.N. tribunal, citing two
Rwandan suspects were transferred to the court last year.
</P>
<P>
The former Speaker of the Rwandan parliament and Secretary
General of the MRND, one of the political parties behind the
genocide, Joseph Nzirorera, and the bourgmestre (mayor) of
Mukingo, Juvenal Kajelijeli, were both arrested in Benin on June 5
of 1998 before being handed over to the U. N. Detention Facility
in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the legal advisor to the Registrar of the court,
Jean-Pele Fomete, told Xinhua that Zambia and other African
countries were also ready to accept prisoners related to the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was set up by the United Nations Security Council in
November of 1994 in northern Tanzania town Arusha to try leading
architects of the genocide that took place in the middle of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Two French Distribution Giants to Merge: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Two French giants of distribution,
Carrefour and Promodes, are expected to arrange a friendly merger
next week to create the world's second largest distribution group
after the U.S. Walmart, reported the daily Le Figaro on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Such a merger operation will be carried out through a take-over
bid or through an exchange of shares, said the report, which did
not quote any specific sources.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the value of shares of Carrefour rose by 2.86
percent to attain 140.30 euros (147 U.S. dollars) per share, while
that of Promodes, which are sold under the trademarks of Continent,
Shopi, Champion and 8 et Huit, were sold at 700 euros (735 U.S.
dollars), 6.71 percent more than the previous day.
</P>
<P>
A merger between the two groups will create an entity of more
than 47 billion euros (49.35 billion U.S. dollars) in sales figure
with a net profit of 900 million euros (945 million U.S. dollars),
according to statistics published by the two groups in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A merged group will also have 45 billion euros (47.25 billion U.
S. dollars) of shares listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that a merger between Carrefour and Promodes
will make it more difficult for foreign predators to launch a take-
over bid against them, as rumors have been spreading on a merger
between Carrefour with the German Metro or with the Dutch Ahold.
</P>
<P>
The successful entry by U.S. Walmart into Germany in 1998 and
its take-over of British Asda this year have stimulated a
restructuring of European distributors.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Abdulla Al Ahmar, assistant
secretary general of the ruling Socialist Arab Baath Party of
Syria, has reaffirmed his country's commitment to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ahmar said Syria
has always adhered to the peace process on the basis of
international resolutions as well as the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the May elections in Israel which brought to power
Ehud Barak, who pledged to push ahead the stalled peace process,
Ahmar said that recent changes in Israel have opened the door for
the prospects of new, positive grounds for the achievement of
peace.
</P>
<P>
Peace could be achieved if the new Israeli leaders turn the
positive indications into reality by seriously adhering to all
signed agreements and resuming negotiations from the point it had
reached before being stalled in early 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmar stressed that the return of the Israel-occupied Golan
Heights to Syria, and the Israel-occupied south Lebanon to
Lebanon, were not subjects of discussion or compromise.
</P>
<P>
The rights of the Palestinian people must be effected,
particularly their right to establish an independent state, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Only a just and comprehensive peace will bring about security,
stability and prosperity for all states and peoples in the region,
the Syrian official said.

<HEADLINE> No Agreement Reached Between Cambodia, U.N. on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 28 (Xinhua) -- No agreement was reached
between the Cambodian and U.N. legal groups on the establishment
of a tribunal to try former Khmer Rouge leaders, according to a
senior Cambodian official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We held deep and frank discussions over many important aspects
on the matter with the U.N. team, but differences still remain on
some main points," Sok An, senior minister in charge of the
Council of Ministers and the leader of a nine-member team of
Cambodia, told reporters after Saturday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. five-member legal team led by assistant to the U.N.
secretary general Ralph Zacklin has held two rounds of talks with
its Cambodian counterpart since it arrived here on August 25.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have presented their own draft plans on the
establishment of a tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"Each side has maintained its position about the nature,
structure and composition of the tribunal," Sok An said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Cambodia's draft, the trial must be carried out at
three levels of the existing Cambodian court in which five judges
will perform at the municipal court, seven at the appeals court
and nine judges at the supreme court. And the draft permits a
minority of foreign judges at each level.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. draft has only one level of court and demands the
majority of foreign judges at the court.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia also proposed that one person can not be tried twice
for the same case, but it was rejected by the U.N. team, added Sok
An.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to have further discussions based on their
first drafts and then to put forward their second ones.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After an avalanche of revelations by Western countries on
the corruption of Russian top leaders, the pro-government press in
Moscow has raised the possibility of a Western conspiracy to
defame the Russian leaders and businessmen. The political class

Lakhman, Konarh and Nangharhar in the east which have become the
battle field.

Germany with a resounding success.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Profile: Revival of Beijing Opera: An Actress's Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th birthday of the People's
Republic of China (PRC). Xinhua News Agency is releasing a series
of stories about 50 Chinese men and women, old and young, to
present a picture of the changes that have taken place in China
over the past 50 years. These people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the seventh article.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The famous Beijing Opera Actress,
Liu Changyu, 57, believes that she is able to see the full-scale
revival of the opera in her life.
</P>
<P>
The 200-year-old traditional performing arts has been losing its
popularity over the past decades, particularly among the
youngsters, as a result of competition from modern entertainment
such as movies, disco dances and pop music performances.
</P>
<P>
This is not good news for Liu, who started to learn Beijing
Opera at the age of nine and demonstrated her first public
performance at 16.
</P>
<P>
However, some new changes have taken place to dilute Liu's
worry.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, the government inaugurated a training class aimed at
training and cultivating outstanding young performers. And I have
been invited to be a teacher," she said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the event can be regarded as a light of hope, and it
has reminded her of the past days she was trained to be a master.
</P>
<P>
"In 1951, two years after the founding of new China, I was sent
to an opera academy to study Beijing Opera. Though the war-torn
country had so many important things to do, the top leadership
still paid attention to Beijing Opera. That's wonderful and beyond
a lot of people's expectations," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
Liu's Beijing Opera performing career thus began. She soon
became obsessed with the mysterious and dazzling theatrical
performance which blends Kung Fu, recitation, singing and dancing
together, while her country fellows were plunged into the flames
of war on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The government selected and trusted the most renowned Beijing
Opera masters to pass on their expertise to us, and the scene is
very similar to what we are witnessing today," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the teaching of Beijing Opera was through a
clandestine way. In many cases, only opera masters' family members
had the opportunity to learn and acquire the superb skills.
</P>
<P>
Liu became famous in the 1960s for acting the part of the young
heroine Li Tiemei in the "Story of Red Lantern", which tells of
the story of a revolutionary family during the War of Resistance
to Japanese aggression. This kind of theatrical works is then
called "Revolutionary Model Beijing Opera", which set to reform
the old tradition.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that a lot of reforms are being done in the late
1990s for survival of the opera. People have produced Beijing
Opera discs, used TV to facilitate spreading its charm, and
repeatedly held Beijing Opera festivals, she said. All these
undertakings are done with the assistance of enormous government
funding.
</P>
<P>
The government also spent 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars) building a Beijing Opera Theater, the Chang'an Opera
Theater, along one of the busiest thoroughfares in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Our country will not let the art wither away, as it is a
national treasure and a fortune for the entire human race," she
said, citing the days when she went to West Europe where she found
many foreigners lining up for signatures of the Chinese actors and
actresses.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Telkom Kenya Limited has decided
to reduce the charges for mobile phone services, which will take
effect from next month.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard Saturday quoted the Telkom Kenya
Limited as saying the reduction will affect entry points for both

reviewing its rates in order to regulate and maintain charges for
the various services it renders competitively.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment was in keeping with its motto of offering
quality services to customers and the public at affordable cost,
the company said.

<HEADLINE> Official Sees Higher Growth in Philippines This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines can reach this
year's growth target of 3-3.7 percent for gross national product
(GNP) and 2.6-3.2 percent for gross domestic product (GDP)
following a robust performance in the second quarter, a senior
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The economy to further accelerate in the second semester for a
full-year performance that is likely to reach the high end of our
growth target of 3-3.7 percent for GNP and 2.6-3.2 percent for
GDP," said Felipe Medalla, director general of the National
Economic and Development Authority, in a radio program here.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP grew by 3.6 percent in the second quarter
from 1.2 percent in the first quarter, while its GNP increased by
3.8 percent from 2.1 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in almost one and a half years, production
grew faster than the population (which is growing at an annual
rate of 2.3 percent)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said that the government expects the economic upswing
to continue and even accelerate in the second half of the year
following the robust performance powered by the agricultural
sector during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
But economists here said that the agriculture-led growth is
unlikely to sustain because the industrial sector is still
contracting now.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Firm Begins Demining in North Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An experts team from the
Zimbabwe mine defusing company Mine Tech has located and destroyed
10 land mines in northern Sri Lanka under a United
Nations-initiated demining project, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member team with four German shepherd sniffer dogs
arrived in the northern peninsula of Jaffna early last month to
launch the two-and-a-half-year land mine clearing project assisted
by the U.N. Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The demining contract worth 5 million U.S. dollars was awarded
to the Harare-based Mine Tech which has carried out similar work
in Somalia, Mozambique and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The team had begun work around the Jaffna Medical Faculty since
it is a high-use public space, UNDP's information officer Lisa
Hiller said, adding that the team will move to the Jaffna Council
Park as the next step and mark the minefield there.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the people of Jaffna are taught the dangers
of land mines and how to protect themselves by keeping away from
mine-infested areas under a mine awareness program, said Hiller.
</P>
<P>
The demining project, partly funded by the Netherlands and
Australia, is to clear vast areas of only lightly mined land in
order to resettle thousands of displaced civilians, officials here
said.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people suffer injuries from land mines each month
in the Jaffna peninsula which security forces captured from rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna, the former stronghold of Tamil rebels, has been viewed
as the most-densely mined area in South Asia. According to the
UNDP, about 10 to 12 percent of the Jaffna peninsula is suspected
to be mined although only about 2 percent is believed to be
heavily mined.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has received assurances from both the government and
the LTTE that once an area is certified as being free of land
mines, they would not plant any in that space.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a separatist war against the
Sri Lankan government for a Tamil homeland in the north and east
of the island nation since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has refused to sign the Ottawa Treaty banning land
mines, citing its security concerns imposed by the LTTE rebels who
also use the weapon.

<HEADLINE> Likely Last Mir Crew Back to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The escape capsule carrying the
Russian-French crew of Mir, likely the last for the Russian space
station, landed successfully in Kazakhstan early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The capsule landed 70 kilometers northeast of the Kazakh town
of Arkalyk at 04:34 Moscow time (00:34 GMT), the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has gone off as planned," Tass quoted Valery
Lyndin, head of the mission control's press center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A rescue helicopter was awaiting the capsule by the touchdown
site, and a mobile hospital was unfolded for a quick physical
check-up for Russian cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei
Avdeyev, and Frenchman Jean-Pierre Haignere.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev, a 50-year-old air force colonel, spent his 544th
day in orbit on Friday while Avdeyev is the man who has spent the
longest time in orbit -- 748 days.
</P>
<P>
The crew's mission, the 27th in the station's 13 and a half
years in space, will be the last if no money is found to keep it
afloat. The Russian government has stopped funding the project for
financial pinch and efforts to secure non-budgetary funding have
so far been futile.
</P>
<P>
Six to eight days later, Mission Control in Korolyov near
Moscow will issue the final commands to shut off the main computer
on Mir and the gyrodines maintaining the station's pitch and
attitude will then stop turning. The 120-ton station will begin to
drift, performing no practical functions.
</P>
<P>
Only its temperature systems, power, solar panel orientation
and telemetry equipment will continue to operate. The cosmonauts
have deactivated all other service systems.
</P>
<P>
However, these systems can be reactivated by commands from
Mission Control if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that Mir can continue to function for
several more years. If no financing for Mir's further operation is
found, a final crew will visit the station and prepare it to fall
back to Earth over a safe area of the Pacific Ocean in February-
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mir was lifted into space on February 20, 1986. Twenty-four
international scientific programs and 17,000 scientific and
technological experiments have been conducted aboard the station.
</P>
<P>
It provided researchers from 15 countries a unique chance to
study space and conduct experiments in zero gravity. The station
carries 11.5 tons of scientific equipment from 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
Mir has also hosted 102 astronauts from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Small County Sees Great Changes Since Getting Rid of Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Deng Meichan, a 67-year-old
woman in a village in Yujiang County in east China's Jiangxi
Province said she is very happy to see her daughter's beer
wholesaling business booming, bringing her a large fortune and a
three-story building in the town.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to lead such a happy life in my late years
because snail fever almost took my life when I was young and life
at that time was miserable," she said.
</P>
<P>
More than forty years ago, Deng contracted snail fever and
could not conceive a child after eight years of marriage life. She
thought she would die, as from childhood she had seen many of her
villagers died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
But she was cured in 1957 by doctors sent to her village by the
central government. The provincial government also attached great
importance to the treatment and prevention of this disease and
launched a massive campaign to eliminate fresh water snails, the
intermediate host of the blood fluke which causes the disease,
with the aim of wiping it out.
</P>
<P>
To her villagers' great surprise, Deng gave birth to her first
child after she was fully recovered the next year. She later had
four other children.
</P>
<P>
Yujiang was hit hard by snail fever before new China was
founded in 1949, and hundreds of its people died there from it
every year at that time.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 2,900 people died in the county during the
30 years before 1949, and tens of thousands lived in abject
poverty because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
After new China was founded, the central Government sent many
doctors to the area to help cure patients and prevent the disease
from spreading.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, Yujiang County eliminated the disease
totally in no more than three years from 1955 to 1958.
</P>
<P>
Delighted to learn the news, Chairman Mao Zedong, who had long
been worried about the epidemic, wrote his famous poem " Seeing
Off the God of Plague."
</P>
<P>
Since 1958, the county has continued its prevention efforts
against the epidemic and worked diligently to avoid any
reoccurrence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the county government issued an order to search for
remaining fresh water snails and offered a reward of 30 yuan for
each snail, but not a single one was found.
</P>
<P>
After getting rid of this plague, especially after the country
introduced the reform and opening policies in the late 1970s,
people in the county went all-out for a better life and now many,
like Deng, are happy with their lives.
</P>
<P>
Deng's daughter Jin Hualan is a very successful person about
town in Yujiang with her beer and real estate enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another notable is Zhang Guoxi, who went from carpenter to "
King of Woodcuts" after he established a woodcut factory which is
producing big profits and paying big taxes in the county.
</P>
<P>
To mark his special contributions, a planet-naming committee of
the Association of International Astronomers named a planet "Zhang
Guoxi Planet" after him.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Zhang's success, more than 20 woodcut factories
have been set up in the county and other private enterprises are
emerging to the benefit of local residents and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Free from the plague of snail fever, the people of Yujiang are
now working hard to build their hometown into a rich, modern one.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia suffered a confidence damper ahead of next week's US

Magnus Norman at the ATP Hamlet Cup here on Friday.
</P>

Two-time Cup winner Kafelnikov seemed to be cruising through

Norman will next face Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, who scored

quarter-final match due to a viral infection.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Bank Put Under Police Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The head office of the United
Commercial Bank Limited (UCBL), whose chairman was forced to
resign on Thursday, has been sealed by police and put under police
custody, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken as directed by Home Minister Mohammad
Nasim following violence in the bank's board of directors' meeting
on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mohiuddin Jahur Amin, an executive director of the central
bank, the Bangladesh Bank, was appointed on Friday by the bank as
the temporary administrator of the UCBL and directors of the UCBL
have been asked not to interfere in the operation of the
management.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also served a show-cause notice upon the
UCBL's board of directors as to why the board of directors will
not be dissolved and the reply has to be submitted by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank took the measures as it felt the activities
of the board of directors of the UCBL were harmful to and against
the interests of the depositors, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu, commerce secretary of the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) and a former member of parliament,
on Thursday afternoon allegedly forced Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury,
chairman of the UCBL, and other directors of a bank to resign and
declared himself as the new chairman of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury, one of the accused in a murder case,
occupied the head office of the UCBL after ousting members of the
board of directors at gun point, directors and senior officials of
the bank were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ousted chairman and directors met the home minister, the
finance minister, the governor of the Bangladesh Bank and Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The law would take its own course in connection with the
incident of the bank, the prime minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three separate cases have been filed against five
persons, including Akhtaruzzaman and his son Saiduzzaman Zaved, in
connection with Thursday's incident at the bank.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Bangladesh Observer said Akhtaruzzaman might
face expulsion from the BAL for his activities.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL, a private bank, has 79 branches throughout the
country with a deposit of 11 billion taka (about 220 million U.S.
dollars) and more than 2,500 employees and officials, according to
Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury.

<HEADLINE> New Farming Techniques Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- If the number of Beijing's
farmers decreases by three percent per year, the city's
agriculture may brim with more vigor and enjoy brighter prospects
towards modernization.
</P>
<P>
The point was set forth in a report prepared by the Beijing
Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference and eight
other organizations on the development of the Chinese capital's
agriculture, which was released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a series of investigations, research and discussion, the
nine organizations said in the report they believed the labor
structure of Beijing's agriculture needs big adjustment.
</P>
<P>
"Because many farmers are still stuck to planting, it is a
major problem affecting the increase of agricultural productivity
and farmers' income, as well as modernization of Beijing's
agriculture as a whole," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon also contributes heavily to the slow increase of
Beijing's farmers' income, which in turn result in a widening
disparity between their income level and that of the urbanities.
</P>
<P>
Of Beijing's countryside labor force, 40 percent were engaged
in agriculture, and 80 percent of the 40 percent were planting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the land area in Beijing's suburbs has decreased
sharply, leaving only an average of 0.2 hectare of land to each
laborer.
</P>
<P>
The report boldly suggests channeling the rural labor force to
other parts of China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests that developing livestock husbandry,
especially raising the profitable cows, and the related processing
businesses would be of great help to the farmers.

<HEADLINE> Seven U.S. Western States Continue Battles Against Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 27 (Xinhua) -- California and other six
states in the U.S. West on Friday continued to fight wildfires,
with more than two dozen major fires still roaring through dry
forests.
</P>
<P>
"While many of the fires have been fully or partially contained,
they continue to threaten homes and other structures in several
areas," said Gray Davis, California Governor, who on Thursday
ordered California National Guard troops to help 11,000
firefighters to contain the wild blazes.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that western fires have so far burned a
total of about 150,000 acres in California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Utah, Texas, Washington, with many fires sparked by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
Reports from local officials say there are 22 fires still
burning in the first seven states, and in some areas situations
have been out of control since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Northern California has been the worst hit. Governor Gray Davis
declared fire emergency in four counties in the area and directed
National Guard to mobilize Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 cargo
planes to transport firefighting crews and equipment.
</P>
<P>
A major fire covering some 22,000 acres in Butte County north
of Sacramento, capital of California, continued to burn Friday,
and firefighters warned some 40,000 people in the towns of
Paradise and Magalia to be on stand-by for possible evacuation,
California Department of Forestry spokeswoman Jolene DeGroot said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that with upward of 10,000 people fighting the
fires and reinforcements being brought in from other states, it
was hoped most of the fires could be contained within the next
several days.

COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
provided a grant of 443 million rupees (6.3 million U.S. dollars)
for the development of agriculture in Sri Lanka, the official
Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The grant is provided under the Japanese Government Food
Production Program which is extended annually to support programs

This year's grant will be used to purchase products such as
fertilizer, agricultural machinery and equipment and transport
vehicles which will help increase the productivity of staple food
crops.

<HEADLINE> Levies on Individuals, Enterprises Must Be Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's central government is
again requiring local government departments to reduce their
levies on individuals and enterprises, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance issued a circular earlier this week
telling local governments to stop illegal charges and lower
charging standards for some legal ones.
</P>
<P>
Similar decrees have been emerging now and then in recent years
to stem rampant levies, which serve as an "off-budget" source for
local government's revenues but are also deemed to be harmful for
financial order.
</P>
<P>
This time the prime aim is to assist the country's efforts in
encouraging investment and consumption. Various levies have added
to the cost of investing and consuming activities and dampened
public enthusiasm for both, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry singled out levies charged on farmers, enterprises
and trading houses as those that need to be reduced. Charges on
car buyers, real estate developers and buyers should also be
alleviated.
</P>
<P>
All the related sectors bear the hope for a more active
economic growth, observers say.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would soon publish a list of annual levies and
those with lower charging standards, it said. The ministry had
released similar lists in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Paper Criticizes Britain Over Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan newspaper Saturday
accused Britain of practicing double standards on fighting
international terrorism by enacting laws against terrorism while
tolerating terrorist activities on their soil.
</P>
<P>
The paper, The Island, in an editorial quoted Sri Lankan
Ambassador to the United States Rasaputram as saying the fight
against terrorism will not gain ground unless countries like
Britain stop allowing terrorist groups like the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from operating within their shores.
</P>
<P>
Rasaputram told a seminar on terrorism in Asia at the Potomac
Institute for Policy Studies in Washington that the LTTE operates
a base in London to fund the group's activities.
</P>
<P>
"Britain, despite legislation adopted exactly a year ago which
provides for authorities to crack down on terrorists who have
committed offenses outside Britain, are permitting the LTTE to
operate freely," said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 16-year-old war against the Sri
Lankan government for a separate Tamil homeland in the country's
north and east, have been blamed for lots of terrorist bombings
and assassinations in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, the British government enacted
legislation where it was made an offense to conspire while in
Britain to commit terrorist and other offenses abroad following
the Omagh bombing in northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But since then the law appears to have remained a dead letter
in the statute book, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Britain issued entry visas to LTTE's
spokesman and theoretician Anton Balasingham.
</P>
<P>
"British Prime Minister Tony Blair must realize that his
rhetoric against terrorism rings hollow when the godfather and
theoretician of Sri Lanka's terrorist movement Anton Balasingham
is permitted to walk freely in the streets of London," the paper
said.

<P>
China beat an Australian team twice in tuneup mathces this
month after one-and-a-half-month rigid training at the Kalun Lake
recreation center in Changchun, Jilin Province. Both wins were
wrapped up in a convincing manner.
</P>
<P>
"The ticket to Sydney is the only thing we are concerned about,
" Jiang vowed.
</P>
<P>
Pivot Wang Zhizhi, who was selected by the NBA Dallas Maver
icks with the 36th pick in June, is leading the star-studed squad,
consisting of Li Xiaoyong, Batere, Yao Ming, Hu Weidong, which won
the Asian Games in Bangkon last December.
</P>
<P>
"The title is the only thing in my mind now," Wang said after
his club, Bayi Rockets, turned down the Mavericks offer, keeping
the youngth star in the Chinese basketball association.
</P>
<P>
But China's dream trip to Sydney and hope of regaining the
title could meet tremendous challenge from the defending champions
South Korea and the hosts Japan.
</P>
<P>
China was upset by South Korea 86-72 in the last version of the
tournament and surrendered the berth of the World Championships as
consequence.
</P>
<P>
But the powerhouse China, who dominated Asia basketball for
dozens of years, took revenge in the Asian Games when it beat up
South Korea 112-92 in the final.
</P>
<P>
In that action game, the Koreans had nothing to answer to the
all-round Chinese, who proved their strength in all fields on the
court.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is bracketed in Group A with Lebanon, Phillippines
and the United Arabia Emitates, while China is grouped with
Malaysia and Syria in Group C in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
The two teams could make a faceoff in the second round if both
top their groups in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
With the arch-rivals pulling off their sleeves before the
finals of the tournament, Japan could have been waiting in the
other part of the draw for the losers of the two if everything has
gone well to the hosts before the semi-finals round.
</P>
<P>
Japan, whom China has not played against since the 1995 version,
is tagging as a mistery giant because it did not show up at the
Asian Games in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
With the women's counterpart having lost its chance to the
Sydney Olympic Games, Japan men's team has nothing to appease the
fury prevailing the domestic fans but the title.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea and Japan have the same determinations as us to
win the tournament," Jiang added. "We're expecting to meet great
difficulties to fulfil our goal."
</P>
<P>
China is to set off its campaign on a meeting with Malaysia on
Saturday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUKUOKA, Japan, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese brilliant
talented youngth Wang Zhizhi is ready and confident to head China
to the victory at the Asian Men's Basketball Championships and
Asia's only ticket to the Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I give my credit to every famed center to be at the tournament,
" said the 2.13-meter-high center. "I'm ready to go out and
compete with them."
</P>
<P>
Wang, 22, who was selected by the NBA's Dallas Mavericks this
summer, is ready to excite the Asian fans as the best and most
promised center of the continent.
</P>
<P>
His military club, Bayi Rockets of the Chinese Basketball
Association, refused to release the pivot, leaving the Asian
championships arenas the perfect place to employ his determination
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to a magneficent international competition
in Japan, where I'll exacute my skills and power which I learned
from the domestic league," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of ten people had though Wang would have won CBA's
Most Valuable Player at the end of the 1998-99 season, but forward
Sun Jun from Jinlin Northeast Tigers, also member of the national
squad, stole the limelight to take the title.
</P>
<P>
The setback of individual glory, however, did little to the
dwindling of his popularity and powessness, as Wang is going to
stamp his dominance in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I realize there is big pressure on my shoulder. We must win
the tournament and bring back the ticket to Sydney."
</P>
<P>
China's women's national team failed to claim a berth in the
Games after it finished an embarrassed third place in the Asian
Championships. The men's counterpart and Wang are carrying the
country's Olympic hope.
</P>
<P>
"The trophy and the berth to Sydney are the only things in my
mind now," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
With Wang ready and in good shape, China is boosting a great
tournament in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Toll in Southern Nepal Hits 62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The encephalitis toll in the
Kailali district in southern Nepal has reached 46 and has left at
least 350 infected in the past one month, The Kathmandu Post
quoted local health officials as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the nearby Dang and Bardia districts, 16 people
have died of encephalitis in the month and dozens are still in
critical condition, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kailali District Health Office, the lack of
doctors and medical staff has made the situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the lack of awareness among the public and
illiteracy are the main reason for the spread of the disease in
the rural areas and the continuous rainfall has washed away the
medicine sprayed by health officials to prevent the disease from
spreading further.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people died of various diseases every year in
Nepal because of poor sanitary conditions and people's lack of
sanitary knowledge.

<HEADLINE> A Chronology of East Timor Issue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- ... if and when the Timorese
people reject the autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately indeed, a breakthrough was achieved when Indonesia
and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N. secretary general
signed an agreement on the autonomy package on May 5, 1999, which
hopefully will solve the East Timor question once and for all
through the holding of a popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
As a neutral and independent third party, the United Nations
would conduct this consultation aimed at ascertaining the views of
the East Timorese inside and outside the territory on whether they
would accept or reject the autonomy proposal. The government of
Indonesia is responsible for maintaining security with the U.N.
Civilian Police acting as adviser.
</P>
<P>
Following the May 5, 1999 New York agreements, the parties to
the agreements initially agreed to organize the event on August 5,
1999. Due to logistical and security reasons, however, the
balloting had been rescheduled a number of times. Finally, the
U.N. secretary general announced that the poll will take place on
August 30, 1999. And then the United Nations sent its Mission to
East Timor (UNAMET) and the Indonesian government dispatched
approximately 8,000 police personnel to the region.
</P>
<P>
From July 16 to August 6, 451,796 people inside and outside
East Timor had registered for the direct ballot. The figure
exceeds the initial estimate of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, the campaign started and it will end on August
27. But the campaign has been marred by several clashes between
the rival factions, leaving at least five people dead and many
others injured. The mounting tension in some districts has also
forced about 3,000 local people to take refuge in churches.
</P>
<P>
August 28 and 29 will be a two-day cooling period before the
direct ballot.

<HEADLINE> International Credit to Be Closed to Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The international banking
institutions began to close the lines of credit recently opened to
Ecuador, after the country announced that it would seek a
restructuring of its "Brady debt," local bankers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's plan to postpone the payment of interest on its Brady
debt has caused concern among foreign investors, said president of
the Ecuador Private Banks Association (ABPE), Mario Canessa, who
has briefed Ecuadorian Economic Minister Guillermo Lasso on the
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Canessa, the ABPE will request international
support at the September 28 International Monetary Fund (IMF)
meeting in order to reactivate the production system and the banks.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad announced Wednesday that
Ecuador would postpone for 30 days, starting Saturday, the payment
of 96 million U.S. dollars in interest on a Brady debt of some 5.9
billion dollars while restructuring the country's foreign debt,
which totals 16 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bank superintendent Jorge Guzman said that according to
international investment advisors, the market has already absorbed
the news and those of the lines of credit that have already been
in Ecuador will not be closed.
</P>
<P>
The bankers are also worried that Ecuador's decision to
restructure its Brady bonds with the IMF blessing may send
shockwaves through emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, are largely restructured commercial bank loans
often backed by U.S. Treasuries. They came in response to the
Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.

events in East Timor From July 1998 to August 1999:
</P>
<P>
July 23, 1998: Indonesian President B.J. Habibie offered to
grant special status to East Timor, a special province with
wide-ranging autonomy, within the context of and as part of an

status, based on a wide-ranging autonomy" for East Timor. The two

In Saturday's special time trial, the South African touched in
30.83 seconds, slicing 0.12 seconds from her record of 30.95,
which was set in New York last August.
</P>
<P>
The 50 meters is not an Olympic event and is not raced at the
Pan Pacs but the time is approved by world governing body FINA as
a world record. FINA gave Heyns permission for the time trial.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old has now broken eight world records in the space
of six weeks. It was also the 11th world record of the Sydney meet,
which has seen new marks set every day for seven.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1500m heats, world record holder Perkins, who
could only manage a time of 15 minutes 28.43 seconds, was beaten
into third place following American Chris Thompson and his fellow
Australian Craig Stevens and lost the chance to compete in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
The last chance for the veteran swimmer to make Australia's
team for the Sydney Olympics will be next May's Australian
national championships.

<HEADLINE> China Has Achieved High Degree of Success: Thai Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The People's Republic of China
has achieved great success in its economic development since its
founding 50 years ago, Korn Dabbaransi, deputy prime minister of
Thailand said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago, China was a poor and backward country. Under
such circumstances, the Chinese people made the right decision to
establish the People's Republic to keep the country in unity and
develop its economy," said Dabbaransi, who is also the Thai public
health minister and president of the Thai-Chinese Friendship
Association.
</P>
<P>
In Dabbaransi's opinion, any attempt to compare the development
of China with that of any other country would be wrong, since
other countries do not have the unique circumstances that China
has, which include a 5,000-year-old culture, a 1.2 billion
population and a vast territory.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister spoke highly of China's adoption of
the reform and opening-up policy, which has directly led to the
country's economic success over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Dabbaransi said he believes that China will continue to develop
since its economic growth has not reached the ceiling yet.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the new millennium, China will have to prepare an
agenda so as to play a more important role in the world arena in
the next century," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to refute the so-called "China Threat" theory,
saying that he has never considered China as a threat to world
peace or to the interests of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"I never saw and will never see and imagine that Chinese
supremacy in economy poses a threat to anybody," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As a person who has had the chance to meet all three
generations of Chinese leaders, Dabbaransi said he has always
admired the great charisma and superb art of leadership of the
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I found that all Chinese leaders in the past 50 years have
been very careful in running the country, for they have to take
into consideration the interests and future of 1.2 billion people
all the time," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his firm belief that Chinese leaders would bring a
well-prepared China into the next century in a very successful
manner.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Ministry of
Yugoslavia on Friday accused U.S. President Bill Clinton and 13
other NATO leaders of war crimes in the bombing against Yugoslavia,
the official news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Local courts in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Pristina and some other
cities have been ordered to investigate the 14 people, on charges
of "having commanded or executed" NATO air strikes against the "
civilian population" of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics from Yugoslavia, about 2,000
civilians were killed and 6,000 were injured during the 11-week
long air strikes by NATO.
</P>
<P>
General Wesley Clark and Javier Solana, who at the time were
NATO's top military commander in Europe and secretary general
respectively, are among those accused, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Besides Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
are on the list of accused.

Also included are U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, French Foreign Minister

<HEADLINE> Youngest Professor Wants To Develop Career As Birthday Present For China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 34-year-old Yang Zhenkun has
never imagined that he would hold so many academic records without
ever having studied overseas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some software he designed made its debut on the
international market and that same year he became Beijing
University's youngest professor. Then, in 1998, he was recognized
as one of China's best professors.
</P>
<P>
It's only just over 1,000 kilometers from the small town of
Xiantao in central China's Hubei Province where he comes from to
the nation's capital, but when the 1984 national college entrance
exam gave him the change to cover that distance to attend
university, it changed his life.
</P>
<P>
China's higher education system since the founding of new China
in 1949 has gone through periods of development, controls,
structural changes, and system reforms. After the country opened
itself up to the outside world in the late 1970s, it has produced
more than 9.1 million college graduates. Yang Zhenkun was one of
them, and his higher education began at Beijing University in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Now, fifteen years later, Yang is Beijing University's youngest
professor as well as a leader of Founder Group, the computer
company.
</P>
<P>
Yang and his colleagues developed the Raster Image Processor (
RIP), which made Founder a world leader in image and language
processing and their processor an international standard.

He spent 10 years from 1984 until 1993, when he received his
doctorate, at Beijing University, a rarity. And he is the only one
of the 73 professors not to have studied or worked abroad.
</P>
<P>
He notes that the 100,000 yuan is a kind of honor. Whether you
are in China or overseas, if you get the opportunity and working
conditions, you can achieve success, he adds.
</P>
<P>
As a young man, he says, he was fortunate enough to be given
the chance at Beijing University to develop his talent and that's
why he choose to stay here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been pushing for the revitalization
of the country through the use of science and technology and is on
the lookout for young, talented people. Premier Zhu Rongji told a
national conference on technology recently that society should
encourage young talents and provides more opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
Yang is one of the beneficiaries of this and he is now
preparing a long-term research project for software applications
for the next decade. He wants all of his developments to be a
present for 50th founding anniversary of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers in Chile Discover Brown Dwarf Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A team of seven astronomers
from the European Southern Observatory discovered the farthest
star of our galaxy (Milky Way) in the Virgo Constellation, the "El
Mercurio" newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, made with Net Technology Telescopes (NTT) of the
La Silla observatory in the Coquimbo Region in northern Chile,
concerned a Brown Dwarf Star, of which very few are known because
of the weak light they radiate for their low temperature on their
surface.
</P>
<P>
To locate a dwarf star is as difficult as finding a firefly in
the desert, so this discovery is considered as a great
contribution to astronomic science regarding the volume of mass
that may exist in the universe.
</P>
<P>
The new star, provisionally named NTTDF JI205-0744, is situated
some 300 light years away from the Earth and some 240 light years
over the plane of the Milky Way, meaning that it is practically in
the limits of our galaxy.
</P>
<P>
The mass of the discovered object is from 20 to 50 times bigger
than that of the planet Jupiter, and less than two percent the
mass of our Sun.
</P>
<P>
Its temperature is close to 700 degrees Celsius, suggesting
that it might have been formed between 500 million and 1 billion
years ago -- a young star in the universe.
</P>
<P>
A series of long expositions aimed at identifying other
galaxies was made with the NTT of La Silla, 170 kilometers
northeast of the city of La Serena.

<HEADLINE> Factsheet About East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A direct ballot is to be held in
East Timor on August 30 to determine whether that former
Portuguese colony will stay within Indonesia enjoying wide-ranging
autonomy or become independent.
</P>
<P>
The following are some basic facts and figures about East
Timor:
</P>
<P>
Area: About 15,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Location: Situated in the east of Nusa Tenggara Islands of
Southeast Asia, bounded by West Timor of Indonesia to the west,
the Timor Sea to the south and the Banda Sea to the north.
</P>
<P>
Population: 800,000 (estimated), mostly descendants of Malays
and Papuans.
</P>
<P>
Language: There are 12 local languages which can be further
divided into 35 dialects or sub-dialects. But now all East
Timorese are fluent in Bahasa Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
Religious Followers: Roman Catholics (91.4 percent),
Protestants (2.6 percent), Muslims (0.79 percent), Hindus (0.68
percent), Buddhists (0.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
Capital: Dili (population 100,000).
</P>
<P>
Economy: In the past 20 years, economic growth averaged at
about 10 percent. Its per capita income is about 200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Polling time: 06:30 (GMT 22:30 August 29)
</P>
<P>
Ballot stations: 850
</P>
<P>
Registered voters: 451,796
</P>
<P>
Brief history: East Timor was reduced to a Portuguese colony in
the 16th century and had stayed that way for more than 400 years.
In 1975 the Portuguese government proclaimed that a referendum
would be held in East Timor for the right of self-determination of
the East Timorese people and in the same year Portugal withdrew
from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In July 1976, Indonesia declared East Timor as its 27th
province, but the United Nations never recognized the move. Since
then, East Timor autonomy has been a solution to the long-standing
issue between Portugal and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In February 1983, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a
resolution affirming East Timor's right to independence and
self-determination. Negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal
under the U.N. auspices have been intensified since 1998.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, 1999, the Indonesian government announced that
it is ready to release East Timor if the alternative to wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community. On May 5, Indonesia and Portugal signed
pacts on a poll to determine the future of East Timor and the U.N.
Security Council endorsed the pacts for a special autonomy of East
Timor on May 7. On June 11, the U.N. Security Council decided to
set up a U.N. Mission in East Timor to be responsible for a
referendum of the East Timorese people.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators Clash With Police in Venezuela, 35 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- About 35 people were injured in
a confrontation between police and protesters against Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez during a demonstration near the Congress
building here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration added to the latest struggles in Venezuela's
political arena. On Wednesday, the National Constitutional
Assembly, which is dominated by supporters of President Chavez,
banned the opposition-controlled Congress from passing laws and
limited its powers. The ban came barely a week after the assembly
gave itself sweeping new judicial powers.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police used fisticuffs, tear gas, high pressure
water jets as the demonstrators blocked the entrance to the
legislative building, which is also the seat of the National
Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people gathered at the Bolivar Plaza across the
street from the Congress building on Friday. Among them, some were
supporters of President Chavez while others demanded the permanent
existence of the Congress so as to prevent Venezuela from falling
under "a dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
Some of the legislators had to step on people's shoulder to get
over the fence, while the police continued to disperse the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
After hours of tension in the Congress, President Chavez made a
televised address to the nation, calling for people's
understanding for the changes which he said needed by the country.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said a major shake-up of Venezuela's institutions is
essential to root out decades of government corruption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unhappy With Cuba's Membership in Latin American Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy for the Americas, Kenneth Mackay, Friday expressed
his displeasure for the admission of Cuba into the Latin American
Integration Association (Aladi).
</P>
<P>
Mackay told the press after a meeting with Uruguayan President
Julio Maria Sanguinetti that the United States will continue the
embargo against Cuba as long as Fidel Castro is in power.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Cuba's entry into Aladi will not affect
the U.S. relations with other member countries of the organization,
comprising of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has become a formal member of the regional integration
organization and shown its desire to start trade relations with
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Community of Andean
Nations (CAN).
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas lashed vigorously
at the nearly 40-year-old U.S. blockade against his country during
the admission ceremony in Montevedeo on Thursday, saying it had
caused his country billions of dollars in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Mackay arrived in Montevideo on Friday to start his South
American tour, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Mackay's purpose is believed to promote political and trade
cooperation between the United States and South America, as well
as negotiations for the American Free Trade Area.

<HEADLINE> President Chavez Asks Venezuelans to Stay Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
on Friday called on the people "to avoid being provoked" after a
conflict earlier in the day between his sympathizers and his
opponents, during which at least 35 people were injured in front
of the Congress building here.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation, Chavez said that his opponents,
who are trying to create "a storm" in the country, are doomed to
fail after the installation of the National Constitutional
Assembly (ANC), which is preparing a new Magna Charta.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the ANC will put an end to 40 years of
corruption and anarchy in the country, and the Supreme Court of
Justice is not "dead" as said by its slanderers.
</P>
<P>
He said forces which are "politically dead" are to blame for
Friday's disorder.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between Chavez's supporters and opponents occurred
when some legislators tried to force their way into the
Legislative Palace, where the National Constitutional Assembly was
in session. Opposition legislators tried to scale over the fence
around the Legislative Palace, defying restrictions imposed on
them on Wednesday by the National Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Police used water jets and tear gas canisters to control the
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
ANC President Luis Miquilena said that the Constitutional
Assembly would not tolerate disobedience and disrespect for its
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Democracy!"
and "No to dictatorship!" while police tried to disperse them. No
detentions were reported immediately by the police.
</P>
<P>
The ANC is 92-percent controlled by representatives of the
ruling coalition Patriotic Pole, while the Congress is dominated
by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition legislators regarded the ANC measure as a
dissolution of the Congress, even a coup d'etat. The ANC was
elected on July 25 and installed on August 3.

<HEADLINE> A Chronology of East Timor Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The East Timorese people will
cast their vote in the direct autonomy ballot scheduled for August
30. The following is a chronology of the East Timor issue:
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of about 15,000 square kilometers and
a population of 800,000, had been a Portuguese colony for more
than 400 years before 1975.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian troops invaded East Timor on December 7, 1975, after
the departure of the Portuguese and annexed the territory the
following year.
</P>
<P>
Since its incorporation into Indonesia, East Timor has been an
intractable problem and the Portuguese and the international
community including the United Nations have never recognized the
move.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to regain control over the disputed territory,
the government of Portugal brought the matter before the U.N.
General Assembly demanding the withdrawal of the Indonesian forces
from East Timor. The issue was lively debated in this multilateral
forum from 1975 to 1982. However, the deliberations of the issue
were temporarily suspended in 1983 when the U.N. secretary-general
managed to institute a "tripartite dialogue," a forum in which
Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N.
secretary-general engaged in a direct negotiation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
A series of serious negotiations have accordingly been
conducted within the framework of the tripartite dialogue,
attempting to settle once and for all the final status of the
disputed territory. Unfortunately, these exercises have proven to
be futile.
</P>
<P>
It was only after the fall of the former Indonesian President
Soeharto in May 1998 that Indonesia has been able to be more
forthcoming by proposing a wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor as
an end solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1999, Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations
agreed to conduct a direct polling to ascertain the wish of the
majority of the East Timorese on the proposal. Basically, it
offers a window of opportunity for the people of East Timor to
remain as an integral part of Indonesia while giving them the
freedom to administer their internal affairs free from the central
government's interference. The Indonesian government has even
offered another option that would enable East Timor to secede
honorably and peacefully from Indonesia, if and when the majority
of the East Timorese people reject the autonomy package.

insurance market, our profit stands at 10 percent of the total
property insurance industry," said Wang Zimu, director with Huatai
's management board.
</P>
<P>

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chilean
President Eduardo Frei rejected whatever military intervention in
Colombia, reports said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Frei, who started a three-day visit to this coffee producing
country on Thursday night, said that Chile is willing to do
whatever is necessary for the Colombian peace process to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is going through a crucial period in its history,
because of the ongoing process to achieve peace between the
government and the rebel guerrillas -- the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
Frei said that Chile has not been consulted over a possible
military intervention in other Latin American country. "It has
never been Chile's position to intervene in other countries and
the only missions we have taken part in are the peace missions
with the United Nations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greene Takes First World 100-200 Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- After winning the 100 meters
earlier, Maurice Greene of the United States became the first
sprinter to take the 100 and 200 at a major global meet since Carl
Lewis swept both at the 1984 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The world 100 meters record holder led from start to finish to
win the 200 meters gold medal in a season-best time of 19.90
seconds.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to anchor the U.S. team to a 4x100 meters gold
on Sunday and promised to complete another double in Sydney
Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
"To come out here and perform the way I did in the 200 is just
great," Greene said. "Now I can sit back and have fun in the relay
and bring home another gold to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Michael Johnson, the Olympic 200 meters
champion and world record holder, said he would be striving to
repeat his 1996 Atlanta 200-400 double in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Johnson broke the world 400 meters record in Thursday's final
and, if both men remain fit and in form, the two American
sprinters appear to be moving inexorably to a Sydney showdown.
</P>
<P>
A Greene-Johnson clash could be just what the sport needs and,
in all likelihood, it will take place at a major championship.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who won the 100 meters in 9.80 seconds on Sunday, took
charge right out of the blocks, stormed around the bend with a
sizeable lead and pulled further away from the field down the
straight.
</P>
<P>
He crossed the line with a big lead over Brazil's Claudinei Da
Silva, who finished in 20.00. Nigeria's Francis Obikwelu was third
in 20.11.
</P>
<P>
"The 200 gold is more valuable at this time, because I've done
the 100 before," Greene said. "After I saw Inger win I just knew I
had to go out there and do it for the group."
</P>
<P>
Greene's chances had been bolstered when Namibia's Frankie
Fredericks _ the 1993 200-meter champion _ withdrew hours before
the final, citing a left hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
Also missing from the field was defending champion Ato Boldon,
who also trains with Greene at UCLA under renowned sprint coach
John Smith. Boldon skipped the championships with an injury.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on Probe Into 1997 Silkair Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore minister said here
Friday that his government has not ruled out the possibility that
a suicide attempt by the pilot had caused the 1997 SilkAir Flight
MI185 crash but Singapore will not hold an independent inquiry
into the crash.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communication and Information Technology
(MCIT) Yeo Cheow Tong told reporters at the launch of a new cruise
ship that the government has not ruled out the possibility of a
suicide attempt by the pilot, Captain Tsu Way Ming.
</P>
<P>
The government has filed a report with the police here who will
now investigate whether a criminal act was involved in the
accident, which killed 104 people on board, Yeo added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the demand by relatives of victims for Singapore
to conduct an independent investigation into the crash, the
minister said experts worldwide are already working on
investigations and their efforts cannot be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
The government is waiting for a final report from the Aircraft
Accident Investigation Commission of Indonesia (AAIC) whom it has
urged to proceed as fast as possible, Yeo added.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also said, "We have to trust the competence of the
commission" on ground that all the evidence is in Indonesia and
all the aircraft parts are there.
</P>
<P>
Yeo's remarks came two days after he received information from
his Indonesian counterpart that unlawful interference may have
been a factor in the 1997 SilkAir Flight MI185 accident near
Palembang, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Yeo's ministry confirmed in a statement Wednesday that
Indonesian Minister of Communications Giri S Hadihardjono has
written to Yeo, informing him that the team investigating the
SilkAir Flight MI185 has found indications raising suspicions that
unlawful interference may have been a factor in the accident and
that the Indonesian government has referred this suspicion to the
Indonesian Police for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
A latest report from the investigators said someone in the
cockpit altered the setting on horizontal stabilizer and caused
the plane to plunge and Captain Tsu was facing financial
difficulties and faced a series of disciplinary actions in the
months before the crash and had been demoted because of one lapse.
</P>
<P>
In response to press queries, Yeo's ministry ruled out any
problems in Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)'
licensing procedures for pilots, saying CAAS' procedures for
pilots conform fully to international norms stipulated by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and both pilots
had met the licensing requirements.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Plans to Make Coherent Policy to Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission's
president-designate Romano Prodi said Friday in Italy's north city
of Rimini that he plans to make a coherent and continuous policy
towards Islamic countries a hall-mark of his five-year term.
</P>
<P>
In a 10 minutes' TV show with the Friendship Meeting held in
Rimini, he also suggested that only the EU can advance a "unifying
proposal" for all the Arab countries in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
"Will we manage to pursue this task?" he wondered, "the answer
is a question-mark, but we must be aware that this is a total
change in European foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
According to Prodi, good relations with the Islamic world are
fundamental for maintaining peace in the Mediterranean: "Hitherto,
there have been so many relations, but there has not been a true
general policy towards this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Yet it is useless to think that these countries can develop if
they remain divided, if they fail to put together their resources,
energies and competence."
</P>
<P>
"Our task is precisely to make a unifying proposal for all the
Arab countries facing us (across the Mediterranean)," said the
former Italian premier.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Fabrizio Mori of Italy defeated
reigning world champion Stephane Diagana of France to win the men's
400m hurdles at the 7th World Athletics Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mori clocked 47.72 seconds to take the title. However, the result
has been appealed by the French team, who claimed that the Italian had
stepped into an adjoining lane.
</P>
<P>
The Italian had been a lucky one when he successfully appealed
against disqualification for stepping in Diagana's lane in Wednesday's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Diagana was leading the race before the last hurdle but he was
squeezed to the second at 48.12 and Marcel Schelbert of Switzerland
third at 48.13.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a further confusion after the race when American
Joey Woody, who ended up sixth, appeared in third position on the
official scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
"Was I really third?," asked Schelbert. "I can't believe it. I
thought at first I was fourth and I would have been quite satisfied
with that position and the Swiss record."
</P>
<P>
According to the International Amateur Athletics Federation, the
Brazilian team also protested about the photo-finish for third place.
Brazilian Eronilde Nunes de Araujo was relegated to fourth in the same
time as Schelbert.

<HEADLINE> China Wins First Gold, Greene Completes Sprint Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China won its first medals of
the 7th World Championships on Friday when Liu Hongyu and Wang Yan
took a 1-2 finish in the women's 20 km walk.
</P>
<P>
Marching down the home straight -- seemingly content with their
positions -- the Chinese basked in the applause of the 42,000
spectators and crossed the line in 1:30:50 and 1:30:52.
</P>
<P>
Liu, the reigning World Cup champion and bronze medalist in the
1996 Olympic Games, was in the leading pack throughout the race
and seized the initiative at around the 15km point. Defending
champion Annarita Sidoti led the race through 10 km but withdrew
shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy," Liu said. "After 15km I knew that I
would win today. The longer race is more suited to me, much better
than the old 10km walk."
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan, the 1993 World Cup champion, said: "I'm very proud
that we have two Chinese medalists today. For me I prefer the
shorter distance of 10km but with my performance today I can
hardly complain about the 20km."
</P>
<P>
The 38 year-old Australian, Kerry Saxby-Junna, showed that the
technique which has brought her 21 world records over the years is
still intact by winning the bronze.
</P>
<P>
American sprinters ruled the championships again Friday night.
Maurice Greene became the first man in World Championships history
to complete the sprint double after winning the 200m in 19.90.
</P>
<P>
Inger Miller clocked 21.77 -- the fastest in the world this
year --to blow away the opposition in the women's 200m final. What
a shame that Marion Jones had not also been in the race, as Miller
would surely have pushed her to a remarkable performance.
</P>
<P>
After the race, Greene spoke of his delight at making history:
"This is something I have been dreaming about since I was a child.
I was looking forward to this race the whole year. For me, in
races like this the time has no meaning, only the gold. And I am
going to have a lot of fun running the sprint relay now."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Claudinei Da Silva ran with great assurance, edging
ahead of Nigerian Francis Obikwelu to take silver in 20.00 -- a
personal best. Obikwelu was third in 20.11.
</P>
<P>
Miller's winning margin (0.45 seconds) was the history of these
championships and showed how much she has benefited from a winter
training with the likes of Greene and Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
But Jamaica deserved applause, too. They had three athletes in
the
final, with Beverly McDonald winning silver in 22.22 seconds and
Merlene Frazer bronze in 22.26.
</P>
<P>
Miller said in delight: "My goal here was to win gold. I had
hoped to break 22 seconds today. This is a mark for now and will
not be just a one-off. I feel I can keep improving. I used to
train on my own but now, with John Smith coaching me I feel like I
am in a big family. I get so much confidence from them."
</P>
<P>
Fabrizio Mori of Italy ended up being crowned champion in
Seville after clocking 47.72 in a thrilling 400m hurdles final.
Defending champion Stephane Diagana of France was sprinting hard
from the gun, but this time he was unable to hold his form to the
finish line, taking the silver in 48.12. The bronze went to Swiss
Marcel Schelbert in 48.13.
</P>
<P>
"I was not concerned about how the rest of the field started,"
said Mori. "Because I was confident I could catch them. I felt my
legs moving faster and faster down the straight and knew that I
couldpast Diagana and win."
</P>
<P>
As on so many other occasions this season, the women's 5000m
was a duel between Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco and the incredible
Romanian Gabriela Szabo of Romania.
</P>
<P>
As one of only three athletes left in contention for the one
million U.S. dollars IAAF Golden League Jackpot after winning five
consecutive Gold League meetings, Szabo beat her rivals to finish
first in 14 minutes 41.82 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ouaziz had to settle for the silver in 14:43.15 and Ayelech
Worku of Ethiopia won the bronze with 14:44.22.

<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletics Federation has rejected French team's appeal over the
men's 400m hurdles result at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Italian Fabrizio Mori won the event in a year's best of 47.72
seconds Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the French team appealed against the result, saying the
Italian had stepped into an adjoining lane, which costed defending
champion Stephane Diagana's gold medal.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the world athletics governing body IAAF said
that the jury of appeal had turned down the appeal.
</P>
<P>
A protest by the Brazilian team against the third place result,
in which Eronilde Nunes de Araujo was relegated to fourth behind
Swiss Marcel Schelbert, was also rejected.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia's Ruling Party Selects Its Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's major ruling party in
the coalition government Friday announced that Boris Trajkovski,
the current deputy minister of foreign affairs, is its candidate
for the forthcoming presidential elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Trajkovski was selected at a convention of the Internal
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for
Macedonian National Unity (IMRO-DPMNU) when 1,229 of the 1,541
delegates participating in the convention voted for him.
</P>
<P>
The party's other candidate, the current Defense Minister
Nikola Kljusev, received only 156 votes at the convention, the
Macedonian Information Agency (MIA) said.
</P>
<P>
After winning the candidacy, Trajkovski said that his party
will sure win in the presidential elections this year, as it won
the parliamentarian elections last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMRO-DPMNU led by Ljupco Georgievski, Macedonia's current
prime minister, won the parliamentarian elections last November
and formed a coalition government with the Democratic Alternative
Party.
</P>
<P>
The coalition led by the Social Democratic Alliance, which
pushed Macedonia's current president Kiro Gligorov to the throne
in 1994, lost significant seats in the 1998 parliamentarian
elections.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's presidential elections, the second after the
country won the independence, are scheduled for October 31 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, selections of the presidential candidates by other
political parties in Macedonia are still under way. The
registration of candidates is set to close on September 7.

hke -- Mori Wins Women's 400m Hurdles Gold
</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Fabrizio Mori of Italy defeated
reigning world champion Stephane Diagana of France to win the women's
400m hurdles at the 7th World Athletics Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mori clocked 47.72 seconds to take the title. However, the result
has been appealed by the French team, who claimed that the Italian had
stepped into an adjoining lane.
</P>
<P>
The Italian had been an lucky one when she successfully appealed
against disqualification for stepping in Diagana's lane in Wednesday's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Diagana was leading the race before the last hurdle but she was
squeezed to the second at 48.12 and Marcel Schelbert of Switzerland
third at 48.13.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a further confusion after the race when American
Joey Woody, who ended up sixth, appeared in third position on the
official scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
"Was I really third?," asked Schelbert. "I can't believe it. I
thought at first I was fourth and I would have been quite satisfied
with that position and the Swiss record."
</P>
<P>
According to the International Amateur Athletics Federation, the
Brazilian team also protested about the photo-finish for third place.
Brazilian Eronilde Nunes de Araujo was relegated to fourth in the same
time as Schelbert.

<HEADLINE>   Liu Hongyu Wins China's First Gold at Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Liu Hongyu needed only one hour
30 minutes and 50 seconds to finish first in the women's 20km walk
event Friday night, but it took China six years and three World
Championships to take the first gold medal.
</P>
<P>
After Chinese women long-distance runners collected three gold
medals in Stuggart, Germany in 1993, Chinese athletes only claimed
one bronze through women shotputter Huang Zhihong at the fifth
World Championships in Gothenborg and returned home with empty
hands from Athens two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese walker Wang Yan had the silver with two seconds
behind Liu Hongyu. Australian veteran Kerry Saxby-Junna finished
third at 1:31:18.
</P>
<P>
With two kilometers to go, when defending champion Italian Anna
Rita Sidoti dropped out of the race and world number one Natalia
Fedoskina of Russia was disqualified, Liu Hongyu and her teammate
Wang Yan knew the 20km walk gold and silver were in their hands.
</P>
<P>
The two teammates entered the stadium with no rivals chasing
behind and eased home first and second in a emotional finish with
hands up to the sky, celebrating the hard-fought win for China and
Asia as well.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 24, World Cup champion in France last May, clocked the
fastest time with comfort in the grueling race, which was making
its debut at the World Championships, replacing originally 10km
walk.
</P>
<P>
Wang, bronze medalist in the 10km walk at the Atlanta Olympic
Games in 1996, failed to make a charge in the end after she
received warning twice, settling for the silver with a smiling
face.
</P>
<P>
Saxby-Junna, 38, had a strife with Portugese Susana Feitor in
the last kilometer. Technique and experience had a final say at
the moment with Saxby-Junna taking the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy," Liu said. "After 15 kilometers I knew I
would win today. The longer race is more suited to me, much better
than the old 10km walk."
</P>
<P>
Said Wang: "For me I prefer the shorter distance of 10km, but
with my performance today I can hardly complain about 20km."
</P>
<P>
The race took place in the road outside the Olympic stadium in
the Seville's steamy heat with 50 walkers participating.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Olga Kardopoltseva led in the first kilometers but
had to reduce her pace with two warnings. She was finally
disaqualified.
</P>
<P>
After this a compact group was formed but it broke around 15
kilometers, with the two Chinese and Fedoskina taking the lead.
But the Russian was soon disqualified and the Chinese were never
threatened.
</P>
<P>
"The two Chinese are wonderful. They are my real models," said
Saxby-Junna, a prolific world record breaker.
</P>
<P>
"The gold is really encouraging not only for the athletes but
for China's athletics," said Zhang Fuxin, coach of the two
medalists.
