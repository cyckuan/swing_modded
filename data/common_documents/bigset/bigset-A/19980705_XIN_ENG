<HEADLINE> Envoy of Pakistani PM Arrives in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's special envoy Akram Zaki arrived here Saturday on a
mission to brief Nepali leaders about Pakistan's perception of the
current situation in South Asia after the nuclear tests conducted
by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Xinhua at the airport, Zaki said one of the purposes
of his visit is to exchange views and prepare the ground for the
10th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) to be held late this month in Colombo, Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his current tour of Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka and the Maldives, he would hold talks with leaders of the
four countries on how the summit can be helpful in reducing
tension and stabilizing the security situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said he was carrying letters from Prime Minister Sharif to
the leaders of the four countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Canada and the United States last month,
Zaki also explained the new development in South Asia to
legislators of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Although we wanted our region to be a nuclear-free zone, we
were pushed into the situation in self-defense," he said. "But it
is very important that serious negotiations take place to resolve
the issue, specially the Kashmir question."
</P>
<P>
He said his country wants the whole world to mediate in the
dispute of Kashmir, because it has lingered on for too long a
time.
</P>
<P>
"It must be solved and it is only by solving the dispute of
Kashmir that we can have a stable and peaceful South Asia where we
can work for progress, and we are ready and much interested in
developing the SAARC region," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the South Asia region is left behind in the world
and has more poor people than any other area.
</P>
<P>
He said both the United States and Canada have realized that
the Kashmir dispute has been pending for too long and must be
solved.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence in 1947 and two of them were over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out any outside mediation in its dispute with
Pakistan, including that of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zaki is scheduled to leave for Bangladesh on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says Determined to Eliminate Child labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State for Women
Development and Social Welfare Tehmina Daultana said Saturday that
there is a strong political will at the top level of Pakistan to
eliminate child labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We want our children in schools and not in workshops or
industries," she said.
</P>
<P>
The government is making efforts to provide education to every
child so that the new generation could become educated and
responsible citizens of the country, she told a workshop.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the National Commission for Child
Welfare and Development (NCCWD), is designed to develop a draft
plan of action for elimination of child labor and protection of
working children.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has not only supported
broad-based social development strategies but has also taken
initiatives for eliminating child labor.
</P>
<P>
It is the moral responsibility of all citizens of the country
to work together and cooperate with the government to solve the
problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also called for launching a mass awareness campaign about
child labor and said a non-formal basic education program should
be introduced for education of dropped-out children from schools.
</P>
<P>
Tehmina said Pakistan has ratified the Convention of Right of
Child (CRC) in 1990 and is committed to including the provisions
of the convention in the national, social, economic and legal
framework.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Probe into Cooperation in Nuclear Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A four-hour discussion held here on
Saturday between Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov and
a U.S. delegation focused on possibilities of bilateral
cooperation in control over nuclear technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the talks had
concentrated on the tightening by both sides over nuclear
technologies in the context of the recent nuclear tests in India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Adamov invited the American side to take technological steps
toward nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
Head of the U.S. delegation Peter Dominichi, who is satisfied
with the talks, said they also discussed what should be done to
plutonium from dismantled nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries should primarily develop
measures to rule out the repeated use of the plutonium for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Adamov suggested developing an international
project on the natural security of nuclear technologies.
</P>
<P>
This is a very promising project, and agreement and mutual
understanding on it may be reached in time, Dominichi said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the diluting of military plutonium
for power engineering. However, Russia is not ready for that and
therefore other ways of using the plutonium should be developed,
the American official said.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on preparations for the next session of
the Gore-Kiriyenko commission due in Moscow at the end of July,
especially the implementation of a contract for the delivery of
Russian low enriched uranium extracted from dismantled nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said that a contract on such deliveries may be signed by
Russia and the U.S. within this month.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Beat Argentina to Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands beat Argentina 2-1
to advance into the semi-finals of the World Cup finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-final match was full of action and the Netherlands
proved that they were the better side.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team dominated the first half and opened the scoring at
the 12th minute through Patrick Kluivert who chipped home a header
pass from fellow striker Dennis Bergkamp.
</P>
<P>
They continued to enjoy a great advantage after the goal but
only 6 minutes later, the Argentine team beat a Dutch off-side trap
and levelled the score through Claudio Lopez.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch could have take the lead at the 5th minute but Wim
Jonk's shot hit the bar.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine team's counter-attack was quite effective and
playmaker Ariel Ortega also hit the bar at the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands started the second half strongly and for nearly
15 minutes they didn't even give the Argentine team a single chance.
</P>
<P>
But at the 64th minute, the Argentine team finally launched
their first attack of the second half and Batistuta's shot hit the
bar again.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team played more cautiously after the scare but they
suffered another blow at the 76th minute when Arthur Numan was sent
off for his second booking in the match.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine team took advantage that and assumed an upper hand
over their Dutch opponents. But Ortega made a unforgivable mistake
as he hit the Dutch goal-keeper Edwin van der Sar with his head and
was also shown the red card at the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes after Ortega's send-off, the Dutch team dealt
their Argentine rivals a final blow when Bergkamp connected a
30-meter pass and beat the Argentine goal-keeper Carlos Roa to put
his team into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team will face title-holders Brazil in the semi-finals
while hosts France will take on the winners of the match between
Germany and Croatia to be played later on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Zagallo Confused by Refereeing Inconsistency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said on
Saturday that he was confused by the inconsistency of refereeing at
the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the yellow card for Cafu in Friday's quarterfinal,
Zagallo said: "I don't understand it. Players have done far worse
things and not been booked. There was an incident in the Italy-France
game where an Italian elbowed an opponent and did not get a yellow
card."
</P>
<P>
Cafu was booked for allegedly wasting time before a free kick in
Brazil's 3-2 victory over Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the French town Lesigny, he added: "We have seen red
cards for minor things and violent tackles where there has not even
been a yellow."
</P>
<P>
He said: "I don't see any criteria. We never know what will happen,
if there will be a red card or a yellow card because the criteria are
always different."
</P>
<P>
When asked what advice he would give to his players concerning
officiating, he said there was none because the referees were
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
"The criteria depends on the referee on the day of the game. If
there's no criteria, anything can happen."

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Discusses Military Intervention in G. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and defense ministers from
west African countries are at a meeting in Abidjan, capital of
Cote d'Ivoire, to discuss whether to intervene militarily in the
current conflict in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which stated Friday, is called at the request of
Guinea Bissau's President Joau Bernardo Vieira for assistance
from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in
the battle to overcome a month-long rebellion by some of the
country's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It may mean to generate a consensus for sub-regional action in
favor of President Vieira, analysts said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation in that country resulted from a
rebellion led by former Army Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane,
shortly after he was sacked by President Vieira for neglect of
duty on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The country's neighbors, Guinea and Senegal have sent some
2,000 troops to help the Vieira government's efforts to end the
revolt that has killed an unknown number of people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, once the principle
of military intervention is passed, ECOWAS would order its
monitoring group, widely known as ECOMOG, to launch air attack
against the rebel soldiers to expel them from the positions they
hold currently.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss a plan which asks for the
establishment of a mediation council to solve the crisis in
peaceful means, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told the meeting "it's
time we stop all military coups and attempt to make military
coups in the sub-region."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently chairs ECOWAS. Its troops led ECOMOG in
successfully reversing a coup in Sierra Leone last February and
restoring the country's elected government.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate also stressed the
need not to recognize any government empowered through military
coup.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate made consultative visits to Senegal, Gambia and Guinea
later last month to seek solution to the crisis in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
These visits are seen as preparatory steps for the current
meeting. It is not yet known when the meeting will close.

<HEADLINE> Annan Defends Deal About Nigeria's Abiola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has defended a deal to obtain Nigerian politician
Moshood Abiola's release from detention in Nigeria, saying the
situation in the country had changed since the 1993 presidential
polls which was apparently won by Abiola.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Saturday, Annan made the
remarks Friday night before leaving Accra, capital of Ghana, for
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said he had spoken to many Nigerians during his
visit to Nigeria and they "did not see Moshood Abiola as a
president-in-waiting".
</P>
<P>
Many things had changed since the June 12, 1993 elections, and
thus the situation should be viewed in the light of the
expectations of both Nigerians at large and the international
community, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived his home town Thursday after a four-day
visit to Nigeria, said Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, had agreed to release "all political prisoners" at an
unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, after meeting with Annan, had accepted that he would
not claim the right of the presidency, for which he was arrested
by the military government four years ago.
</P>
<P>
But some of his relatives and the country's opposition leaders
expressed disbelief of Abiola's undertaking to renounce his claim
on the presidency in return for freedom.
</P>
<P>
Proper solution of Abiola's case is widely seen as the core to
resolve the current political crisis in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been pressing the release of Abiola so that
he could organize a government of national unity, but the
military government seems not to agree.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France to Continue Joint Mideast Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior French official said here
Saturday that France and Egypt have agreed to continue
consultations on a joint initiative calling for an international
conference to salvage the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Jean
Claude Consserean, director of the French Foreign Ministry North
Africa and Middle East Department, said their talks were part of
the consultations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would follow up the initiative and monitor the
situation in the Middle East, said Consserean, who arrived here in
the day for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to France last May, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac launched the
initiative on calling for an international conference to discuss
the long deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Consserean will hold further talks with Egyptian officials on
Sunday to coordinate the stands of the two countries before a
visit to Washington by Moussa in August.
</P>
<P>
He will leave here late Sunday for Israel for talks with
Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
1997 due to Israeli construction of a settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem and the differences over Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Frees 2 Journalists in Libel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Two journalists from the Egyptian
opposition newspaper Al Shaab were released from prison Saturday
after a court overruled an earlier verdict convicting them of
libel.
</P>
<P>
Magdy Ahmed Hussein, editor-in-chief of the Arabic-language
paper, and Mohamed Helal, an editor, were set free two days after
the Court of Cassation, Egypt's supreme court, overturned a
jailing sentence against them, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency did not tell the reason why the earlier
verdict was overruled.
</P>
<P>
Hussein and Helal were sentenced to one year in prison with
hard labor for their articles accusing former Interior Minister
Hassan el-Alfi and his sons of using his position to amass wealth.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists have served four months in jail.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the supreme court said the ruling ordered the
former minister to pay the expenses of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court ordered a retrial of another case in which
Al Shaab accused Alaa el-Alfi, son of the ex-minister, of abusing
power to procure land and houses in the Mediterranean city of
Alexandria, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The former minister was sacked last November after 58 foreign
tourists and four Egyptians were gunned down by terrorists in the
southern tourist city of Luxor. The killing was widely blamed on
lax security.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Junta Leaders to Be Tried in One Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the military junta that
ruled Sierra Leone until last February will face a court martial
in a week, a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Paul Koroma, the junta's number one leader, is still on
the run, but as many as 70 others, including Koroma's brother and
the junta's chief of defense staff, Brig. Samuel Koroma, could
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
"The long-awaited court martial against the top brass and
junior ranks for the military junta will begin in a week's time,"
a spokesman for restored President Ahemd Tejan Kabbah said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to prison sources, about 100 soldiers alleged to be
closely involved with the junta are currently in jail.
</P>
<P>
Also facing trial would be Hassan Konteh, who was Kabbah's
chief of defense staff before the May 25, 1997 military coup,
Brig. Kiss Kamara, the junta's health minister, and Corporal
Tamba Gborie, who announced the coup on the national radio.
</P>
<P>
The junta was driven out of the capital Freetown in
mid-February by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, which
has since been carrying out operations to mop up the remnants of
the junta and allied rebels in the east and north of the tiny
west African country.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Hit Price Of Homes In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The rise in interest rates is now
affecting the housing market in Britain, according to a new report
released here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Home owners have been put off moving house and first-time
buyers are reluctant to commit themselves to a mortgage, the
report by ICM Housing Monitor said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the earlier growth in house prices has ground to a
halt, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rate rises have meant that people are now thinking
not just once or twice but three times before moving," said Paul
Raymond, managing director of Woolwich Property Services.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Halifax, one of the largest Building
societies in Britain, said "Interest rate rises have affected
buyers' confidence."
</P>
<P>
"People are almost watching and waiting to see what happens to
interest rates, but we are expecting maybe only one more small
rise," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Engloand's monetary policy committee will make a
decision on interest rates next week when it meets to discuss the
economic situation now in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the housing market said that many estate agents
are pessimistic about a recovery in the market.

<HEADLINE> Formula for Resuming Cyprus' Talks Hopeful: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy said here on Saturday
that it is hopeful he will find an "acceptable" formula to help
resume the talks between leaders of Cyprus' two communities when
he returns to the Mediterranean island in September.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying very hard and I can tell you I may succeed. I am
quite hopeful that when I come back we will be able to have a
process again," United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's
Special Advisor for Cyprus Diego Cordovez told reporters before
wrapping up a three-day peace mission.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Cordovez held two separate meetings with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had "positive, substantive and constructive"
discussions with the two community leaders, adding that "I am very
satisfied with the progress we have made."
</P>
<P>
It is important to find out the two sides "are willing to
discuss" the resumption of negotiations and "are interested in
discussing with me the possibilities and alternatives" for
resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem in Cyprus is that there is very little
confidence between the two sides, tremendous distrust and the only
way you can reduce distrust is to get them to talk," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are interested in trying to find a way to resume
the talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots
broke down last summer when Denktash walked out of the
negotiations to protest against European Union's decision to start
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I told them we need a formula that is acceptable to both. It
should be reasonable, practical and fair to both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his mission, Cordovez said his principle task is
to "get a process of negotiations started," a task he will perform
in two phases.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage before September, he will consult his two
interlocutors on the arrangements for the talks to be resumed and
the second stage will start in September after Clerides and
Denktash have thought about the alternatives for the resumption of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez said that he will report to the U.N. Security Council
on Monday his "positive and substantive discussions" with the
leaders of Cyprus' two communities and "the good atmosphere on
both sides."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify Cyprus in a
bizonal and bicommunal federation, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> US President Clinton Back Home, Hoping for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
his family returned home early Saturday morning, hoping more
regular summits between the United States and China would take
place.
</P>
<P>
Stepping off the "Air Force One" at the Andrews military
airport, the Clintons appeared in high spirit with broad smiles on
their faces.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day trip to China was fascinating, the president said,
hoping more regular meetings would be held between the two
countries' leaders.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by an American president in almost ten
years, took Clinton to Xi'an, Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and Hong
Kong. Before he flew back home, President Clinton told
reporters in Hong Kong that his trip was a remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin met in Beijing
for continued exchanges on a wide range of issues from bilateral
ties to nonproliferation to human rights. They announced at a
joint press conference that the two countries would not aim
nuclear missiles at each other.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders issued a joint statement calling for
strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention and early
conclusion of a protocol establishing a practical and effective
compliance mechanism and improving transparency.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to work together to accelerate global
humanitarian demining and ease the tension in South Asia built up
following nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides identified such areas as energy and
environment protection for closer cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Critics at home grudgingly acknowledged that President
Clinton's visit was a success.
</P>
<P>
"As a political matter, there seems to be a consensus among
Republicans that, at least for now, Mr. Clinton has overcome fears
among Democrats that the trip would expose the President to
damaging attacks on issues like human rights, the exporting of
satellite technology to China and campaign finance
irregularities," "The New York times" said Friday.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had called Clinton to postpone
his trip weeks ago, told reporters Wednesday that "I think the
president did a pretty good job talking on Chinese radio and TV."
</P>
<P>
Administration officials believed that it was significant that
Clinton was accorded unprecedented media coverage in China as he
spoke about such issues as human rights.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States hoped that Clinton's visit
would give a new impetus to the improvement of the bilateral
relationship. They try to expand their cooperation while openly
discussing their differences on human rights, Tibet and trade
imbalance issues.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Woman Donates Kidney to Save Husband's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Ghanaian senior military officer
has escaped death by the donation of a kidney by his wife, a
report reaching here said, quoting a local weekly issued
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Klutsey, according to a "heart-warming" front-page
story in the state-owned The Mirror weekly, was told in early
1996 that his life could only be saved by a kidney transplant and
the donor needed to be a close relative for a tissue match.
</P>
<P>
A brother or sister is usually the first option, followed by
son or daughter.
</P>
<P>
Col. Klutsey told "The Mirror" that his brothers and sisters
refused but his two daughters agreed. His wife, however,
objected, saying the girls were too young and for a second time
offered to donate one of her own.
</P>
<P>
A series of tests proved that her kidney was compatible with
her husband's and in September 1996 the operation was carried
out.
</P>
<P>
One year after the transplant, Col. Klutsey looks very
healthy, telling The Mirror weekly "we are now more than one
flesh because it is her organ which is keeping me going." The
couple were married in 1972.

<HEADLINE> TUC Urges Government To Tackle Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Trades Union Congress (TUC)
urges the government to start talks with employers and trade
unions on how to protect its economy from "stagflation".
</P>
<P>
Low growth and investment, rising unemployment and high price
inflation present an increasing danger, the TUC warns in its
latest economic briefing report.
</P>
<P>
The report says: "The economic slowdown and coming rise in
unemployment is in danger of pushing the government's economic and
labor market strategies off course."
</P>
<P>
It complains that while Chancellor Gordon Brown has taken the
lead in starting a national debate with business leaders on the
causes and cures of low productivity, he has done nothing yet
"beyond exhortation to promote the equally important national
debate on how to reconcile growth, employment and low inflation".
</P>
<P>
The TUC says: "predictions of an immediate slump in the demand
for labor are exaggerated", adding that "there is no doubt the
labor market is fast approaching a turning point."
</P>
<P>
The report indicates job prospects for young workers are
holding up well. However, among the over-50 year olds,
unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
"These appear to be among the first labor market casualties of
the economic squeeze applied by tight monetary and fiscal policy,"
the TUC says.
</P>
<P>
It adds the the decline in output has ensured slower
productivity growth and has put a "severe upward pressure on unit
labor costs".

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Foreign Trade Increases via Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Business activities in the
eastern part of Ethiopia has flourished since Ethiopia recently
began to fully carry out import and export trade via Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Tewolde Gebre-Amlak, office manager of the National Bank of
Ethiopia in Dire Dawa, second largest city in Ethiopia which
located at middle of the 781 kilometers Djibouti-Addis Ababa
railway, said that ever since Ethiopia's import-export was
channeled fully via the Djibouti port, the volume of imported
items has shown an increase of about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tewolde said earlier Ethiopia used to effect only 30 percent
of its import-export transaction via the Djibouti port, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the businessmen now have better access to
infrastructures than they used to when effecting their business
via Assab and Massawa ports.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has diverted from Assab port of Eritrea to port of
Djibouti as its outlet since the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrea border
dispute on May 6, this year. About 70 percent of Ethiopia's
import-export used to transit through Assab.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges N. Irish People to Stay Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Saturday urged both sides in Northern Ireland to stay calm and
search for an agreement to ease off potential conflict to be
sparked by Sunday's parade.
</P>
<P>
"I say to both sides: carry on searching for an agreement, for
a negotiated solution, and keep calm and keep law-abiding because
this is bound to be exploited by small pockets of extremists on
both sides who want to wreck the (peace) agreement," Blair
appealed to Northern Irish people in an interview with Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
Blair was speaking on the eve of Sunday's parade by Protestant
Orangemen who insisted to go ahead with the traditional march in
Protadown in defiance of a ban issued by the independent Parade
Committee early this week. But Catholic residents in the city vow
to oppose them.
</P>
<P>
"It's important for people to realize this is a problem this
year with this particular march... but it doesn't mean anything in
respect of the wider picture unless people force it that way," he
added. In the past two years, such parades have sparked off riots
between Protestants and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who paid a visit to Belfast on Thursday to
head off the crisis, said the stand-off had arisen in Portadown
because of an unwillingness by both sides of the divided community
to talk to one another.
</P>
<P>
But he believed an agreement was still possible to settle the
problem peacefully if there was a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"If it was left up to the leaders of those parties involved in
the talks process in Northern Ireland, I have no doubt that we
would have an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Blair also promised to keep doing all he could to head off a
repeat of the trouble that the annual parade has sparked in each
of the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges India to Be Serious towards Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Saturday that it
wants to push forward the process of dialogue with India, and
urged New Delhi to show "seriousness towards critical issues and
address the Kashmir dispute - the root cause of tensions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press briefing, a Pakistani Foreign
Ministry spokesman said: "We very much want the process of
dialogue commenced and we hope that in Colombo when the two prime
ministers (of Pakistan and India) meet the dialogue process will
push forward."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman regretted "the non-serious attitude" on the part
of the Indian side towards the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Let us hope that New Delhi comes up with a better attitude, a
more serious attitude and address the urgent issues including the
peace and security and the root-cause of the tensions."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the third-party mediation over
Kashmir, he said: "In no other dispute has there been a more
categorical rejection of a third party role as on Kashmir by
India."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Pakistan is keeping its options open
with regard to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
and is carrying out a strategic review in this context.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remain conscious of the demand made on our
capability, if we feel that the strategic parity in the region is
threatened we will take appropriate measures to correct the
strategic imbalance," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is following an integrated and a comprehensive
approach on the issue and will keep a watch on various elements,"
he said. "We cannot allow the strategic imbalance in the region
because Pakistan's security is of paramount importance to us."
</P>
<P>
As long as India does not sign the test ban treaty, Pakistan
will keep its options open, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We will take the decision when we consider it in our interest
and at an appropriate time and till then we will continue to
pursue a comprehensive approach," he said.

1,000, local radio stations reported.
</P>

Many displaced residents live in their makeshift tents for

<HEADLINE> Cyber Courtesy Highlighted in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 4 (Xinhua)-- Singapore on Saturday highlighted
courtesy in cyberspace, as it launched its 21th national courtesy
campaign.
</P>
<P>
At the launch of the 1998 National Courtesy Campaign, Finance
Minister Richard Hu said the Singapore Courtesy Council wants to
promote the campaign to the growing generation of cybernauts.
</P>
<P>
"As we progress into the era of the Internet, reinforcing the
courtesy message is going to be even more crucial," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially so when conveniences such as e-mail and
e-commerce are becoming so much a part of our lives", he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Courtesy Council's overall theme this year focuses
on promoting good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
"This is very relevant, especially at a time when we are facing
a slowdown in our economy", he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Singapore Courtesy Council Noel Hon also said
the current campaign pays special attention to the use of pagers
and handphones and etiquette on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"With 2.3 million handphones and pagers in Singapore, this
could become a very serious problem", he said, referring to the
rising complaints about the inappropriate use of handphones and
pagers at concerts, in cinemas, theaters and weddings.
</P>
<P>
"Another new norm of behavior that comes from technology is
etiquette on the Internet", he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Courtesy Campaign was first launched in 1979 and
the focus was on courteous behavior toward each other under its
first slogan of "Courtesy is Our Way of Life."
</P>
<P>
The Courtesy Council has designed 19 interstitials that cover
the years since then, playing an important part in bringing about
harmony in the country's society.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the campaigns over the years, Minister Hu said the
they have changed in terms of length, focus and choice of target
audience, changing from a month-long campaign to a year-long
drive, from a government-led effort to a campaign driven more by
private initiatives, from getting people to be courteous in a
vague sense to urging them to make the first move to practise
small acts of kindness every day.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Egyptian, Palestinian Leaders to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan will leave
here Sunday for Cairo to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss ways to restart the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
They would seek how to press Israel into accepting a United
States proposal that calls for a 13.1 percent second-phase
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank, Jordan's official
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also focus on the recent Israeli government's
decision to annex new parts of the Holy City of Jerusalem, which,
if not reverted, would change the geographic and demographic
situation of the city in benefit of the Jewish inhabitants, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Besides peace issues, the three leaders are to discuss means of
enhancing economic cooperation between their countries,
particularly in the field of trade exchange and investment.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's trip to Cairo will be a "short working visit"
upon an official invitation from Mubarak, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since March 1997 due to the Jewish settlement expansion in the
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In order to defuse the tension and revive peace talks between
the two sides, the U.S. put forward the proposal mentioned above
several months ago. The Palestinians accepted it, but Israel
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have reached
peace accords with Israel, have been active mediators in the Middle
East peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) - A total of 2,584 Tanzanians
have died of cholera from last July 1 to May 31 this year, the
Minister for Health has said.
</P>
<P>
Aaron Chiduo said Friday at the parliament which is in session
for debating the 1998/99 budget in central city of Dodoma that
the deadly disease affected all the 20 regions in the mainland,
media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the 43,231 patients, there are 10,832 in
Mtwara, 6,741 in Dar es Salaam, 5,876 in Lindi, 3,414 in
Morogoro, 2,821 in Mara, 2,149 in Iringa, 1,956 in Kigoma and
1,444 in Coast.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to keep their surroundings clean as one
way to fight cholera.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that another kind of disease, tuberculosis,
also affected the people heavily as its patients have increased
from 43,869 in 1996 to 44,477 last year due to squalid
environment and population pressure.
</P>
<P>
Chiduo requested the parliament to approve 29 billion
Shillings (43.6 million U.S. Dollars) for recurrent expenditure
and 21.5 billion Shillings for development expenditure in the
health sector which takes care of a total population of some 30
million.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Salmonella-resistant Gene in Chickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have identified
the gene that keeps chickens free of salmonella, the bacterium
that can cause human food poisoning, The Times newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, made by researchers at the Institute for Animal
Health at Compton, Berkshire, could lead to the elimination of
salmonella in eggs and the fall in food-poisoning cases.
</P>
<P>
The salmonella-resistant gene, thought to be present in about
10 percent of commercial chickens, increases the bacteria-killing
powers of macrophages, large cells that form part of the chicken's
immune system.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are now working on a way to identify the DNA markers
for the gene, hoping that in a few years it should be possible for
commercial breeders to identify chickens with the gene by a simple
blood test.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the brink of potentially controlling salmonellosis,
which would improve food safety and reduce the loss of valuable
stock." Phil Jones, head of microbiology at the institute, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While properly cooking eggs could kill the salmonella bacteria,
the highest risk comes from food made from raw eggs. Last year
32,000 cases of salmonella poisoning were reported in England and
Wales, 48 of them fatal.

<P>
Local people are assured that the government will translocate
the giant elephants into national parks and a foreign expert will
come to embark on the work soon.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister urged people to cooperate by
offering correct information about the destruction of crops and
loss of lives caused by the elephants.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been some newspaper reports about the
misdoings of elephants which strayed into populated areas or crop
fields, destroying crops and killing the vulnerable. This is the
first time in recent months for the government to use foreign
assistance in flashing out the big animals.

CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Tunis -- The percentage of the Tunisian debts declined from 53
of the GNP in 1991 to 51 in 1996, according to the local economic
daily "El-Sabah" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The daily predicted that the trend would go on until the
percentage reaches 40 in 2001. Tunisia is one of the few countries
in the Arab and African regions which did not resort to
rescheduling its arrears.
</P>
<P>
Tunis -- The internation stock exchange federation and the Arab
money market authority will hold a meeting here between July 8 and
10 under the title "investment in Arab exchanges .. opportunities
and challenges."
</P>
<P>
Represtatives of capital markets in Tunisia, Kuwait, Egypt,
Lebanon, Morocco, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Palestine and Sudan will
take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources of the Tunis Stock Exchange, the
meeting will discuss two themes namely; the external effects on
the Arab stock exchanges and ways of facing up to them, and the
nature of the Arab capital markets and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- An exhibition of Saudi-made products was unveiled here
Saturday to acquaint the Jordanians with such products.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Allied Militiamen Wounded in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Israeli allied
South Lebanese Army (SLA) were wounded in south Lebanon in two
separate incidents Saturday, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The first SLA militiaman was moderately wounded in a roadside
bomb detonated by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
near Kfar Tibnit village on the edge of Israeli occupied south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The second one was wounded when his car which was carrying the
first wounded SLA man, turned over in the eastern sector of the
occupied zone, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The wounded SLA members were then carried away by an Israeli
helicopter to a hospital in Israel, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 to guard its northern areas against
cross-border attack by guerrillas, clashes with Lebanese
guerrillas spearheaded by Hezbollah have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Police Chief Stands Firm over Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Protestant Orangemen would not be
allowed to march through the mainly nationalist area of Portadown
on Sunday, even if they force a stand-off, a police chief said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said he was determined to
enforce a decision to prevent loyalists from passing along the
Garvaghy Road from Drumcree church.
</P>
<P>
"The march will not be forced down" the road, BBC quoted him as
saying in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen were determined to march the route despite a
ruling by an independent parades commission that it should be
diverted away from Garvaghy Road. In the past two years, Orangemen
and police conflicted while the parade was going on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British soldiers threw a ring of concrete, razor
wire and armored cars around the Catholic-dominated area on
Saturday to keep back the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
Irish nationalists who live on Garvaghy Road plan to block it
even though security forces used force to clear them last year,
allowing the Orangemen to proceed.
</P>
<P>
In face of the possible riot on Sunday, Protestant First
Minister David Trimble and his nationalist, Catholic deputy
elected at the inaugural meeting of a new power-sharing assembly
last week issued a joint appeal for calm.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see the two sides in our community embark on
a collision course where there will only be losers," Trimble said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Reiterates to Sell Copper Mines in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba reiterated Saturday that his country will sell its copper
mines in full value.
</P>
<P>
Opening this year's Zambia International Trade Fair in Ndola,
northern Zambia, Chiluba reiterated the need to get full value of
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) in its on-going
privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said successful privatization of ZCCM will contribute to
the government and job creation will depend on increased
activities of the ZCCM, the biggest foreign exchange earner of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged foreign investors not to doubt his government
resolve to create private sector-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
Zambia discontinued the negotiations last April with Kafue
Consortium on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines, which make up
65 percent of the ZCCM assets, over disagreement on the prices of
the two mines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two other foreign mining companies pulled out, citing
falling international copper prices as the main reason for their
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, donors pledged Zambia an aid of 530 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, some donors said recently that they will not release
the pledged aid until ZCCM is privatized because the money ZCCM
is losing equals the amount of the aid the donor community
pledged to give Zambia and that if it is released, it will go to
bailing out the ailing ZCCM.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Cotton Exports Benefitted from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian cotton exports are
expected to fetch good prices this season as a result of the
international economic sanctions imposed against India and
Pakistan for their nuclear testings, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Nyanda, Chairman of the Tanzania Cotton Lint and Seed
Board of Directors (TCL &AMP; SB) said in a statement reaching here
that the cotton growers in the Lake Victoria areas were
encouraged by the sanctions on India and Pakistan which are both
main cotton producers in the world market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world demand for lint this year stands at
89.036 million bales compared with a target of 87.036, meaning
that buyers should give competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that cotton buyers have offered between 160-210
Shillings (0.24-0.35 U.S. Dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda also cautioned both peasants and buyers of cotton, in
his recent tour of Mara, Shinyanga and Mwanza regions, that
Tanzania was in danger of being kicked out of the world market
because of the decline in the quality of its cotton since the
liberalization of the marketing of the crop in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Serious steps will be taken to improve the mis-management of
cotton in the buying centers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Surfing Net from Home Overtakes Use at Work in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- For the first time people using the
Internet from home in Britain outnumber those net surfing at work,
according to a new research.
</P>
<P>
The findings, coming from the latest Internet Monitor, a
quarterly survey of 1,000 Internet users, showed that 4.4 million
people in Britain have used the Internet in the last six months,
of which 40 percent or 2.2 million people logged on from home.
</P>
<P>
Around 36 percent accessed the Internet from work with the
remainder logging on at Internet cafes, clubs and libraries.
</P>
<P>
The results mark a watershed in the evolution of the Internet
as it switches from being a tool for business to being a medium
for domestic consumers.
</P>
<P>
The increase in home use has been matched by a growth in people
using the Internet for home shopping, with one million people
buying something over the Internet in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
The average Internet shopper spends around 40 pounds (66 U.S.
dollars) per month and more than half feel confident about using
their credit card over the Internet, the research has found.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Denounces Bombings in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir Saturday condemned the bombings that took place in
the capital area before the ninth anniversary of the Salvation
Revolution on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Atbara city to the north of the capital,
al-Bashir vowed to punish those responsible for the crimes of the
kind.
</P>
<P>
Nine bombings occurred last week in the area, setting ablaze a
gas station, damaging an electricity facilities and cutting a
power network between the capital and El-Damazin.
</P>
<P>
The bombings that targeted strategic public utilities in the
province resulted from the "failure of the enemies of religion"
and were carried out by hostile elements to harm Sudan and its
"civilizational project," al-Bashir said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president stressed that the enemies are destined
to failure in their plot to destabilize Sudan through various
"aggressive designs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohammed Abdul-Rahim Gah-Ennabi, director of Sudan's
Criminal Evidence Department and Central Investigations, urged the
citizens to keep vigilant against such crimes.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Deputy PM Criticizes Those Against Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry Moses Ali
Saturday criticized those who are inciting the public against the
land bill.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a song sung at the 76th
International Cooperative Day celebrations at the Luwero Sports
Ground in central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Those who are mobilizing young people to incite the public
should stop it immediately because it would be a potential danger
in future, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the land bill, passed by the parliament at the end of
June and consented by President Yoweri Museveni on July 2, is a
law now which must be strictly enacted.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful resolution of the land bill in parliament shows
the country is mature in all aspects, he added.
</P>
<P>
The land bill, passed by the parliament after eight days of
steamy debate, provides security for both tenants and land owners
and is therefore vital to further development of the country's
growing economy.
</P>
<P>
It was originally protested by the Buganda Kingdom which
thought that the central government was to take land away from
the kingdom through the bill.
</P>
<P>
With discussions between President Museveni and
parliamentarians representing the kingdom, the problem was
resolved peacefully.

ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- People are fleeing from Adana,
southern Turkey, after 1,000 people were injured in two
earthquakes Saturday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been rushed to hospitals.
</P>

Following the strong earthquake measuring 6.3 degrees on the
open-ended Richter scale on June 27, the people in Adana started

CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King Hussein will
hold talks here on Sunday on the stalled Mideast peace process,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite summit will focus on the latest developments of
the peace process and the deteriorating conditions in the occupied
Palestinian territories, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will discuss a United States proposal on Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly proposed that Israel hand over another
13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian National
Authority. The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel
has not.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also discuss Israel's recent decision to expand
the authority of Jerusalem, which will cover eight West Bank
settlements to east, north and south of the city, the Egyptian
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Arabs fear that the plan will change Jerusalem's geographical
and demographic status.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders will touch on means of strengthening economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi al Kedra said that Arafat
will hold talks with Mubarak before the tripartite summit on the
recent clashes in the Gaza Strip between the Palestinians and
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
A confrontation erupted Thursday over control of a road in the
Gaza Strip. Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and refused
Palestinian Minister of Communications Emad Falouji and other
officials to enter Gaza through the Eretz check point.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to
block roads leading to Jewish settlements. Israeli troops also
stationed three vehicles on a road linking two major cities in the
Gaza Strip and created a serious traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
"This standoff indicated that the patience of the Palestinian
people is running thin of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu's provocations and attempts to outflank the peace
agreements," Kedra said.

<HEADLINE> Maldini Defends Usage of Del Piero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian coach Cesare Maldini on Saturday
defended his choice of Alessandro Del Piero as starter in their loss
to France.
</P>
<P>
Maldini, who would be heading home with Squadra Azzura late
Saturday, told a news conference in Senlis north of Paris that it was
wrong to criticize the choice.
</P>
<P>
"If people regret the choices I made, like using Alessandro Del
Piero as a starter, that's a shame," Maldini said of Friday's
quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
Maldini said: "Del Piero was well prepared physically. He was also
very motivated but perhaps lacked confidence."
</P>
<P>
The coach thought the Italian defence had performed a great job as
usual but lamented the failure to exalt in the penalty shoot-outs
which France won 4-3.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't thrashed, our goalkeeper had few saves to make... We
had the advantage during the shoot-outs but we did not know how to use
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We've paid a dear price for it, but that's the law of
football."
</P>
<P>
Maldini hoped his son Paolo, who captained the team, would not
leave the squad following the loss.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to come back four years later in the next finals to
be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, if he was still the coach.
</P>
<P>
"Winning the World Cup was dream for us... I may have made
mistakes, but I will keep them to myself."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Saturday issued an official note to South Korean ambassador Li In
Ho to protest unlawful activities of a councillor of the embassy,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) last night detained
councillor of the South Korean embassy Cho Sung U, who was
allegedly in secret meeting with a Russian Foreign Ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Federal Security Service said on
Saturday that his detention became possible due to long and
thorough intelligence work with the assistance of the Foreign
Ministry's Security Directorate.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side believes the activities of the South Korean
diplomat were incompatible with a diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass news agency, it has been established
that the Russian contact systematically provided confidential
information to the South Korean secret services, thus causing
substantial damage to Russia's political and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Cho Sung U was handed over to embassy officials after he had
completed all formalities at FSB, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the FSB instituted criminal proceedings
against the Russian accomplice.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean diplomat was invited to leave Russia within
three days, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An Arab League (AL) official said Sunday that the
number of Arab countries, which have enforced the first phase of
the Greater Arab Free Trade Zone Agreement, had risen to 11.
</P>
<P>
The AL Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Affairs Abdul
Ruhman al-Sahybani said that these countries were putting into
effect the executive program of the pact, which involved a 10
percent cut in tariffs starting from last January.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchange among these states accounts for around 80
percent of inter-Arab trade.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the pact are committed to phasing out customs
duties by the end of the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia plans to attract more foreign tourists,
especially Germans and Britons, in a bid to further promote its
tourism industry through an advertisement campaign.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by a state-run institution pointed out that
23 million Britons and 10 million Germans intend to visit Tunisia,
and huge potentials exist in eastern Europe where people are
getting richer.
</P>
<P>
The study also recommended working out policies and strategies
to bring the country's tourism industry in line with the
international changes in the related areas of technology,
marketing and communication.
</P>
<P>
The tourist sector is a major source of hard currency in
Tunisia as its revenues hit 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Iran have reached an agreement to set up a
joint company to market and export pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The company will market Iranian medicines in Arab and African
countries and Iran will market Egyptian pharmaceutical products in
Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Gamila Moussa, undersecretary of the Egyptian Ministry of
Health for pharmaceutical affairs, said following her return from
Tehran Saturday, that the two sides also signed an agreement on
health and medicinal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on exchange of information, staff training and
joint research in health and medical fields. Egypt has accepted an
Iranian proposal to set up joint industries for manufacturing
medical equipments which will then be marketed in both countries,
she said.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The Algerian Minister of Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises Bouguerra Sultani has announced that the government
will privatize 1,000 public enterprises, selling shares to workers
and staff, in the the coming months.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization would be completed before the end of
the year. He estimated the number of bankrupt public
establishments and factories due to mismanagement in Algeria at
1,200.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture is undertaking a
study on the needs of the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture for
Egyptian animal fodder for cattle, poultry and sheep, Sunday's
local newspaper "Alam Al Yom" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian First Undersecretary of State for Agriculture Ali
Saada has disclosed that the export of fodder will not be
restricted to government agencies, but to the private sector as
well.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian trade delegation had recently visited Iraq for
talks with Iraqi officials on prospective exports of Egyptian
foodstuffs and medicine to Iraq under the oil-for-food agreement.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's wheat output reached 6.1 million tonnes this
year, 300,000 tonnes more than last year, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Wali, minister of agriculture and land reclamation,
attributed the increase to the use of high-yield and
pest-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with the board of the Agricultural
Ministry's Research Center, the minister also cited a 1 percent
increase in rice production compared with that of last year.

<HEADLINE> Water Rising At Slower Rate On Middle Reaches Of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The flood waters on the middle
reaches of China's Yangtze River, which went above the warning level
on July 2, have started to slow down, an official at the Yangtze
River Flood Headquarters reports, but says that the overall flood
situation is still very serious.
</P>
<P>
He said that a great deal of attention needs to be paid to
banks along the middle reaches of the river, even though no
section has collapsed so far, thanks to the combined efforts of
rescue workers, local residents, and PLA units stationed along the
river.
</P>
<P>
He said that flood-control departments are keeping an eye on
the weather situation in the Three Gorges dam area and along the
upper reaches of the Yangtze. Local officials are anticipating a
struggle with more serious flood as the bulk of the flood season
usually comes in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The latest news from southwest China's Sichuan Province, at the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River, shows that last night the
province was hit by a rainstorm which inflicted heavy losses on
local residents.
</P>
<P>
In less than 24 hours, the rainfall in Wenjiang County and
Shuangliu County, both in Sichuan, reached 350 mm and 240 mm
respectively, which has recent rare in decades.

<HEADLINE> China Trying to Increase Tax Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's State Tax Administration
has a series of measures that are intended to bring this year's
tax revenues up by 80 billion to 100 billion yuan (about 12
billion US dollars) over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
This may be hard to achieve because tax revenue for the first
five months of this year were only about 304 billion yuan,
according to an official from the administration.
</P>
<P>
The drop was triggered by the Asian financial crisis, a
decrease in companies' efficiency, a drop in sales, and a slowdown
in exports.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the trend, the State Tax Administration has started
a nationwide three-month tax registration inspection to prevent
tax evasion. Special attention will be paid to key tax sources
like tobacco, alcohol, and electric power.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, enterprises still owed as much as 44.7
billion yuan in unpaid taxes and overdue fines, and local
governments are being told not to give tax exemptions for
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Value-added tax policies for small businesses will be improved
and the valued-added tax rate has been reduced from 6 to 4 percent
since July 1. Transportation fees for the value added tax are down
from 10 to 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nepal PM to Meet SAARC Leaders Over Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said Sunday he will discuss separately with all the
other South Asian leaders the issue of stability and security in
the region during their summit meeting late this month.
</P>
<P>
The 10th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) is scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri
Lanka on July 29-31.
</P>
<P>
Koirala made the remarks when meeting with Akram Zaki, the
special envoy of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Zaki
arrived here Saturday on a mission to brief Nepali leaders about
his country's perception of the current situation in South Asia
after the nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
The envoy will also visit Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the
Maldives.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Zaki handed over a letter from Prime
Minister Sharif to Prime Minister Koirala, the Nepali Foreign
Ministry said, adding that the contents of the letter covered "the
strengthening of matters of regional stability."
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have raised fears of an
arms race and caused rising tensions in the region. The two
neighbors have fought three wars since their independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
No further details of the meeting were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Voices Regret over Moscow's Expulsion of Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Sunday expressed regret over
the Russian government's decision to expel a South Korean diplomat on
spy charge Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable for Russia to take such a measure without prior
consultations with us," said Lee Ho-jin, spokesman of the Foreign
Affairs and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government Saturday ordered Cho Sung-woo, a councilor
at the South Korea's Embassy in Moscow, to depart Russia within 72
hours after he was detained on charges of espionage activity Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia announced that it seized Cho when he met with a Russian, an
employee with Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who has been
arrested on charge of "providing confidential information'' to South
Korean intelligence."
</P>
<P>
"We will first look into the case as soon as Cho returns home from
Moscow," the spokesman said, adding Seoul will take appropriate
action after its probe.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry is expected
to call in ambassador to Russia back to Seoul in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that South Korea would take retaliatory action
against Russia.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for either Seoul or Moscow to expel a
diplomat on charges of espionage since the two nations established
diplomatic ties in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Urge Continuous Efforts to Save Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Jordan's King Hussein and Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat Sunday joined in a call for unremitting efforts to
put the derailed Mideast peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders made the appeal at a joint press
conference following their meeting at Al-Itihadiya Presidential
Palace here to discuss the latest developments in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the region is in a "very dangerous" situation
due to the breakdown in the peace march caused by Israel's
intransigent policy.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Israeli government to implement the agreements
it signed with Arab countries and revise its policy which they
said is "not conducive to stability and security" in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The three-way press conference is considered a rarity because
Hussein and Arafat made lightning visits to Cairo on regular basis
but they seldom appeared together with Mubarak before the press.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president told reporters that he is "deeply
worried" that if the current situation further deteriorates, a
flare-up of violence will be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"The only road to stability is achieving peace and restoring
the illegitimate rights to the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite his serious warnings, Mubarak said an widely-expected
Arab summit will not be convened until the situation hits a dead
end.
</P>
<P>
"If the American initiative fails, there is still the
Franco-Egyptian initiative in place," he said, referring to a
joint call made by French President Jacques Chirac and himself for
an international conference on saving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The call came after Israel resisted a U.S. proposal on Israeli
army withdrawal from 13.1 percent more of the West Bank in its
second phase redeployment. The Palestinians have accepted the
formula.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he hoped that the tripartite summit will become a
prelude to another pan-Arab summit to coordinate stances of fellow
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli plan to expand Jerusalem, the Jordanian king noted,
is "the most serious" problem facing the Arab nation. He said all
kinds of attempt to change the status quos of the holy city should
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
In a post-summit communique, the three leaders voiced their
resolute rejection of the Judaization of Jerusalem, calling for a
freeze on Jewish settlement construction and the confiscation of
Palestinian buildings and properties.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that Israel comply with of the land-for-peace
principle which started the peace wheel in the Mideast region
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that the only way to salvage peace is to carry
out "the spirit of the 1991 Madrid peace conference" and the
relevant United Nations resolutions, and for Israel to return
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
The summit took place on the heels of the recent standoff in
the Gaza Strip between the Palestinian and Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
The tension began Thursday afternoon when Palestinian police
and civilians blocked access to the Gush Katif Jewish settlement
to protest against Israeli closure of a section of a coastal road
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel had barred a Palestinian minister and a convoy of some
22 trucks from entering Gaza via the road, part of which Israeli
soldiers said was off-limits to Palestinians for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The standoff ended Friday following intensive mediation
involving Americans and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident was another indication that the tension between
Israel and the Palestinian side is mounting due to the prolonged
deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides broke down 16 months ago when
Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem. The sticking point now is the Israeli refusal to carry
out a long overdue troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the tension, Israeli government approved a plan
on June 21 to expand the boundaries of the hotly disputed holy
city of Jerusalem, a violation of the agreement that no unilateral
move should be made to change the status pending permanent peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held brief, separate talks with Arafat and Hussein
Sunday morning before the joint summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Hussein, who arrived in Cairo respectively on
Saturday night and at noon on Sunday, had left for home in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Discussing New Extra Time Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- FIFA is discussing a new extra time which
may replace the current "sudden death" approach to encourage more
attacking soccer.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said on Sunday that in the new format,
the teams will play a full 30-minute extra time if they tie after 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
If both sides fail to score in extra time, a penalty shoot-out will
be held to decide the winners.
</P>
<P>
If there are goals, the team which scores the most goals wins the
game while if both sides score the same number of goals, team which
nets the first goal will be the winner.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of the format compared to the "sudden death' is that
the team trailing behind in the extra time have a chance to rally from
behind.
</P>
<P>
He said the format was still in the discussion stage and FIFA would
need experiments to study its effect on the sport.

product development and trade at the same time -- also imported
goods valued at 5.68 million U.S. dollars in the January-May
period, 2.5 times the comparable figure of last year.
</P>

the first five months. Exports to Europe came to 2.76 million
U.S. dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
High-tech enterprises in the Chinese capital have beefed up
their efforts to tap new markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, countries
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Africa.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard Sunday arrived in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah in a
bid to win arms deals, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Hubert de la Fortelle told
the news agency that Richard will hold talks with his Saudi
counterpart Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz on defense, security and
political issues.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the talks will cover bilateral defense
cooperation and a potential Saudi purchase of French-made Le Clair
main battle tanks, a deal facing competition from the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
France hopes to sell 350 Le Clair tanks and 38 recovery
vehicles worth 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said France is confident it will win the deal,
especially after the Saudi armed forces conducted tests on the
French tanks in its desert and asked for modifications to the
engine to adapt to the demanding environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the French diplomat, France is also hoping to
sell the kingdom Rafale warplanes, which Paris believes are the
most sophisticated warplanes of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In addition to defense cooperation, Richard and Prince Sultan
will review regional issues, including the deadlocked Middle East
peace process, the French ambassador said.

and setbacks in vaccine trials left many participants thinking
that their best hope against the epidemic is the strategy they
have had since it began -- prevention.

</P>
<P>
-- Fresh fighting erupted Saturday between Serb and ethnic
Albanian military forces on the outskirts of Suva Reka, the center
of a region with 60,000 residents south of Pristina. The fighting

<HEADLINE> Somalia's 1998 Grain Yield to Hit 5-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) warned Sunday that food will be in short supply in
the months ahead in Somalia where grain harvests this year are
expected "to hit an alarming five-year low."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency estimated that Somalia's total cereal output
for 1998 would be 160,000 to 170,000 tons, 60 percent less than
last year's production of 462,000 tons, marking the lowest annual
yield since 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming Gu crop, which is the country's most
important cereal harvest making up 75 to 80 percent of the annual
cereal yield, "Somali farmers will likely bring in only half the
maize and sorghum harvested last year," said a WFP statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a poor Gu harvest, cereal prices have
already increased sharply and will continue to go up in the near
future, said the WFP.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline of cereal yield is a result of the aftermath
of the El Nino rains and floods late last year and early this
year and the following poor rains this season, the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
"One of the many setbacks was that when the flood waters
receded, some families who had lost virtually all their food
stocks planted small areas of off season crops," said Ricardo
Cueva, WFP's Deputy Country Director for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"When the Gu rains eventually arrived, large segments of their
fields were then occupied by these minor crops, leaving little
space for them to cultivate their main harvest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flood, which engulfed the agriculturally-rich Juba and
Shabelle river valley areas in southern Somalia, left residents
with broken river embankments, destroyed irrigation systems,
heavily silted soil, extensive weed growth, and infestations by
pests.
</P>
<P>
The delayed and abnormally low rains this season made it more
difficult for crops to fully mature, said the WFP.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting earlier this year in the Bay region, Somalia's
main "bread basket" area, resulted in the displacement of
thousands of families and the abandonment of large tracts of
agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's only other major cereal harvest, the Deyr crop, was
a virtual failure earlier this year when the torrential floods
and heavy rains swept over the south of the country, bringing in
a mere 42,000-ton output of grain.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the Deyr has produced more than double this
figure.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that thousands of families will need
our (WFP's) help in the months ahead," said Cueva.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're finalizing plans for a new emergency
operation to distribute some 5,000 tons of relief food over the
next three months to more than half a million southern Somalis,"
he announced.
</P>
<P>
WFP delivered approximately 15,000 tons of food to more than
one million Somali flood victims from last November to May this
year.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Criticizes "Flash Interviews" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- FIFA on Sunday criticized the practice of
television and radio "flash" interviews at the end of game for
provoking players and coaches to speak irresponsibilly.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Director of Communication Keith Cooper said: "Sometimes it was
simply not fair. It is provoking them saying something which, given
several minutes of reflection, they would probably not say."
</P>
<P>
He said, "FIFA and all the teams are facing great pressure from the
media for instant comments in so-called 'flash interview' at the end
of the game."
</P>
<P>
Cooper added: "The team come off the pitch and the microphone are
stuck to the noses of the coach and the players... They are provoking
them to say something that they may be subsequently punished for."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question about German coach Berti Vogts'
words that the referee for their World Cup quarterfinal against
Croatia was biased because somebody had told him to do so.
</P>
<P>
But Cooper dismissed the comments as "totally nonsense."

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Reopen Roads in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Sunday urged Israel's reopening of all closed roads in the Gaza
Strip to Palestinian vehicles to prevent the tense situation from
worsening.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Dahlan, Palestinian preventive security director in
Gaza, said the standoff between Israeli and Palestinian forces
last Thursday in Gaza is liable to trigger violence against
Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The situation is "still very tense and any more such incidents
can lead to the break of big violence," Dahlan said at the press
conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has closed some roads in Gaza, including part of the
coastal road near Gush Katif settlement for what it claimed
"security reasons," and barred a senior Palestinian official and a
convoy of 22 vehicles from entering Gaza via the coastal road.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Palestinian police and civilians blocked access
to the Gush Katif Jewish settlement last Thursday to protest the
Israeli closure.
</P>
<P>
Their security forces entered a 15-hour standoff when Israel
sent more troops, armored vehicles and tanks into Gaza as
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Tensions were brought to an end Friday after intensive
mediation involving U.S., British, Egyptian officials. But the
roads remain sealed.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan spoke highly of the cooperation between security
officers of the two sides in handling the standoff, saying such
cooperation prevented the incident from running out of control.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an unnamed Palestinian source as saying that
that Dahlan met head of Israeli army's Southern Command Yom-Tom
Samia Saturday night on roads reopening.
</P>
<P>
The source said the two leaders are to meet Sunday for further
discussion.

The marchers calmly turned back, but many vowed to stay until
they were allowed through to a mainly nationalist area.
</P>
<P>
The standoff followed a peaceful march and service at Drumcree
parish church by the Protestant Orangemen late in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The independent Parades Commission has decided to ban the
Protestant march on the traditional route that include the Catholic
areas in Portadown, southwest of provincial capital Belfast. But
the Orange Order, the organizer of the parade, said it would
exercise its "civil right" to follow its traditional journey back
from Drumcree Church, as it did since 1807.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 troops and police were on hand to prevent the
Orangemen going down Garvaghy Road, in accordance with the Parades
Commission ruling.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chief Constable in Northern Ireland Ronnie Flanagan
said he was determined to enforce the Parades Commission decision
to bar the Protestant Orangemen from passing along the traditional
route.

PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- England team manager Glenn Hoddle said
he was not yet ready to discuss a new contract with the Football
Association (FA).
</P>
<P>
FA chairman Keith Wiseman had offered to talk with Hoddle about
extending his contract, which is due to end after the 2000 European

But Hoddle said he would not commit to anything:The next World
Cup is too far away for me to consider at the moment."

"There is a lot of water to pass under the bridge before then. I
want to keep my options open," said Hoddle, "Both the FA and myself
are aware that my contract runs until Euro 2000."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said:"I don't see any reason for them or me to change the
situation. If the agreement was coming to an end then it would be

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Saudi Arabia to Liberalize Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Saudi Arabia are making
efforts to liberalize bilateral trade and bolster their economic
and commercial cooperation, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Jordanian Minister of Industry and Trade Hani
Mulqi as saying that a joint Jordanian-Saudi committee will be
established to work towards reaching a free trade agreement at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Mulqi made the statement here Saturday after meeting with
visiting Saudi Commerce Minister Osama Ibn Jaafar Bin Ibrahim
Faqih that the establishment of such a committee became ever more
necessary as the bilateral trade reached to 354 million
U.S. dollars last year and is expected to further rise this year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is Jordan's second largest trade partner after
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Faqih, in Amman for a Saudi-made products exhibition, also
stressed the importance for mutual recognition of product
specifications and standards adopted by each country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year an agreement will be signed on products
specifications and standards that will enable businessmen to
understand each other country's requirements and abide by them.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also sign an agreement on transportation
by land to facilitate the flow of goods and passengers between the
two countries. Jordan currently has over 100 trucks handling Saudi
Arabia-bound goods.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Faqih also met with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
and the two sides emphasized the importance of creating an
Arab Free Trade Zone and promised to contribute to the creation of
such a zone.

<HEADLINE> 2,400-year-old Tomb Excavated in Zhejiang Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A tomb on a mountaintop believed
to belong to a ruler of the Yue State in the late Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 BC) has been excavated in Shaoxing, east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, covering an area of 100,000 square meters, was built
in a pit that was dug in Yinshan Mountain. In the 32-meter-long
burial room was a wooden coffin made of a whole trunk that is six
meters long and one meter in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The burial room, made of painted wood, was wrapped with more
than 140 layers of bark. Above the bark was a one-meter-thick
layer of charcoal. The whole pit was sealed with black clay.
</P>
<P>
Although the tomb had been robbed before, Chinese archeologists
unearthed pieces of jade, lacquer, bronzeware and stoneware.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists, who have found no written records in the
tomb, believe it belonged to King Yun Chang of the Yue State,
father of King Gou Jian.
</P>
<P>
Gou Jian is the most famous king in the history of the Yue
State which conquered the much stronger Wu State.
</P>
<P>
The city of Shaoxing is planning to build a museum at the
site.

<HEADLINE> Israel Calls Cairo Summit "Not Helpful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- As Egyptian, Jordanian and
Palestinian leaders converged in Cairo to discuss the troubled
peace process, Israel dismissed the three-way summit as "not
helpful" and urged Palestinians to resume direct talks.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was quoted by Israel Radio as saying
that the Cairo summit would not help advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the summit held by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King
Hussein. They held the meeting to coordinate their stances toward
the Israeli intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan criticized the three leaders for attempting to
pressure Israel to make concessions in the negotiations, adding
that the best way to revive the peace process was for the
Palestinians to resume direct talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiating
table since early last year when Israel began building a Jewish
settlement in the East Jerusalem. The talks are currently stuck by
the dispute over the next Israeli troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Top on the Cairo summit were the American initiative on the
Israeli redeployment, the Israeli plan to expand the boundaries of
the disputed holy city of Jerusalem, and a joint Egyptian-French
initiative for holding an international conference to rescue the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-French proposal was made by French President
Jacques Chirac and Mubarak during the latter's visit to Paris in
last May.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up to the Paris meeting between the two
presidents, French presidential envoy Jean Claude Consserean met
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Cairo Saturday to discuss
the joint peace bid.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to press Israel to accept the American pullback plan,
Arafat has also been lobbying for support for holding an Arab
summit to confront the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday that
the Egyptian-French proposal could not serve as an alternative
to the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted him as saying that Israel was continuing
discussions with the U.S. over the redeployment and he hoped that
a solution would be found.
</P>
<P>
Consserean arrived in Israel Sunday for talks with Israeli
officials. Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur
has said that Israel opposes the Egyptian-French proposal because
Israel would be excluded from such a meeting.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leaders Leave for Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A large delegation led by
Mogadishu's main faction leaders, accompanied by Libya's
Ambassador to Somalia, left together for Tripoli Sunday morning
for peace talks in that northern African country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of more than 40 people, accompanied by Libya's
Ambassador to Somalia Ali-Sayid Ma'tuq, took off from the only
tarmac airport of Ballidogle, 90 km south of the capital, at 9:15
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The scope behind the sudden visit to Tripoli is not known.
However, sources close to the top aids of the faction leaders had
characterized the move as a new initiative in which Libya wants
to intervene in the deadlocked peace talks over the formation of
an administration for Somalia's capital and the reopening of the
air and sea ports of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the faction leaders will be attending a
large religious congregation sponsored by Libya's leader Col.
Muammar al-Gaddafi on the occasion of the birth day of Prophet
Mohamed which falls on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the faction leaders coincided with the
arrival of new uniforms for Hussein Aidid's faction only two days
ago.
</P>
<P>
Even though the source of these uniforms is not disclosed
officially, rumors indicate that they have arrived from Libya
through Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of gunmen in these new uniforms are wandering around
the main streets of the capital, especially in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the headquarters of the faction
leaders in Mogadishu, the unexpected departure to Libya followed
a formal 10-day invitation from Col.Gaddaf through Ambassador
Ma'tuq.
</P>
<P>
Ma'tug conveyed the letters of invitation to the faction
leaders including Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein Aidid and Osman Ali
Atto who all together flew from the same airport for the second
time now since the civil war broke out in Somalia seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such visit by Mogadishu's faction leaders
to Libya since the Cairo peace deal was signed last December.
</P>
<P>
However, no fruits seem to be coming out soon from either the
meeting in Tripoli or the peace deal of Cairo itself as each of
the faction leaders is facing serious internal rivalry and
further split within each faction.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders themselves do not agree on many points.
Particularly, Mohamed and Atto have not been in good terms since
the nine-day long abduction of the International Red Cross aid
workers in north Mogadishu in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Rules out Dissolution of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
(Parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri Sunday ruled out the dissolution
of the Majlis, saying no one or authority has the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
This was the strongest reaction of the county's conservatives
to the recent call by pro-moderate university students for
dissolving the Majlis, which they called as a puppet parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Majlis' open session, Nouri said the Majlis has
a legal and important place in the Islamic system and is "the
symbol of the system's independence and republicanism."
</P>
<P>
Nouri expressed indignation at those who launched insults
against Majlis deputies and called for dissolving the
parliament. Such call was the first since the foundation of the
Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering at Tehran University in support of former
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, a representative of the
moderates impeached by the Majlis last month, thousands of
students denounced the Majlis' move and calling for its
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
The students chanted slogans: "We do not want a puppet Majlis,
We do not want Nateq Nouri"
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Majlis speaker described the students' call as an
"alarm bell" for the country, warning that foreigners might have
had a hand in the issue. "Otherwise, why has BBC (British
Broadcasting Corporation) made interviews about the Majlis'
dissolution and even gave suggestions about certain issues?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that weakening the Majlis would weaken the
government, because a legitimate government should obtain vote of
confidence from the Majlis while a "puppet Majlis will establish
a puppet government."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that under the constitution, no one can dissolve
the Majlis, adding that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also
rejected such a proposal "with insight and respect to the people's
will."

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Companies from Hong Kong have
steadily increased their investment in Zhangzhou, a coastal city
in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou approved 96 Hong Kong-funded enterprises in the first
five months of this year, with contracted investment totaling 180
million U.S. dollars. Both figures were 57 percent of the total
for the five-month period and nearly double the comparable figures
of last year.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of Zhangzhou's increased effort to attract
investors from Hong Kong since it returned to the motherland last
July, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year Zhangzhou has also taken effective measures
to improve its overall investment environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Hong Kong have invested in agriculture,
forestry, processing trade, plastics, real estate, VCDs and other
areas, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Though affected by the Asian financial crisis, Zhangzhou's
exports to Hong Kong continued to rise this year. The export
volume reached 200 million U.S. dollars in the first five months
of this year, about two-thirds of Zhangzhou's total exports during
the period.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Newspaper Praises Clinton's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A leading Bangladeshi newspaper
Sunday praised U.S. President Bill Clinton's just-concluded China
visit, saying it is conducive to Asia's stability, of which China
remains an anchor.
</P>
<P>
Both the world and China have changed in the past 26 years
since former U.S. President Richard Nixon "opened the way to
engagement with the world's most populous country" in 1972, The
Independent daily said in an editorial entitled "Clinton's China
Mission."
</P>
<P>
China "has modernized and strengthened its economy, and is
today a power to be reckoned with," the newspaper noted.
"President Clinton during his tour of China from Xi'an to Beijing
to Shanghai must have noted this change."
</P>
<P>
"China has remained an anchor of stability in a region (Asia)
torn by economic slide forcing countries of the region to devalue
their currencies," it said. "The U.S. president had words of
praise for China for its economic stability in the face of the
Japanese yen's weakness and Asia's economic downturn."
</P>
<P>
"He also found common ground with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
on the nuclear issue, disarmament and regional cooperation," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president signaled to the Chinese public his policy of
engagement with China at his joint news conference with his
Chinese counterpart and later in an interview with the local
television, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"Considering everything, Clinton's visit was an historic one
and will hopefully help bring stability in the region," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The general perception is that in a subtle rearrangement of
its Asian relationship, the the United States is putting China
atop the list ahead of its traditional allies," it continued.
"This has sparked sharp reaction in some countries, notably
India," "but is welcomed by most others."
</P>
<P>
"The world will watch with keen interest how the perceived new
relationship between the only superpower of the post-Cold War era
and the Asian giant develops in the days ahead," the editorial
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Orangemen Begin Controversial Parade in Portadown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Five thousand Orangemen marched out
of Portadown on their way to the annual church service at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
It is feared the controversial parade may spark violence and
damage the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the Roman Catholics in the parade area, the
independent Parades Commission has decided to ban the Protestant
march on the traditional route that include the Catholic areas in
Portadown, southwest of provincial capital Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Orange leaders appealed their marchers for calm, but insisted
they would defy the ban and march back from the church along the
mainly nationalist Gargaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 troops and police are on standby in case the
Orangemen attempt to break the block.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the parade has sparked violence between
Orangemen and police.

PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexican referee Arturo Brizio Carter has
set a new record for sendings-off after officiating Saturday's World
Cup quarterfinal between Argentia and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> New "No-Sweat" Surgery Helps Heavy Perspirers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- For those who suffer from
hyperhydrosis -- excessive perspiration from the palms of hands
and soles of feet and armpits - "no sweat" is a cherished wish.
</P>
<P>
Now their wish can become true with the help of a new surgery
adopted by doctors at the Soroka Hospital in the southern Israeli
city of Beersheba.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional surgical solution, the armpit was
opened to enter the thoracic cavity and nerves that stimulate
excessive sweating from the palms were cut.
</P>
<P>
But the surgery took 45 minutes per armpit, and the patients
needed about two weeks to recover. Also, each armpit had to be
operated on months apart.
</P>
<P>
Today the procedure is carried out by the "keyhole surgery" via
the armpits into the chest, said Professor Abraham Mares, chief of
 pediatric surgery at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
In the surgery, a one-centimeter incision is made at the
armpit for a tiny video camera on a catheter and an electric wire
that cauterizes the trouble-making ganglion (knot of nerves). The
area near the ribs is inflated slightly with carbon dioxide gas
to ease manipulation of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
A special type of glue, which peels away in less than a week,
is used to seal the incisions, so even stitches are unnecessary,
Mares said. The patient is kept overnight for observation, and
sent home.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Appeals for Calm Ahead of Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
made a last-ditch appeal on Sunday morning for both sides to calm
down ahead of the contentious Drumcree march later in the day.
</P>
<P>
She said that if Orangemen were to clash with security forces at
the parade "everyone would be a loser."
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order has underlined its determination to march down
the nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown on Sunday, contrary to a
Parade Commission ruling. It said it would exercise its "civil
right" to follow its traditional journey back from Drumcree Church,
as it did since 1807.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chief Constable in Northern Ireland Ronnie Flanagan
said he was determined to enforce a decision of the Parades
Commission to prevent the Protestant Orangemen from passing along
the Garvaghy Road from Drumcree church.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 2,000 police and soldiers spend most of
Saturday turning Portadown into a fortress. They laid kilometers of
razor wire, dug trenches and set up road blocks to prevent the
Orange march following its traditional route.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers are in the town to support the police
officers in the event of violence and security chiefs banned
aircraft from entering the area.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Use Force to End Rebellion in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and defense ministers from
west African countries have ended an emergency meeting with a
resolution to use force to crush the armed rebellion in Guinea
Bissau, a report reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Guinea Bissau's President Joau Bernardo
Vieira, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
held a two-day ministerial meeting, which started Friday in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, to discuss the possibility of military
intervention in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have resolved that ECOWAS member states should
immediately beef up the strength of the organization's monitoring
group, widely known as ECOMOG, as the first step to the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
There are now only soldiers from Nigeria and Ghana serving the
West African Peace-keeping Force (ECOMOG). Member states are
urged to redeem pledges they made long ago for the provision of
logistic support and troops contribution to the sub-regional
peace keeping force, according to a communique issued at the end
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send ECOMOG troops to Guinea Bissau was one of
the key resolutions contained in the communique.
</P>
<P>
According to it, the ministers from 14 out of the 16 ECOWAS
member states reaffirmed their support for the
democratically-elected government of President Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The central objective of ECOWAS intervention would be to
restore peace to that country and reassert the authority of the
elected government.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to work toward realizing this objective
by a combination of three measures: dialog and negotiation,
sanctions and embargo, and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Urging an immediate halt of hostilities within Guinea Bissau,
the minister established a special committee to ensure the full
implementation of the decisions and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises seven countries, namely, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. It will be
joined by representatives of the Organization of African Unity
and ECOWAS secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also work to ensure support of the United
Nations Security Council to various measures taken by ECOWAS in
handling issues concerning Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent some 2,000 troops to help the
Vieira government's efforts to end the revolt that has killed
hundreds of civilians, leaving tens of thousands to be refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were praised at the meeting for their prompt
action already taken in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The armed rebellion started on June 7 and was led by the
country's former Army Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane who was
dismissed by President Vieira the previous day.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Makes Progress in Eliminating Child Labor in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has made history in
eliminating child labor from the labor-intensive garment sector,
The New Nation daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Children (child laborers in the garment sector) are now going
to formal and non-formal educational institutions erasing their
garment-workers' symbol," Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed said while addressing a function held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This has been done in line with the implementation of the
tripartite Memorandum of Understanding among the Bangladesh
Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the ILO
(International Labor Organization) and UNICEF (United Nations
Children's Fund), he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that 353 learning centers had been set up to
accommodate 9,743 children, accounting for 95 percent of the total
former child laborers in the country's garment sector.
</P>
<P>
A monthly stipend of 300 taka (about 6.4 U.S. dollars) was
being provided to each student, he said.
</P>
<P>
Children who attained 14 years of age were also being provided
with job and other income generating facilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the employers not to accept child laborers
in their garment factories any more.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh "is expected to be compensated by 30 percent more
quota for garment export to the markets abroad," he told the
function, saying that the prerequisite for this was to eliminate
child labor in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh plans to end all forms of child labor by the year
2010. The International Program on Elimination of Child Labor has
been under effective implementation with donor assistance since
1995, and the program will remove the last vestiges of child labor
from the country.

currently closed to Palestinians for "security reasons."
</P>

Yediot Aharonot:
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation in
India shot up to 6.86 percent for the week that ended June 20 this
year on sustained increases in prices of primary articles, Press
Trust of India (PTI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate based on the wholesale price index (WPI)
shot up by 0.21 percentage points to 6.86 (provisional) from 6.65
percent the previous week. Inflation stood at 5.64 percent in the
corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend in inflation has gathered momentum in the
current fiscal year and this is the seventh consecutive week
inflation has ruled above the six percent mark. During the first
week of April, it stood at 4.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rising inflation rate is maily attributed to rises in
prices of certain primary articles. In the last three months
preceding June 13, prices of potatoes had risen by about 126.7
percent while prices of groundnut oil and mustard oil by 11.1
percent and 18.0 percent respectively.

Israel had barred Palestinian Minister of Supplies Abdul Aziz
Shahin and a convoy of some 22 trucks from entering the Gaza Strip
via the road, part of which Israeli soldiers said was off-limited
to Palestinians for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli charged that the incident was clearly a provocation
planned by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Kedra said that "this standoff indicated that the patience
of the Palestinian people is running thin with (Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's provocations and attempts to
outflank the peace agreements."
</P>
<P>
The standoff ended Friday following intensive mediation
involving Americans and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident was another indication that the tension between
Israel and the Palestinian side is mounting due to the prolonged
deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides broke down 16 months ago when
Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in the Arab
East Jerusalem. The sticking point now is Israeli refusal to carry
out a long overdue troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension, Israeli government approved a plan on
June 21 to expand the boundaries of the hotly disputed holy city
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat meeting preceded a three-way summit starting
later Sunday among Mubarak, Arafat and Jordanian King Hussein. The
three leaders will discuss ways to break the deadlock in the peace
process, intensify Arab unity to confront the Israel's hard-line
policies and enhance economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo Saturday night, Hussein is due here
before noon.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Commander's Son Seeking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A son of former commander of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Mohsen Rezaee was not kidnaped
but in fact seeking asylum in the United States, the Iranian daily
Salam reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source was quoted as saying that Ahmad Rezaee's
asylum was a personal issue and did not have any political
motives. The paper denied the claim that Ahmad was kidnaped by the
U.S. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ahmad's brother Ali Rezaee refuted a report by The
Voice of America's (VOA's) Persian program that Ahmad had sought
asylum in the U.S., claiming that Ahmad was kidnaped by the NASA.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the officials Iranian news agency
IRNA, Ali said that his 21-year-old brother Ahmad phoned home on
Friday, "telling us that he had been threatened to give an
interview with the VOA on Iranian supreme leader" Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The evening daily Kayhan reported on Saturday that Ahmad left
Iran for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to a quarrel with his
father Mohsen, present secretary of the State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, Ahmad, a sophomore studying mathematics at Tehran's
Teacher Training University, attracted the attention of
U.S. intelligence agents who helped him travel to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
So far, Mohsen has not personally made any comment on his
son's issue.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Appeals for Tolerance Among Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has urged all factions in the country to exercise tolerance in
order to ensure social stability, the officials news agency IRNA
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami issued the call during a Saturday speech to religious
figures in Shahr Kord, the southwestern province of
Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the existing differences in the society is a
natural phenomenon, and the way to strengthen and defend religion
is to protect the freedom given by the religion and people's
right to criticize.
</P>
<P>
The moderate leader, arriving in Shahr Kord Saturday afternoon
for a two-day inspection tour, said that criticizing the
president, the Majlis (Parliament), the judiciary and other
officials was allowed, although it must be restricted within the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
To ensure social stability, all should respect the law and all
three branches of the government should act within the framework
of rules and regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's remarks came at a time when the country is facing a
heated struggle between the moderate and conservative camps due
to their different views about the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
The moderates advocate political progress in the country,
while the conservatives believe that social crimes and economic
problems are the main issues facing the government.
</P>
<P>
In another meeting with Iranian national football team on
Saturday, Khatami said the Iranian nation should adopt the rule of
football match, in which the two sides compete with each other
without real animosity.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn that human beings have differences of
opinion," he said, "at the same time we must learn to hold
talks with each other."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed regret that the Iranian people have not
yet established a desirable system "for unfortunately we are not
tolerant." He promised that his government would make more efforts
to heal the social division.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Airport Night Move to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The dramatic overnight move of
airport operations from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok will go ahead as
planned late Sunday despite forecast for heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Crowds of people flooded to Kai Tak Sunday to catch a last
glimpse of the 73-year-old airport that will be closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rain and thunderstorms, as forecast by the Hong Kong
Observatory Sunday morning, will not affect the relocation,
scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m. Sunday and end at 6:30 a.m.
Monday, when the first flight is to land at the new airport,
according to the latest report by the Airport Authority (AA).
</P>
<P>
During the 13 hours, Hong Kong will move all equipment and
facilities from Kai Tak, the world's third busiest international
passenger airport and busiest international cargo airport some 30
km to the west -- the most critical stage of a five-phase
relocation exercise that lasts three months.
</P>
<P>
The night move may be the biggest peace-time operation, which
is composed of some 1,100 vehicle movements by land, sea and air.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Kai Tak near the Kowloon Bay, about 1,000
vehicles will pass through some of the most densely populated
areas anywhere, cross one of the world's longest suspension
bridges, and move westwards to the new airport built on a
reclaimed island 25 km away from the central business district on
Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen convoys are planned, and all will travel under police
escort along the designated routes, and 1,000 policemen will be
deployed to control the traffic.
</P>
<P>
Some large, strange-shaped, utilitarian vehicles familiar on
airport parking areas, such as deck loaders, tractors, pallet
pushers and assorted dollies, will be seen on roads.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 14 barges will sail through Victoria Harbor to
ship heavier loads to Chek Lap Kok, to where 31 airliners will
make a hop from Kai Tak, believed to be the shortest distance they
have ever fly.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest item to be moved will be an aircraft recovery
vehicle, which is big enough to haul a disabled Boeing 747 from
the runway, and the smallest items probably will be 70,000 sets of
utensils that are on the transfer list of Cathay Pacific Catering
Services.
</P>
<P>
Everything has been planned to the finest detail to make a
seamless transfer and ensure that Hong Kong, at all times, has a
fully functional airport, whether Kai Tak or Chek Lap Kok,
according to the AA, which is responsible for building and
management of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The night move comprises three interlinked operations --
departure from Kai Tak, journey from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok, and
reception and distribution at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Each individual vehicle has an allocated time slot to load,
depart and arrive at Chek Lap Kok. The AA will be logging each
vehicle move by computer so that a real-time picture emerges on
how the relocation is proceeding.
</P>
<P>
A dozen government departments and 65 airlines or
aviation-related businesses will take part in the overnight
relocation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry Townsend, AA's Chief Executive Officer, is optimistic
about the relocation, saying that "we don't anticipate any major
problems".
</P>
<P>
"People will probably collapse from exhaustion, and my role is
to help every one and keep an eye on what is going on in the event
of some crises and emergency," said Townsend, who will stay at his
office at Chek Lap Kok throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Police urge the public time and again to stay home on
the night so that the roads are clear of traffic.
</P>
<P>
At the heel of the overnight relocation, a month-long move will
follow to wrap up the entire process that started on May 6 and
will conclude on August 5.

<HEADLINE> Ten-Project Airport Core Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The opening of Hong Kong's new
airport at Chek Lap Kok marks the successful conclusion of the
10-project 155.3-billion-HK-dollar (19.9 billion U.S. dollars)
Airport Core Program, which is the largest infrastructure
development undertaken in Hong Kong.

1. New Airport
</P>
<P>
The new airport at Chek Lap Kok is almost four times the size
of existing airport at Kai Tak. The "greenfield" site was formed
by leveling the tiny islands of Chek Lap Kok and Lam Chau and
reclaiming land from the sea.
</P>
<P>
On opening, with the first of its two 3,800-meter runways in
service, the new airport will be able to handle 35 million
passengers and three million tons of air cargo a year, compared
with the 28.3 million passengers and 1.79 million tons of cargo
passing through Kai Tak in 1997. The new airport will operate
round the clock without the night-time flight restrictions imposed
at the Kai Tak airport.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be developed in phases and ultimately is
expected to handle 87 million passengers and nine million tons of
air cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
The passenger terminal building is very spacious. It will
eventually have a gross floor area of nearly 550,000 square
meters, or nine times as large as that of Kai Tak, with 30,000
square meters dedicated to retailing. Sign posting in English and
Chinese throughout the terminal will be clear and simple.
</P>
<P>
There will be 38 bridge-served gates for wide-bodied aircraft
(48 by the end of 1998 after extension of the northwest
concourse). Accessibility to the gates will be facilitated by a
driverless shuttle train and moving walkways.
</P>
<P>
Departing passengers should take less than three minutes to
check in at nearly 300 desks. From each of these desks, as well as
16 over-sized baggage check-in counters, luggage will move
smoothly on its way through a sophisticated baggage handling and
screening system, so the highest levels of security will be
maintained. It should take no more than 30 minutes to complete
check-in and immigration formalities to board aircraft.
</P>
<P>
With 12 reclaim carousels handling almost 20,000 pieces of
luggage an hour, passengers will be able to retrieve their baggage
quickly after entering the arrivals area.

2. The Airport Railway
</P>
<P>
The Airport Railway, 34 kilometers long, is the world's first
railway built specifically to serve an airport. It has two
separate services: the Airport Express and the domestic service --
the Tung Chung Line, with the trains running at speeds up to 135
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Express, designed as an all-seated, business
class-type service, carries passengers between the new airport and
the Central District of Hong Kong Island in just 23 minutes.
There are two intermediate stops at Kowloon and Tsing Yi.
</P>
<P>
In-town check-in facilities will be provided at the Hong Kong
and Kowloon stations, and baggage checked in will be carried in a
separate car.
</P>
<P>
The Tung Chung Line, providing a mass transit-type service
between Hong Kong Island and Tung Chung new town, has intermediate
stations at Kowloon, Tai Kok Tsui (Olympic Station), Lai King (an
interchange with the existing MTR Tsuen Wan Line) and Tsing Yi.
This service, designed to carry more than 260,000 passengers
daily, can ease congestion on the present Mass Transit Railway
(MTR) Tsuen Wan line.

3. New Town
</P>
<P>
The new town has been built on specially reclaimed land at Tung
Chung, Lantau Island, as a support community for the new airport.
</P>
<P>
It is not only the latest new town in Hong Kong, but also the
first new town located on an outlying island. It has been designed
to blend in with its rural surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Under Phase 1 development, the new town has a population of
20,000, with up to 15,000 living in public housing. About 10,000
residents have moved into the new town.
</P>
<P>
Further stages of development, greatly expanding the new town's
area, will provide for a population of about 200,000 by the year
2011.

<HEADLINE> Ten-Project Airport Core Program in HK (2) 4. The Lantau Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lantau Link, opened to traffic on May 22, 1997, has become
a new landmark in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is the vital link in the transport network serving the new
airport, comprising the Tsing Ma Bridge, the Kap Shui Mun Bridge
and a connecting Ma Wan Viaduct.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its 3.5 kilometer length, the double-decked Lantau
Link has a similar configuration: six road lanes on the open upper
deck and two road lanes for use in bad weather, or in emergency,
on the sheltered lower deck, which will also carry the airport
railway.
</P>
<P>
The Tsing Ma Bridge is the world's longest span suspension
bridge carrying both road and rail traffic. Its main span of 1,377
meters is more than twice the length of the Sydney Harbor Bridge
which is 500 meters long and 97 meters longer than San Francisco's
Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Tsing Ma Bridge has been designed to withstand typhoons
with wind speeds of up to 342 kilometers per hour. The highest
gust wind speed ever recorded in Hong Kong is 259 kilometers per
hour in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The Kap Shui Mun Bridge, though smaller than its sister bridge
Tsing Ma, is the world's longest cable-stayed bridge to carry both
road and rail traffic.

5. Western Harbor Crossing
</P>
<P>
The two-kilometer Western Harbor Crossing, opened to traffic on
April 30, 1997, is the third road tunnel built under Victoria
Harbor. It runs from the reclaimed land at West Kowloon to Sai
Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
The six-lane tunnel has a maximum capacity of 180,000 vehicles
daily, far exceeding that of the existing four-lane tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Its 1.36-kilometer immersed tube section comprises 12 concrete
units each weighing 35,000 tons.

6. North Lantau Expressway
</P>
<P>
The North Lantau Expressway was opened to traffic on May 22,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The 12.5-kilometer expressway runs along the north Lantau
coast, from the Lantau Link to the new airport. It is the first
highway constructed along the island's northern coastline.
</P>
<P>
More than half the route is on reclaimed land.
</P>
<P>
An interchange at Tung Chung will provide direct access to the
new town.

7. Route 3 (part)
</P>
<P>
Two sections of this north-south route are built as part of the
Airport Core Program -- the Tsing Yi and Kwai Chung sections.
</P>
<P>
Tsing Yi section comprises a 1.6-kilometer dual three-lane
twin-tube tunnel through Tsing Yi Island and a 500-meter bridge
over the Rambler Channel that separates the island from the
mainland. It was opened to traffic on May 22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kwai Chung section is a viaduct built 20 meters above ground.
Unlike the rest of the road transport network, it has eight lanes.
The three-kilometer viaduct was opened to the public on February
20, 1997. It links the Rambler Channel Bridge in the north and the
West Kowloon Expressway in the south.

8. West Kowloon Expressway
</P>
<P>
The West Kowloon Expressway, opened to traffic on February 20,
1997,  is a four-kilometer expressway running from the Kwai Chung
viaduct to the Western Harbor Crossing toll plaza.
</P>
<P>
The northern section is carried on a viaduct and the southern
section is at ground level.
</P>
<P>
Two interchanges provide for connections with the local
transport network.

9. West Kowloon Reclamation
</P>
<P>
The West Kowloon Reclamation is the largest reclamation project
ever undertaken in the urban area -- increasing the size of the
Kowloon peninsula by one-third and extending the waterfront into
the harbor by as much as one kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The project provides 334 hectares of new land between Yau Ma
Tei and Lai Chi Kok. This land is being used for the transport
infrastructure serving the new airport. It will also be used for
various other purposes, including public and private housing for
over 90,000 people, government and community facilities and
recreational areas.

10. Central Reclamation (phase 1)
</P>
<P>
Twenty hectares of land have been reclaimed from the Central
waterfront and a further six hectares of existing land are being
redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
The reclamation, between Rumsey Street and Pedder Street, has
extended the waterfront by up to 350 meters beyond Central's
existing shoreline.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong terminus of the Airport Railway is built on the
new land, which also provides opportunities for the expansion of
the Central business district.
</P>
<P>
Four new ferry piers, serving both inner harbor and outlying
inland routes, have been opened on the reclaimed land. A large
promenade has been provided as well as a bus terminus.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Jiang's Central Asian Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The successful visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan
represents another major contribution to regional peace and
development, China's People's Daily said in an editorial Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in his visit Friday through Saturday, first attended a
meeting with the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and
Tajikistan. High on the agenda of the five-nation meeting was
regional peace and stability as well as multilateral economic
cooperation. At the one-day meeting, the leaders reached consensus
on the following points:
</P>
<P>
-- They will continue to observe the universally-accepted norms
governing international relations: mutual respect for sovereignty
and territory integrity, equality and mutual benefit, and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- They will solve the differences and disputes between their
countries through friendly consultations;
</P>
<P>
-- They will join efforts in fighting against various forms of
public evils, such as national splittism, religious extremism,
terrorism, arms smuggling and drug trafficking;
</P>
<P>
-- They will forge closer economic ties in pursuit of mutual
benefit;
</P>
<P>
-- They will work with the world community to prevent a nuclear
arms race in South Asia and safeguard the international nuclear
non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president reiterated that China favors a
comprehensive ban and total destruction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said that unconditionally, China will never be the first to
use nuclear weapons; that under no circumstances will China ever
use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against any nuclear-free
country or nuclear-free zone, and that China has no intention to
resume nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that China's cooperation with the four
countries is a clear demonstration that China has always been a
major force to promote world peace and development, and that its
development and strength will bring greater security and more
chances of cooperation, instead of any threat, to the world.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations with Kazakhstan, the editorial noted
that President Jiang's visit is also an important event, because
the leaders of the two countries have re-designed a new blueprint
for bilateral relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the supplementary border agreement signed during
the visit is the third legal document of this nature and marks a
complete settlement of all the issues concerning the
1,700-kilometer-long border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This will not only help deepen their mutual trust and
friendship but also have a positive impact on their efforts to
solve similar issues with their other neighbors, the editorial
said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Marks Anniversary of Anti-Fascist Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Mass rallies were held in major
cities across Yugoslavia on Saturday to mark the 57th anniversary
of the country's anti-fascist uprising.
</P>
<P>
On July 4, 1941, the then Communist Party of Yugoslavia decided
to stage an armed uprising against the invasion of German and
Italian forces, which triggered off the country's four-year
anti-fascist war.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally held in Prijepolje in west Serbia, Bozidar
Jovanovic, a war veteran, said that for both Yugoslavia and
Europe, the 1941 uprising is of both great historic and profound
practical significance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the currently tense situation in the troubled
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Jovanovic said that every citizen of
the Federation of Yugoslavia has a duty to safeguard the
federation's independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also warned certain western forces against supporting
separatism and terrorism in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The World War II veterans taking part in the rally sent a
message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, offering full
support to the president's efforts to safeguard the country and to
seek a peaceful end to the Kosovo crisis through political
dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Officials Hail Jiang's Successful Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh officials said Saturday
that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to
Kazakhstan has contributed greatly to the development of the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Presidential Press Secretary Kairat
Sarybaev said Jiang's just-concluded visit has injected new
vitality into the Kazakhstan-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the good personal relations between Jiang and
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev will play a positive role in
furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mubtar Abliazov, minister of energy, industry and trade, said
the visit has achieved positive results. With the leaders of the
two countries sharing views on many issues, he said, the economic
relations between the two countries will see a period of fast
growth.
</P>
<P>
Nurlan Kapparov, president of the state-owned oil company
Kazakhoil, said that cooperation in the oil sector will benefit
from Jiang's visit because the two leaders agreed to strengthen
cooperation in energy, especially in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Shakirov said that the fact that
Jiang visited Kazakhstan twice in two years demonstrates that
bilateral relations have grown to a new level.
</P>
<P>
All these Kazakh officials believed that the most important
achievement of Jiang's visit is the signing of a supplementary
agreement on border issues.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has completely solved all the remaining border
issues between the two countries, turning the border into a bond
of friendship and laying a solid foundation for the future
development of bilateral relations, they said.

he won't try a 200- and 400-meter double at the coming Goodwill
Games starting in New York on July 19.
</P>
<P>
"I'm running just the 400," said Johnson, who shone at 1996
Olympics with a brilliant double triumph.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Take Steps to Protect Local Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said that his government is to sign trade agreements with
neighboring countries to protect local industries threatened by
imported subsidized goods.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-week 34th Zambia international trade fair
Saturday in Ndola, 330 kilometers north of Lusaka, Chiluba said
it is imperative to sign such agreements because some foreign
companies have capitalized on Zambia's liberalized economy to
dump goods on the local market, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of our economy had at times brought in
undesired international companies who have seized the opportunity
to dump goods on our market," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trade agreements are intended to bring the
country's manufacturing industry on the line of fair competition
with other firms in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba explained that the measures in the trade
agreements are not intended to stop the economic integration
process in the eastern and southern Africa but to compliment the
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said to ensure the playing field is leveled, it is the
government's duty to promote a tax system that is responsive to
the business growth.
</P>
<P>
Zambia needs a tax system which does not encourage loopholes
for cheating and evasion, said the president, adding that the
Zambia Revenue Authority will have to constantly work with the
business community to sustain development.
</P>
<P>
The annual international trade fair whose theme is "Trade
Without Borders" has attracted 154 local companies and 99 firms
from nine foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Devalues Currency to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank Sunday devalued
the country's currency taka by 1.7 percent against the U.S. dollar
in an attempt to boost export and increase its foreign exchange
reserve.
</P>
<P>
This is the second downward adjustment of the taka this year
and the 13th since the Awami League-led government was formed in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar now
stand at 46.95 and 47.25 taka per dollar as against 46.15 taka and
46.45 taka respectively before the devaluation which, according to
the country's central bank, the Bangladesh Bank, was aimed at
"maintaining incentives for exports and for inflow from expatriate
Bangladeshis."
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts are concerned whether devaluation, the
"prescribed medicine" for supporting exports, could reach the
desired results.
</P>
<P>
In early February this year, the taka was devalued in the wake
of widespread currency depreciation in Southeast Asia, in the hope
that the move would help improve the competitiveness of
Bangladesh's exports and raise its foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign exchange reserve did not demonstrate a strong
upward trend as expected, which rose slightly to 1.68 billion
dollars as of June 1 from 1.67 billion on January 8, while export
earnings which stood at about 4.1 billion dollars during the first
10 months of the past fiscal year ending on June 30, were 10
million dollars short of the target.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation this time is the result of pressure from
exporters and the business community as a whole to accelerate
exports, particularly ready-made garments, after the depreciation
in the value of Indian and Pakistani rupee under economic
sanctions following their nuclear tests in May, press reports here
said.
</P>
<P>
While devaluation promotes exports, encourages remittances of
foreign currency by Bangladeshi workers abroad and hence may
increase the country's foreign exchange reserve, it also
discourages imports causing a fall in the government's revenue
earnings. And with procurements from other countries becoming
costlier, the supply prices shot up, possibly inducing high
inflation into the economy, exerts said.
</P>
<P>
Since most of Bangladeshi industries, especially its no. 1
foreign exchange earner the garment industry, are heavily
dependent on imported raw materials, it will not be easy to
squeeze anything significant from a situation where the import
costs will go up, they said.
</P>
<P>
And if investors do not feel confident, the country's export
base will be wakened, they added.
</P>
<P>
Exports can be spurred through increasing operational
efficiency and measures like tax exemption or rebate for the
benefit of exporters, according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation might give an impetus to export and help
increase the country's foreign exchange reserve to some extent,
but it would have an adverse effect on the country's industrial
investment in the long run, considering that it would curb the
country's imports and affecting its revenue earnings, they pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> Panama Declines Bargain With U.S. on Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government on
Saturday ruled out the possibility that it would negotiate with
the United States the continuing presence of U.S. troops in the
central American country after their mission expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"There is no possibility of re-negotiating the military bases
with the United States, as suggested by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,
in case the Multinational Drug Center project is aborted," said
Panamanian Minister of State for Canal Affairs Jorge Ritter.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, also the key negotiator for the drug center project,
known as CMA in Spanish, said Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares made it clear that there would be no re-negotiation on
the issue whether the United States asked for it or not.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1977 Canal Treaty signed between Panama and the
United States, the latter should withdraw completely its troops
from Panamanian territories on the last day of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, President Balladares initiated the CMA project. The
planned anti-drug facility, in which several Latin American
nations have been invited, is conceived as a civilian program but
will include a U.S. military component yet to be clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached at the end of last year an accord in
principle on the possible establishment of the CMA through
negotiations to be held during the following two years.
</P>
<P>
Panama presented to the United States a new proposal on the
issue and is now awaiting the U.S. government's response.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. final answer on the CMA is expected to come next week,
after the long holiday Washington will have to celebrate the
country's Independence Day, which falls on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms and House of Representatives
International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman will
ask President Bill Clinton to renegotiate the bases issue in case
of a possible failure in the CMA negotiations.

Some state banks have adjusted their loan structures to offer
more lending to infrastructure construction, simplified the
procedures of loan assessment and even extended loans in advance
to projects where repayment is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
These banks have also raised the loan ratios of their head
offices to provide direct funding to key state projects.
</P>
<P>
"This measure will meet the financial demands of important
state projects in the infrastructure and technological renovation
sectors," said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
Led by the central bank, China's banking circle has also set up
a system where bank representatives meet to timely declare
information on their banks' lending to infrastructure construction
projects and discuss solutions to existing problems.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank had granted 16.35 billion yuan (1.96
billion US dollars) in loans to railway construction by the end of
May, completing its annual loan plan for the rail sector. China
Construction Bank offered six billion yuan (722 million US
dollars) to rail projects by May, accounting for 85 percent of its
yearly target.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural
Bank of China and the China Construction Bank are assessing 140
loan projects valued at 57.9 billion yuan (6.98 billion US
dollars) in road construction.
</P>
<P>
While actively supporting infrastructure construction, these
banks have also been careful to avoid financial risks by
intensifying loan management and making sure that injected loans
are strictly in line with lending regulations.

<HEADLINE> Equities Fail to Sustain Initial Rally on BSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Equities failed to sustain the
initial sharp rally and once again showed substantial falls on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week as the negative
political developments weighed heavily on the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index, which spurted to 3,289.56 points
Monday, later moved down gradually to end the week at 3,089.02 as
against last weekend's close of 3,168.82, netting a loss of 79.80
points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dropped by 36.12 points to close the
week at 1,355.70 from last weekend close of 1391.82. The BSE-200
and us dollar index were quoted down at 300.01 and 121.08 points
compared with last weekend close of 317.52 and 123.78
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The early upsurge on the market was halted as operators
withdrew from the market in view of prevailing restrictions on
trading and selling pressure from foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The major factors for players turning cautious were the United
States attack on Iraqi missile site giving rise to speculation
about a likely war, followed by changing unstable political
situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Group Wins Thai Bridge Building Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese joint venture has been
awarded a contract to build Rama VIII Bridge across the Chao
Phraya River running through Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The group, made up of China State Construction Engineering
Corp., PPD Construction Co. and BBR System Ltd.-PCD Group
Engineering Consultant Co., won the contract to build the
2.45-kilometer Rama VIII Bridge for 2.88 billion baht (702 million
U.S. dollars), Sunday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
That is 142 million baht (3.5 million dollars) less than the
price quote of its only rival, a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
The paper said price was the sole determining factor as the two
shortlisted rivals have passed technical screening.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok required 3 billion baht (731 million dollars) in bank
guarantees from the company to make sure that the construction
work would run smoothly and that work would not come to a halt due
to financial problems later.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese consortium would have access to the land to begin
construction within a few months after the city pays land
expropriation fee to 300 families of landowners in the
construction area.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Cooperatives' Role in Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's cooperative sector has
been playing a role in changing the country's socio-economic life
under the market-oriented economic system, partly contributing to
its economic development.
</P>
<P>
The country has established more than 21,700 cooperative
societies with 2.8 million members, Myanmar Minister of
Cooperatives U Aung San was quoted by Sunday's The New Light of
Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Marking the International Day of Cooperatives here Saturday,

special regions.
</P>
<P>
After the formation of the Cooperative Export-Import
Enterprise, the export value of the organization reached 20.4
million U.S. dollars up to March this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on Myanmar's financial, economic and
social conditions, the country's cooperative sector contributed
2.1 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) in the 1997-98
fiscal year ending March.
</P>
<P>
In the three main goods sectors which contributed most to the
GDP in the year, the cooperative enterprises also shared 2.1

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan: Wreckage of Russian Helicopter Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A search team found on Saturday the
wreckage of a Russian military helicopter that went down in
Kyrgyzstan last month and confirmed the death of all the 20 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
As reported by Russia's Itar-Tass News Agency, the helicopter
lost contact with the ground 15 minutes before landing on June 25
near the mountainous Central Asian republic's border with China.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the copter, a Mi-8 of Kyrgyzstan-based Russian border
guards, were four Russian crew members and 16 Kyrgyz passengers.
</P>
<P>
Russian border guards started in 1992 to patrol along the
Sino-Kyrgyz border, which extends for more than 1,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Russian-made Mi-8 helicopters were involved in several
accidents in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, three people, including a European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development worker, were killed and 13 injured
when an Mi-8 crashed on take-off near Lake Baikal in southeastern
Siberia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Working on New Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government faces many
challenges in establishing a multiple pillar pension system, which
is in preparation for an aging generation in the 21st Century,
today's China daily reported.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to establish a comprehensive pension system,
characterized by multiple channels of funding sources, multiple
levels of insurance means and a combination of social pooling and
individual accounts, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The government initiated a major campaign to overhaul the
country's pension system last year, issuing a newly-defined
regulation for the old age pension system for enterprise employees.
</P>
<P>
"These initiatives, focusing on the transformation from the
defined-benefit and pay-as-you-go system to a multiple pillar
social security network, are encouraging," the paper quoted
Srinivasa Madhur, a senior economist with the Asian Development
Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, the movement towards a multiple pillar pension
system, using individual funding accounts for pension recipients,
poses problems relating to financing the transition," Madhur
noted.
</P>
<P>
China needs to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework
for social security, including the prudential regulation of
pension funds, the disclosure of information and the supervision
of the pension funds, Madhur said, adding that extending the
coverage of the pension system is also necessary.
</P>
<P>
Due to the one-child policy introduced in the second half of the
1970s and increasing life expectancy, China's population is aging
rapidly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At present, people aged 60 and above account for about nine
percent of China's 1.24 billion population, this figure, is
predicted to expand by 13 percent by 2030, according to the China
population Society.
</P>
<P>
"with an aging population, the financial resources needed for
providing for an old-age social security will grow enormously at
that time," said Yan Kun, an economist with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is more compelling since the current pension system
is not yet workable,' he added.
</P>
<P>
China's current pension system is characterized by a social
welfare and pay-as-you-go types, covering mainly the state-owned
enterprises, government employees and military personnel. Although
a pension scheme was introduced for farmers on an experimental
basis in 1996, it has only scarce coverage in rural areas.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's auto industry in
the past four years has received cash injection worth about 20
billion U.S. dollars, said a press here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen foreign automakers, including 11 newcomers, have
announced their plans to build new factories in Brazil, said the
Brazilian Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (Anfavea).
</P>
<P>
The capital inflow into the auto industry is after a stable
Brazilian currency and the government's favorable industrial
policy, said Celio Batalha, vice president of the Anfavea.
</P>
<P>
Another reason behind the increased funding, Batalha was quoted
as saying, is that foreign investors are assured of the bright
prospects of the Brazil market, particularly in the auto sector.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's auto industry registered a 36 percent growth from 1994
through 1997, with sales up from 1.206 million units to 1.64
million.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the nation's auto production would reach
3 million units by the year 2000.

YANGON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior finance officials of the nine
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
are meeting here to discuss the regional currency crisis which has
been sweeping the region for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day third meeting of the ASEAN finance officials, which

</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein said

<HEADLINE> A Sexual Harassment Law Is Needed: Chinese Lawmakers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Hong, a 30-year-old female employee of a government agency
in Beijing, says that instances of women being harassed in
hospital or during a regular physical examination at work units
are quite common.
</P>
<P>
Women have begun to wake up to the importance of
self-protection, but it is very difficult to bring the crime
before a court because there is often no witness, or insufficient
evidence, or no way to tell whether it is harassment or not, Wang
explains and adds, "I think it is necessary to pass a law to
punish those who commit such crimes in order to protect women's
rights and interests."
</P>
<P>
One study of 45 women involved in different jobs in Beijing
found the majority saying that they have not been harassed, but
admitting that they have heard friends complain about sexual
harassment or have read reports in the tabloids. The major media
in China usually keep silent about this.
</P>
<P>
Hu Min, also a member of the NPC Standing Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, says that he is certain that,
with an improved sense of self-protection, sexual harassment will
be put on Chinese legislators' agenda, even though there is no
precedent to follow in coming up with penalties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Standing Committee
of China's National People's Congress, Chen Guizun, said today
that the country needs a law on punish sexual harassment and
unfair use of position and power.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the third meeting of the NPC Standing committee last
week that assaulting a woman with obscenities or taking liberties
with the opposite sex by using one's position and power is in fact
a kind of crime and he suggested that a law be passed so that
sexual harassment can be penalized. His suggestion has won the
support of many legislators.
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars say that this is the first time for sexual
harassment to get the attention of legislators. The Chinese have
long been conservative about sexual matters, and people who are
harassed often do not breathe a word of it to anyone, but complain
about it in private, Chen, who was a professor at Beijing's
University of Geology and is now vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress, explained.
</P>
<P>
"They have to bear the insult in silence," he said, and this
has had a great impact, although sexual harassment by doctors is
not so common in the country.

<HEADLINE> Health Official Responds to Claims on Human Organ Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In May of 1996, the Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the General
Administration of Customs published a regulation banning the use
of human tissue and organs, including fetuses, to produce medical
preparations; prohibiting the trading of human tissue or organs;
and making it illegal to donate or exchange human tissue and
organs with any overseas organizations or individuals.
</P>
<P>
"China does not allow any work unit or individuals to be
involved in handling the bodies of executed convicts or their
organs," said the public health official. "Neither does it allow
the organs of executed convicts to be removed through coercive
means or illicit collecting and trading in human organs."
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to trade in human organs in China, and any
violation will be punished according to law, the official
said. China's Customs officials have never uncovered or
intercepted a single case of human organs being transported out of
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The health official described as "absolutely groundless" the
accusations at the U.S. House of Representative hearing that China
removes and sells organs from the executed prisoners and "even
removes organs from the convicts on the death roll, or time the
execution to suit the special needs of organ transplants."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. House of Representatives should have brought
Harry Wu and the unidentified man to testify at the hearing,
adding that Wu is notorious for making up stories against China.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Wu produced a TV documentary about surgery in a Chinese
hospital, claiming it was an organ transplant operation using a
kidney from an executed prisoner, the public health official
said. However, the documentary clearly shows the surgery was
carried out on the patient's chest instead of the stomach where a
kidney transplant operation should be, he said.
</P>
<P>
China cleared up the facts and exposed Wu's ill intentions
after the TV documentary was released and shown in some western
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the U.S. House of Representative held the
hearing on the eve of President Clinton's visit to China and then
invited Wu to bear witness.

<P>
However, the official said, a man calling himself Liu Jikun
published an article on June 20 in the Hong Kong Daily News which
said that, as a former prisoner, he knew that there could never be
a chance for freed prisoners or inmates to be present at
executions. Because of this, he said, it would be impossible for
the man to be an eyewitness as he testified.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that it was not accidental for some
people in the U.S. House of Representatives to "stage the farce."
Some forces hostile to China in the Untied States do not want to
see China grow strong, and do not want to see the healthy
development of China-US relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Worried About Fate of Hostages in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is worried about the fate of
three Serbs and a Serbia citizen of Bulgarian origin taken hostage
Thursday by the outlawed Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Radko Vlaikov, said that the Bulgarian
government has asked the International Red Cross, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees to look into the incident.
</P>
<P>
Among the four kidnapped was Stamen Genov, a 24-year-old ethnic
Bulgarian from Bosilegrad in Serbia. He served as a military
doctor at the hospital of Djacovica, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the KLA armed men stopped the bus carrying Genov
and the three Serbs near the Crnoevo village and took them hostage.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's concern is humanitarian, said Vlaikov. "We are
worried about the fate of Dr Genov and the other hostages."
</P>
<P>
He said that the incident once again confirms the necessity for
the international community to be active in seeking a quick and
durable solution to the Kosovo conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the Ministry
of Public Health stated here today that human organ transplants in
China are conducted strictly on a voluntary basis and that the
majority of organs for this purpose are donated voluntarily by
citizens or the recipients' relatives.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to clear up what he called the slanderous
rumors of Harry Wu and an unidentified man at a recent U.S. House
of Representative hearing over organ transplants involving
executed Chinese criminals.
</P>
<P>
As a new field of modern medical science, human organ
transplants represent the cutting edge of advanced medical
technology that plays a big role in saving the lives of patients
in serious conditions, the ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
To advance China's medical scientific research and for
humanitarian purposes, the official said, some Chinese hospitals
and medical research institutes have experimented with human organ
transplant research and clinic practices involving such organs as
livers, kidneys, corneas and skeletons.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, the Chinese government has called for organ
donations from citizens on a voluntary basis. The late Chinese
statesman Deng Xiaoping, for example, stated in his will that his
corneas be denoted after his death, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese hospitals and medical research institutes began to
set up human organ banks in the 1980s to receive and keep donated
organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare in China to use the bodies of executed convicts or
organs from an executed convict," he said. "If there is any, it is
put under stringent state control and must go through standard
procedures."
</P>
<P>
A document issued jointly by the Supreme People's Court and the
Ministry of Public Health in the 1980s stipulates that hospitals
and medical research institutes can use the remains of the
executed convicts or their organs only with the voluntary
agreement and the signature of the convicts themselves or with the
consent of the convicts' relatives.
</P>
<P>
The use of such organs is limited to humanitarian purposes,
must undergo strict examination and be approved by the health
department and judicial department, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as organ donations are concerned, the convicts are
treated equally with other citizens," stressed the health
official.

BUENOS AIRES, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said today that the national football team played
excellently, even if it lost 2-1 to the Netherlands in the World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Menem acknowledged that the Netherlands was a great team, but
maintained that the Argentine squad should have not lost, in what
was the first official reaction after the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine public seemed to accept with stoicism the defeat,
despite the high hopes of reaching the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
There were no demonstrations or disturbances in this capital,
as those of June 30, when Argentina defeated the British team in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities took measures before today's match to
prevent any incident if the national team would win.
</P>
<P>
However, in the middle of the rain and with many policemen
deployed in the main streets of downtown Buenos Aires, the
atmosphere of sadness could be felt.
</P>
<P>
Julio Grondona, the Argentine Football Association president,
said from Marseilles, France, that at least it was important that
the national team was ranked among the best eight of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine football team starts its return Sunday to be here

<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Soccer legend Diego Maradona said the
Argentina team had been taught a lesson for their failure to "respect
traditional style of play."
</P>
<P>
"We didn't respect our origins nor our traditional style of play,"
Maradona blasted after Argentina lost to the Netherlands in the World
Cup quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina has tried to become a 'physical' European style team,
but is not able to choose between a physical game and technical
skill," added Maradona, who was in Marseille as a special commentator
for a television station.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we were disguised as Germans and the Netherlands as
Argentines. But you can say that the Netherlands taught us an
important lesson during this match."
</P>
<P>
He added: "From a physical point of view, yes, we are going home
with heads high. But that was not ture from a technical point of view.
Today, we played like, for example, a German team."
</P>
<P>
"You have to 'feel' football, and today, Argentina didn't 'feel'
the match," Maradona concluded.
</P>
<P>
He said Dennis Bergkamp, who scored the winner against Argentina,
was one of the players most impressed him.
</P>
<P>
"The players that have most impressed me are Michael Owen,
Bergkamp, and Rivaldo who've had an excellent World Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
Maradona said he would like to end his soccer career as a coach
for a Engllish club.

to end my career as coach for an English club."

MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Dutch player Phillip Cocu said on
Saturday that he believed his team would beat Brazil in the World Cup
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we can beat Brazil in the semi-final," he said. "We
should try to pressure them as the Danish did last night. If, on the
other hand, we play against them as we did against Argentina, we could
easily put their game off."
</P>
<P>
Captain Frank De Boer said the Netherlands have to look out for
Rivaldo, who scored for Brazil against Denmark in another quarterfinal
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Against Brazil we will have to be very watchful of Rivaldo. I feel
very good not too tired, but the Brazilians will definitely have an
advantage over us, having one more day of rest than we do," De Boer
said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't believe Brazil is any better than Argentina, and
since we are in good shape, we can beat anyone."

<HEADLINE> Passarella: Loss May Due to Stamina Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentina coach Daniel Alberto
Passarella said the lack of stamina might be one of the problems for
their loss to the Netherlands in the World Cup quarterfinals on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There were two Argentina teams, one in the first half and one in
the second," he said. "I think that it is more a question of physical
condition than of ball control."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We did not completely recover after the extremely
intense match against England. Other than the fact that we had one
less day of rest than our adversary, it is natural that we confront
more difficult teams as we advance in the competition."
</P>
<P>
As to the foul that earned a red card for Arnaldo Ortega, he said:
"It was an unfortunate foul that I did not see clearly. I can't say
whether or not there was a penalty, but it deprived us of one of our
players and allowed the Dutch to score."
</P>
<P>
He added: "As I've already said many times, our objective was to be
among the top four teams. We were not able to accomplish this, but we
played very well anyway."

MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Dutch coach Guus Hiddink that his
side apparently had an edge over Argentina in their 2-1 quarterfinal
win here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We know that we are physically very strong because we had a long
preparation stage in Switzerland and Holland, which was very well
done," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, it's good to have some players who don't have
the fatigue of the tournament, and the combination of those two things
is very important."
</P>
<P>
Hiddink added: "I thought it was a good game which we could almost
totally dominate, although there was always the danger of their key
players."
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to their semifinal clash against
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we would like to enjoy this enormous success, and then
we'll start thinking about Tuesday. We're looking forward to that
game, because we know Brazil and they know us. It will be a very
interesting contest."

JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed and
six others injured Friday night when gunmen opened fire at a bar
in Richmond, Kwazulu-Natal, South African media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead was Richmond deputy mayor, Percy Thompson, SABC
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, four to eight in number, arrived at the bar in two
vehicles at about 7.50 p.m. (1750 GMT). They walked inside and
began firing indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the crime. But the
ruling African National Congress (ANC) Saturday blamed the
killing on the work of a "third force."
</P>
<P>
Violence in the region had claimed 58 lives in 1997.

<TEXT>

<P>
LYON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Croatia scored a comfortable 3-0
victory over the aging German team in a quarter-final match here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German team started the match strongly and forced a corner
in their first attack. Dietmar Hamann and Oliver Bierhoff both had
scoring chances in the first half but Hamann headed the ball over
the crossbar while Bierhoff's header was saved by Croat goal-keeper
Drazen Ladic.
</P>
<P>
Christian Worns' send-off in the first half came as a turning
point for Croatia and they immediately fought forward to take over
the domination.
</P>
<P>
Robert Jarni opened the scoring for Croatia in the injury time
of the first half. They continued to explore the weakness of the
German team in the second half as Goran Vlaovic and Davor Suker each
added one to seal up the perfect victory.
</P>
<P>
Germany's top marksmen Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff
failed to show their usual flair in front of a tough Croat defence
line.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, taking part in their first World Cup finals, will take
on hosts France in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
For the German team, it was the second stright time they were

<HEADLINE> Argentina Lacks Concentration: Veron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's loss in the World Cup
quarterfinal against the Netherlands was partly due to their lack of
concentration, Argentine player Juan Veron said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We could have put more pressure on the Netherlands team, but we
did not. Moreover, we lacked concentration," said Veron.
</P>
<P>
Veron refused to comment on the sending off of Ariel Ortega but
said the expulsion "came at the wrong time."
</P>
<P>
He added, "The match against England tired us considerably and we
had less than one day to rest, but we are not making excuses.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I regret not being able to continue in the competition,
but we did our best. We gave our maximum effort."
