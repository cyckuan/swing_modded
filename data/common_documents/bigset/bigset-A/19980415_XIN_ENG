<HEADLINE> French FM Backs Investigation Without Taboo on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that the investigation on the role played
by France in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda should be "accomplished
without taboo."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly "Jeune Afrique," Vedrine also
expressed hope that investigation will be carried out "with
strictness and objectivity."
</P>
<P>
"This is worthy for the policy and the acts of the leaders of
Rwanda of that time, but also for those of the United Nations, the
neighboring countries of Rwanda, the members of the Security
Council and other European countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also worthy for France, because it will show
what France has done or tried to prevent in that region,
particularly since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"This work will not be really illuminating unless it looks at
the events in their long perspective, at least since the
independence of the former Belgian colony," he said.
</P>
<P>
A French parliamentary commission of information, presided by
former Defense Minister Paul Quiles, is investigating the policy
under President Francois Mitterrand toward Rwanda prior to and
during the 1994 genocide, in which one million Tutsis were killed
by Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been organizing hearings and will summon
members of the former staff of the Elysee presidential palace
under Mitterrand to testify about the policy of France at that
time.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Calls for Lifting Sanctions Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) Tuesday called for lifting sanctions
against Burundi to allow a free flow of trade with the country,
reported the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against Burundi should be lifted because the country
has met the required conditions, said Enoch Kavindele, Chairman
of the COMESA Council of Ministers at a meeting here attended by
visiting Burundian Commerce Minister Gregoire Banyiyezako and the
ambassadors of member countries to the Lusaka-based regional
body.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele, who is also Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, said that COMESA regarded Burundi as an important
trading partner, but the sanctions are hindering Burundi from
trading with other COMESA states freely.
</P>
<P>
The remarks followed an earlier statement from Banyiyezako
which said that economic sanctions imposed on Burundi are having
a negative effect on commerce, trade and industry of the country
and that they should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, a member state of COMESA, was sanctioned by countries
in the Great Kakes Region after a military coup in July 1996 in
which former president Ntibantunganya was ousted.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Banyiyezako who is on a week-long visit to
Zambia, said it is time for the sanctions to be lifted because
his country has met the conditions set by the leaders in the
Great Lakes Region.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Recruitment of Children should Be War Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Recruiting children into
the armed forces or sending them into combat situations of any
kind should be considered a war crime by the proposed
International Criminal Court (ICC), the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whether children are assigned to combatant or supposedly
non-combatant roles, they are vulnerable to the horror of war and
to manipulation by adult soldiers and commanders," UNICEF's
Executive Director Carol Bellamy said. "To allow this to continue
would constitute a complete violation of child rights."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is making its views now as a contribution to ongoing
public debate which will culminate in formal consideration of the
ICC at a conference in Rome this June.
</P>
<P>
The proposed court would consider cases that involve alleged
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It would be a
permanent international body, rather than an ad hoc tribunal, such
as those established by Security Council resolutions in Rwanda and
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are bitterly disappointed that the international community
has not yet adopted an optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CRC) to raise the minimum age of military
recruitment from 15-18," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF also stressed that the proposed ICC should act against
recruitment regardless of whether children are used as front-line
combatants or in support roles, such as messengers, drivers or in
other capacities.
</P>
<P>
In conflicts in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, UNICEF has worked to extricate children
from combat situations and to assist demobilized child soldiers.
It is estimated that on any given day there are 250,000 children
under the age of 18 involved in armed conflicts around the world.

<HEADLINE> Banking Merger Speculation Boosts Australia Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market shot
to record levels on Tuesday as the banking sector was ignited by a
surge of takeover and merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed at 2,840.9, both a record
closing and an all-time high, as United States banking mergers
prompted thoughts of a consolidation of the local industry or a
foreign takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
The new closing high eclipsed the previous record of 2,813.5
reached on Wednesday last week.
</P>
<P>
"It was bank mania in the market today. Obviously the mergers
in the U.S. have set the standard for our performance today," Jack
Moss from Shaw stockbroking said.
</P>
<P>
While overseas buyers entered the market on expectation of a
market shake-out, lingering anticipation of an interest rate cut
and low bond yields also added to the attraction of banking
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds &AMP; Co broker Steve Negrine said huge buying support for
the banking stocks from overseas was driven by the announcement of
the mergers in the U.S. financial sector overnight.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. was again the most
marked riser among the four major banks, with a 46 cent gain to
11.80 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the other majors, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 35
cents to 19.15 Australia dollars, National Australia Bank added
six cents to a record close of 22.78 Australian dollars and
Westpac bank rose 28 cents to 11.03 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The four major banks are prevented from merging under the
Australian federal government requirements but there had been talk
in the market that such regulation could be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
St. George Bank and the Colonial banking group were other major
movers on Tuesday, with St. George jumping 39 cents to 9.75
Australian dollars and Colonial rising 26 cents to 5.68 Australian
dollars while Macquarie Bank gained 62 cents to 15.12 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moss said the encouragement from the surging banking sector
spread to other stocks as buyers sought value away from the
expensive leaders.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 66.6 points higher at 4,904.5.
</P>
<P>
Patrick stevedores parent Lang Corp climbed another 31 cents to
2.46 Australian dollars on investor approval of progress in the
waterfront labor battle.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 9.2 points higher at 1,189.7.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP rose 5.6 cents to 15.30 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index rose 13.6 points to 1,302.0. The Australian
bullion price closed on Tuesday at 308.55 U.S. dollars, unchanged
from locally late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for Tuesday was 269.21 million shares at a
value of 584.42 million U.S. dollars, with rises outnumbering
falls 624 to 496.

<HEADLINE> German Construction Workers Strike for Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 14,000 construction workers
downed tools Tuesday for a 4 percent wage rise for about 830,000
employees in the western German building sector.
</P>
<P>
The strikes came before a crucial round of wage negotiations
between the employers and the construction workers' trade union IG
BAU scheduled for Wednesday in Mainz.
</P>
<P>
The employers expected a number of concessions from the trade
union in return for the wage rise. However, the IG BAU threatened
to stage larger demonstrations if the talks ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers also staged strikes Tuesday in many
construction sites in eastern Germany where wage talks have also
been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The next round of negotiations for the eastern German
construction sector, which employs about 340,000 workers, is
scheduled for April 23.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops by Nearly One U.S. Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled
almost one U.S. cent on Tuesday as interest rate cut speculation
gripped Australian foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency closed at 65.00 U.S. cents, from 65.93
cents on Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Darrin Stewart, an Australia foreign exchange expert, said the
Australian dollar's fall on Tuesday was because of interest rate
cut speculation.
</P>
<P>
"The futures market is pumped up for an easing in rates over
the next couple of days," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last altered monetary
policy on July 30, 1997, when it moved to cut the cash rate to
5.00 percent from 5.50 percent, the fifth official reduction in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
But Stewart said the foreign exchange market may not want to
get too short too quickly, on the basis it would be nearing
territory which could spark action by RBA.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last intervened in the foreign exchange market on
January 9 when the Australian dollar slumped to an 11-year low of
63.20 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was at 84.33 yen from a close
of 86.71 last Thursday, and at 1.1843 marks from 1.1982.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Files Challenge to EU Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen AG has filed a legal challenge to a record fine imposed
by the European Commission to punish its alleged illegal marketing
practices, the company said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen spokesman Hans-Peter Blechinger said on Tuesday that
the company had a strong case with the complaint which it brought
to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg last week.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission imposed the 102 million Ecu (112.2
million U.S. dollar) fine on Volkswagen on January 28 after ruling
that the German carmaker had broken EU regulations by barring its
Italian dealer from selling Volkswagen cars to German and Austrian
residents who sought to take advantage of the price differences in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The fine is the largest ever imposed by the European Commission
on a single company.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen, however, denied any wrongdoings and accused the
Commission of mounting a political war against the German company.
</P>
<P>
The company also argued it had only asked its Italian dealer
not to sell VW and Audi cars to unauthorized dealers, and
therefore it had not barred sales to authorized dealers and
private buyers from Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, however, insisted that it had hard
evidences about Volkswagen's offense against the EU common-market
rules, which state that consumers can buy whatever they want
wherever they want within the EU at whatever price they find it.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian prosecutor said
on Tuesday that he would investigate the killing of Mohammed
Anqawi suspected of collaborating with Israel, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Wally Daddaly, alleged that Anqawi was killed
by security agents of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Anqawi, 37, was found dead last week near the West Bank city of
Ramallah, the radio said, adding that there were nine bullet holes
in his body.
</P>
<P>
He is said to be gunned down on his way to a Palestinian
security office in the city for an interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has yet to release information on Anqawi's death.
Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group also has claimed that
Anqawi was killed by agents of Palestinian intelligence service
while he was heading toward its office.
</P>
<P>
The group said that Anqawi, suspected of collaborating with
Israel, was arrested by the Palestinian Preventive Security Force
on April 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
But he was not convicted or put on trial, but set free after
20 days in detention, the human rights group said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Leftist Rebels Declare Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine's leftist rebel
group, the National Democratic Front (NDF), on Tuesday declared a
30-day ceasefire effective later this month, the official
Philippine Television said.
</P>
<P>
Luis Jalandoni, a leader of the NDF led by the Communist Party
of the Philippines, was quoted as saying that the truce would take
effect in late April after President Fidel Ramos issues a formal
order for the release of more than 100 "political prisoners."
</P>
<P>
He said some of the prisoners might be released immediately
after Ramos issues his order, while the others could be freed
later after pending cases against them are resolved.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that all political prisoners could
be effectively freed before Ramos steps down in June when his
six-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
The government has denied there were political prisoners in the
country, but said it would release some NDF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire was announced just before a visit to Manila by
NDF exiled leader Jose Maria Sison later this month to witness the
formal signing of an agreement on human rights and international
humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, a breakthrough reached between the NDF and
Manila after years of talks, was initialed last month by the two
sides in the Hague, the Netherlands, where many NDF leaders live
in exile.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the three accords that the NDF and the government
have been negotiating prior to a final peace settlement to end
decades of NDF insurgency in the country. The two sides will soon
start talks on economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government ordered a 90-day unilateral
ceasefire to encourage NDF members to participate in the May 11
presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Export Earnings to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's earnings from tobacco
export this year will drop by an estimated two billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (about 121 million U.S.Dollars) if the current low prices
continue to hog the local market, the Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association (ZTA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here, ZTA President Robert Webb
said if the prices being offered by buyers at the country's three
tobacco auction floors don't improve, foreign currency earnings
from the crop will fall from a projected nine billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (545 million U.S. Dollars) to seven billion Zimbabwean
Dollars, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
''The current trend of low prices will not only affect farmers
but the country's balance of payments as well since export
earnings from the crop will be reduced,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although ZTA had been aware of impending soft
prices this year following a visit to major European
manufacturers of tobacco, it did not expect the prices to be as
low as they are.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's tobacco marketing season opened on March 31 and the
average price was pegged at 1.42 U.S. Dollars a kilogram at the
beginning of last week. At the same time of last year, average
price was over 1.6 U.S.Dollars a kg.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia hoped that the forthcoming visit to Afghanistan by U.S.
special envoy Bill Richardson would play a positive role in
restoring peace in the war-torn country, a senior Taliban official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, is
due to visit Afghanistan Friday and hold talks with the Taliban
who control about two thirds of Afghanistan, and the rival
northern alliance which controls the remaining one third.
</P>
<P>
"I think this trip is significant," Abdul Kakim Mujahid, envoy
of the Taliban regime in Pakistan, told Xinhua in a telephone
interview Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important visit by a high-level U.S. delegation
to Afghanistan in 20 years," Mujahid said. "I hope that it will
play a positive role in the settlement of the Afghan issue."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the main issues to be discussed between the Taliban
and the U.S. envoy, Mujahid said: "I haven't yet received any
specific agenda of the forthcoming talks."
</P>
<P>
"But I hope the U.S. would admit the present realities in
Afghanistan, review its policies towards the Taliban and recognize
our government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson is expected to urge the Taliban and the northern
alliance to resolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He is also to discuss the human rights issue, particularly
restrictions on women imposed by the Taliban, and the obstacles to
U.N. operations in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> London Oil Price Dives on Oversupply Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) - Oil prices on the London market
staged another downward turn early Tuesday, still depressed by
concerns over the size of the glut in global supplies.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend futures for May loading were trading 27
cents down at 13.73 US dollars a barrel in early dealings Tuesday,
and prices for Brent are now down two dollars a barrel from the
peak of 15.82 dollars a barrel established after the deal of
output cut was reached by the world's main oil producers on March
22.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was still weighed heavily by concerns
of oversupply in spite of the agreement among world producers to
cut production.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that traders remained sceptical about the
accord which planned to reduce some 1.5 million barrels a day
(bpd) from the 75 million bpd global market.
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that even if the pledged cuts are met in
full, world markets could still remain in trouble due to the high
output level.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based International Energy Agency said Friday in its
monthly market report that supply exceeded demand by a hefty 1.5
million bpd in the first quarter of the year, leaving stocks to
build heavily when normally they are drawn down.
</P>
<P>
To make matter worse for oil producers, there was news Monday
that Iraq was planning to raise its oil exports in April to 1.58
million bpd from 1.22 million in March under the UN's oil-for-food
exchange.

<HEADLINE> Fear of Heroin Flood in UK After Seizures Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The amount of heroin seized by
British Customs officers last year had more than doubled that of
1996, according to new figures released by the Customs Service on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that a total of 1.7 tons of drugs were
seized last year, with a street value of more than 145 million
pounds (246 million U.S. dollars). The 1996 figure was 0.7 ton.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were issued ahead of a conference dealing with
abuse of drugs among young Asians in Britain. Drug workers say
they seem more likely to be addicted than their white
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say seizures represent only 15 percent of total
traffic and warn that Britain is being flooded with cheap heroin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British national anti-drugs coordinator Keith
Hellawell also warned on Tuesday of a heroin epidemic in the
country, with a dose of the drug available on the streets for the
same price as a pint of beer.
</P>
<P>
"We must conclude there is a greater availability of heroin on
our streets," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The service said much of the illegal traffic is Turkish heroin
smuggled overland through the Balkans. Customs chiefs say the drug
gangs see Britain as both market and warehouse for drugs destined
for Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Privatization Drive on Track: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of the Public
Business Sector Atef Mohamed Ebeid said Tuesday that Egypt's
seven-year-old privatization drive remains on track despite the
sweeping southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's privatization program is more mature now than ever...
the targets achieved are much higher than the targets set," the
minister in charge of privatization of more than 300 public
companies told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid blamed the Asian upheaval on mismanagement which resulted
in excessive building and investment, as well as reckless lending
and borrowing activities. The financial system itself should be
"smarter" to steer away from such turmoil, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he said Egypt neither is feeling the negative impact of the
Asian crisis nor will impose any restrictions on foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be scared of foreign investment. (Because) only
when you invest irrationally and without preparation, will crisis
happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is
satisfied with Egypt's liberalization and privatization progress
and expects the trend to sustain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed a deal with the IMF in August 1996, hinging the
forgivenness of Egypt's last tranche of half of its debts owed to
the Paris Club on the implementation of privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid said Egypt no longer needs loans so it will not seek a
new agreement with the IMF when the current one expires in
August. Egypt's short-term foreign debts are below 10 percent of
its foreign reserves, which now stand at 20.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It is a story of success between us. And we are to keep up a
new, strong partnership," he said, adding that Egypt will seek the
organization's consultancy instead of financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid said Egypt is privatizing an average of four companies a
month and altogether 87 companies have been restructured or sold
and nine have been offered to strategic investors since the
program was first implemented in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Being reluctant to privatize vital sectors, Egypt finally moved
to sell, in late 1997, its utilities sector including power
plants, airports, seaports, which had been off-limits to private
and foreign hands since 1965.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid estimated the revenues from privatization this year at
7-8 billion pounds (2.06-2.35 billion dollars). The government
demanded that the sum be equally divided and channeled into
repayment of debts, early retirement program and the state coffer.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the government will not be responsible for the
debts of the companies to be sold, nor will it provide any
guarantee for the losses. "The business enterprises are 100
percent independent," Ebeid stressed.
</P>
<P>
Public sectors owed 26.9 billion pounds (7.91 billion dollars)
in debts to banks in 1996, and at the same time were owed 41.7
billion pounds (12.27 billion dollars) by the government and their
private and public clients in the forms of credits and goods.
</P>
<P>
Government debts alone accounted for 55.8 percent, according a
report of the Cairo Accounting Authority.
</P>
<P>
It is these huge debts owed to public companies that led to
chronic crisis of cash liquidity in companies, forcing them into
overdrawing money from banks, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks to Change World Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States would seek
to change the "the architecture of the international financial
system" during the spring meeting of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), said U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Brookings Institute, Rubin said he hopes the
world financial officials this week will push for reforms that
would force private investors to take greater losses in future
financial crises such as the one that shook Asia.
</P>
<P>
The financial officials of the IMF member countries will gather
at the fund's Washington headquarters starting on Wednesday to
focus on the Asian financial crisis that started in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
He called for changes in "the architecture of the international
financial system," including "effective mechanisms for creditors
and investors to more fully bear the consequences of their
actions."
</P>
<P>
Asian crises have been blamed on the flood of money poured into
unprofitable commercial real estate projects and government
protected cartels.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the rescues of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea
have complained that government money is bailing out investors
unjustifiably.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said IMF assistance "is essential in providing countries
the breathing room they need to stabilize their currencies,
restore market confidence and resume growth."
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking assurance that private investors bear
more risk, Rubin called for international surveillance of
countries' financial regulators to "induce national authorities to
bring their practices up to internationally acceptable levels."

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends to Extend Mandate of MINURSO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
a further period of three months until July 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said during the
months of December 1997 and January 1998, the spirit and space of
the identification process generated hope that the target date of
completing it by May 31, 1998 could be met.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said however, it is now unlikely that
this goal will be achieved due to the slowdown on identification
activities in February and March and to the lack of progress in
resolving issues linked to the identification of applicants from
the three tribal groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Annan said, the climate of mutual mistrust has not
been conducive to expediting and facilitating MINURSO"s task, and
the current tension may increase as completion of the
identification process approaches.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief urged the both Morocco and the POLISARIO Front to
cooperate fully, in accordance with the commitment which they
freely entered into. He also called on the two sides to cooperate
fully with his special Representative and the Identification
Commission so that the identification process may move froward.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the present situation, the months of May and June
will be critical for determining whether the identification of all
the applicants that remain to be convoked can be completed by the
end of July and whether a solution can be found to the problem of
the three tribal groups.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Backs Convening of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official said here Tuesday that Jordan supports the convening of
an Arab summit to deal with current "Arab issues," especially the
long-stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit must be properly prepared and the concerned
parties in the Arab World be invited to attend it in order to
reach results that will back the Palestinian position, said Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the "Voice of Palestine" Radio, he
said the summit should support the Palestinian position because it
responds "positively" to the international peace efforts led by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the summit should also contribute to
pressing Israel to live up to its commitments with the
implementation of the signed accords with the concerned countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit was called for earlier this month by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. He proposed to the 22-member
Arab League to hold an urgent session to discuss the deadlock in
the peace process and Israel's refusal to implement agreements
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
last March when Israel began to construct a Jewish neighborhood in
Arab East Jerusalem despite world outcry.

<HEADLINE> Angola's State-Owned Sector Produces 432,170 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Geology and
Mines Marcos Samondo said Tuesday that Angola's formal mineral
sector produced about 432,170 carats of diamond in 1997, earning
the country 120 million U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Samondo revealed this figure at the National Conference on
Mines opened here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that the diamond output of the
informal sector amounted to 882,000 carats, valuing 239 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Samondo urged that strict measures must be
taken to control the exploitation of the mineral resources in the
country. He said that anarchic exploitation of diamond has led
to serious outflow of foreign exchange and fatted some
individuals' wallets.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has given priority to the mineral
sector in its three-year (1998-2000) plan for economic stability
and revitalization, Samondo said, adding that it is necessary to
draw foreign investments and put emphasis on personnel training
so that the mine industry of Angola could be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will focus on the revitalization of
Angola's formal mineral sector, will end on April 27.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country is rich in mieral resources. So
far, 150 mines of various minerals have been found in the
country.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Sharif Killed by Hamas Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Tuesday reiterated that Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif was killed by his fellow members in
an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, PNA Cabinet secretary general, said that
Sharif was murdered because he refused to construct a car bomb to
avenge Israeli attack on Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan
last September.
</P>
<P>
Rahim make the remarks while informing PNA legislators in a
closed session in the West Bank city of Ramallah over the
investigation of Sharif's death. The bombmaker was shot to death
and his body was dumped into a car that exploded on March 29 in
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas rejected the findings of the PNA investigation,
blaming the PNA for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's
killing. The Islamic radical group said it would carry out its own
investigation into Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Tuesday, Rahim also objected notions that
Palestinian territories are on the verge of civil war between the
PNA and Hamas, according to a report by the Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian top negotiator Saeb Erekat emphasized
that there is only one Palestinian authority, that is the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after Tuesday's session, he said "we
welcome political pluralism but we'll never tolerate authority
pluralism."
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials have insisted that the PNA would
not tolerate any question about its investigation over Sharif's
death.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment to See New Record in 1998, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's average annual
unemployment is most likely to post a new record high in 1998
despite the continuing export boom, said a German job market
research institute on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Nuremberg-based German Job
Market and Occupation Research Institute, Germany would see 4.46
million people out of work on average in 1998, some 80,000 more
than last year.
</P>
<P>
The projection was based on an estimated economic growth of
2.75 percent, which the institute said was the most likely for
1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the best scenario when the economy grew by 3.25 percent
this year, the average annual unemployment would be 4.36 million,
the institute said. Under the worst scenario with an economic
growth of only 2.25 percent, the average jobless total would be
4.52 million.
</P>
<P>
The estimates conformed with expectations of most analysts that
Germany's export-led economic upswing is unlikely to reduce
joblessness significantly as companies vie with each other to cut
costs and improve international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The record-high unemployment has become a main rebuff for
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl who is running against Social
Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder to win the
national elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
As a new setback for Kohl, Germany's main trade union
federation DGB announced on Tuesday that it would launch a
national placard and advertisement campaign for job creation as
well as for power change in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Kohl's ruling coalition accused the DGB of
intervening in politics by publicly campaigning for the opposition
parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi Tuesday called for close cooperation
among the regional countries to help end the civil war in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During the second round of talks with Iranian special envoy on
Afghanistan Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Brahimi said that the close
cooperation of the regional countries is a requisite for restoring
peace and tranquility in Afghanistan, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy stressed that the U.N. is serious in restoring
peace in Afghanistan, adding that cooperation between the U.N. and
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) will help ease
the critical situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lauding Iran's efforts in resolving the Afghan crisis, Brahimi
said that Iran's active participation in the U.N. six-plus-two session
has resulted in close cooperation among the countries neighboring
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The six-plus-two group, which has been appointed by the U.N. to
help settle Afghan issue, includes six countries neighboring
Afghanistan, and the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian special envoy voiced Iran's interests in settling
the Afghan crisis, saying that the continued war in Afghanistan
harms the interests of the country, the world of Islam and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Iran, as the current OIC chairman, has encouraged the
organization to take further steps to solve the Afghan crisis, the
Iranian envoy said.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the two sides also expressed concern over
the possible escalation of military operations in Afghanistan and
denounced violation of basic rights of the Afghan people, women in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here Saturday from Islamabad, Pakistan, for a
three-day visit to explore ways of ending the Afghan civil war.

IGAD Charter provides a key forum for the harmonization of
policies with regard to transport in order to promote foreign,
regional, cross-border and domestic trade and investment,
Ethiopian Vice Minister of Transport and Communications Ayenew
Bitewelegne said at the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said that coordination is likely to be centered on
sub-regional and regional level in the implementation of
international maritime conventions, the harmonization of
documentation and the safety of coastal navigation.
</P>
<P>
There is urgent need for expanding the capacity and rendering
it more efficient and competitive, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If railways are to retain their advantage for efficient
transport of freight over long distances, said Bitewelegne, then
there must be good coordination of regional customs at transfer
points.
</P>
<P>
Peki Kana Kwala, Director of Eastern Africa Sub-Regional
Development Center (EASRDC) of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA), said at the meeting that it is proposed to
formulate national and sub-regional transport strategies to link
up IGAD countries with access to the sea and the landlocked
states.
</P>
<P>
EASRDC and the regional cooperation and integration division
of ECA have been assigned responsibility for cooperation with
regional economic communities in a bid to enhance the process of
regional cooperation in Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Introduce Doorstep Letter Box Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian postal service
said Tuesday that it would soon launch a doorstep letter box
service in the country.
</P>
<P>
Getahun Atnafu, head of the Postal Training Center of the
Ethiopian postal service, told local journalists here that the
new service would enable groups of customers to receive letters
near their living or business areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the service standard of the Universal Postal Union, a
post office is required to serve up to 5,000 people. In Addis
Ababa, however, each post office provides service to up to
104,000 people, which is the major factor that necessitated the
introduction of the new service, Getahun said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, customers of the service will also
be introduced with post codes that represent their particular
area as part of their postal address.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69,067 mail boxes are now in service in Ethiopia,
and 63.4 percent of them are found in the capital, Getahun noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Imposes Duties on Norwegian Salmon Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
announced Tuesday that its ministers have imposed definitive
anti-dumping duties on imports of farmed salmon from 24 Norwegian
companies.
</P>
<P>
The decision, published in the EU's Official Journal, extends
duties on most of the 29 Norwegian companies targeted for
provisional anti-dumping duties by the European Commission last
December while removing a few companies from the list.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 0.32
ECU (0.35 U.S. dollar) per kilogram and a definitive
countervailing duty, used to counter subsidies, of 3.8 percent on
farmed salmon exported to the EU by the 24 Norwegian exporters.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body, which imposed four-month provisional
duties last December, accused the exporters of breaking an
agreement to end a row over EU imports of Norwegian salmon.
</P>
<P>
The 24 companies hit with definitive duties represent only a
small part of Norway's total salmon exports to the EU of about
five billion crowns (690 million dollars) a year.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Electricity Consumption Rises by 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's electricity consumption
rose by 9 percent during the past Iranian year (ending March 20)
from 8.8 percent in the previous year, Iranian Energy Minister
Habibollah Bitaraf announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the evening daily Resalat, Bitaraf said in Yazd,
Iran's central province of Yazd that the figure was much higher
than the target of five percent projected in the country's second
five-year development plan (1995-2000) and indicated a growing
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, only around 34 percent of the total consumed
electricity was spent on the country's industrial units, much
lower than the level in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Energy Minister Mohammad Maleki said that
Iran's electricity production during the past Iranian year stood
at 94 billion kilowatt-hours and of that 80 billion
Kilowatt-hours were consumed.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the total amount of consumed electricity, 28
billion Kilowatt-hours was used by industrial sector, 8 billion
Kilowatt-hours by agricultural sector and the rest 44 billion
Kilowatt-hours by others.
</P>
<P>
In January, an official put Iran's annual energy consumption
at 12-15 billion U.S. dollars, saying that energy waste each year
stood at around 4 billion dollars because of the large amount
of subsidies by the government.

<HEADLINE> Botha's Case Postponed to Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The case against former
South African president P. W. Botha for defying a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) subpoena was postponed till
Wednesday, South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Botha appeared before the George Magistrates' Court in the
Western Cape Province Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The case was originally postponed for one hour but talks
between the TRC and Botha's legal team dragged the postponement
on till 3:36 p.m. (1336 GMT)
</P>
<P>
The two parties were seeking an out-of-court settlement to the
standoff between the 82-year-old former president and the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bruce Morrison warned that he had been instructed
by Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn to go ahead with the
prosecution, but that there was little point in doing so late in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kahn had also made it clear that unless the
parties reached a definite agreement before 8:00 a.m. (0600 GMT)
Wednesday, the prosecution would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
He told the court that it appeared that the parties were very
close to an agreement, but there was none finally.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated that the two parties would finally
reach an agreement under which the TRC would withdraw its
criminal charges against Botha while the latter would agree to
appear before the commission to testify on the role of the former
State Security Council.
</P>
<P>
TRC chairman Desmond Tutu said after the adjournment in the
morning that all his commission wanted was for Botha to appear
before it.
</P>
<P>
"We do not seek to humiliate him, we do not seek to prosecute
him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Botha's advocate Lappe Laubscher also said, "As far as my
client is concerned there was never a blanket refusal to
cooperate with the TRC."
</P>
<P>
Botha told an Afrikaans newspaper in mid-November, 1997 that
he would rather be prosecuted than appear before the TRC. He
later repeatedly reaffirmed his decision not to cooperate with
the TRC.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Three Submarines Conduct First Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's three submarines for the
first time are joining a naval exercise held in the Persian Gulf,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The submarines conducted special tactics on Monday to counter
under-water threats of hypothetical enemy and passed through
areas under surveillance by enemy's fighters without being
intercepted, spokesman for the exercise Abdullah Ma'navi said.
</P>
<P>
The submarines fired live ammunition, which hit the targets
both on the ground and under the water, Ma'navi, also deputy
commander of the Iranian Navy, said.
</P>
<P>
Of the three submarines Iran bought from Russia, the first was
delivered in 1992 and the last in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran started the nine-day naval exercise in and out of the
Strait of Hormuz on Sunday. Besides the three submarines, two
frigates, two personnel carrier vessels, two logistic vessels and
teams of frogmen and 15,000 troops of the navy and air force took
part in the war games, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ma'navi said that speedboats, frogmen and special task forces
carried out operations to control ships' movements and jet
fighters destroyed units of the hypothetical enemy and safely
returned to the bases on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that refueling operations were also carried out
successfully in the war game.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Ticket Decision by World Cup Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Tuesday welcomed the
decision by the French World Cup organizers to sell most of the
remaining tickets without discriminating against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee CFO said on Friday that it would open
telephone sales in Europe for the remaining 110,000 tickets on
April 22 on a first come first served basis.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the EU said the decision did not
resolve a dispute over the way the bulk of the 2.5 million tickets
printed for this summer's finals were sold.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive, reacting to complaints from national
federations and disgruntled fans, asked CFO last month to make all
remaining tickets -- 160,772 -- available exclusively to European
fans outside France.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said this would be a "sporting" gesture to
compensate for discrimination in the first place.
</P>
<P>
However, CFO only offered to reserve a total of 50,000 tickets
for foreign federations.
</P>
<P>
While the Commission cannot legally force CFO to discriminate
against French fans this time, it can fine the committee for the
way it handled the sales in the past if it concludes there had
been an infringement of EU fair competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The Commission received complaints from Belgium and the
Netherlands that they were not given enough tickets for the match
opposing both countries on June 13 and got similar complaints from
Britain, where both England and Scotland qualified for the finals.
</P>
<P>
CFO will announce on Friday the telephone numbers to ring to
buy the remaining tickets.

<HEADLINE> Duma Chairman Calls on Approval of Kiriyenko as PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Russian State Duma
(the lower house of parliament) Gennady Seleznyov on Tuesday said
that the Duma should approve Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov told a briefing after meeting with president Boris
Yeltsin that in his view, the fate of Russia is more important
than the fate of Kiriyenko, so he will make efforts to ensure the
Duma for its entire term.
</P>
<P>
He said if the new government does a bad work, the State Duma
can as well put forward its no-confidence motion to the government
a month after.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Yeltsin once again said he will insist on the
approval of Kiriyenko's nomination as the Russian prime minister.
"The president refused to consider other candidates to the post of
the government chairman and is prone to use his constitutional
right," Selenanyov said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin explained his insistence in the nomination of Kiriyenko
with the striving to involve young people in the country's
leadership, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma speaker, during the meeting with Yeltsin, conveyed to
the president a statement of the Duma Council sharply criticizing
Kiriyenko's candidature.
</P>
<P>
The statement reads that the confirmation of Sergei Kiriyenko's
candidacy for prime minister "may deepen socioeconomic problems,
and make the country even more unstable and authority even less
efficient and less respected."
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, all leaders of the Duma factions and
groups, except the Our Home is Russia faction and Russian Regions
group, backed the document.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma Tuesday decided to hold the second round of vote
on Kiriyenko's nomination on Friday, April 17.
</P>
<P>
The lower house failed to approve Kiriyenko as premier last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko was nominated by Yeltsin as prime minister soon after
he dismissed the entier government on March 23.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Jordan Backs Holding Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein said on
Tuesday that the kingdom supports the convening of an Arab summit
to discuss the long-stalled Middle East peace process, Jordan's
official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit is very necessary, especially at a time when the
peace process is stalled, Hussein told reporters after a cabinet
meeting. "Jordan is always for Arab meetings and supports
such meetings."
</P>
<P>
It is important to prepare for a successful summit, which can
result in a common Arab stand to serve the Arab cause, he said,
adding that peace and stability should be restored in the region
urgently.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called for an Arab summit
earlier this month. He proposed to the 22-member Arab League to
hold an urgent session to discuss the deadlock in the peace
process and Israel's refusal to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Hussein called on all the concerned parties to "focus on the
just and comprehensive peace that gives people their rights and
enables them to live in security."
</P>
<P>
Such a summit will be a step "in the right direction," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
March, 1997, due to Israel's settlement activities in East Arab
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Preservation of Cultural Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has called on the
international community to assist efforts for the protection of
some 200 monuments in the Turkish-controlled northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus made the call to mark the International Day of Monuments
which falls on April 18.
</P>
<P>
An announcement issued here Tuesday by the Ministry of
Communications says that out of 774 listed monuments on the
island, 197 are situated in the northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Access to these sites since 1974 has been impossible because of
the intransigence of the Turkish occupation regime which does not
allow inspection of the sites, the announcement adds.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The announcement points out that despite representations by
the Cyprus government to international organizations, the looting
and destruction of cultural heritage continues in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that a number of archaeological sites, medieval
and other monuments in the government-controlled southern part of
the island were well-preserved, which has won international
acknowledgment.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Tries More Junta Collaborators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of 14 permanent Sierra
Leoneans were taken to court Tuesday in the capital Freetown
while 21 others suspected to be collaborating with the defunct
military junta have already been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Former President Joseph Momo and the junta spokesman Aliu
Kamara are among the second batch of alleged junta collaborators,
who are to be charged with treason, according to a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the alleged junta collaborators began at the end
of March, about two weeks after the restoration of the elected
government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Those charged with treason and arson will face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Momo surprised many people as he
apparently had lost much weight when he appeared in court Tuesday
morning, while others remained silent.
</P>
<P>
All of them were presented by a group of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
However, the audience in the court, which was under tight
security, were reportedly in an angry mood as some people even
held that the former junta spokesman should be killed.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be charged on April 21 when trial of the
case is formally done, said the report, adding that all the
accused persons may have the chance of a third trial.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, investigations are going on to
find out junta members and collaborators among close to 200
persons, both military and civilian. Those who are not involved
will be released immediately.
</P>
<P>
The military junta, which toppled Kabbah's government in a
coup last May, was dislodged by the west African peace-keeping
force in mid-February, with the president regaining power on
March 10.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to penalize members and collaborators
of the junta regime for the nationwide destruction and chaos
caused by the coupists and those cooperated with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- In one of his last moves to push
France into adopting the European single currency, French
President Jacques Chirac will meet the Paris-based home and
international press corps on Thursday to speak on a whole set of
questions concerning Europe.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Elysee Presidential Palace said
Tuesday afternoon that Chirac will talk about the European Union
extraordinary summit to be held on May 2 in Brussels, described as
"a historic step in European construction" by the presidential
office of France.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels summit will officially determine the final list of
countries to join the European single currency and elect the
president of the future European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, the three Benelux countries, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland, Austria and Finland are expected to be among
those to adopt the euro in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will also address the
French National Assembly next Tuesday on euro, in a bid to
persuade a majority number of parliamentarians to support the
country's adoption of euro.
</P>
<P>
France's political parties are still divided over the launching
of euro in France, with many parliamentarians expressing fear that
the country's monetary independence will be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
When the National Assembly voted last week on the change of the
status of the Bank of France to subordinate to the ECB system, the
Communists, the Radical Socialists and some other leftwing
parties, as well as one fourth of the parliament members of the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic voted against the move.

LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia approved about 567 million
Dollars investment in the first quarter of this year compared to
273 million Dollars last year, a senior investment official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya Ngandu, director of the Zambia Investment Center, said
the achievement indicates that his country is beginning to
receive serious investors.
</P>
<P>
This trend also shows that investors are beginning to have
confidence in Zambia's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngandu also stressed the need to encourage more investments
because when big companies come to invest, they bring with them
other small companies which is good for a country's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with visiting Burundi
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Gregoire Banyiyezako.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi minister suggested that the TAZARA railway line
from Kasama be extended up to Mpulungu Harbor in north Zambia so
that goods could easily flow from South Africa to other
countries.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Study Evaluates Financial Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A new U.N. study found
that international financial liberalization brought more private
capital flows into emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case of Morocco, the study said after liberalizing
its capital account, the African country managed to offset the net
negative public flows of 1987-1991 with fresh private sources
during 1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
The study released by the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) on
Tuesday said the liberalization also provided more credit for
small businesses, with opportunities for more investment.
</P>
<P>
Another merit of the process is that it brings more incentives
for macro-economic stability, the study said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP experts found that the most successful countries are those
who managed to attract capital flows while putting into place
safeguards to reduce their destabilizing effects.
</P>
<P>
The study alerted to such risks as reduced domestic savings,
overborrowing, encouragement of excessive investment in the real
estate sector and stock market and a sudden reverse of short-term
inflows which pushes many banks and firms into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Among the suggestions for preventative measures put forward by
experts, the study said banks and financial institutions may be
required to be more transparent.
</P>
<P>
Central banks could require that a portion of loans or banks
deposits from non-residents be placed in non-interest bearing
accounts for up to a year, it said.

<HEADLINE> Seven More Officers Plead Guilty to Drug Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Three police officers and four
jail guards of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, have pleaded guilty to
conspiracy as a result of an Federal Bureau of Investigation sting
that led to the arrests of 44 officers.
</P>
<P>
Monday's pleas brought to 10 the number of people who have
admitted guilt, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, indicted in February along with nine civilians,
were accused of taking part in a security ring that they thought
was protecting cocaine sales for a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
But the "drug dealer" was really an FBI undercover agent, and
his sales were staged for the benefit of concealed microphones and
cameras.
</P>
<P>
Everyone arrested in the sting was charged with conspiracy to
distribute cocaine, which carries a maximum of 10 years to life in
prison. However, prosecutors offered most defendants shorter
sentences in exchange for guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Donald C. Nugent scheduled a hearing for
Wednesday, possibly to accept more guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the defendants were free on bail, although five
remained in custody, the report said.

PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Two government ministers of the
Democratic Republic of Congo were on a private visit in Paris on
Tuesday after they were refused entry by Belgium earlier, said a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Information and spokesman of the government of
D.R. Congo Raphael Ghenda, and the Minister of Public Function
Paul Kapita "could be received at their request" by senior
officials of the French Foreign Ministry, said spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Ghenda originally planned to go to Brussels on a mission of
"clarification and explanation" of the policy of D.R. Congo, but
he was denied a visa by the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
The move by Belgium came after the government of Kinshasa
accused Brussels of "terrorist practices" because of alleged
seizure of some weapons destinated for the Belgian consulate in
Lubumbashi in southern D.R. Congo.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Soldiers' Presence Denied in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Defense Minister
Aguiar Mazula Tuesday denied that there are Angolan soldiers in
Sofala Province, central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mazula made the denial here in parliament in reply to a
question raised by an MP from the Mozambique National Resistance
Movement (Renamo), the largest opposition in the country, the
Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there have been visits by Angolan military
officers to Mozambique since 1996, including an Angolan military
delegation headed by its Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao last
February.
</P>
<P>
"But they are here to exchange experiences especially in the
setting up of national army and in defense legislation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Demos, a weekly magazine in Mozambique, reported on April 1
that Afonso Dhlakama, president of Renamo, told the weekly that
about 15 Angolan soldiers had penetrated into the north and
central part of Mozambique aiming to sabotage the local elections
due on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Antonio de Carvalho, Angolan ambassador to
Mozambique, also denied the presence of any Angolan soldier in
Mozambique in a speech on April 9.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates No to Cyprus' Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday reaffirmed its
opposition to Cyprus' plan to deploy Russian anti-aircraft
missiles on the island, stressing that the missiles "will not be
allowed to enter the island."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying "Turkey
previously announced and stands firm on its stance that it would
not tolerate any deployment that would imperil the security of
Turkish Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's scheme to deploy the Russian S-300
missiles on the island is aimed at heightening its bargaining
counter in the Cyprus peace talks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement apparently served as a rejection of the remarks
made by U.S. special coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, that
there have been some changes in Turkey's position on Cyprus'
missile program.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with a Greek magazine, Miller said
that "Turkey has recently changed its rhetoric regarding the
S-300 missiles and does not speak any more of destroying them."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Turkish cabinet had demanded that
the military take measures to prevent deployment of the missiles,
and that appropriate measures are being implemented.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the Cypriot government decided to buy
Russian-made missiles, triggering strong reaction from both
Turkish Cypriots and their supporter, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara said these missiles will pose a direct threat to the
security of Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, and threatened to destroy
them if they are finally deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in the north in 1983, which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At present, both Turkey and Greece station troops on the
divided island.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President to Attend Second Summit of Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite of his failure to
obtain "fast-track" trade authority, U.S. President Bill Clinton
heads to Chile Wednesday to the Second Summit of Americas, hoping
to find a way to enhance the proposed free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president and the leaders of other 33 countries in the
Western Hemisphere plan to launch negotiations for a Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a move for which Clinton is
hobbled by political opposition, largely from members of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. labor unions and environmental groups, still unhappy
about the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) in Clinton's first term, are strongly resisting the
efforts to have more free-trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting in December 1994 in Miami, the 34
leaders agreed to a free-trade zone throughout the hemisphere by
the year of 2005 with "concrete progress" by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Second Summit in Santiago will be focused on education
issues, which will form a basket to itself. The other baskets
include: Making Democracy Relevant, Enjoying the Fruits of
Freedom, Building Our Wealth Through Economic Integration and
Trade, and Rejecting Poverty Amid Growing Prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration officials insisted that last year's
defeat to win Congress' support for "fast-track" authority would
not threaten the time-line for negotiating the FTAA, but said they
would continue seeking fast-track for its eventual use in FTAA
ratification.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have insisted the FTAA is critical because Latin
American nations, led by summit host Chile, have already begun
forming their own trading alliances.
</P>
<P>
The region's countries last year took 42 percent of all U.S.
exports, 286 billion U.S. dollars, up 17 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said Clinton's agenda for the visit
will also cover non-economic issues such as the war against drugs.
As part of Clinton's visit to Chile, which begins Thursday, the
U.S. president will travel to the port city of Valparaiso Friday
to address the National Congress.

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Tuesday a 13.1 million U.S. dollar loan for the Cesme-Alacati
water supply and sewerage project to improve the services in the
municipalities of Cesme and Alacati, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The project will bring about institutional development of the
Cesme-Alacati Union of Municipalities to promote municipal
services, and will increase efficiency of delivering water and
sewerage services through a contract with an experienced private
firm to provide the services on behalf of the union.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is some 24 million dollars equivalent
including contingencies. Apart from the World Bank loan, the
Cesme-Alacati union will contribute some 5.4 million dollars and
the Turkish Ministry of Tourism will commit 5.5 million dollars
for the project.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the World Bank in 1947, the bank commitments
total 25.94 billion dollars for 130 projects in the country.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says South Korea Recovers from Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Growth and international
confidence are returning to South Korea quicker after the
financial crisis than expected, said Managing Director Michel
Camdessus of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the quick recovery is that South Korea
fully implements an international rescue package, Camdessus told a
press conference one day before the Spring meeting of the IMF and
the World Bank opens in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing in Korea a remarkable phenomenon," said
Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
"President Kim Dae Jung is obtaining probably a quicker
recovery and regaining more quickly the international markets'
confidence than we expected," Camdessus told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis once saw South Korea's currency lose more
than half its value against the U.S. dollar, and forced corporate
bankruptcies and will likely push Korea's unemployment rate
sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and Seoul agreed last year to a rescue and reform
package valued at some 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that the remarkable success of the bond issuance
last week in South Korea shows the strength of the recovery of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that markets now have understood that Korea is
sticking to its program and has a wonderful potential for recovery
and for being rapidly in stronger growth conditions than before,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rally Held to Support Detained Tehran Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A crowd of people gathered in
front of the Tehran University here Tuesday afternoon to show
their support for the detained Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, a close ally of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was staged despite a call for restraint by
the Khatami government.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that most of the
demonstrators were young people who chanted slogans supporting
Karbaschi and marched towards the Interior Ministry, about one
kilometer away from the university.
</P>
<P>
The protest ended peacefully in front of the Interior Ministry,
IRNA said. There was no exact account of the number of
participants.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old mayor, who supported Khatami in his landslide
victory in last May's elections over hardline competitor, was
detained on April 4 by the judiciary on charges of embezzlement,
misappropriation of funds and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary, together with the Majlis (parliament), is
believed to be tightly controlled by the hardliners bloc.
Karbaschi's detention angered Khatami's supporters who regarded it
as politically-motivated aimed at weakening the government.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that top Iranian leaders were trying to reach
a compromise between the moderates and hardline factions, which
would ultimately lead to Karbaschi's release.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Equipment Arrive in N. Tanzania Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The operation to rescue
workers who were buried in a mine in Arusha in north Tanzania
four days ago has become easier after the arrival of more water
pumps, reports reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Daniel Ole Njoolay, Arusha Regional Commissioner,
several pumps have arrived in the mine area, and efforts to
airlift another three pumps with military planes are underway.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 miners were trapped as far down as 300 meters
after a downpour caused a landslide on April 10 in a tanzanite
mine in Mererani, some 40 km southeast of the Arusha town.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation has been in slow progress for lack of
pumps, bulldozers and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
A miner in Mererani, Peter Horsley, said the rescue team found
the fifth body Tuesday, despite the fact that authorities have
offered a list of 56 miners who are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
The death toll, however, could be higher since more miners
might have entered the area to work illegally, Njoolay said.
</P>
<P>
During the accident, 21 lucky miners were rescued by their
colleagues who responded to SOS calls.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are considering to deploy navy men equipped with
oxygen bags to retrieve the decomposing bodies because foul smell
has started to come out of the pits.
</P>
<P>
The site of the burial has already been fixed and religious
leaders have been contacted to give a fitting farewell. In
addition, medicine supplies and doctors have arrived.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay said special tents are being constructed for
identification and preservation of bodies until a mass burial is
announced.
</P>
<P>
He also said that 8.4 million Shillings (about 12,600 U.S.
Dollars) have been collected so far for the rescue operation and
burial.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Unveils Aviation Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
announced Tuesday new aviation safety plan including more rigorous
engine inspections and the mandatory installation of enhanced
ground-warning systems by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The new safety agenda was announced by Vice President Al Gore
at the Ronald Reagon Washington National Airport, the airport in
the capital city renamed recently in remembrance of former
President Ronald Reagon.
</P>
<P>
The plan was designed to cut the U.S. fatal accident rate by 80
percent over the next 10 years from the present one major accident
per 1 million flights.
</P>
<P>
With the number of passengers in the United States alone
expected to increase from 600 million to over 1 billion a year by
2010, the added number of flights could result in six or seven
major accidents annually by then.
</P>
<P>
However, the government wants to bring down the current rate of
three to four major accidents per year with new measures.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud that flying is already the safest way to travel.
The steps we are announcing will make the safest skies in the
world even safer," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The two priorities highlighted by Gore addressed critical
problems in the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
As airliners are increasingly using two engines to reduce
maintenance and fuel costs, simpler, more standardized inspections
are necessary to ensure the safety of the revolving components.
</P>
<P>
With the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, airliners
could reduce the chance of unintentional flight into the ground.
The "controlled flight into terrain" accounted for 25 percent of
all commercial airplane accidents worldwide from 1987 to 1996,
leading to 2,396 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The new systems compare a plane's location to a global database
of mountains. However, the current system, looking down to measure
altitude, is difficult to detect sharply rising mountains and
other impediments.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials accompanying Gore also used the appearance
to unveil several other safety goals, including steps to improve
safety within the flight cabin and to minimize passenger
interference with members of the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration also said it will back the
increase of passenger seatbelt use and may consider limiting the
size and number of passenger carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is part of a renewed emphasis on aviation
safety that followed the May 1996 ValuJet crash in the Florida
Everglades and the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off the New York
coast two months later.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton formed the White House Commission on Aviation
Security with Gore as the head. The commission has made a number
of recommendations including passenger profiling, installation of
explosive-detecting equipment and bag matching at airports to
reduce the chances of a bomb being brought aboard an airliner.
</P>
<P>
To back the government efforts, Congress boosted the FAA's 1998
budget by 785 million U.S. dollars, including about 100 million
dollars for security improvements.

OTTAWA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien will attend the Second Summit of the Americans in
Santiago, Chile, on April 18 and 19, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the Santiago summit, 34 leaders of the Western Hemisphere

"As a nation of the Americas, Canada is committed to working
with our hemispheric partners to build a prosperous and peaceful
region," Chretien was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Before the Santiago summit, the Canadian prime minister is
expected to meet with leaders of the Caribbean Community and

<HEADLINE> British Scholar Calls for Regulation of International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- There is a need for the
regulation of international financial markets given the fact of
globalization, a British scholar said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"With globalization, there is no difference between domestic
and international markets," said John Eatwell, President of
Queens' College, Cambridge, and member of the House of Lords of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) press function.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore why is international regulation regarded as a bad
thing when everybody accepts domestic regulation as a good thing
when we are talking about the same integrated market structure?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his views on the perspectives on international
financial liberalization, which is a UNDP study theme, Eatwell
said developed countries should bear the responsibility to work
together with their developing counterparts for regulation of
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
This is because most of the developing countries do not have
the financial infrastructure for the effective regulation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that national financial markets should be
regulated with regard to their transparency, prudential operation
and their conduct of business, he observed in his paper presented
to the UNDP study.
</P>
<P>
"If financial markets are liberalized there is no meaningful
distinction between national and international markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And if national markets should be regulated by a national
political authority then international markets should be regulated
by an international political authority," he added.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Imports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- France spent 85.6 billion francs
(14 billion U.S dollars) on oil from abroad in 1997, an 8 percent
rise over 1996, said State Secretary of Industry Christian Pierret
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spending increase was attributed to a rising U.S. dollar
and an increase of crude oil import.
</P>
<P>
France consumed about 237 million tons of oil in 1997, slightly
more than 1996, Pierret said.
</P>
<P>
France's energy industry produced the equivalent of 116 million
tons of oil, mainly in nuclear power stations, allowing the
country's self-reliance rate on energy to stand at slightly more
than 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pierret said that France would continue to seek security of
its short-term and long-term energy provision.
</P>
<P>
"France should seek to diversify its energy provision,
especially by developing renewable energy and controlling its
consumption of energy," he added.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Exerted to Move Cyprus Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. and others are trying
hard to overcome the current deadlock in Cyprus peace talks,
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Feissel was speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, during which, he said, they discussed
future steps on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a situation where things have been stuck for quite
a while and we all recognize that it is vital that we move things
forward and we make progress toward a settlement," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
He noted "the U.N. Secretary-General and others, like the U.S.,
have been working very hard to find a way out of this impasse and
we are hoping that these efforts will bear fruit in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official refrained from elaborating on possible ideas
and suggestions for breaking the current deadlock. "We hope that
we can work something out that everybody can buy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has ordered suspension of
bicommunal contacts since last December in retaliation for the
European Union's decision to start accession negotiations with the
Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said he had a meeting Tuesday with Denktash, during
which they discussed the exchange of visits by the people from the
two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the people from the two communities
meet, if that is their wish," the U.N. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greek Cypriot Presidential Commissioner on
Humanitarian Affairs Takis Christopoulos and Turkish Cypriot
representative Rustem Tatar will meet soon to discuss the issue of
missing persons.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement reached between Clerides and
Denktash on July 31, 1997, the two sides agreed to meet and
exchange information on missing persons.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots were listed as missing persons
soon after the 1974 Turkish invasion, while the Turkish Cypriot
side claims that around 500 Turkish Cypriots have been missing
since the intercommunal clashes that broke out in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which has been only recognized
by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Kaiserslautern Keeper Banned For Taking Steroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kaiserslautern goalkeeper Petr Kouba
was banned for four weeks by the German Soccer Federation's
disciplinary committee on Wednesday for taking a forbidden steroid
in a knee injury treatment.
</P>
<P>
Kouba received a prescribe containing an anabolic steroid banned
by soccer authorities, but he immediately informed his club after
he discovered the medication was banned.
</P>
<P>
The Czech was told by Kaiserslautern's club doctor that his
career would end after an operation on his injured knee. Then he
went to consult another doctor for alternative treatment.
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary committee ruled out Kouba's confession, saying
that Kouba should have told the club before he went for
alternative treatment and should have made his own enquiries about
whether any of the medicines were disallowed.
</P>
<P>
Kouba, who joined Kaiserslautern on loan from Spanish side
Deportivo Coruna before the start of the season, was told earlier
this month to walk away at the end of the season for his knee
injury, which hampered his performance on the pitch.

ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson will hold official talks with
Pakistani leaders Thursday on a wide range of issues, particularly
the Pakistani-Indian relations and the Afghan conflict, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who is heading a high-level delegation, arrived

Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and other Indian officials.
</P>
<P>
This is the second cabinet-level visit to Pakistan by a U.S.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Sending Experts to Help Fight Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central government
will send at least 700 fire experts to East Kalimantan in a major
move to fight the fires which have destroyed 262,000 hectares of
forests since January this year in the province, an official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director general for forestry conservation, Soemarsono, said
that everyone hopes the forest fires in the region will be totally
put out in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that estimated losses amount to 4 trillion rupiah
(500 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Soemarsono said thousands of fires continued to burn in the
province despite efforts to curb their advance.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rain since the middle of last year has left forest
and ground cover extremely susceptible to fires.
</P>
<P>
Water bombing, artificial rain-making and military support for
local fire-fighters have all failed to put out the fires.
</P>
<P>
Soemarsono said, however, that in the past few days East
Kalimantan has experienced rains. "Hopefully, that will help end
the forest fires."
</P>
<P>
Some environmental experts said the disaster has wiped out
valuable nature reserves and killed orangutans, deer and other
endangered jungle species.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of people in East Kalimantan are now
suffering serious health problems, especially respiratory
ailments, due to the thick smoke created by the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
A noted meteorologist has warned that unless the forest fires
were put out quickly, Indonesia might soon "re-export" thick haze
to neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore, as it did
for several months last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, heavy smoke from Sumatra and Kalimantan islands of
Indonesia covered wide parts of Southeast Asia for more than two
months, disrupting air and sea transport and causing health
problems for millions of people.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bo Hamburger of Denmark beat
Belgium's hopeful Frank Vandenbroucke to win Wednesday's cycling
race from Charleroi to Huy, known as the Fleche Wallone race.
</P>
<P>
The Dane grabbed the leading position away from Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert with some 15 kilometers remaining in the
201-kilometer race.
</P>
<P>
He then lurked in the leading pack of eight until the last five
kilometers. He then pedaled away on the final climb toward the
finish and clocked five hours 13 minutes 19 seconds, averaging
38.49 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Lead changed hands several times toward the finish when riders
had to attack a series of climbs including a 20-percent ascent
over a stretch of 3.4 kilometers that slowed down a couple of the
early leaders.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's race was held amidst a continuous drizzle.
</P>
<P>
Vandenbroucke, winner of last Wednesday's Gent-Wevelgem race
also in Belgium, finished second.
</P>
<P>
Hamburger's Casino teammate Alberto Elli from Italy came in
third behind Vandenbroucke.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert, who won the non-classic one-day race in 1995 and last
year, led the first of the closing attacks on a climb with some 25
kilometers left and once opened an 11-second gap from the chasing
pack.
</P>
<P>
In the 62 years of the race's history, altogether three men
have won the race three times. They are Marcel Kint and Eddy
Merckx, both of Belgium, and Maureno Argentin of Italy.

<HEADLINE> Intel's New Chips to Fuel Weak PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's No.1 chip
maker, will launch today its low-cost Celeron chip which is to be
used widely by the booming sub-1,000-dollar PC market, and its
fastest yet Pentium II chips for the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
The P-II chips will run at 350-MHz and 400-MHz, according to an
Intel spokesman. Intel has historically cut prices once every
quarter to make way for newer, faster processors, but it now cuts
prices at any possible time.
</P>
<P>
Intel reported Tuesday a 36 percent plunge in first quarter net
income Tuesday and surprised analysts with plans to cut 3,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
It said its earnings dropped to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, down
from 2 billion U.S. dollars, a year ago. Revenues fell to 6
billion dollars from 6.4 billion dollars a year earlier. It said
its expected revenues to be flat to slightly lower in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the job cuts and profits drop on
weaker-than-expected PC sales throughout the world, and a shift
in the industry to better inventory management for
build-to-order manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
While the computer industry remains one of the fastest-growing
in the U.S.A., tech companies have hit a speed bump with falling
prices, overcapacity and the Asian economic crisis, according to
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
Many expect the PC market to grow 13 percent to 15 percent
this year, down from 16 percent last year. The networking
industry is projected to grow 21 percent this year, down from 28
percent, market researcher Dataquest says.
</P>
<P>
Desktop PC prices have dropped 17 percent this year,
according to some newspaper report.

<HEADLINE> Officials Held Responsible for Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of officials held
responsible for this year's forest fires in north China's
Heilongjiang Province have either been criticized, demoted or
detained, according a provincial press conference.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, a major province in forest reserves, has recorded
a number of small-scale forest fires since the beginning of the
year. The fires have been attributed to either dereliction of duty
on the part of officials or farmers carelessly discarding lit
cigarettes in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Song Jianqiu, deputy director of the Zhanhe City Forestry
Bureau was severely criticized for a fire which destroyed some
18.5 ha. between April 3-6.
</P>
<P>
Zou Shuchun, the official directly responsible for a fire which
spread from a fire protection belt, has been placed in detention
for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Local experts warned of the great possibility for further fires
due to the dry Spring air, increasing commercial forestry
activities and periodic law of forest fires.
</P>
<P>
A recent conference reminded both officials and ordinary
citizens to adopt precautions against possible fires in order to
ensure the safety of forest reserves, as well as the ecological
balance and sustained economic development.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Hits Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An El Nino-induced food shortage
has affected a total of 34,000 families in the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao, a government official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Agriculture Under-secretary Domingo
Panganiban said the affected areas were mainly located in central
Mindanao, the worst hit by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Panganiban said the El Nino-caused drought has already rendered
60 percent of the 95,000-hectare farmland in South Cotabato
province in central Mindanao parched up.
</P>
<P>
The government has stepped up the distribution of rice and food
in the provinces of South Cotabato, North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat
and Maguindanao and the General Santos City, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Tuesday that a total of 42 people,
mostly children, have died from food poisoning in Mindanao in
recent weeks as a result of the food shortage.

DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Board of Investment
(BOI) decided Wednesday to set up several industrial parks to
quicken the country's industrialization and to create more job
opportunities, the national BSS news agency reported.

The decision was made at a BOI board meeting at the office of
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The meeting reviewed the entire
investment situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lands lying around various state-owned textiles and jute mills
would be used for setting up such industrial parks, and lands
reclaimed in low-lying areas should be utilized to develop into
industrial plots, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Industries should be set up in a planned and organized way to
prevent environment degradation, she added.
</P>
<P>
Nine textile mills with unutilized lands have been identified
for constructing the industrial parks, and such lands would also
be bought from state-owned jute mills, the BSS said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Exhibit Great Concern for Village Election (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Lu Quanxin hurried from downtown
Beijing to his village some 70 km distant this morning to vote for
members of the new village committee.
</P>
<P>
"The election is my main concern since it is directly related
to the development of my family and entire village over the next
few years. I hope the new committee will raise our income," said
Lu, a migrant worker at Beijing's Ping'an Avenue construction site.
</P>
<P>
The 1,047 voters in Beijing's northwest suburban Jiantou
Village, including 700 people who returned from outside jobs, cast
their ballots today for the new village committee.
</P>
<P>
While Lu and other voters were familiar with candidates, they
nonetheless carefully scrutinized the list of candidates prior to
voting. The list was prominently displayed on the wall
outside the polling place.
</P>
<P>
The election commenced at nine a.m, with villagers completing
registration procedures and voting in order. Assistants helped
people encountering difficulties in completing ballots.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoshi, an illiterate septuagenarian female villager,
asked an assistant to read the names of the candidates and mark
her choices.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yuwu, 34, a village accountant for five years, was citied as
one of the most promising candidates. Many villagers referred to
Lu as "fair, honest, dependable, bold and resolute".
</P>
<P>
"I've watched him growing up and know him well. He can help us
make a fortune," said Lu Chongdong, 85, as he marked the circle
beside Lu's name.
</P>
<P>
"If appointed as director of the committee, I'll strive to
increase the village's 1998 output value to 1.9 million yuan, a
level substantially higher than the 1.5 million yuan in 1997,"
said Lu.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Candidate Denies Trying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Philippine House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia on Wednesday strongly denied
charges by the opposition that he is behind the move to disqualify
former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, the presidential candidate of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
Party, said that the move against Lim was initiated by concerned
Filipinos particularly from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer last week filed a petition to the Commission on
Elections (Comelec) demanding the disqualification of Lim, the
presidential bet of the Liberal Party, from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The motion stated that Lim was not a natural-born Filipino
because his parents were Chinese "mestizos." The Philippine
constitution stipulates that only natural-born Filipinos may seek
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Such issue is within the jurisdiction of the Comelec... I
cannot be preoccupied by such issue because I'm busy campaigning,"
De Venecia stressed.
</P>
<P>
The speaker added that the opposition are panicking because his
popularity ratings are scoring high. But he did not name the party
which pointed an accusatory finger at him.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec is expected to rule on Lim's citizenship soon.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the United Opposition, De
Venecia and Lim were currently front-runners in the presidential
race, according to a March survey by the country's independent and
leading polling group, the Social Weather Stations (SWS).
</P>
<P>
In the survey, De Venecia, supported by President Fidel Ramos
but having lagged far behind Lim in many previous SWS polls, came
in second place and caught up with Lim with a 14-percent
supporting rate.
</P>
<P>
But De Venecia, widely seen as a traditional politician good at
backstage maneuvering, was still far behind Estrada who garnered a
hefty 28-percent approval rate.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Lifting of Lumber Export Ban Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
on Wednesday ordered the suspension of an earlier government order
that temporarily lifted the ban on lumber export amid mounting
opposition to this move.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the order to the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR) after a cabinet meeting Tuesday on the
DENR decision to resume lumber exports.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to DENR Secretary Victor Ramos, Ramos said the
suspension will be in effect pending a cabinet review and public
hearings to be undertaken by the DENR on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The DENR ordered early this month the resumption of lumber
exports late this week in order to gain more foreign exchange to
help stabilize the foreign exchange rate of the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was under strong criticism from the Catholic
Church, the political opposition and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
The critics said that the resumption of lumber exports would
encourage further destruction of the country's forests as well as
displace indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the move was meant to raise funds for the
campaign chest of the ruling Lakas-NUCD led by the president.

<HEADLINE> Canada Hopes to Sell Arms to Kuwait: Canadian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Defense
Minister Arthur Eggleton Wednesday disclosed that he had discussed
with Kuwaiti officials possible Canadian arms supplies to the Gulf
state.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying that
"we think we have a number of Canadian products that can help meet
some of their (Kuwaiti) needs, the discussions are ongoing and we
are hopeful that some Canadian products will find their way in the
Kuwaiti forces."
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister added that the procurement program was
discussed to meet Kuwaiti needs. Canada has tried to sell Kuwait
warships and military trucks.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton arrived in Kuwait Monday for a three-day visit, during
which he held high level talks with Kuwaiti leaders. He visited
the Canadian HMCS Toronto patrol frigate, which is currently on
mission in the Gulf and docked Monday at Shuwaikh Port, just west of
Kuwait city.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the members of the 435 Air Squadron of Winnipeg,
who have been in Kuwait since early March.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian forces were part of Ottawa's contribution to the
multinational forces that rushed to the Gulf earlier this year to
ensure Iraq's complying with an agreement it signed with U.N. over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Eggleton reassured the Kuwaiti officials of
Canada's support for peace and stability in the region and for
the integrity of Kuwaiti territories.
</P>
<P>
"We are ensuring that the U.N. Security Council resolutions
are properly enforced and we are doing that with the coalition
partnership," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 Gulf War that liberated Kuwait from a seven-month
Iraqi occupation, Canada provided about 1,800 troops in a back-up
role, in addition to fighter planes to escort bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton also affirmed his government's stance in support of
Kuwait's demands for release of Prisoners of War (POWs) by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we in Canada have taken this matter up with the
Iraqi Charge D'Affaires and we will continue to press this case,
because we think it is only right for Iraq to say to Kuwait and
its citizens what has happened to the POWs."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said that Baghdad still detains 625 Kuwaiti POWs in
Iraqi jails and has frequently urged Iraq to release them, but
Baghdad said those POWs were missing during turmoils in southern
Iraq following the Gulf War.

ALMA ATA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said Wednesday that Kazakhstan hoped to strengthen its
ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Holding talks with visiting Belgian Prime Minister Jean-luc
Dehaene, Nazarbayev said that Belgium was one of his country's key
European cooperation partners.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders agreed that there was a bright future for the two
countries to develop bilateral cooperation and cooperate in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also briefed Dehaene on Kazakhstan's foreign
policies toward the development of ties with NATO and regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the Kazakh president said that Kazakhstan,
which is not a member of NATO, wanted to develop ties with the
military alliance in the framework of the Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene arrived in Alma Ata on Wednesday for an official visit
to Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the diplomatic ties between
Kazakhstan and Belgium in August 1992, the two countries have seen
frequent exchanges of high-level visits and the development of
bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 38.6
million U.S. dollars in 1996 and rose to 53.4 million dollars in
1997. So far, Belgium has set up 22 joint ventures and four
solely-owned enterprises in Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Surgeons Remove Giant Tumor From Manchurian Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A Manchurian tiger remains in
fair condition following surgery to remove a tumor, a Chinese
expert on tiger said here today.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no reports of operations similar to the one
completed by Chinese experts," said Liu Xinchen, a leading
specialist on breeding Manchurian tigers, whose number has been
decreasing for several decades in the world.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons from local hospitals and professors of veterinary
medicine removed the tumor weighing four kilograms. Later tests
revealed the tumor was a urinary cyst. The tumor was removed on
March 31 at the world's largest tiger breeding center located in
suburban Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Doctors noted that tumor threatened the life of the young tiger
which is almost a year old.
</P>
<P>
Medical workers are caring for the tiger during the recovery
period.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in breeding 90 Manchurian tigers since the
establishment of the tiger breeding center in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The natural habitat of wild Manchurian tigers, one of the ten
most endangered species, is limited to the mountains and forests
in northeast China and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that some 300 Manchurian tigers live in said
areas, with some 20 tigers found in China.

<HEADLINE> 10 Red Cross Aid Workers Kidnaped by Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten members from the
International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC) and two pilots were
kidnapped by Somali gunmen in Mogadishu Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the ICRD members were taken hostage
immediately after their plane landed at Issaley Airport at about
10:15 local time, 15 kilometers north of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Those who have been kidnapped include the ICRC official
responsible for the Mogadishu and Lower Shabelle regions, Mr.
Toon and his wife Christine Toon, and Mr. Ole, a Norwegian who is
in charge of the Norwegiann Red Cross that manufactures the
artificial limps for the Somali disabled and Mr. Ali Said from
the Somali Red Crescent society.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses also said the pilots of the plane and the
would-be ICRC Somali Office Delegate, Mr. Thomas are among the
kidnapped. And the others are reported to be Swiss citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to the militia sources, the kidnapped are currently
being kept in a large militia garage in Karan District controlled
by Somali faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the militia garage said that all of the
kidnapped are in good health and offered potable water and are
fed well.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the kidnaping is not known yet. However,
the whole operation seemed to have been a preplanned action
carried out by the Somalis who may mean more than just asking for
ransom.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said that four battle wagons including a
Russian-made recoilless artillery B-10 were involved in the
kidnaping process in which no exchange of shooting occurred.
Three members from the ICRC escaped the kidnaping by rushing back
into the plane, they added.
</P>
<P>
Serious negotiations about the safe release of the hostages
are going on between local Somali Red Crescent officials and the
group led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
This incident took place at a time when all of Mogadishu's
main faction leaders are abroad for discussions with the Kenyan
authorities over the current peace talks and reconciliation
efforts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders are expected to return to Mogadishu
Thursday with the Mogadishu's all-inclusive administration making
announcement to fight the widespread banditry activities.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal appeals court voided an F.C.C. requirement that
radio and television stations seek minority job applicants. Legal
experts said the ruling was the first in which a Federal appeals
court had subjected to a strict legal standard on affirmative
action program that used special efforts to recruit minority.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100,000 people a year die in American hospitals
from adverse reactions to medication, making drug reactions one of
the leading causes of death in this country,
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Franklin D. Raines, whose low-key pragmatism helped
President Clinton bridge partisan differences to close the 1997
balanced-budget deal with congressional Republicans, announced
Tuesday he will step down after less than two years as White House
budget director to become chairman and chief executive of home
mortgage lender Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton initiated a televised "town meeting" of
prominent sports figures as part of his campaign to foster
national discussion on racial issues Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Intel beat diminished expectations for its first-quarter
earnings. But the chip maker warned that revenue will remain flat
to slightly down in the second quarter amid slumping demand from
PC makers. Intel also said it will cut 3,000 jobs over the next
six months, and it plans to trim its 5.3 billion dollar
capital-spending budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- Air-safety initiatives were announced by Vice President Al
Gore in an administration effort to address what it sees as the
most pressing dangers facing the industry. The FAA will require

installation of "terrain avoidance" system on jetliners by 2001.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Testing for the next Census is going on in three states. But
the test site in 11 rural counties around Columbia, South

<HEADLINE> Duma Challenges Constitution on Prime Minister Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, is to question President Boris Yeltsin's
right to renominate the same man as prime minister after the Duma
has already rejected him.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's plenary session, Duma deputies voted in favor of
asking the Constitutional Court to re-interpret Article 111 of the
constitution on the right of Duma to turn down the president's
nomination three times, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The deputies said they needed clarification of "uncertainty in
some questions," in particular about the president's right to
renominate the person who had already been turned down by the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also decided to hold the second vote on confirmation
of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister by a show of hands instead
of by secret ballot as in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Shakhrai, President Yeltsin's representative in the
Duma, said on Wednesday that the president may name one or more
candidates for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members have to decide on one candidate named by the
president when the second round vote is held on Friday, Shakhrai
said.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kiriyenko was first nominated as prime minister on March
23, soon after President Yeltsin dismissed the whole government.
</P>
<P>
He was turned down by the State Duma last week and the
president named him again as the head of government.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Resumption of Talks with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday called
again for the resumption of official talks with India on the basis
of the Islamabad Agreement reached between the two countries last
June.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan believes that the dialogue should resume on the basis
of the Islamabad Agreement and it must focus on finding a peaceful
solution to the Kashmir problem," a Foreign Office spokesman said
Wednesday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on the remarks of Indian Defense
Minister George Fernandes about the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes reportedly said on Tuesday that Kashmir was not an
"internal issue" for India. "There has been a constant dialogue
with Pakistan...and there are U.N. resolutions...so it may not be
an appropriate definition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government welcomes the Indian government's
willingness to continue dialogue with Pakistan as indicated by the
Indian defense minister, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a realistic and pragmatic approach by the Indian
defense minister," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in time with the universally accepted position that
Kashmir is a disputed territory and the United Nations has
determined that the people of Jammu and Kashmir must be given
their right of self-determination," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Both Pakistan and India, he said, are committed to this goal in
accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The recalling of the U.N. resolutions is a constructive step.
This should now lead to practical measures for their faithful
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that Kashmir was on the agenda as
mutually agreed upon during the second round of foreign
secretary-level talks in Islamabad in June last year.

MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian Economic Minister
Yakov Moiseyevich Urinson said the government should try to reduce
interest rates to stimulate the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
Wednesday, Urinson said that to maintain a stable economic
situation, the government should also reduce tax and tariffs and
provide a better investment environment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia's industrial growth last year was
1.9 percent and the gross domestic product increased by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
This indicated a stable condition for industrial production,
but did not mean production growth, he warned.

Russia's foreign debts totaled about 130 billion U.S. dollars,
90 billion of which were inherited from the former Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior Communist Party of China
(CPC) official Wei Jianxing said today that CPC and the Chinese
government value very much their traditional friendship with
Rwanda and all other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Wei, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, made the remark during a meeting
with a delegation from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) led by
Denis Polisi, a member of the RPF executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that attaching great value to friendship and
enhancing consolidation and cooperation with all countries,
including African nations, are important components of China's
independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to join hands with all African
countries, developing long-term, stable and comprehensive
cooperative state-to-state relations oriented towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Africa has developed in a good direction in recent years, with
the trend centered on seeking peace, stability and development,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
African countries still face various difficulties and
undeveloped economies, said Wu, adding that China is convinced
that African nations will overcome all difficulties and realize
peace and advancement on the continent so long as the countries
and their people insist on implementing policies suited to unique
national situations and enhancing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that Polisi's visit will increase mutual understanding
and friendship between the CPC and RPF, and will at the same time
improve friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wei expressed appreciation for the support the Rwandan
government and RPF have displayed for the "One China" policy and
China's reunification effort.
</P>
<P>
Wei congratulated the RPF on its sound achievements scored in
leading the efforts of the Rwandan people to uphold the nation
reconciliation policy and in rebuilding the country.
</P>
<P>
Polisi said that Rwanda and China, as well as the RPF and CPC,
have maintained friendly ties and the all sides have shared
identical views on many major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Polisi said the delegation's visit will further enhance ties
between the two parties, and will reaffirm Rwanda's "One China"
stand.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Promises Measures Against Red Tide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
Wednesday promised to take effective measures to tackle the red
tide, which has caused some 100 million HK dollars (12.82 million
U.S. dollars) of loss to local fish farmers.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting fish farms affected by the recent red tide at Sok
Kwu Wan on Lamma Island, an island located to the south of the
Hong Kong island, Tung told representatives of the fish farmers
that the SAR government is aware they had been hard hit by this
attack, and is also deeply concerned about its environmental
impact.
</P>
<P>
Red tide is caused by a heavy buildup of microscopic organisms
that release toxic substances to suffocate fish. The current red
tide, which first appeared in Hong Kong on March 19, has killed
hundreds of tons of fish and affected about 1,000 of Hong Kong's
1,500 fish farms.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sympathy to the affected fish farmers, Tung said the
government would take immediate action to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
First, the government, together with fish farmers, will speed
up the clean-up operation to remove the dead fish to avoid
contamination, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the government will advise the public on the proper
handling of seafood and closely monitor the seafood markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the government will provide the affected fish farmers
with low-interest loans to enable them to resume their business as
soon as possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, the government will seek to improve the red
tide monitoring and warning system. This may include adopting the
latest technologies from overseas and intensifying cooperation
with our neighboring areas," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soliders were wounded
Wednesday in a roadside bomb explosion in south Lebanon, Lebanese
Voice of the People Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was set off when an armored Israeli patrol passed by a
road near the village of Aieshii in the central sector of the
so-called Israeli security zone in south Lebanon, the radio quoted
Lebanese security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the explosion. It said that it also launched
attacks against an Israeli post in the village of Radara inside
the zone.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 43 the number of Israeli soldiers wounded
in south Lebanon since the start of this year with four killed.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for Hezbollah's offensive, Israeli artillery
bombarded the mountainous area of the village of al Rihan which is
believed to be used by guerrillas as an operation base to attack
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The radio owned by the Israeli-allied militia South Lebanese
Army said the bomb explosion followed a fierce exchange of fire
between Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
A boy was wounded during the clashes by Hezbollah's rockets
and mortar rounds directed toward the Israeli post in the village
of Rihan.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to dislodge 2,000 Israeli
troops out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
villages and towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Solicits Opinions on Draft Law on Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, has solicited opinions
about the draft Law on Higher Education in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Li Peng, who is also member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, 22 representatives from 19
institutions of higher learning in the province's capital of
Nanjing on Monday offered their opinions about the law which is
being drawn up.
</P>
<P>
The participants said at the seminar that such a law will exert
great impact on the reform and development of China's higher
education. It should not only meet the need of promoting the
socialist market economy but also conform with intrinsic rules
concerning higher education.
</P>
<P>
The law should encourage the management of higher education in
diverse forms, and relevant functions of government and
universities should be made clearer, the representatives said.
</P>
<P>
After listening to the opinions of the scholars, Li Peng said
that higher education is responsible for the vital task of
fostering high-level professionals, and such a law will play a
leading role in promoting educational reform and development on
the whole.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, China's top legislature has enacted a
number of educational laws, including the Law on Education, Law on
Teachers, Law on Compulsory Education and Law on Vocational
Education.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the new law being drafted will ensure the sound
development of higher education and is of vital significance for
revitalizing the country by relying on science and education.
</P>
<P>
The draft had been deliberated twice at Standing Committee
sessions of the Eighth NPC. And it will be submitted to the second
session of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> UN Survey Predicts 6 Percent GDP Growth for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to have a
6 percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth for fiscal 1997-98
with the inflation rate projected at 9 percent, according to a
United Nations report released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 1998"
also forecasts a 7 percent GDP growth rate in Pakistan for fiscal
1998-99 and 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is projected to drop to 8 percent in the fiscal year
of 1998-99, dipping further to 7 percent in 1999-2000, says the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The setback in GDP growth in recent years owed much to the slow
growth in agriculture, which still plays an important role in the
economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate in Pakistan in fiscal 1996-97 declined to
3.1 percent from 4.6 percent in 1995-96, it said, adding both the
agricultural and large-scale manufacturing sectors performed
poorly, with the agricultural sector growing only by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The low growth for the agricultural sector was attributed to a
weather-induced decline in production of all major crops such as
cotton (declining by 11.5 percent), sugar cane (falling by 7.1
percent) and wheat (declining by 3.1 percent), the survey said.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan met with his Georgian counterpart Iraklii Menagarichvili
here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang warmly welcomed Menagarichvili, the first visiting
Georgian foreign minister since the two established diplomatic
ties six years ago. He praised the smooth development of the
bilateral relations between the two countries and noted that
wide-ranging cooperation has followed a normal track.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that geographical separation presents no obstacles
hindering the further development of relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries share either similar or identical
views on many key international issues, which will enhance future
efforts to deepen relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang praised the Georgian government's strict adherence to "One
China" policy and for its steadfastness in refusing to establish
official contacts with Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government fully respects Georgia's independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Menagarichvili said his country attaches great importance to
developing ties with China and noted that related efforts will
continue to be "satisfactory" for the both sides. The Georgian
leader expressed for the respect China has exhibited for the
territorial integrity of his country and said Georgia will
continue its support to China's reunification effort.
</P>
<P>
He said the Georgian government will open an embassy in China
as part of an effort to expand cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers exchanged views on wide-ranging
international issues of common concern and expressed great
interest in enhancing consultations and cooperation in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two nations exchanged ratification
documents covering counsellor treaties.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Predicts Healthy Economy, Rules Out Currency Peg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate outlined an economic blueprint on Wednesday
for the country which is expected to be welcomed by local
investors and industry.
</P>
<P>
Skate also predicted that the sagging kina currency would
bounce back within a few months as he ruled out an earlier
government proposal to peg it to the currencies of the United
States, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is to allow the market to continue determining the
rates based on supply and demand," he said in his economic
statement delivered to parliament.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no move by my government to peg the kina," he
was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are advised by the World Bank to allow the kina to remain
around 50 cents American."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said cash crops were expected to produce 487
million U.S. dollars of income this year with revenue from gold,
copper and oil also expected to be above estimates.
</P>
<P>
Skate said the recent drought, during which food drops were
needed from Australia, highlighted PNG's need to improve its
ability to feed its 4.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
The government would fund or enter into joint arrangements to
establish rice fields and cattle and sheep farms within 12 months,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rural credit schemes would also be established to help produce
and sell home-made goods.
</P>
<P>
Tax concessions would be offered to private businesses which
reach employment targets in key areas such as agriculture and
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to help establish several tuna canneries
to capitalize on the under-utilized resource which is dominated by
foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The value-added export value of processed tuna will be in
excess of 2.5 billion kina (1.21 billion U.S. dollars) and at the
same time provide a minimum of 50,000 jobs in the country," Skate
said.
</P>
<P>
The economic statement came only three weeks after the Skate
government handed down an austere expenditure budget for this year
which was compiled with input from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Skate said on Wednesday that he hoped to wipe out the country's
3.5 billion kina (1.69 billion U.S. dollar) debt.
</P>
<P>
"My dream for the future is not of high rise buildings and
super highways, but of a village with a good school and a health
center somewhere in the remote rural area," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Introduces Triple-Blade Razor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Gillette, the world's largest
razor maker, introduced a new type of razor with three blades
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The company, which spent 750 million U.S. dollars developing
the product, has earmarked 300 million dollars for marketing.
</P>
<P>
The triple-blade razor is called Mach 3, after the term for
three times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
The new product will be priced at about 35 percent above the
twin-blade Sensor Excel razor, with an expected retail price of
between 6.49 and 6.99 dollars for a Mach 3 and two refill
cartridges, Gillette officials said.
</P>
<P>
A four-pack of refill cartridges would retail from 6.29 to 6.79
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mach 3 blades, expected to appear in stores in July, are
thinner than the Sensor's and are progressively mounted to provide
a closer shave with fewer strokes.
</P>
<P>
The company will continue to sell Sensors, but expects Mach 3
to capture 20 to 30 percent of the total market in a year.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Is It Time to Adjust China's Macro-Economic Policies?  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Chen Xin
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) --Some Chinese economists warned a
year ago to pay attention to a possible prolonged economic growth
slide, which was not taken seriously by many people then. But now,
that possibility has turned into reality.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of China for the first quarter of this
year was less than 8 percent, even though officials have not
confirmed it, said experts with the State Statistics Bureau (SSB)
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
It was the 16th consecutive quarter that China has had an
economic slow-down.
</P>
<P>
China has set its economic growth target for this year at 8
percent. Last year's actual economic growth rate was 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jianyi, a SSB specialist responsible for analyzing monthly
economic performance across the country, called for "greater
attention" to the current downward economic trend.
</P>
<P>
"It is an arduous task to reach a pre-set economic growth
goal," said Xu. "It is a must to have strong and effective policy
backing."
</P>
<P>
The proper growth range commonly accepted by China's economic
decision-making authorities and economists stands at 8-to-10
percent. Five years ago, when China had an overheated economy and
skyrocketing inflation, China successfully practiced
"comparatively tight" fiscal and monetary policies, eventually
bringing inflation down to last year's 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the economy cools down, China will face a heavier
pressure from unemployment. The registered unemployed population
in urban areas of China, including laid-off workers, is now 13
million.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing number of the unemployed is closely associated
with factors such as China's huge total population, the slowdown
of economic growth, the transformation from an agriculturally
dominant society to an industrially dominant one as well as the
reform of state-owned enterprises to increase efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Is It Time to Adjust China's Macro-Economic Policies ? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is fundamental to maintain a higher economic growth rate to
solve unemployment and safeguard social stability.
</P>
<P>
Take the first quarter of this year as an example. The big drop
in investment growth across the country and stable consumer
demands have made domestic demand inadequate in the light of the
country's economic growth target.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the impact on China's foreign trade caused by
the financial crisis afflicting Southeast Asian economies has
started to take its toll, and a drastic drop in the growth of
exports was reported in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that solving the shortage of effective
demands is an urgent task.
</P>
<P>
But, obviously, the Central Chinese Government will not let go
its "comparatively tight" macro-economic policies, an attitude
that has won wide support by the economic elite, including
experts who have strongly advocated spurring growth in demand.
</P>
<P>
The factor of blind expansion in China's economic system has
not been eliminated, said Liu Guoguang, a noted Chinese
economist, "so it is necessary to continue the comparatively
tight policy in order to avoid taking actions time and again to
fight inflation and create a more stable macro environment for
China's reform and development."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the current shortage of effective demands
in China is caused by the fact that improvements in the supply
structure is slower than changes in the demand structure, which
means there is an oversupply of obsolete products and services,
but inadequate new supplies leave market demands unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
Based on this understanding, government leaders and economists
have disapproved the possibility of changing China's
macro-economic policies from "tight" to freewheeling expansion,
but emphasized limited micro adjustments in an appropriate time in
gross volume and the adjustment of policies concerning fields such
as investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures practiced by the new cabinet on its
formation last month was to slightly lower interest rates. As the
current inflation rate is very low, the move will not change the
orientation of the comparatively tight money policy.
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive act of lowering interest rates in
less than one year, which has fully demonstrated the Central
Government's intent to advance economic development by micro
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
More measures of this kind will be published in the near
future, including increasing investment in basic industries and
infrastructure and speeding up housing system reform to guide
residents' investment orientation.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Is It Time to Adjust China's Macro-Economic Policies?  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sources from government departments of transport, railways,
telecommunications and water resources shows that the state
decided to increase investment in these four sectors with the
added scale amounting to 80 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Consumption in housing has remained low under the traditional
system of distributing government-subsidized apartments as a
welfare form, but the Chinese Government has decided to introduce
reform measures to bring a fundamental change to the situation in
the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Different localities and various government departments have
taken actions as a way to support the implementation of the reform
measures. Purchases of open-market apartments by residents rose by
about 40 percent in the first quarter of this year according to
comparable figures for last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the banking community has decided to increase this
year's credit scale for real estate to 100 billion yuan, quadruple
last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Economist Fan Gang believes the state is determined to tighten
control over common investment projects, and to focus more
investment in infrastructure, high-tech industries and housing to
increase effective demand, improve the industrial structure and
bring about a healthy cycle in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, SSB's chief economist, predicts that the slide in
the economic growth rate is likely to continue in the months to
come, but this year's investment in the country's fixed assets
will probably go up by about 20 percent according to last year's
standard, and social consumption demand will steadily increase.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to publish new measures to encourage
exports. Although China's foreign trade has been affected by the
financial crisis of Southeast Asia, the general demand for foreign
trade in 1998 will continue to maintain a certain growth rate, so
that China's national economy will continue to develop at a faster
speed.

<HEADLINE> Botha Still Tough on TRC Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South African president P
W Botha reiterated Wednesday that he would not appear before the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Botha spoke briefly to journalists during a five-minute break in
proceedings at the George regional court in Western Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
He was in court for his defiance of a TRC subpoena served in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Botha could face a fine of up to 20,000 Rand (about
4,000 U.S. Dollars), or and two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they destroy me they cannot destroy my soul and my
convictions," Botha said.
</P>
<P>
Court proceedings resumed Wednesday morning after talks between the
legal teams of the two parties failed to result in an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned Tuesday morning to allow the two sides to
seek an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu told journalists Wednesday that Botha
pulled the plug on an agreement at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very distressed because the two parties were very
close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Botha and the TRC had put together a statement
which had found general acceptance except for one or two small
amendments.
</P>
<P>
"This morning our counsel said that Mr. Botha basically broke off
any discussions, and the case is going ahead," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the TRC was still ready to talk to Botha about a
compromise, although this was more difficult now that the case was
under way.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his commission never wanted Botha to be
prosecuted, but wanted him to answer questions about the activities of
the former State Security Council which he chaired at the peak of the
anti-apartheid struggle in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Botha's ultimate objection had been, Tutu said it had
"stuck in his gullet " to have any dealings at all with the
commission.
</P>
<P>
"In his view we have done nothing but humiliate his people, as he
says. I don't think anything we try to say or do would move him from
that position."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, was president between 1984 and 1989. His government
vehemently implemented apartheid policies and suppressed
anti-apartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
He refused to apologize for his government's role during the
apartheid era and believed that the TRC was trying to "witch hunt" the
Afrikaner. He also called the TRC a "circus."
</P>
<P>
He first appeared in court on January 23. The case was postponed to
February 23 when he pleaded not guilty.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Raises Paddy Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The per acre yield of paddy in
Sri Lanka, which stood at about 3.5 metric tonnes per acre for
decades, increased to 4.7 tonnes per acre last year, official
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and Land Ministry sources said the ministry plans
to increase the per acre yield to as high as 7.3 tonnes this year.
</P>
<P>
Paddy is for double cropping in this South Asian country. To
achieve this target, the sources said, the ministry has drawn up a
plan to expand agricultural services in technology, distribution
of fertilizer and expertise service islandwide, including major
paddy producing areas and outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
But doubt remains about the plans for such a steep increase in
the per acre yield.
</P>
<P>
Paddy is a main crop in Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Talks Seem Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The first inter-Korean government
level contact in four years reached an impasse here today, as both
sides were reluctant to take the first step to re-open the talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK) seem to be still far apart
on varying agendas, though they kept contact today in hope of
further talks.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to stay here for another two days,
including today, which is the Sun's Day, the 86th birthday of the
late President Kim Il Sung. The DPRK delegates are said to be busy
with celebrations today.
</P>
<P>
If either side changes its position, it can propose further
talks, Jeong Se Hyun, head of the ROK delegation said. But should
these two days pass without progress, the talks would be over, a
source close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made all concessions we could make. There are no more
things we could give the Southern side," one member of the DPRK
delegation today was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are still in contact. But I cannot say if it can
re-open later today or tomorrow," an official from the ROK said.
</P>
<P>
At yesterday's "unsuccessful" talks, the North wanted the South
to provide half a million tons of fertilizer, while the South
would give no more than 200,000 tons and insists that the issue of
separated families be more urgent than that of the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Chun Kum Chul, head of the DPRK delegation, complained that the
South attached political terms to an economic and humanitarian
issue, the fertilizer aid.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the South should first offer fertilizer
assistance to create an atmosphere conducive to improved relations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that although the talks had no tangible
results, they were symbolic after the nearly four-year break.
</P>
<P>
This historic Beijing talks follow an inconclusive second round
of Four-Party Korean peace talks, which ended in Geneva on March
21 after six days.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala

At the close, the 100-quality stocks Composite Index fell 20.22
points to 644.62, the all-shares Emas Index eased 5.15 points to

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reducing Reliance on Underground Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Exploitation of underground
water in east China's Shanghai municipality dropped for the first
time in 1997, according to the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the municipality exploited 123 million cubic
meters of underground water, 91 percent of the set plan. The
figure is 9.22 million cubic meters less than in the previous
year, said Ren Guangzhao, a high-ranking ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The municipality also pumped 19 million cubic meters of water
into underground.
</P>
<P>
To stop subsidence resulting from overuse of underground water,
the municipality has adopted stringent measures to control
drilling for new wells, he said, adding that only 24 new wells
were put into operation last year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai formulated an effective scheme of using surface water
for the replacement of underground water in 1996, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said the municipality plans to raise prices
of water in an effort to stop water-wasting activities.
</P>
<P>
The underground water available for exploitation is 571 million
cubic meters each year in the city. But the municipality
controlled its real exploitation amount under 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Stresses International Cooperation in IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to expand its
cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) and patent offices of other countries so as to make its due
contributions to the world intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection, State Councillor Wu Yi said today.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark during a meeting with WIPO Deputy
Director-General Francois Curchod and other foreign visitors who
are here to attend the inaugural ceremony of the China
Intellectual Property Training Center and the International
Symposium on the Property Co-operation Treaty (PCT) System in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the WIPO has made outstanding contributions to the
IPR cause of all countries as well as their co-operation in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO, along with patent offices of other countries, has
provided great assistance to China in its legislation, personnel
training, and the expansion of its influence in the world in the
field of IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
To introduce and constantly improve the IPR system is an
important part of China's reform and opening up, and also a need
to create a socialist market economy in China, Wu Yi said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the Chinese government has changed the name of
the former Patent Office into the present State Intellectual
Property Office, in a move to enhance cooperation with other
countries in this area, she said, adding this has fully
demonstrated the importance attached by the government to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Curchod said that in the past 20 years, co-operation with China
has been a priority for WIPO, which is pleased to help China
institute a modern intellectual property system.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has formulated many laws and regulations
concerning intellectual property, and has made great progress in
this regard, he said, adding that WIPO and patent offices of other
countries are ready to further cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, China has enacted laws concerning the protection of
trademarks, patents, copyright, computer software and new plant
species, and also the Law against Unfair Competition. China has
also joined WIPO and the nine treaties under its administration
since 1980.

effect of El-Nino which causes drought, the Post Express reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Mange, chief meteorologist of one of the weather
forecast centers of the ministry, said there would be little
rainfall in the south of the country this month, while the
current dusty haze will persist in the north.
</P>
<P>
According to him, farmers nationwide would experience some
problems in the first and second planting seasons this year.
</P>
<P>
The first planting season, he said, had already been distorted
as a result of the unusual heat and drought, unlike the previous
years when farmers were supposed to have started harvesting crops
such as corn and other grains.
</P>
<P>
He further warned that in the second planting season projected
to commence between September and October in the southwest and
July in the southeast, crops would not do well because of the
anticipated heavy rainfall distribution pattern.
</P>
<P>
Mange's warning followed that of Alhaji Yusuf Salahu, director
of Nigeria Meteorological Services, who last weekend forecast
that the extreme hot weather situation, the most devastating in
the last 10 years, would persist for most part of the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted the occurrence of corresponding severe dry
wind in the later part of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an equally extreme wet situation should be expected
during the rainy season, cautioning farmers on higher volume of
rainfall and its accompanying flood, the director said.

<HEADLINE> Web Founder Voices Concerns About Internet Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The inventor of the World Wide
Web on Wednesday said he was concerned about how personal privacy
may be affected by the rapid growth of the Internet and easier
access to information.
</P>
<P>
Tim Berners-Lee, who founded the Web in 1989 as a medium for
global information sharing, said privacy was now a top priority
for the international World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which
oversees use of the medium.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned about the privacy aspects of the use of
the Web at the moment," Berners-Lee told journalists at the
Seventh International World Wide Web Conference in Australia's
coastal city of Brisbane, the third largest city in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said W3C was currently working on a platform for privacy
preference, which would allow Web users to dictate how much, if
any, information was collected by Internet providers about what
sites they visited, what purchases they made and other Web habits.
</P>
<P>
But despite privacy concerns, Berners-Lee said the Web would
become a much more creative and usable tool over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the development of Web browsers that would apply
human-style reasoning to search for and provide more relevant
information to users.
</P>
<P>
Berners-Lee was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as
saying he frowned on people or governments who sought to regulate
or censor the Internet, saying Web technology did not force a
particular policy or view on its users.
</P>
<P>
Answering criticisms about allowing children access to
inappropriate material such as pornography, Berners-Lee pointed to
technology that allows parents to lock their children out of
certain sites.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower on Negative Factors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar sank lower
on Wednesday to hover around three month lows as a host of
negative factors reinforced the market's bearish tone.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar closed at 64.72 U.S. cents on Wednesday, from
65 U.S. cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Magnus, senior foreign exchange manager of Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, one of the four major banks in the nation, said
the Australian currency remained plagued by a number of domestic
issues.
</P>
<P>
"If you give me one reason to buy the Aussie, I'll give you two
to sell it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The market needs some clearly positive news and there has not
been any."
</P>
<P>
The waterfront labor dispute, the possibility of an early
national election, or a double dissolution election over the Wik
native title bill, talk of an interest rate cut and weak commodity
prices were all negative factors weighing on the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 83.57 Japanese yen from a close of
84.33 on Tuesday, and at 1.1658 Deutsche marks from 1.1843 marks.

<P>
PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Algerian government has arrested about 10
government-sponsored "patriot" self-defense militiamen,
including the mayor of Relizane, who were accused of killing
dozens of civilians. The aime of the government is to prove that
it is putting things under control.
</P>
<P>
-- After several days of arms wrestling with President Boris
Yeltsin over the nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister,
the Russian State Duma Tuesday gave the first signs of yielding
to avoid a dissolution. The speaker of Duma, Gennady Seleznev,
who has strong influence in the Communist Party, has called on
the deputies to vote for Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The official Economic and Social Council of France said on
Tuesday that 43 percent of French families living in urban areas
are suffering from noises because of heavy traffic on the
road. The council regretted lack of efficient measures by the
government to curb the problem of noise in big cities, which it
described as "a national priority."
</P>
<P>
-- Held responsible for the economic crisis in Japan, Japanese
Prime Minister Ruytaro Hashimoto is under severe attack from the
oppositions and his own Liberal Democratic Party. The bankruptcy
rate of Japanese enterprises has attained 17.4 percent in the
1997-98 fiscal year, while their debts amounted to 698 billion
francs (116 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Austrian Airlines Extends China Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Airlines recently added
an additional flight to Shanghai, extending all three
Vienna-Beijing flights to the commercial and financial center of
China.
</P>
<P>
According to Alfred Brader, Austrian Airlines general manager
for the People's Republic of China, this is a result of
consultations between the Austrian and Chinese governments on
tourism cooperation to cater to flourishing tourist and trade
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The three weekly flights between the Chinese and Austrian
capitals began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1997, two of the flights connect Vienna and Shanghai
via Beijing to better handle the increasing passenger traffic with
a third flight following suit on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The flights are run in cooperation between Air China and
Austrian Airlines. The aircraft used is an Airbus A340 with two
additional cabin attendants from Air China on board to give
special service to Chinese-speaking passengers.
</P>
<P>
All of China's major travel agencies have taken tourist groups
on package tours to Austria, according to an official in charge of
international tourism in the China Travel Service Head Office, and
Austria has become an attractive destination for Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Apart from flights between Shanghai, Beijing and Vienna,
Austrian Airlines also has two Hong Kong-Vienna flights each
week.

SINGAPORE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to fall
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) declined by another 17.61 points to close at 1543.94
points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that stock prices finished lower as weakening
regional currencies and ratings down-grades on several local banks
dealt a blow to stocks.
</P>
<P>
Standard &AMP; Poor's had lowered the public information rating on
four local banks due to concerns over worsening asset quality,
property sector outlook and the domestic economic slowdown, they
said.
</P>
<P>
There was light selling across the board and the weak sentiment
was not helped by negative news, they added.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 239.74 million units,
valued at 235.27 million Singapore dollars ( 147.04 million U.S.
dollars). Again declines overwhelmed advances by 271 to 55, while
266 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Uraco was the most actively traded counter as it registered a
turnover of 26.97 million units. It was followed by Malaya
Resources which had 13.63 million shares traded. MBF Capital was
next with 12.58 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
SIA (Singapore Airlines) Foreign led the gainers of the day as
it rose by 30 cents to finish at 11.1 Singapore dollars. HongFok
increased by 21 cents to end at 1.32 Singapore dollars. Elec&AMP;E and
UOB (United Overseas Bank) Foreign were up by 15 cents each to
close at 5.9 U.S. dollars and 6.15 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 80 cents to end at 36 Singapore dollars. Bukit
Sembawang and Cycle &AMP; Carriage (C&AMP;C) fell by 40 cents each to
close at 12.3 and seven Singapore dollars respectively. OCBC

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Plans to Issue Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is about to
issue domestic and so-called Yankee bonds worth 500 billion baht
(13 billion U.S. dollars) to boost liquidity in the business
sector.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the bonds would be issued by the Financial
Institutions Development Fund (FIDF), a government official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said earlier that the
government was planning to issue domestic bonds in order to reduce
the short-term interest rate and correct a distortion in the
market's financial structure.
</P>
<P>
The measure would also help ease the interest burden of the
public sector caused by the fund's borrowings at a 20 percent
interest from five major commercial banks, said the source, who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
He said interest on the fund's bonds would be 13 percent, but
it had yet to be decided whether the repurchase period should be
three, six or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Legislative proposals were being drawn up and would be put to
the cabinet on April 28 for approval. An executive decree would be
issued to empower the Finance Ministry to carry out the program,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
At present, the major banks refuse to extend loans to business
operators because they feel more secure lending money to the fund
and enjoying a 20-percent interest.
</P>
<P>
The bonds would make the fund less dependent on the five banks.
</P>
<P>
The massive short-term loans the fund had drawn from domestic
financial sources had caused distortion in the financial
structure, drained liquidity and spurred a rise in short-term
interest.
</P>
<P>
By pulling the fund out of the short-term market and creating a
long-term financial source for it, the distortion would be
corrected, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Ranks Lowest in Telephone Availability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's improvement in the
telecommunications industry has not changed its ranking among the
lowest ladder of telephone accessibility, otherwise termed as low
teledensity, the Guardian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent ranking by the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), Nigeria occupies the 49th
position among the least developed in telecommunications in the
world, or 79th in total world ranking.
</P>
<P>
ITU statistics show that teledensity in Nigeria is only 0.46
lines for 100 people, much lower than 9.24 lines in South Africa,
the highest in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), the national
carrier, now has an installed capacity of 700,000 lines from its
127 exchanges nationwide, compared with a population of more than
100 million.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Communications Minister Maj.-Gen. Patrick Aziza said
recently that the country needed six billion U.S. dollars to meet
the ITU prescription of one telephone line to 100 persons by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
As there is paucity of funds from government angle, the
minsiter said he has enlisted the involvement of the organized
private sector to beef up the situation.
</P>
<P>
This goes in line with the government plan to privatize NITEL
this year.
</P>
<P>
Since deregulation of the telecommunications industry began in
1992, five private telephone companies have been established in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The private operators have made plans to put in place over
500,000 telephone lines across the country by the turn of the
century.

<HEADLINE> Intel Cuts 3,000 Jobs Following First Quarter Profit Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest
chip maker, on Tuesday announced its plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs
following a 36 percent plunge in its profit for the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company intends to eliminate the positions over the next
six months mainly through attrition, but Intel executives said
some layoffs could occur in specialized areas if the company drops
out of some businesses entirely.
</P>
<P>
Weaker-than-anticipated demand, particularly in the Americas,
Japan and Europe, led to the drop, the Silicon Valley company said
today.
</P>
<P>
First quarter revenue was 6 billion U.S. dollars, down 7
percent from first quarter of 1997, and down 8 percent from fourth
quarter of 1997. Net income in the first quarter was 1.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In February, Intel warned analysts to expect a poor first
quarter, when the company announced that orders were running about
10 percent below expectations.
</P>
<P>
Microprocessor chips made by Intel run more than 85 percent of
the world's PCs. But the company has been facing stiffer
competition from rivals in supplying the increasingly popular
class of PCs costing less than 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The PC industry seems to have gotten ahead of itself, building
more products than end-customers purchased, " said Andrew Grove,
Intel chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
In providing guidelines to industry analysts for the second
quarter, the company predicted that sales would be about the same
or slightly less than they were in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
But earnings are expected to decline, as the profit on each
product sold by Intel before operating expenses are taken to
account will drop by a couple of percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The cost of producing a Pentium II processor, which is now
outselling the older Pentium line, is higher for Intel because of
the card design that processor line uses.

<HEADLINE> China To Sell 140 Billion Yuan of Household Electrical Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The market demand for China's
household electrical appliances is expected to continue its 10
percent growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a projection recently released by the China
Household Electric Appliance Association, total sales value will
reach 140 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of obsolete appliances in urban households and
the need for newlyweds setting up new ones are the major sources
of demand, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The rising purchasing capacity of the rural market also should
contribute to the sales surge.
</P>
<P>
Among the major products, air conditioners and microwave ovens
are predicted to remain popular with consumers. Air conditioners
are expected to have a 20 percent sales increase and microwaves,
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price competition also will intensify, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The industry has shifted to a low-profit stage. The current
average profit rate for the industry has dropped to 3-to-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the market price of a microwave oven has
dropped 40 percent, and that of a refrigerator has dropped 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts stress that manufacturers should step up
quality guarantees and after-sales service, and try to nurture
long-term development while promoting sales through price cuts.
</P>
<P>
China's exports of household electrical appliances also is
promising in a favorable international environment, the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, this year's exports will approach 3.6
billion U.S. dollars, up 12 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the bulk of the exports will still be small appliances,
large appliances are expected to account for a larger proportion.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia on the
export situation will be mostly confined to small electric
appliances.
</P>
<P>
And, since the target market for big electric appliances is
mostly developed countries and regions, their export situation
will not be greatly affected.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China exported 3.21 billion U.S. dollars of household
electrical appliances, up 16.7 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Child Laborers on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of child laborers in
Zambia aged 12 to 14 has increased by nearly 250 percent from
59,000 in 1991 to 146,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a news briefing held here Tuesday by
Peter Mcdermott, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Resident
Representative to Zambia, according to The Post published here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same briefing, Rodgers Mwewa, Director of Fountain of
Hope, a non-governmental organization, said that poverty is one
of the major causes of child labor in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambia economy has deteriorated over the past
years and has led to profound poverty among the ever increasing
population.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty in Zambia is the major cause of child labor but it is
not the only one," Mwewa said, adding that the rapid increase in
the population has not been accompanied by corresponding growth
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 700,000 Zambian children between the ages
of 7-13 are not reached by the educational system and this has
led to substantial increase in levels of children engaged in
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Mwewa noted that 90 percent of child abuses are found in the
rural areas. He called on the Zambian government to increase the
level of budgetary spending on education to enable children to go
to school.
</P>
<P>
There are 250 million working children in the world, 60
million of which are in India and one third are in Africa, said
the paper.

<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's State Statistics Bureau
says that the non-state sector is now contributing 24.2 percent to
the nation's economy and has become a major force in China's

</P>
<P>
Non-state companies in agriculture scored an added value of 376
billion yuan last year, accounting for 27.5 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Cooperation to Foster Company Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Although "company analyst" still
does not sound so familiar to the Chinese people, the securities
companies in the nation are already far-sighted enough to direct
part of their attention to training such talents.
</P>
<P>
As a joint effort by the China Securities Co. Ltd and a French
bank, a second training class was sponsored Monday, aimed at
fostering qualified analyst of the listed companies. It has
attracted securities professionals from the nation's major
securities brokerages, and three French company analysts in
telecommunications, computer industries and the retail sector are
scheduled to give lectures to the class.
</P>
<P>
"Analysis of the listed companies is bound to play an
increasingly important role in the investment decisions of the
Chinese securities buyers or fund managers in the future, as is
the common case overseas, and the seminar is opened to prepare the
securities industry for this coming trend," said Lin Yixiang, the
Executive Vice-President of the China Securities.
</P>
<P>
He said similar class will continue to be offered in the
future, and securities analysts from the other industries will
also be invited.
</P>
<P>
Due to the over-speculation and lack of standardization of the
young securities market, the investment decisions in securities
still do not depend so much on the quality of the listed companies
in China as overseas. But "rational investment", which is mainly
based on a thorough knowledge of the listed company and its
industry, is already beginning to show its power in some cases,
according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities also attach great importance to the
standardization and maturing of the market, which is best
indicated in the unveiling of the regulations governing the
securities and futures investment consultancy and introduction of
standardized funds designed for securities investment.

financial risks and to promote their healthy development.

By the end of 1997, rural credit cooperatives had 1 trillion
yuan in deposits, or 12.8 percent of the total amount in all

Shi said that the rural credit cooperative management system,
agricultural services, and credit capital need to be improved to

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between supporters and
adversaries of the detained Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi
took place in Tehran Tuesday and a number of demonstrators have
been arrested, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The group were arrested Tuesday in front of the Laleh Park,
north of the Tehran University, Political Director General of the
Interior Ministry Seyed Javad Zaker was quoted as saying. But the
number of the arrested was not given.
</P>
<P>
The pro-mayor rally was held despite the student group the
Unity Consolidation Office canceled its planned rally after the
government called for calm.
</P>
<P>
Zaker said the demonstrators were apparently those who had no
information about the cancellation of the rally.
</P>
<P>
The rally in support of the mayor was later interrupted by his
adversaries, causing fistfights among them, according to
Wednesday's moderate newspaper Iran News.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, violence occurred in a gathering
inside the Interior Ministry between Karbaschi's supporters and
adversaries, injuring at least four people, the moderate newspaper
Iran News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clashes erupted between members of the hard-line
group, "Ansar-e Hezbollah" (Friends of Hezbollah) and the
mayor's supporters, who were angered by a question raised by the
hard-line group.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, who supported President Mohammad Khatami in his
landslide victory in last May's presidential elections over
hard-line competitor, was temporally detained by the judiciary on
charges of embezzlement, misappropriation of funds and
mismanagement. The detention intensified a growing power struggle
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary, together with the parliament, is believed to be
tightly controlled by the hardliners bloc. The mayor's detention
angered Khatami's supporters who regarded it as
politically-motivated aimed at weakening the government.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that top Iranian leaders were trying to release
the mayor by making a compromise between the moderates and the
hardliners in order to quell a political disturbance in the
country.

been hospitalized by April 11. Their symptoms included nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pains, dizziness, and nosebleeds.
</P>
<P>
Only 44 pupils who didn't take the tablets, out of more than
470 at a primary school in the Xigu district, did not get sick.
</P>
<P>
The iodine supplements were handed out in response to a Lanzhou
Health Department and urban education bureau circular asking that
iodine intake be increased in children who were found to have
serious iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The tablets were given by the Health Department, which got them
from the Xingyi Pharmaceutical Plant in southwest China's Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
An enquiry found that the tablets had already been given to
nearly 70,000 students in the city. The tablets had not been
examined by local health departments, nor had they been authorized
by the Ministry of Health of the central government.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of similar incidents elsewhere in the
province.
</P>
<P>
China has plans to eliminate iodine-related diseases by the
year 2000, mainly by using iodized salt. But, the Health Ministry
has cautioned that over-the counter iodized calcium nutrients and
iodized foodstuff should not be given indiscriminately to
kindergartens and schools.

<HEADLINE> Three-Member Government of Nepal Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala took
office Wednesday noon as prime minister of Nepal with a slim
government of three members, ending a three-day anarchy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra administered the oath of office to Koirala at the
Royal Palace, and Koirala did the same to Miss Shailaja Acharya,
deputy prime minister and minister for water resources, and Ram
Saran Mahat, minister for finance, said a notice issued by the
King's Principle Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Koirala himself holds concurrently two dozens of other
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Koirala was appointed new prime minister by King Birendra
Sunday evening following the resignation of Surya Bahadur Thapa
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But he could not form a new cabinet due to quarreling over
allocation of portfolios among the MPs of his Nepali Congress
(NC).
</P>
<P>
Because of failure to find a ruling partner, the NC, the
largest party in the Lower House of parliament with 87 MPs,
decided to form a minority government.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that after obtaining a vote of confidence in the
House as is required of a new coalition or minority government
within 30 days under the constitution, Koirala will expand his
cabinet to 27 members.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of 103 votes is needed in the 205-seat House
to win a vote of confidence. The main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which has 49 MPs in
the House, has promised to support the new government.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa vacated the premiership for the NC under an
agreement he reached before he went to power last October.
</P>
<P>
Koirala's is the second minority government and the fifth since
the mid-term polls in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The last minority government led by the CPN-UML lasted only ten
months.

<HEADLINE> Cataracts to Plague More Chinese, Doctors Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The graying of Chinese society
will increase the incidence of cataracts, a common eye disease
that can cause blindness, according to doctors.
</P>
<P>
"Because most cataract cases in China occur among old people,
we expect a much higher incidence of cataracts and blindness in
the future with the increasing number of senior citizens," said
Professor Sun Baochen, director of the Beijing Research Institute
of Ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
China reportedly will have more than 130 million people over 60
by 2000, and 200 million in 2020, the biggest elderly population
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Cancers, cardiovascular and cerebral diseases and diabetes
will severely harm their health; so will cataracts," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye, is the leading
cause of blindness in China now.
</P>
<P>
Although two million cataract patients had their eyesight
restored through surgery in the last decade, medical services are
still greatly needed by patients living in remote and poor areas,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
A staff worker with the China Disabled Persons' Federation said
efforts are being made to increase ophthalmological services in
remote and poor areas, such as sending medical teams to villages
and cooperating with international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We have planned to provide 1.75 million cataract surgeries in
the 1996-2000 period," said Chen Yuan of the federation's
Rehabilitation Department.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Find More Relics On Xisha Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of relics uncovered
on China's Xisha Islands show that Chinese settled there more than
1,000 years ago, archeologists say.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 coins and ceramic and pottery pieces selected
from more than 1,800 items from the islands are now on display in
Haikou, the capital of China's island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that the relics date from the Tang (618-907)
to the Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and that the pottery was mainly
produced in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists did two major excavations on some of the
Xisha islets in 1974 and 1975 and discovered the remains of sunken
ships to the north, east, and west of some, indicating that they
had come from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The relics tally with Chinese records on the islands and that
the Chinese were the earliest to discover and develop the islands,
archeologists say.

<HEADLINE> Botha Trial to Proceed After Talks Break Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua ) -- Talks on a possible deal
to prevent Former South African President P.W. Botha from
standing trial broke down Wednesday, meaning the court case would
proceed.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, faces charges of contempt for ignoring a subpoena
by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is authorized
by the government to investigate apartheid-era crimes.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could receive up to two years in jail and an
unspecified fine.
</P>
<P>
The trial was supposed to begin Tuesday, but Botha's lawyers
asked for a postponement to try to work out a deal in which the
former president would testify before the commission in exchange
for dismissal of the charges.
</P>
<P>
TRC lawyer Jeremy Gauntlett said Wednesday morning, a day and
night of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. "He (Botha)
has effectively repudiated all the discussion," Gauntlett told
journalists outside the court house.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest news, TRC spokesman Johan Allen quoted
TRC Chairman Archbishop Desmond tutu as saying early in the
morning that even though the deadline had expired for reaching an
agreement with Botha, TRC had not closed the door on
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> IMF Projects Slowdown in Nigeria's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has projected a sharp slowdown in Nigeria's economic growth
to 2.7 percent this year from last year's 5.1 percent, the Daily
Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund based its prediction on the acute power and fuel
shortages Nigerians have been experiencing since early this year,
as well as the unfavorable investment climate in the country.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the fund said, many African countries are
expected to achieve an economic growth rate of around five
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The trend looks set to continue over the medium term, IMF said
in its semi-annual World Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that weak commodity prices could still keep
growth rates from meeting expectations this year as in 1997, when
adverse weather conditions and declines in commodity prices
produced disappointing results throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
According to the fund, trade liberalization will be critical
in ensuring continued expansion of African economies.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Largest Opposition UNIP Gives Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's largest opposition
party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), has set out
the preconditions for its participating in the forthcoming local
government elections to be held late this year.
</P>
<P>
Leading independent newspaper the Post published Wednesday
quoted UNIP chairman Malimba Masheke as saying Tuesday in
Livingstone that his party won't participate in the elections
unless the government agrees to resolve all contentious electoral
issues.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing in the southern border city, Masheke also
expressed surprise at Tuesday's story in the state-owned media to
the effect that his party will participate in the elections
regardless of whether contentious electoral issues are resolved
or not.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP chairman said that UNIP has left the doors open for
participation in the local government elections, but can only
participate if government agrees to resolve all contentious
issues, including voters register, electoral process and
presidential candidate's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
UNIP is still consulting its members and the Patriotic
Alliance grouping more than a dozen opposition parties over its
participation in the forthcoming elections, said Masheke, "but as
we have said before we can only participate if those contentious
issues are resolved."
</P>
<P>
UNIP, former ruling party under the leadership of former
president and Zambia's veteran stateman Kenneth Kaunda, boycotted
the country's 1996 general and presidential elections because
Kaunda, the most hopeful opposition leader, was disqualified as a
presidential candidate for his Malawian parentage.
</P>
<P>
The largest oppostion party together with other opposition
parties has been calling for dialogue with the government to
resolve the country's political issues. However, the dialogue has
never been conducted seriously.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Claim to Develop Super Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Indian scientists said
Tuesday that they were developing wheat varieties that could raise
output by 15 to 20 percent when grown in optimum conditions, the
Times of India reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a substantial jump considering that the genetic gain
in production during the 1980s has been only one percent per
annum," said S. Nagarajan, head of Directorate of Wheat Research
(DWR) at Karnal in the north state of Haryana.
</P>
<P>
Another agronomist, Sanjaya Rajaram, director of the wheat
program at Mexico-based International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center (CIMMYT), said that the super wheat varieties would be
ready in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Both agricultural experts are participating in a conference
held here to further cooperation between Indian agricultural
scientists and the CIMMYT.
</P>
<P>
Nagarajan elaborated that the super wheat could yield seven to
eight tones per hectare while the current best varieties could
produce 6.5 tones per hectare under optimum conditions.
</P>
<P>
Wheat is grown over 25 million hectares in India and the
average yield works out to 2.4 tones per hectares.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the country's annual production has
hovered between 60 to 62 million tones per year, with the previous
season only showing a blip -- to 68 million tones.
</P>
<P>
Nagarajan said that the scientists were using two approaches to
develop the super wheat variety, one of which was conventional
plant breeding involving extensive selection and crossing of
strains over generations.
</P>
<P>
The second was producing hybrid wheat by crossing two strains,
where the yield of the progeny or hybrid exceeds that of the
parents.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Airlifts Relief Supplies to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A Moroccan plane landed Wednesday
morning at Saddam International Airport with 10 tonnes of
medicines, foodstuffs and clothings on board sent by the
Confederation Democratique De Travail (CDT).
</P>
<P>
CDT Secretary-General Noubir al-Amaoui, head of the Moroccan
delegation, told Iraqi News Agency that this flight was the
second by CDT on behalf of the Moroccan people to show solidarity
with Iraq in the face of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Amaoui said that various forms of support will continue
until sanctions imposed on Iraq are lifted and foreign troops and
fleets, which pose a threat to region's and Arab security and
stability, have been withdrawn from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain maintain a massive military build-up in
the region to force Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions to
dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al-Amaoui denounced the British attempt to hold a conference on
the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program, saying it was a ploy to
perpetuate the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is an overall lifting of sanctions, now
that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments vis-a-vis (U.N.) Security
Council resolutions," al-Amaoui said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. But Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil to buy back food and medicine over every six-month
period.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Records Higher Exports, Lower Imports in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan saw higher exports and lower
imports in 1997 over the previous year, semi-official Jordan Times
Wednesday quoted Industry, Trade and Supply Minister Hani Mulki
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exports in 1997 increased by 2.6 percent over 1996 to
reach 1,066 million Jordanian dinars (about 1,506 million
U.S. dollars) while imports fell by 4.1 percent to stand at 2,909
million dinars (about 4,109 million dollars), the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of exports can be attributed to the fact that
Jordan's foreign trade has won new grounds - the number of export
markets in 1997 has grown by 17 percent over 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Arab Free Trade Agreement which
Jordan has signed with Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and
Bahrain was a major factor that helped the kingdom expand its
export markets, Mulki noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan also benefited from the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal, under which Jordan exported 113 million dinars
(about 160 million dollars) worth of products to Iraq in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of
oil over six months to buy food and medicine. The U.N. has
increased the amount of oil Iraq can sell to 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mulki did not elaborate why Jordan' imports decreased last
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Rice Producer Looking for Higher Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China,
the country's largest rice producer, has been getting some results
from its efforts to develop high-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province has raised its annual grain output from 10 billion
kilograms to more than 25 billion kilograms in the past five
decades, according to the provincial development office.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the province began to raise the per-hectare output by
planting double-cropping hybrid rice on the same paddy
fields. Last year, the technique was used on 960,000 hectares,
more than half of its total double-cropping farmland.
</P>
<P>
The fields using the technique produced an average of 15,075
kilograms of rice per hectare last year, 1,665 kilograms more than
the province's average.
</P>
<P>
Hunan plans to introduce the technique to more than one million
hectares by the year 2000.

Leonardo Simao expressed his government's discontent over the
situation with the Mozambican citizens in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing of the Parliament, Simao said Tuesday
that the waves of violences in South Africa had targeted not only

The two countries have suggested to take unilateral, bilateral
and even multilateral action through the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), with the two countries being its
members, to deal with the problem, Simao said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses 3 BN Dollars to Import Duty Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government lost three
billion U.S. dollars to fake importers and fraudsters since the
stoppage of pre-shipment inspection at the beginning of this
year, Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani has said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the amount, 179 million dollars has been recovered from
the fraudsters, the minister said, quoted by press reports
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government is compiling a list of the
fraudsters, including Nigerian importers and businessmen from
some Asian countries, who will be tried for economic sabotage.
</P>
<P>
To simplify import procedures, the government decided to stop
pre-shipment inspection, which requires import duty reports
issued by international pre-shipment firms, and introduce
destination inspection from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the government had to re-introduce the pre-shipment
inspection exercise at the end of February in an effort to check
abuses of the liberalized economic policies as some unscrupulous
Nigerians and their foreign collaborators had taken advantage of
the policies to make easy money.
</P>
<P>
According to Ani, the fraud was effected through the opening
of letters of credit by the importers who used the facility to
secure foreign exchange at 75 naira to one dollar only to recycle
the money into the black market instead of importing goods.
</P>
<P>
The act had made the naira jump from 75 to 81 or more to a
dollar, forcing the government to supply at least 800 million
dollars to meet the "steep rise" in the demand at the official
exchange market in the first four or five weeks this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister argued the fall of the naira at the
instance of the fraud should not be understood to mean
devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are on to recover all such money so as to instil
sanity in the import-export sub-sector of the economy, the
minister said Monday in Calabar, a port city in southeast
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ani was in Calabar on an inspection tour to the country's
first export processing zone, which has been waiting in
desperation for investment for commission as construction has
been completed for long.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the fall in oil price on this year's budget,
the minister said the federal government would use its savings to
shore up the budget whenever such signs emerge.

</P>
<P>
The official said the new policy should increase use of the

The Ministry of Public Security has entrusted China Travel
Service (Hong Kong) Ltd., China Travel Service (Macao) Ltd., the
Consular Department of the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) and the Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
Macao to deal with applications for new passes beginning at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Entry and exit application forms will also be simplified, the
official said. The time for handling certificate-related affairs
will be shortened from seven working days to four to seven.
</P>
<P>
The official said that urgent certificates will be handled in
three days and urgent approvals will take one day.
</P>
<P>
Old certificates will not be approved after May 1. However,
passes approved before April 30 will still be valid.

<HEADLINE> Stone Buddhas to Have Dirty Faces Cleaned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of stone Buddhas in
north China's Shanxi Province will have their dirty faces washed,
today's Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Fifty thousand rock Buddhas in the Yungang Grottos near the
city of Datong were carved 1,500 years ago. However, they have in
the past decade accumulated a thick mantle of coal dust.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, an averaging 16,000 trucks pass the
Buddhas each day, shuttling coal from Datong, a major coal
producer in China, to other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of coal mines are scattered along the 16-kilometer
road linking Datong with the grottos. A 1.5-meter-wide belt of
coal dust covers both sides of the road. Local residents complain
of the "black snakes" of coal dust, which attack passers-by on
every dry, windy day.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists, all wearing gauze masks when visiting the
grottos, also complain of the dust-polluted air and the
dust-covered Buddhas, who look like coal dealers.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show the dust content of the air is 27 times the
State-set standard.
</P>
<P>
"Acid rains caused by too much sulphur dioxide and carbon
monoxide in the air will hasten the erosion of stone carvings,"
said Li Zhiguo with the cultural relics research center attached
to the Yungang Grottos.
</P>
<P>
The local tourism bureau also complains that the number of
visitors has decreased sharply from 440,000 in 1987 to 220,000 in
1995 because of the deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
A plan has been worked out by the provincial government to
build a new road for coal transport, which will not go through the
Yungang Grottos, said a provincial official. However, the project
has not started because of a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
The road is expected to cost 188 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Release Windows 98 on June 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. has set June
25 for the release of Windows 98, the latest upgrade software to
its Microsoft operating system for personal computers, the company
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rob Bennett, group product manager for Windows 98, estimates
that old Windows users will pay about 109 U.S. dollars for an
upgrade version while new Windows buyers will shell out roughly
100 dollars more.
</P>
<P>
He added the upgrade version probably will be sold in most
stores at a discount price of 89 to 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98's main improvement is that it weaves Microsoft's
Internet browser into the desktop operating system, turning the
computer screen into a viewfinder for both the World Wide Web and
information stored in a personal computer, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
It also has some minor new features, such as faster loading of
software and a trouble-shooting guide for common computer problems.
</P>
<P>
Bennett pointed out that the new system enables users to run
high-capacity digital video disks, use two monitors at a time and
more easily hook up peripherals.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, said that Windows 98 is not dramatic change
like Windows 95, which improved the basic "look and feel" of
computing and encouraged Apple Macintosh users to switch to
Windows machines.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Windows 98 requires a minimum of a 486-class computer
with 16 megabytes of random access memory and 195 megabytes of
free hard disk space for typical installation, compared with 120
megabytes for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Windows 98 will quickly become the standard
operating system for new personal computers.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Popular Science Through Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A national publicity campaign for
popular science started at the Beijing West Railway Station today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign -- jointly sponsored by the China Association for
Science and Technology, the Ministry of Railways and the China
Railway Society -- will be carried out on trains and in railway
stations throughout the country, according to Guo Lin, Railway
Society chairman.
</P>
<P>
The event will include setting up bulletin boards of popular
science in waiting rooms and on platforms, distributing popular
science magazines and other publications to passengers on trains
and broadcasting relevant knowledge on radio and cable television
in railway stations.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of environmental protection, health care and railway
transportation will be widely spread through such measures, Guo
said.
</P>
<P>
China has 66,000 kilometers of rail lines and more than 6,000
railway stations.
</P>
<P>
"Trains and railway stations around the country, which receive
an average of three million passengers a day, provide a good
chance for popular science education," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said nine years have passed since China began to use trains
and railway stations as a media for popular science education. The
publicity campaign will help promote popular science through
railways around the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, in addition to the Beijing West Railway Station,
the campaign will be launched in eight railway stations in
Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shijiazhuang, Urumqi,
Lanzhou and Liuzhou.
</P>
<P>
China last year held an effective publicity campaign for
HIV/AIDS prevention on trains and stations along the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway line, he said.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Growing Cost Shoots up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The cost of producing coffee in
Kenya has increased by 110 percent during the past six years, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Cooperative Development Minister Amukowa Anangwe was
quoted as saying that the high cost of production had contributed
to low yields and falling crop quality, forcing some farmers to
abandon the crop.
</P>
<P>
In the main coffee base of Meru District, production of coffee
fell from 44.9 million kilograms of cherry in 1991 to 23.9
million kilograms last year, he sighed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged farmers to use credit facilities offered
by both Kenya Planters' Cooperative Union (KPCU) and Coffee Board
of Kenya to boost output.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed wrangles in the cooperative societies as
another cause of low production as big societies split into
smaller ones owing to disagreements.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is one of the major foreign exchange earners of Kenya.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Remove Trade Barriers: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the
three member states of the East Africa Cooperation (EAC), have
been planning to remove tariff barriers in the region, the East
African Standard reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These barriers now adversely affect trade among the three
countries, said Kenya Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho when meeting
with Uganda's Trade and Industry Minister Rwendeire Abel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Plans were also underway to sort out trade bias against some
commodities, like Ugandan Waragi (an alcoholic drink) and maize
in the Kenyan market, said Kamotho.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added that high tariffs, congestion at Kenya's
Indian Ocean city Mombasa, the major port in the EAC region, and
bureaucracy hampered trade between Uganda and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
There is need to open a consulate in Mombasa, said Abel,
pointing out that the port has become an important area in the
foreign trade of the landlocked Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The main problems traders were facing now are delay in the
clearance of goods, accessibility of ships at the port and the
opening of containers on transit, said Abel.
</P>
<P>
He commended Kenya President Moi for maintaining stability in
the country, adding that Uganda's economy has been affected by
conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Overall Inflation Rate Falls in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall year-on-year
inflation fell to 8.1 percent in March from 12.3 percent in
February with a decline in basic food prices toward the end of
the month, said the latest Central Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said in its monthly report for
April that the improved availability of basic foods helped the
food index to rise by only 5.7 percent in the year to March 1998
compared with a hike of 21.8 percent in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in food prices helped lessen the tax-induced
inflationary pressures on overall inflation," the CBK said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the combined effects of new tax measures
announced last month and the rising cost of transportation and
distribution caused underlying three-month annualized inflation
to rise to 34.2 percent in March from 26.4 percent in February
and 10.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
To confine year-on-year inflation to a target of 5.0 percent
by June 1998, the annual expansion in broad money supply would be
maintained below 8.3 percent, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It urged a more restrained fiscal policy to contain the budget
deficit at below 2.4 percent of GDP from 1.7 percent in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
"The steps taken to address the deficit in food production and
to rehabilitate the country's infrastructure are also expected to
impact positively on inflation in the months ahead thereby
containing the month-on-month inflation at less than five percent
by June 1998," said the CBK.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Executed in U.S. Despite World Court Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A Paraguayan man who stabbed a
woman to death was executed in Virginia Tuesday night despite
appeals by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the World
Court that the sentence be stayed.
</P>
<P>
Angel Francisco Breard, 32, was executed by injection soon
after Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore refused to stop the sentence
from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
Breard, who was sentenced to die for his attempted rape and the
murder of a northern Virginia woman in February 1992, was
injected with a dose of lethal chemicals in the state prison in
Jarratt, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Governor Gilmore's decision followed a United States Supreme
Court ruling dismissing appeals to stay the execution.
</P>
<P>
The World Court ruled last week that the execution should be
blocked because Virginia authorities failed to notify Paraguay of
the man's arrest as required by the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Breard having committed a heinous and depraved murder, and
his guilt being unquestioned, and the legal issues being resolved
against him, and the U.S. Supreme Court having denied the
petitions of Breard and Paraguay, I find no reason to interfere
with his sentence," Gilmore said in a statement issued by his
office.
</P>
<P>
Breard's death sentence drew protests from the Paraguayan
government, which argued Breard was not afforded his rights under
international law to seek legal help from diplomatic officials
before his trial.
</P>
<P>
Virginia prosecutors admit Breard was not afforded his rights
under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to meet with
Paraguayan consular officials, but said the issue should have been
raised with state appeals courts that upheld the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, the International Court of Justice asked the United
States to delay the execution, and the Paraguayan government
appealed to the Supreme Court and Virginia governor for a stay of
execution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
Gilmore to issue a stay so that the security interests of
Americans abroad could be secured when such incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to make sure that when Americans are
abroad, that we have the ability to protect them if they are in
any kind of trouble abroad. That requires us to be able to have
some kind of access to them, through our consuls," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Breard was born in Argentina, but moved to Paraguay with his
family when he was 13. He later moved to the United States,
enrolling in English classes and finding a job in the Washington,
D.C. suburbs of northern Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ticket Scalpers Receive Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Five people who were caught
selling 2,600 train tickets in Beijing have received stiff
sentences and been fined 1.45 million yuan, according to today's
Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Railway Transport Court sentenced the
five to prison terms ranging from two months to three years.
</P>
<P>
The major offender, Gui Kemin, who was in charge of buying train
tickets for Beijing Chemical Engineering University, was involved
in the largest such case since new China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Gui used his power to privately buy some
2,600 tickets, valued at 390,000 yuan, from January 25 to February
4, 1997. He then resold 2,300 tickets at a 7-yuan price increase
and 300 with a 2-yuan mark-up, for a profit of 16,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The other defendants used similar methods to resell the tickets
they had bought to people who were desperate for them.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have been asked to help prevent such
things from happening and to protect passengers' interests.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese league champions
Dalian Wanda have been fined $10,000 by the disciplinary committee
of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), AFC's Secretary-General
Peter Velappan said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dalian were fined for refusing to collect their medals after
they lost to South Korea's Pohang Steelers in the final match of
the Asian Club championship in Hong Kong on April 5.
</P>
<P>
Velappan said that the AFC also issued a stern warning to the
Dalian Wanda.
</P>
<P>
Dalian were protesting following a controversial sudden-death
penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
With the two teams level at 5-5, Pohang's Abbas Jassem hit the
post. The referee decided that a hesitation in Jassem's run-up
was illegal and ordered the Iraqi international to retake his spot
kick. Jassem scored, giving Pohang Steelers a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
The referee needed an escort to protect him from Dalian
supporters and officials as he left the pitch.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 Asian Club championships, Dalian Wanda is
scheduled to meet India's East Bengal in the opening match in
September.

<HEADLINE> Britain Concerned over French World Cup Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
expressed concern over a French minister's encouragement of
British football fans without World Cup tickets to visit France
this summer.
</P>
<P>
French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine told a news
conference in London that all people would be welcome to visit
France to enjoy the biggest football tournament in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why people cannot come to France and enjoy
the atmosphere of the matches and the celebrations going on in the
towns," she said.
</P>
<P>
This statement is clearly contrary to a British government
campaign to persuade ticketless British fans not to travel to
France during the whole football tournament.
</P>
<P>
British Sports Minister Tony Banks said in a statement issued
Tuesday that Demessine's statement for British football fans was
"not helpful".
</P>
<P>
"For (ticketless) English and Scottish fans to go there is not
advisable and it's not something we're encouraging people to do,"
he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw also reaffirmed the
government policy by saying:"The message is a very simple one. If
you have no ticket, don't travel."

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese County's Bamboo-Driven Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The bamboo industry has become a
force in the economic development of Anji, a small county in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Anji, which has 450,000 people, now has 1,200 companies doing
1.5 billion yuan worth of business processing bamboo and bamboo
shoots.
</P>
<P>
Anji has 60,000 ha of bamboo groves that can produce 450,000
tons of bamboo annually, and was referred to as the "home of
bamboo" by the previous Forestry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
These abundant resources lay idle over the past few years
however and showed no appreciable profit, when bamboo was
generally thought of as a kind of construction material.
</P>
<P>
But, after the opening up, bamboo related industries began to
appear and bamboo prices went up three or four times. The
development of these industries not only attracted surplus rural
laborers, but also brought higher incomes for farmers, and
household incomes have been growing by 6,000 yuan every year as
they got involved in this sector.

<HEADLINE> China's Timber Business Expected to Remain Stable This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government sources say
that there is expected to be a balance in supply and demand in the
domestic timber market this year in spite of an expected decrease
in domestic output and slight increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration will restrict the cutting of
trees to protect state-owned forest reserves, reducing timber
output a great deal. Output is estimated at 49.36 million cubic
meters, down 3.1 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Declining prices on the international market and lower tariffs
in China will mean increased timber imports, with total volume
expected to be nine million cubic meters, up 12.5 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
Timber demand this year is estimated at 59.2 million cubic
meters, up 1.1 percent from last year, resulting in a fall of 5.6
percent in timber stocks by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor to Be Released following Rafsanjani's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The detained Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi is expected to be released on Thursday
after former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani launched
"extensive efforts" to rescue him, a moderate newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The mayor is very likely to be freed on Thursday," an
informed source told the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said that former President and Chairman of the State
Expediency Council Rafsanjani has been conducting the management
to resolve the Tehran municipality crisis behind the scene.
</P>
<P>
"After holding lengthy talks with the supreme leader
(Ayatollah Ali Khamenei), Ayatollah Rafsanjani has managed to
gain the leader's consent for the release of Karbaschi," the
source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that under the agreement between Rafsanjani and
Khamenei, President Khatami was to make an appeal to the
leader for Karbaschi's release.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old mayor was detained on April 4 by the
conservative-led judiciary on the charges of embezzlement,
misappropriation of funds and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The detention intensified the growing power struggle between
the conservatives headed by the parliament speaker and the
judicial general-supervisor and the moderates led by President
Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Filament of Ancient Hair Examined in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An analysis of a filament of
hair removed from an ancient corpse indicates that Shanghai
enjoyed a clean environment some 400 years ago, according to
Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
"No lead was detected in the hair," according to Cheng
Huansheng, a professor of modern physics at Fudan
University. Cheng noted that the analysis provided strong evidence
that region enjoyed a clean environment in the period dating back
some 400 years.
</P>
<P>
An examination in a high-energy accelerator revealed that the
filament of hair contained normal levels of all chemical elements,
including calcium, phosphorus, iron and copper, with the exception
of zinc, with levels of the latter sharply lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
"This indicated that the elderly man was in poor health and
most likely died around the age of 81," according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
The remains, unearthed in Shanghai in 1994, has been identified
as belonging to Gu Chongli, a dignitary and high-ranking official
during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Gu's remains were in the
highest state of preservation of any ancient corpse thus far
discovered in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Pathologists from Hong Kong and Shanghai conducted an autoposy
to determine answers to questions related to the cause of death,
diseases suffered during old age and the high state of
preservation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest city, faces increasing threats from
pollution and the municipal government has adopted various to
control related problems.

<HEADLINE> More Price Cuts Of Chinese Cars Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Price cuts for Chinese
automobiles are inevitable and more advantageous than
disadvantageous, today's People's Daily says.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, prices of many popular brands like
Charade, Alto, Jetta, Citroen, and Peugeot have dropped from 5,000
yuan (602 US dollars) to 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The cuts were prompted when import tariffs were lowered 20
percentage points to 80 to 100 percent last October, causing
competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is an annual production increase of 20 to 25
percent, and supplies far outstripping demand. This year, car
output is expected to reach 620,000, but only about 500,000 are
expected to be sold. With their heavy bank loan burden, car
manufacturers are ready to move their products.
</P>
<P>
For the long-term, the cuts are thought to be helpful to
China's automobile industry: First, they help the restructuring of
automobile manufacturing. The industry has some serious problems
with production, planning and management. The combined annual
output of China's eight major manufacturers, for example, is only
500,000, less than a tenth of General Motors, which is just one of
the U.S.'s auto manufacturers. Intense competition can help
eliminate small producers.
</P>
<P>
Second, lower prices attract more buyers, stimulating
production, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Third, the increased competition means that manufacturers will
have to improve quality, lower production costs and develop new
brands.

<HEADLINE> Deep Sea Shrimp Catch Declines in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's deep sea shrimp catch
in the Bay of Bengal has fallen sharply in recent months, the
Bangladesh Marine Fisheries Association (BMFA) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Shrimp collection by a deep sea fishing trawler has gone down
to 50 kilograms from 250 to 300 kilograms on the average," BMFA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The area located at the southwest of the St. Martin Island,
southeast Bangladesh, has been identified as the sanctuary of
shrimps, according to BMFA Chairman M.H. Khan, where the
government has given permission to 73 trawlers for fishing but
only 30 deep sea fishing trawlers are in operation there at
present.
</P>
<P>
The owners of shrimping vessels have been suffering a loss due
to the declining catch, but reasons for that are still unknown, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Khan did list a few causes that may have affected the
shrimp population in the area, such as seismic survey affecting
the sustainable stock of shrimp by driving them out of the their
natural area, and shore fisheries and hatcheries collecting spawns
indiscriminately without any control.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries have also increased their presence in the Bay,
using gill nets that do not allow juvenile shrimps to escape, he
said.
</P>
<P>
BMFA officials said there may be many more causes behind the
sharp fall in the reserve of shrimps, including low temperature in
fishing grounds, ground sounding by oil research companies,
sweeping of poaching fleets and high mortality rate of shrimp fry.
</P>
<P>
Khan urged the government to take measures to determine the
reason for the catch decline, which he said has put many fishing
companies on the verge of bankruptcy and would make thousands of
people lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The country's sea fishing sector earned 14.8 million U.S.
dollars from exporting some 2,100 tons of frozen shrimps in 1996,
according to the BMFA.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co, the world's largest
aircraft manufacturer, said Tuesday that it has received new orders
worth 3 billion U.S. dollar from United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based United Airlines has placed orders for 16
777-200s, six 767-300s and one 747-400, Boeing said, adding that
deliveries will begin in the first quarter of 1999 and continue
into 2002.
</P>
<P>
No price was announced for the orders, the largest batch so far
this year for Boeing. Boeing's price list for its aircraft would
make it worth 2.28 billion to 3.16 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald said the new planes will
allow the company to take advantage of recently authorized new routes
to Asia. Analysts expect more passengers to Asia once the region's
financial problems ease.

<P>
Meanwhile, Boeing said that Trans World Airlines is expected to
purchase 24 new MD-83 passenger jets from Boeing, which merged with

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Fighting Software Piracy in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft is going all-out in
its battle against software piracy here as it stepped up action
against vendors of illegal products, and might even sue landlords
who failed to stop the offense, national newspaper the Business
Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the latest legal initiatives see the
U.S. software firm seeking civil injunctions against vendors who
continued to sell pirated software despite repeated warnings and
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
This would allow for intensive court proceedings that would
speed up the legal timeframe from nine months previously to the
present six to eight weeks, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's corporate attorney Christopher Austin was quoted as
saying that in this way, Microsoft hopes to cripple the ability of
the vendors to resume their activities. In addition, Microsoft
might also file civil action against landlords who failed to stop
their tenants from selling illegal software, even after repeated
raids on the premises.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the first such notices were sent to 12 shops in Sim
Lim Square in the downtown area of Singapore. However, Microsoft
Singapore noted that there were instances of raided shops closing
down only to reemerge almost overnight under a new name and
carrying out the same activity.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that each week at Sim Lim Square, over 100,000
Singapore dollars (about 62,500 U.S. dollars) in revenue are made
by syndicate operations selling pirated software," Austin said.
</P>
<P>
Software piracy cost the local industry some 56.5 million U.S.
dollars in sales in 1996, the Business Times said, adding that the
dollar cost is just the tip of the iceberg.

<HEADLINE> Leading Italian Policeman Arrested on Extortion Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading police officer in Italy's
fight against the Mafia was arrested Tuesday on charges of
extortion in connection with the release of a kidnapped wealthy
businessman.
</P>
<P>
General Francesco Delfino, national head of the Carabinieri
police schools, allegedly pocketed an equivalent of over half a
million U.S. dollars for the release of Giuseppe Soffiantini, who
was set free by kidnappers on February 9 after 237 days in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
The Soffiantini family reportedly paid 1 billion lira (555,000
U.S. dollars) to a mysterious informer who claimed he could help
negotiate the release of the victim.
</P>
<P>
Italian media said searches of Delfino's residence turned up
the marked banknotes paid by the Soffiantini family and two
suitcases similar to those used to carry the banknotes.
</P>
<P>
Delfino was arrested in his lodgings at the Carabinieri cadets
school and later taken to the Celio military hospital because of
his poor health.
</P>
<P>
The warrant to arrest Delfino, expected to be transferred to
the military prison of Peschiera, was issued to avoid his
tampering with the evidence and because of conflicting statements
he made during the raid on his property, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the Corriere della Sera daily on
Tuesday, Carlo Soffiantini said that he did not meet or speak with
Delfino during the period his father was held hostage.
</P>
<P>
"Delfino was an old friend of the family," he explained. "He
knew my parents from when he was a lieutenant and stationed near
our home."
</P>
<P>
Delfino is a well-known public figure in Italy for his key role
in the arrest of Mafia "super boss" Salvatore (Toto) Riina in
1993.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar Celebrates Water Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Young girls in their festive
dresses are singing and dancing at a water-throwing pandal in the
capital city of Yangon, while merry-makers throwing water on
people and motor vehicles passing by for festive enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the joyful scenes which can be found at various
pandals to mark the onset of the Thingyan Water Festival,
Myanmar's traditional new year.
</P>
<P>
It has entered the second day of the country's three-day water
festival on which people threw water on one another and made
mutual blessings.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, almost every government department set up
water-throwing pandals on the occasion. But this year the number
of the pandals have been reduced for the purpose of cutting down
government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
However, private companies in the country including foreign
ones kept on building such pandals for the event.
</P>
<P>
Among many pandals erected by foreign companies, the TOTAL, a
French company investing in Myanmar's oil and natural gas
exploration and production, drew a large crowd of merry-makers who
went out for water throwing.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened to the outside world in late 1988, there
were 1,152 foreign companies and branches doing business in the
country at the end of 1997 and foreign investment has now amounted
to nearly 7 billion U.S. dollars from 23 countries or regions,
according to official data.
</P>
<P>
Despite reduction of the number of water-throwing pandals, the
festive atmosphere remained as high as in the past few years,
especially among youngsters.
</P>
<P>
There emerged on Tuesday, the first day of the festival, a
special foreign guest -- General Chetta Thanajaro, Thai Army
Commander-in-Chief, who came to attend the activity, demonstrating
the friendly ties between the two armed forces of Myanmar and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The water-throwing activities will continue till Thursday and
the Myanmar new year will fall on Friday when people will do
various deeds of charity and set free captive animals.

<HEADLINE> Devaluing Dinar Pays Off, Says Kontic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) --The policy of devaluing the
Yugoslav dinar has achieved initial success, Prime Minister of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Radoje Kontic said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency quoted Kontic as saying the financial
reform featured with the dinar devaluation had so far been
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The currency in circulation had slightly dropped against the
amount on March 31, which was an unprecedented situation since the
latest devaluation began.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said intervention efforts by the National Bank of
Yugoslavia had also led to positive results. There was better
clearing ability among business banks; more foreign currencies
were bought by banks than sold and there was a much more stable
exchange rate between the dinar and the deutsche mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the use of the World
Wide Web has posed significant international questions relating to
copyright, censorship and taxation that had so far gone
unanswered, Australian Governor-General William Deane said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Seventh International World Wide Web Conference in
Brisbane, the third largest city in Australia, the
Governor-General, a regular Internet user, said these issues would
need to be addressed either by the industry or by governments.
</P>
<P>
"It is undoubtedly the case that the borderless electronic and
universal nature of the Internet is not only beginning to change
the nature of our transactions and delivery of services, it has
many national and international legal implications," he was quoted
by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Questions, for example, of contract, of defamation, of
harassment, of copyright protection and of where responsibility
lies in cases such as where an employer provides staff with E-mail
and Internet facilities, are assuming some importance."
</P>
<P>
The Governor-General, who was senior judge before he was
appointed Governor-General of Australia, also cited examples of
"cyber-terrorism," the ready availability of information on how to
manufacture weapons, and widespread pornography as other issues
that needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"While national and international legislation is needed to deal
with criminal content on the Internet, a degree of consensus is
emerging in many parts of the world through industry
self-regulation, using codes of conduct, hotlines and labeling
schemes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia was ranked sixth in the world in terms of Internet
usage, and fifth for the number of Internet hosts, he said,
</P>
<P>
"Within Australia, the research company www.consult estimates
that there are about 1.6 million who currently use Internet, of
whom around one million, including, I might add, myself, use it at
least once a week."
</P>
<P>
Australia is a country with a population of about 18 million.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Reform Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Romania plans to make many new
changes in its educational system, including merging the subjects
of physics, chemistry and biology into the general category of
"science."
</P>
<P>
The reform program, proposed by National Education Minister
Andrei Marga, believes the more liberal, democratic and modern
approach to teaching may be the most important change in the
educational field for Romania in this century.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to liberate the pupils from memorizing often
redundant information and to teach them instead creativity and
logic. New subjects such as dramatic arts, mythology and dance
will appear in the new schedule.
</P>
<P>
The hours allotted to what the students consider boring or
"unbearable" subjects will be reduced and some science subjects
will be taught by one teacher in the lower 5-8 grades.
</P>
<P>
However, some teachers do not agree that cutting certain
subjects will be effective and improve education.
</P>
<P>
Marga also promised that no teachers would be idled by the
changes or remain uneffected. The teachers will also have to
re-qualify and offer children new attractive optional courses and
challenges.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Gift Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Overseas buyers continue to
source from Hong Kong despite the recent devaluation of Asian
currencies, Hong Kong's Secretary for the Treasury Denise Yue said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They value our long-term trading relationship, as well as the
cost-effectiveness of sourcing from Hong Kong in terms of quality
and customer services, and our stable and reliable delivery
system," she said.
</P>
<P>
With increasing global competition, Hong Kong gifts and
houseware manufacturers have made efforts to sharpen their
competitive edge, she said.
</P>
<P>
Yue was speaking at the opening ceremony of Asia's largest
gifts and premium trade fairs -- the four-day Hong Kong Gifts &AMP;
Houseware Fair '98 and the Hong Kong Premium Show '98 here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Fairs are organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), and the Premium Show is jointly organized by the
TDC and The Hong Kong Exporters' Association. The two-in-one
event has so far attracted more than 2,400 exhibitors from 39
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Yue said the popularity of the event proves that Hong Kong is a
top sourcing center where products from around the world are
brought under one roof.
</P>
<P>
This fair is the largest trade fair organized by the TDC and
the biggest of its kind in Asia, said Jeffrey Lam, chairman of the
Fair's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
With the addition of 70 percent more exhibition space to a
total space of 54,500 square meters at the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center Extension, 50 percent more exhibitors than
1997 have come to this year's event. They include delegations
from China's mainland, Taiwan, Macao as well as the United States,
Germany, Thailand, Indonesia and India.
</P>
<P>
"The expanded event consolidates Hong Kong's status as the
foremost trade fair capital for Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Its growth also underscores Hong Kong's vital role as a
sourcing center for every conceivable type of giftware, houseware
and premiums," he added.
</P>
<P>
And, for the convenience of buyers, the event is for the first
time, sectioned according to such product categories as gifts,
consumer electronics and electrical appliances, houseware,
kitchenware and tableware, and Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong exported last year 299.6 million HK dollars (38.4
million U.S. dollars) of gifts and household goods; total imports
also exceeded 231 billion HK dollars (29.6 billion U.S. dollars),
with the United States, China's mainland, Japan, Germany and
Britain as the main markets.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Urges Opening of U.S. Market to Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil Tuesday called upon the
United States to open its market gradually to Latin American
countries.
</P>
<P>
It made the appeal on the eve of the second summit of the
Americas, which will focus on the creation of a free trade zone in
the Americas (ALCA).
</P>
<P>
"ALCA's success will depend on a smooth opening of the U.S.
market to Latin American products, especially agricultural ones,"
said Graza Lima, Brazil's main negotiator for international
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of Brazilian exports to the U.S. ran into
trade barriers of high tariffs, anti-dumping regulations and harsh
health standards, according to Brazilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also maintains that ALCA should take into account the
development level of different countries and allow existing
bilateral, regional and world trade agreements, such as the Common
Market of the South, the North America Free Trade Agreement and
the World Trade Organization, co-exist.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, a member of the Common Market of the South, looks
forward to stabilizing and strengthening the regional trade
organization and increasing the competitiveness of its products in
the continental market before ALCA's establishment.
</P>
<P>
It is not a secret that Brazil is worried with the anticipated
creation of ALCA, under which its products may not have easy
access to the U.S. market, but U.S. products may glut the
Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
According to Brazilian authorities, the country registered a
trade deficit of 5 billion U.S. dollars with the United States
last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil attributed its huge trade deficit to U.S. protectionism.
</P>
<P>
The creation of ALCA was first proposed by Washington at the
first summit of the Americas held in Miami in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four countries of the American continent are involved in
the negotiations for ALCA's creation. Cuba is not included because
of its ideological differences with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is promoting ALCA not only because it considers Latin
America as its backyard but also a large market with great
varieties of natural resources, Latin American diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
ALCA will also enable the U.S. to obtain a fast decrease in
customs tariffs in Latin American countries for high-technology,
information and electronic products.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of German tourists
visiting Sri Lanka in the first two months of this year increased
by 28 percent, Sri Lankan Tourist Board sources said Wednesday.

<P>
During this period there were 16,089 German tourists in
comparison with 12,594 during the corresponding period last year,
the sources said.
</P>

participation of the International Tourist Trade Fair (ITTA) held

The ITTA is held annually to support the international tourism
business and provide opportunities for different countries to make

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis Affects Cuban Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Asia's financial crisis, which
erupted in July 1997, has caused both positive and negative
effects on Cuba's economy, a senior Cuban economist said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Osvaldo Martinez, president of Cuba's parliamentary economic
commission, said that one of the favorable effects is the reduced
oil prices resulting from an over-supply in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The lower prices helped Cuba, a major oil importer, save lots
of foreign exchange reserve, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the devaluation of Asian currencies also favors
Cuba as one of the import-intensive countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a predicted slower growth in the world's
economy, especially the Asian economy, in 1998, reduced the demand
for nickel and thus triggered a reduction in its price. Cuba is a
major exporter of nickel.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's exportation of lobster also registered a sharp decrease
since Asia is the main market.

<HEADLINE> Water-Spraying Machine Used to Reduce pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the Lampang province
in northern Thailand are using a water-spraying machine to reduce
dust pollution haunting a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
A TV report said Wednesday that the pollution comes from a
lignite mine near the village and affects the health of the
villagers who ask for relocation from the mine.
</P>
<P>
The highest dust level was detected at 360 micrograms per cubic
meter of air, and most of the pollution is suspended dust of 100
microns in size, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are facing problems relocating the 500
villagers from the pollution zone due to budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the pollution, the officials spent 3 million baht
(790,000 dollars) to install the water-spraying device between the
village and the mine.
</P>
<P>
The device is able to spray water into the air 16 meters high
and one kilometer long.
</P>
<P>
However, the result of the attempt is yet to be ascertained
until the end of April, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A Venezuelan court issued an
order on Tuesday to put former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The arrest order was based on the charge of illegal enrichment
by Perez and his female companion, Cecilia Matos, who now lives in
New York. Perez is accused of depositing ill-gotten public funds
amounting to millions of U.S. dollars in several U.S. bank
accounts, according to judges who announced the indictment here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money Perez and Cecilia kept in the accounts far
exceeded their earnings as public officials, Judge Edith Cabello
de Requena told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Perez could be sentenced to from three to 10
years house arrest, said the judge.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from Perez.
</P>
<P>
Perez, 74, the first Latin American leader to be convicted of
corruption, was forced out of office in May 1993, seven months
before completing his second term. He was sentenced to 28 months
house arrest for embezzling from a secret state fund.

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister Urges Profound IMF Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) needs profound reform of its serious drawbacks exposed in
the financial crisis in Asia, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini was quoted as saying by the newspaper Repubblica on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is an institution born after the War (World War II)
and its structure and method of working have scarcely been changed
since," said Dini, a former executive director of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Profound reform, as well as a revision of the entire logic
behind the IMF, are needed because the world has changed
completely, he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Citing one shortcoming of the fund highlighted by the crisis in
Asia, Dini said, "The first stages of the crisis were marked by a
serious lack of attention. Alert mechanisms ought to have been set
off but in fact remained silent."
</P>
<P>
He also found fault with the IMF's remedy for the crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"One has the impression that action was limited to a general
rescue operation" and could have fallen short of an effective
intervention, without which similar crises might occur again, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a more general review of the IMF's flaws, Dini
said, "too often the IMF has not realized that with money on
credit, or money from rescue operations, it was not financing
development of a zone but solely growth of the wealth of a
governing class."
</P>
<P>
"There was no control to ensure that the money was being used
to finance schools rather than assault tanks," he complained.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Fight Racial Health Disparities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Surgeon General David
Satcher said Tuesday he plans to focus on reducing health
disparities among races in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The focus on racial health disparities comes as part of
President Bill Clinton's race initiative. Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala has also talked about the
department's effort to improve the health of African Americans and
other racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality is 2.5 times as high for black babies and 1.5
times higher for Native American babies than for white babies,
according to the department. African-American men under 65 suffer
from prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate for whites, and
Latinos have more than double the rate of stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
The health initiative aims to eliminate disparities by 2010 in
six areas: infant mortality, HIV and AIDS, immunization rates,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer screening rates,
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Satcher highlighted an
administration proposal to give 30 communities money to target
these areas. Clinton has asked for 150 million U.S.dollars over
five years for grants that must be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
These six areas were chosen because of the large disparities
and because they are easily measured. It will be easy to see if
the nation has made progress, Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
Satcher reiterated the administration's position on tobacco and
its vow to press ahead for comprehensive legislation to reduce
teen smoking.

<HEADLINE> Italy Unveils Plan For 600,000 New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Labor Minister Tiziano Treu
unveiled a new employment package Tuesday with which he plans to
create 600,000 new jobs before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be presented to the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, in Brussels on Wednesday
fulfilling the government's commitment made in November during the
EU's special employment summit.
</P>
<P>
Treu's action plan includes provisions for 170,000
"work-experience" schemes and 296,000 positions reserved for the
long-term unemployed.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many of the jobs created will be permanent.
</P>
<P>
"That depends on a number of factors, beginning with the way
the economy is going and how well companies respond to the
government's tax incentives," said Labor Ministry Adviser Luciano
Forlani.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a coupon scheme imported from Britain has been put
aside for the moment because, according to Forlani, "It still
needs to be studied."
</P>
<P>
Negative reactions to the plan came from both ends of the
political spectrum in the country on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Treu keeps on giving us statistics. When will he give us some
facts?" asked Adriana Poli Bortone, ex-agriculture minister and
member of the hard-right National Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Franco Giordano, labor spokesman for the Communist
Refoundation, said that "certain parts of the plan are clearly in
opposition to its stated aims. The government must launch an
industrial plan compatible with the development of the south."
</P>
<P>
Treu's package provides for 146,000 "work-experience" contracts
to go to the economically depressed south of the country.

<HEADLINE> Korean Talks Seem Unlikely to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK)
embassy said today that vice-ministerial level talks between the
North and South Korea seem unlikely to resume in Beijing this
morning but that the two maintain close contacts.
</P>
<P>
Although Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and ROK
negotiators on Tuesday agreed to stay for two more days for their
first high level contact in four years, they are still far apart
and the talks are at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
If either side changes its position, it can propose further
talks, according to Jeong Se Hyun, the head of the ROK delegation.
</P>
<P>
Jeong said that at yesterday's talks there was no progress and
that the North wanted the South to provide half a million tons of
fertilizer for spring, while the South would give no more than
200,000 tons and insisted that the issue of separated families is
more urgent than that of the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that there are 400,000 elderly people who are
separated.
</P>
<P>
The head of the DPRK delegation, Chun Kum Chul, said the talks
did not succeed, but as soon as the South ships the fertilizer,
the reunion of separated families and other items will naturally
be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Chun was cautious about parliamentary talks between the two. He
was quoted as saying that they were a good idea and would be
considered, but that the South should first offer fertilizer
assistance to create an atmosphere conducive to improved relations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation was said to have planned to return home in
time for the 86th anniversary of the birth of late President Kim
Il Sung, on Wednesday, but that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that although the talks had no tangible
results, they were symbolic after the nearly four-year break.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing talks follow an inconclusive second round of
Four-Party Korean peace talks, which ended in Geneva on March 21
after six days.

<HEADLINE> China's Processing Sector to Spur Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts predicted that
the processing trade will shore up China's export in the face of
the crippling financial crisis in East and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
While currency devaluation in neighbouring countries is putting
heavy pressure on China's exports as a whole, the processing
trade, the raw materials for which mainly come from the affected
countries, has suffered relatively little since devaluation has
reduced import costs, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, although the countries that have devalued their
currencies have obtained price advantages in terms of their
exported products, the majority of those products fall into the
processing trade category, which will not pose a formidable threat
to China's processing trade.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, devaluation raised the cost of importing raw
materials, eroding profit margins.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the crisis-hit countries do not possess
sufficient production capacity to increase their exports
significantly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, only 11 to 15 percent of China's exports overlap
with those of the problem countries, and in the field of textiles
exports, many Western countries allocated quotas to foreign
exporters, which nullifies price competition.
</P>
<P>
Some trade insiders argue that the world market is favorable
for Chinese exports. And it is predicted that world trade will
increase at a rate of seven percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: China's Officials Talk About East and West Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The "Golden Era" of the
cooperation for China's west and east areas is expected to
approach in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jian, Vice-Governor of east China's Jiangsu Province,
said that at the '98 Investment and Trade Fair for Cooperation
between East and West China, which was held in the capital of
Shannxi province recently.
</P>
<P>
Like Liu, many officials from China's east and west provinces
and municipalities, including Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shanxi and
Shanghai, were also active in telling the press from home and
abroad about their new ideas on the cooperation between east
and west China.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Andong, Governor of northwest China's Shaanxi province,
said that the province, which is located at the point in between
China's east and west areas, should act as an intermediate for
promoting the two areas' cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The most distinct characteristic of this year's investment and
trade fair is the increasing number of property right exchange
items, compared with the first one held in 1997, said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that among the total of 4,602 trade
items put forward to the fair this year, 2,175 ones are concerning
property right exchange and 324 contracts about such exchange have
been signed, with the total business volume hitting 7.95 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhibang, Vice-Governor of Shaanxi province, said that
introducing property right exchange into the cooperation between
east and west China is really a significant breakthrough, which
will contribute to the country's assets relocation.
</P>
<P>
Li Dachang, Vice-Governor of southwest China's Sichuan
province, was a high-profile supporter of "West-West Cooperation"
at the fair.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of east and west cooperation goes
smoothly in the areas with relatively better traffic facilities
and more talents, but slows down in those places with poor
conditions. He suggests that cooperation among west areas should
also be improved.
</P>
<P>
Hu Wei, Deputy Director of the Administrative Committee of
Pudong New Area of Shanghai, raised that "Ideas Cooperation" is
also a good method for the further development in west China.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Pudong has benefited much from the experience of
Shenzhen, one of China's pilot cities carrying out the country's
policy of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience is also beneficial to the west areas." said
Hu.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Have First Surplus Budget in a Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government
submitted a draft of the 1999 budget to the parliament on Tuesday,
the first surplus budget in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
The budget surplus will reach 2 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) next year.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government predicts the GDP growth rate will hit 3
percent this year, 3.1 percent in 1999 and 3.4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the official unemployment rate will go down from 8
percent to 4 percent, and inflation will still be under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sweden will also increase its foreign aid by 2.4 billion crowns
(about 300 million U.S. dollars) in the next three years. The
amount of foreign aid will reach 0.73 percent of its gross
national income by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government will also spend an additional one
billion crowns (about 125 million U.S. dollars) a year on
cooperative projects in the Baltic Sea region and in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
A major problem in the Swedish economy is heavy national
debts. As the economy improves, the national debt, which stands at
78.6 percent this year, will be reduced to 74.7 percent next year
and 69.9 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, winning support from most parties in the
parliament, faces some resistance from opposition parties. The
opposition says the surplus budget proposed by the Social
Democratic government is an effort to woo voters since the country
will hold general elections in September.

<HEADLINE> Galanz Aims to Become No. 1 In Microwaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Galanz Enterprise
(Group) Co., is striving to become the world's largest producer of
microwave ovens in 1998, after grabbing the lion's share of
China's market in a fierce price war last year, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Its target is to take 15 percent of the global market and the
company plans to produce and sell 4.5 million microwave ovens this
year, 3 million for the domestic market and 1.5 million to be sold
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"This year will be the hardest year and the crucial year for
our company, " said an official from Galanz.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goals, the company has set the marketing strategy
of "consolidating and developing the domestic market while
actively exploring overseas markets."
</P>
<P>
Galanz Co., based in Guangdong Shunde, dominate China's market
for microwave ovens with a 60 percent share. The ratio is expected
to increase to 65 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The core of the company's strategy is to bankrupt rivals with
its low prices, backed by its large scale production.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Galanz is soon likely to achieve the
ambitious goal of becoming the world's No.1 microwave oven
producer, as Galanz is now the largest enterprise specializing in
their manufacture.

MONTEVIDEO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Paraguayan championship
was suspended for a month on Tuesday after the players decided to
go on strike over their transfer rules.
</P>
<P>
The players' union said it was going on strike for two weeks

At present, the players can transfer only if and when their

The Paraguayan Federation said it had halted the championship
in an effort to find a solution. The strike caused chaos on

<HEADLINE> Textile Export Facing Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's textile export will face
challenges in view of the country's textile sector and the
Southeast Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Although China has given quota priority and tax refunds to
stimulate textile exports, it will still take time for the
expensive domestic cotton industry to meet international
standards, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's textile exports saw progress last year, but those from
processing imported materials accounted for the major increase
while general exports actually experienced a decline.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the inappropriate exports structure, domestic
companies will face more competition this year from Southeast
Asian countries whose exports are likely to benefit from the sharp
devaluation of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, China's textile exports still have opportunities to
recover as the country becomes more competitive by raising tax
rebates in the sector and doing more processing trade using
imported resources.
</P>
<P>
Although the export price of other major Asian textile
exporters is much cheaper due to the financial crisis, it will be
more expensive for them to import raw materials because of
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
This is good news for China, because the prices of imported raw
materials are dropping faster than the prices of the processed
goods exported.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's textile exports saw remarkable progress to
reach a record 45.6 billion US dollars worth of garment and
textile products, the highest figure to date.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academician Says Rights And Interest Important On Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The protection of intellectual
property rights on the Internet needs to consider the balance of
the interests of copyright holders and the interests of the
public, according to Xue Hong of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences' Intellectual Property Rights Center.
</P>
<P>
Xue told a Sino-French Symposium on Intellectual Property
Rights here this week that the Internet has become a hot topic in
the Chinese press and that this has also led to copyright
infringements.
</P>
<P>
One example he cited was of a publishing house releasing a book
with the title "Financial Turmoil" that had been downloaded from
the Internet. The protection of intellectual property rights on
the web is uncharted territory in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a number of international treaties on intellectual
property rights, and if these treaties include information on the
Internet as part of their area of protection, China will have to
modify its laws to meet its international obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that over-regulation must be avoided in
intellectual property rights protection on the Internet and that
rights should not be concentrated in the hands of a few people
while others who use the information to create new things are
deprived of it.

<HEADLINE> Panama Suggests Gradual ALCA Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CITY OF PANAMA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations to create
the Free Trade Zone of the Americas (ALCA) should have a gradual
liberalization process to avoid a negative impact on less
developed economies in the region, Laura Elena Flores, Panama's
vice minister of commerce and industry, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"we are speaking of an opening process. Every country forming
ALCA will have to make some concessions, not only Panama," the
official said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said the economic development level of ALCA
member countries as well as other technical issues will be
addressed by the commissions created for the above mentioned
purpose in May when negotiations start in Miami.
</P>
<P>
She suggested a greater liberalization of the services sector,
because the economy of Panama is mainly based on services such as
the Panama channel, the colon free trade zone and the
international banking center, which is formed by 104 different
banks of the world.
</P>
<P>
Flores said ALCA negotiations will not stop Panama from signing
free trade bilateral agreements with Chile and Mexico. ALCA will
have a potential of reaching 800 million consumers,
</P>
<P>
"Panama is very pleased to have been elected headquarters for
the ALCA negotiations. We estimate that our tourist sector will
receive an additional figure of eight million dollars," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements with San Jose, Costa Rica, the major
negotiations will be held periodically in Miami from May 1998 to
February 2001, in Panama from March 2001 to February 2003 and
Mexico from March 2003 to December 2005.
</P>
<P>
The countries ministers expect the negotiations to end by the
year 2005 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Nine negotiating tables were created as part of the ALCA
structure: access to markets, investment in services, public
sector purchases, conflict solutions, agriculture, rights of
intellectual property, allowances, anti-dumping and competition
policies.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica, the ministers agreed to create an advisory group
headed by Barbados, which will receive outlines and suggestions
from the civil society.
</P>
<P>
The formal date for the beginning of the ALCA negotiations will
be specified during the second summit of the Americas on April 18
and 19 in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian vice minister said the Santiago meeting will be
conclusive for the development of continental trade, because
interests of developed and less-developed countries will have to
be joined.
</P>
<P>
More than 34 presidents around the world will meet in Santiago
to sign the agreements from the previous March round, which took
place in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
One of the central issues to be addressed at the summit of
American presidents will be the preferential treatment to be
enjoyed by ALCA nations.
</P>
<P>
Panama recently signed an agreement with the Andean Community
to begin negotiations on establishing a free trade zone with the
group.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Coalition Agrees on Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Five parties of the Albanian
coalition government Monday reached an agreement on reorganizing
the government following weeks of bickering.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed on setting up a consultative system,
retaining the preportions of representation of each party in the
government while re-distributing government positions within the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The parties were first united shortly before elections in June
1997. The elections were called ahead of time after nation-wide
unrest triggered by the collapse of fraudulent savings schemes
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
But the new coalition government has been criticized for
ineptitude in restoring stability and managing the nation's
economy, and for being corrupt.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, which is the biggest in the coalition, has
said it would reorganize the government single-handedly, but this
caused dissatisfaction among other parties.
</P>
<P>
Tensions were eased Sunday as the Socialist Prime Minister

ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian police arrested a powerful
Sicilian Mafia boss near Palermo on Tuesday after an eight-month
manhunt.
</P>
<P>
Police caught Vito Vitale in the Mafia citadel of San Giuseppe
Jato after following his mistress, a 30-year-old woman known as
Barretta.
</P>
<P>
Unaware she was being followed, Vitale emerged from a house,
hugged his girlfriend and found himself surrounded by police.
</P>
<P>
Vitale, 39, is regarded by police as heir to the jailed
Sicilian Godfather Toto Riina, who was arrested in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Palermo anti-Mafia prosecutor's office said the arrest of
Vitale, infamous for his cruelty and thirst for power, was a great

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Captain to Miss World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. soccer team captain John
Harkes, one of the most experience American players, was dropped
from the World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
U.S. soccer coach Steve Sampson said in a teleconference call
that he had dropped Harkes -- a veteran of the 1990 and 1994 World
cups, and who has played 90 times for the United States -- because
of a combination of poor play and unspecified "leadership issues."
</P>
<P>
He declined to go into details about the question of leadership
from a player who has been the heart and soul of the U.S. team for
eight years and has led Washington D.C. United to two consecutive
Major League Soccer championships.
</P>
<P>
"Out of respect for an individual who has performed so well (in
the past) and contributed so much to U.S. soccer, he deserves the
right for our conversation to remain private," Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Harkes had accepted Sampson's decision to
play him in recent games at left-back rather than in midfield, he
felt the player "did not embrace the decision.
</P>
<P>
"The national team must play as a unit and understand that," he
said, hinting at creative differences with the strong-willed
Harkes.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Harkes' reaction when he told him he would not be
going to France in June, Sampson said: "Enormous disappointment, I
don't know if 'shock' is the word. But John realizes there are
things in his game he needed to improve."
</P>
<P>
Harkes, who has extensive experience in the English Premier
League with Sheffield Wednesday and Derby County and was in the
U.S. team that reached the second round of the World Cup finals in
1994, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
Sampson suggested his place is likely to be taken by Chad
Deering, who has played only six times for Sampson, but is
performing well in the German Bundesliga with Wolfsburg, where he
plays alongside U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have been drawn to play against former world
champions Germany in their World Cup first-round opener on June 15
in Paris. They then face Iran on June 21 and then play Yugoslavia
in Nantes on June 25.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's legal system will protect
foreign investors against unfair competition, according to Li
Bida, an official of the State Administration of Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Li told a Sino-French symposium on intellectual property rights
protection ending Tuesday here that, since Unfair Competition Law
took effect in 1993, his office has dealt with a great number of
cases of unfair competition, including intellectual property
rights infringement.
</P>

He said that the office has dealt with problems of faked
foreign alcoholic drinks, electric appliances and trademarks in
accordance with international agreements and Chinese law and
investigated 14,891 cases of unfair competition and 29,034 cases
of selling fake goods in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China has a multi-level legal system to protect foreign
investors that includes the Trademark Law, Patent Law and
Copyright Law, at the lower level, and the Unfair Competition Law
at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has signed international intellectual
property rights protection agreements and has measures to protect
intellectual property rights of foreign investors and that this
will be stronger if China is admitted to the World Trade

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a world-class
patent rights system for biotechnological discoveries, according
to an official from the State Department of Intellectual Property
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qingkui told participants attending a Sino-French
symposium on the protection of property rights that China's
patents system basically equals that of the advanced world
standards.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has expanded its patent system to
discoveries in the fields of microbes and genetic substances.
</P>
<P>
China has signed a number of international accords on
biotechnological patent rights, with related agreements
facilitating procedures for Chinese and foreign scientists
applying for and obtaining patent rights for inventions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
China does not as yet grant patent rights for the development
of generically engineered or cross-bred animal and plant species,
and it does nonetheless protect patent rights for technology used
to develop related species.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhang said, China will continue to improve the
policies and methods for protecting biotechnological patent rights
in order to keep pace with the worldwide development of
biotechnology.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Budget Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's budget
deficit rose sharply to 12.4 billion pesos (326 million U.S.
dollars) in the first quarter this year due to poor tariff
collections triggered by the depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer Wednesday quoted National Treasurer
Caridad Valdehuesa as saying that "it has been a difficult second
semester last year so it's foolhardy to expect the fiscal
situation will improve overnight."
</P>
<P>
Valdehuesa said the deficit was lower than the 14 billion pesos
(368 million dollars) programmed by the government, but higher
than the 6.69 billion pesos (176 million dollars) recorded during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As of end-March this year, the government's revenues reached
103.04 billion pesos (2.711 billion dollars) while expenditures
were kept at 115.43 billion pesos (3.037 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deficit was specifically rooted to the huge shortfalls in
the revenue collection of the Bureau of Customs which yielded only
18.9 billion pesos (497 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Valdehuesa said she expected the fiscal position to rebound in
the second quarter when tax payments would have been remitted.
</P>
<P>
She expressed confidence that despite the initial deficits, the
government would still be able to meet the 5-billion-peso (131
million dollars) surplus target pledged to the International
Monetary Fund by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government managed a 1.6-billion-peso (42
million dollars) budget surplus last year despite the economic
difficulties incurred by the financial storm sweeping Southeast
and East Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is to accelerate the
growth of its computer industry to make it a new pillar industry
by the beginning of the next century, Vice-Mayor Jiang Yiren told
industry leaders at the recent Shanghai Computer Application and
Development Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the industry's development plan for 1998, output value is
projected to hit 14 billion yuan (1.7 billion U.S. dollars), up 40
percent over 1997. That for software and applications will reach
2.3 billion yuan (277 million U.S dollars), up 50 percent over
last year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 450,000 computers, 1.4 million monitors,
two million printers and 10 million chips will be produced this
year. Production of each of these items will be more than double
that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of computerized cash machines, such as ATMs and point of
sale machines, will reach one billion yuan in value.
</P>
<P>
Twenty software companies, each with their own specific strong
points and annual outputs surpassing 50 million yuan will receive
extra support from the city.
</P>
<P>
Electronic business will take off this year, Jiang noted,
adding the city will begin a test online retailing project soon.
</P>
<P>
So far there are 3,000 computer or software companies and
research institutes in the city. More than 10 well-known foreign
information technology companies have set wholly owned or joint
ventures there to produce integrated circuits, printers and chips.
</P>
<P>
The city has absobed 400 million U.S. dollars in foreign
capital for computer projects. When all the projects are
operational, they will have annual sales estimated at one billion
US dollars.

<P>
SOFIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Feime Hassanova, the oldest woman
in Bulgaria, will celebrate her 119th birthday on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hassanova was born in Yanovska, a mountain hamlet near Madan in
the Rhodopes of south Bulgaria. She has been living there for more
than one hundred years.
</P>
<P>
Except for an hour-long trip to nearby Madan, she has never
left the village in her life, family members said.
</P>
<P>
Hassanova is the mother of five children who survived her three
sons. She has 16 grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren and three
great-great grandchildren. Her husband died at the age of 105.
</P>
<P>
Hassanova is famous among her neighbors for her passion for
sweets, disproving the prevailing theories that sugar is bad for
the health. Her relatives attribute her longevity to goat's milk,
which has been part of her diet for over 100 years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Bulgaria has more than 300
centenarians. Two thirds of them are women. Two more Bulgarian men
turned 100 in January.
</P>
<P>
Most of Bulgaria's centenarians live in the Rhodopes, 20 of
them in the Smolyan region. Asked by journalists to disclose the
secret of long life, they all say it is work in the open, anisette
and honey.

Lazio's most likely moment to score came after 74 minutes as

The remarks, made in a speech to students at Howard University,

world. "We very much don't want to be out there by ourselves as
the organizer and the only superpower," she said.

MOSCOW -- Chairman of the Russian State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) Gennady Seleznyov said Tuesday that the Duma should
approve Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister of the government.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov told a briefing after meeting with president Boris
Yeltsin that in his view, the fate of Russia is more important
than that of Kiriyenko, so he will make efforts to ensure the Duma
for its entire term.
</P>
<P>
He said if the new government does a bad work, the State Duma
can as well put forward its no-confidence motion to the government
a month later. (Russia-Duma-PM)

MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>

government to pour more emergency aid into five drought-stricken
provinces where at least 42 people have died of hunger.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UNDP Study Stresses Need for Managed Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Management, stronger financial
institutions and massive investment in training and capacity
building are necessary to prevent crises and make financial
liberalization work for economies and people, according to a new
study by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
"It is important to repair the damage of financial crises after
it is done," UNDP administrator James Gustave Speth said here on
Tuesday when the U.N. agency announced its new publication,
Perspectives on Financial Liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The new study was released at a time when the Southeast Asian
region is suffering from currency depreciations, soaring
unemployment, higher food and fuel prices and widespread social
and human distress.
</P>
<P>
"But it is even more important to be productive and prevent
these crises before they occur, especially in view of their high
human costs," Speth said.
</P>
<P>
14 financial market scholars and professionals from both the
North and the South have been involved in the study.
</P>
<P>
The study has found that the most successful countries are
those which have managed to attract capital flows while putting in
place safeguards to reduce their destablizing effects.
</P>
<P>
Those safeguards and additional reforms are essential because
international financial liberalization does not automatically
produce sustainable growth and human development, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the study indicates, when crises occur, policy
packages taking into full account social and environmental
concerns should be advised.
</P>
<P>
UNDP officials in charge of the study pointed out that the
current financial crisis in Southeast Asia is a clear illustration
of the effects financial vulnerabilities have on sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
"At current exchange rates," they said, "Indonesia's GDP will
shrink from 226 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 to 50 billion dollars
in 1998, and the Republic of Korea's and Thailand's economies will
shrink by 50 percent in 1998."
</P>
<P>
"Even in local currencies, growth rates in the region are
expected to be negative for the first time in decades," they
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls against Yen, Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell to a
seven-week low against the German mark Tuesday and declined
against other leading currencies on renewed belief that Japan
would further intervene the market to prop up the yen.
</P>
<P>
Investors also were cautious ahead of a meeting of finance
ministers from the world's major countries gathering in Washington
and apprehensive about how the Group of Seven might react to
Japan's efforts to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8020 marks,
down sharply from 1.8265 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that a major trade sent the dollar tumbling against
the mark, touching off more selling. At one point, the dollar fell
as low as 1.7985 marks, a level it hadn't seen since reaching
1.7938 marks on February. 25.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also changed hands at 129.55 yen, down
slightly from 129.60 yen Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday and Friday, Japan intervened heavily in foreign
exchange markets by selling dollars to prop up the yen. Traders
were reluctant early this week to buy or hold onto dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investors also are watching the outcome of Wednesday's G-7
meeting of major industrialized nations. Investors want to know if
the ministers will support Japan in further interventions.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.4927 Swiss francs, down from 1.5100; 6.0385 French francs, down
from 6.1125; 1,782.85 Italian lire, down from 1,801; and 1.4335
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4344.

The British pound was quoted at 1.6852 dollars, up from
1.6775 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
roared back into record high Tuesday as another favorable reading
on inflation and some respectable profit reports by major
companies fueled a market rally.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 97.90 points to 9,110.20, easily beating last
Monday's record of 9,033.23, the blue-chip barometer's first close
above 9,000. The Dow's gain for this year passed 15 percent --
more than double what many analysts had predicted for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares rose sharply in advance of Tuesday's profit
report by Intel -- due after the close -- but the broad market
posted more modest gains.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume increased to 611.42
million shares, from 563.91 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.06 to 1,115.75, and
the NYSE composite index rose 3.54 to 581.31.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.08 to 1,843.03, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.54 to 739.86.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip shares started the day strong after Dow components
Eastman Kodak, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, and J.P. Morgan reported
first-quarter results that met or exceeded Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's open, the Labor Department reported that its
Consumer Price Index was unchanged last month, after inching just
0.1 percent higher in February and holding steady in January.
Energy prices served as the chief bulwark against inflation in
March, falling 1.2 percent, the fourth drop in a row.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales
unexpectedly declined 0.1 percent in March.

<HEADLINE> Britain Concerned over French World Cup Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
expressed concern over a French minister's encouragement of
British football fans without World Cup tickets to visit France
this Summer.
</P>
<P>
French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine told a news
conference in London that all people would be welcome to visit
France to enjoy the biggest football tournament in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why people cannot come to France and enjoy
the atmosphere of the matches and the celebrations going on in the
towns," she said.
</P>
<P>
This statement is clearly contrary to a British government
campaign to persuade ticketless British fans not to travel to
France during the whole football tournament.
</P>
<P>
British Sports Minister Tony Banks said in a statement issued
Tuesday that Demessine's statement for British football fans was
"not helpful".
</P>
<P>
"For (ticketless) English and Scottish fans to go there is not
advisable and it's not something we're encouraging people to do,"
he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw also reaffirmed the
government policy by saying:"The message is a very simple one. If
you have no ticket, don't travel."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Concerned About Proposed World Court's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
Tuesday warned possibility of peacekeeping soldiers being brought
to a proposed world court, which the Clinton administration
strongly backs to set up to handle cases of genocide such as in
Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"What we're concerned about is that the court not be set up in
a way that gives it very broad authority to pursue a vague
definition of aggression," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told
reporters. He said only specific charges should be brought.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has for nearly four years supported
creation of a permanent international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have endorsed the idea of creating the court and have
given their blessing to the Pentagon to become the attack dog in
the United States' campaign to create a court more to Washington
liking, according to Tuesday's New York Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is concerned that the world court, if not
carefully structured, might be used to persecute peacekeeping
soldiers for doing their jobs. It believed the court's duties and
authority should be defined and should not be allowed to override
a responsible nation's legal system.
</P>
<P>
"In cases where a country monitors its own activities and moves
against violations of its own laws, we feel that the national
legal system should be given precedence over an international
prosecution," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Defense Department invited more than 100
foreign military attaches to the Pentagon to discuss U.S. concerns
about the world court, which is expected to be established at a
June meeting in Rome, which all U.N. members will attend.

<HEADLINE> IMF Seeks to Strengthen World Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) seeks to strengthen the world financial system during a
spring meeting scheduled to be held Thursday, said IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the fund's headquarters in
Washington, Camdessus said that three elements were "decisive" in
creating a more solid financial system.
</P>
<P>
The three elements are better information, orderly
liberalization of the capital market and continuous reform of
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Better dissemination of information is an extraordinary factor
for helping rational market expectations while facilitating more
accurate decisions," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee of the fund will meet Thursday morning
and discuss the role of the fund and other international
institutions in strengthening the financial structures,
transparency of the IMF, the role of the fund in managing crisis
and the involvement of the private sector in crisis resolution.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also hoped the meeting would adopt a code of conduct
on fiscal transparency by its members.
</P>
<P>
On Asia's financial crisis, Camdessus said it would have a mild
effect on world growth, but that the rise in global economic
output could bounce back to more than 4 percent in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Japan's weak economy was still a cause
for concern even though he was "quite encouraged" by a new set of
fiscal measures aimed at stimulating domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Camdessus said proposed reforms at the IMF itself
included giving its surveillance mechanisms more teeth, making
staff better able to warn countries of problems ahead.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Neighbors Urged to Help End Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special envoy
for Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi Tuesday called on the country's
neighbors to step up efforts to help end the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Brahimi said
there would be no peace in Afghanistan if without the cooperation
and help from its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these countries have a duty to help
Afghanistan make peace, which he said is in their mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the fact that there is a growing
understanding among the six neighbors of the magnitude of the
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expected that a meeting of the Steering Committee on
Afghanistan to be held soon in Islamabad, Pakistani capital, would
kick off a significant peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that not much progress has been made in
trying to bring the Afghan warring factions to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said he was glad to see the warm-up of ties
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, adding this would help settle the
conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the cooperation between the U.N. and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in this regard,
Brahimi said the two organizations are almost indistinguishable in
their ways of resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the OIC has not done enough and called for a
bigger role of the organization in helping end the Afghan civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Of the neighbors of Afghanistan, five are OIC members, he said,
proposing that the five could form a committee on trying to
resolve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived here Saturday from Pakistan to discuss
with Iranian leaders on ways of bringing peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Brahimi met with Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and Iranian
special envoy for Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says U.S. Doesn't Want to Be Sole Superpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that her country does not want to
be "the only superpower."
</P>
<P>
The remarks, made in a speech to students at Howard University,
appear to somewhat contradict the U.S. strategy of leading the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, she said, is striving to expand the
number of countries that are democratic and have free-market
systems.
</P>
<P>
"We very much don't want to be out there by ourselves as the
organizer and the only superpower," she said.
</P>
<P>
"People don't believe that. They think we just want to be king
of the hill, but we do not," she added.
</P>
<P>
The United States, with the biggest economy and strongest
military force in the world, remains the sole superpower after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the main rival of the U.S. during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the administration strives to develop alliances
and partnerships to encourage countries with similar views to
share the burden of leadership.
</P>
<P>
She also indicated that nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons were the biggest dangers to the United States in the
post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
"Those are weapons that know no boundaries... and they are a
huge threat to us," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The United States must protect its territory and people from a
range of problems, beginning with weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Canada Continues to Be a Nation on Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada continues to be a nation on
the move, but slowed down compared with previous years, Statistics
Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1996, 43 percent of Canadians moved to a
different location, compared with 47 percent between 1986 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
Over the period, Canadians continued to head west, with British
Columbia the biggest receiver of interprovincial migration.
</P>
<P>
A record 150,000 more people moved into the western coast
province than moved out. This was one-fifth higher than its net
flow between 1986 and 1991, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The largest net outflow among Canadian provinces occurred in
Ontario, which lost 47,000 more individuals than it gained.
</P>
<P>
The French-speaking province of Quebec also saw a net outflow
of people, which reached 37,400 over the period.
</P>
<P>
The statistics found that men and women aged 25 to 29 were the
most mobile. From this peak, mobility declined steadily with age.
</P>
<P>
Jobs are often an incentive for interprovincial migration, the
agency noted.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Releases Nine IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government Tuesday gave
early releases to nine Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners in an
effort to boost the Northern Ireland peace process, according to
BBC television reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Irish government official was quoted as saying in
Dublin that the early releases involved IRA prisoners who were
jailed for serious terrorist crimes including arms possession, but
not murder.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said that the release of prisoners from
the Irish Republic's top-security Portlaoise prison was seen as an
official attempt to help Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
secure party backing for the historic agreement on the future of
Northern Ireland reached last week.
</P>
<P>
At its annual party conference to be held in Dublin next
weekend, Sinn Fein is to discuss the peace agreement that
maintains Northern Ireland's links with Britain but builds
stronger cross-border bridges with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Pro-British Unionists have reacted angrily to the
release of these IRA prisoners by saying "this is clearly a
political move."
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael of the Democratic Ulster Party said, "It is an
indication that the IRA will continue to be appeased and we're
going to see more IRA terrorists being freed."

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Computer Bugs Catch Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials are calling the
public attention to an increasingly acute problem -- the year 2000
computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
"Although a small percent of computers will be affected, the
bugs will cost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars," said John
Koskinen, chairman of the newly established President Council on
Year 2000 Conversion, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in New York, Koskinen said the
government is trying to increase the awareness of the public and
tackle the problem in a really serious manner. He said the federal
government is to increase its investment in fixing the bugs to 4.7
billion U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
According to some computer experts, the Year 2000 bugs have to
be eliminated by January 1, 2000. Many old model computers read
the year as two digits, like 98. If those computer see 00, they
would misinterpret it as 1900, rather than 2000, and they could
crash.
</P>
<P>
But some others argue that the U.S., especially private sectors
of the country, are over-exaggerating the issue, because few
people or institutions are still using computers produced in the
1980s and their programs have been upgraded all the way through.
</P>
<P>
They said that software makers are trying to make big money out
of the potential market, which they say would exceed 600 billion
dollars for the whole world. They also complain that countries in
Asia lack sufficient preparation and their computer system would
in turn affect the U.S. systems.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that individuals and companies make more tests.
One simple way is to adjust the computer time to the last few
seconds of this century and wait and see what would happen.
Usually nothing would happen.
</P>
<P>
Koskinen said that practically all the personal computers and
probably 97 percent of networks would not have such an issue, but
mission-critical networks, he said, such as those installed in
banks and hospitals, really need a close look. He said his agency
is to help the government and the general public to figure out the
status of their systems: What are their major risks? What are the
most significant obstacles to removing those risks? What
contingency plans are appropriate in light of that analysis?
</P>
<P>
Analysts also say that the banks involved in mega-merges these
days have to figure out if they can knit together their computer
systems and, at the same time, take care of their Year 2000
computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
Before the travelers deal, Citicorp said it would spend 600
million dollars by the end of 1998 fixing the Year 2000
problems. Many banks have computer systems built up over decades
-- combinations of old mainframes and new PCs from various
makers. The software that runs a bank's system is typically
unique to that bank and would trouble working with systems from
other banks, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Koskinen said that "We have only a bit more than 600 days left
until January 1, 2000, and the question is how can we work
together to ensure that the federal, state and local governments,
those in the private sector, and leaders in other countries are
doing all that they can to minimize disruption to systems on the
first day of the next century."
