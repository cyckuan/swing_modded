<HEADLINE> USDA Forecasts Another Record Soybean and Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to good prices, the
U.S. farmers plan or intend to plant another record soybean crop
this Spring, and also the biggest corn crop in 13 years, the
Agriculture Department (USDA) predicted here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prediction came following the department's survey of some
57,000 farmers across the country which provides the first
official indications of the major crops that will be harvested
this year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that farmers will plant 80.8 million acres of
corn, a 1 percent increase over last year and the biggest acreage
since 1985. Based on an average yield of 130 bushels an acre, that
would translate into a harvest of over 10 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
Soybean plantings, which have been steadily rising as farmers
seek to take advantage of higher prices, are estimated at 72
million acres. That is 2 percent higher than last year's record
crop and would produce about 2.8 billion bushels based on yield of
39 bushels per acre.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Humanitarian Aid for Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations here on Tuesday
appealed for 79 million U.S. dollars to bolster urgently-needed
humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance for Somalia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
An additional 15.3 million dollars are needed to meet the most
pressing needs through June, in the wake of massive floods in the
country, according to the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Somalis lack access to education and basic health
services, the UN office said, adding that repeated outbreaks of
cholera, malaria and tuberculosis -- of one of the world's highest
incidences -- have drastically lowered life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to supply drugs and pharmaceuticals,
train health personnel, ensure safe drinking water, prevent
communicable diseases and rehabilitate schools, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Making the aid appeals are the Food and Agriculture
Organization, U.N. Development Program, U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, U.N. Fund for Population
Activities, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, U.N. Children's
Fund, World Food Program and World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, U.N. agencies operating in Somalia
have joined hands with non-governmental organizations and donor
governments in the assistance program.

<HEADLINE> Germany Admits Pilot Error in Last Year's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The German defense ministry on
Tuesday blamed a pilot error of a German air force passenger plane
as the main cause of its crash with a U.S. military cargo plane
off the southern African coast last year.
</P>
<P>
The mid-air collision, occurred on September 13, last year off
the coast of Namibia, killed all 33 people on board the Tupolev
154 of the German air force and the U.S. C-141 military cargo
plane.
</P>
<P>
In an investigation report on the crash, the German defense
ministry said the German plane was flying at the wrong altitude
when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
But the report also blamed the air control authorities in
Angola, which had been informed of the flight data of both planes,
for failing to prevent the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Neither the German nor the U.S. aircraft was equipped with
collision warning systems which should also have helped to avoid
the crash, the German defense ministry said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Commentary On Institutional Reform's Smooth Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, carries an article on Tuesday entitled "Ensuring A
Healthy and Smooth Implementation of Institutional Restructuring".
</P>
<P>
It calls the Plan concerning Institutional Restructuring of the
State Council "positive, steady and appropriate" because it was
set forth by the Party Central Committee and the State Council,
based on an overall collection of opinion.
</P>
<P>
The plan has won the support of officials and the general
public, but some problems have cropped up in some units and
attention must be paid to these problems and steps be taken to
ensure the smooth implementation.
</P>
<P>
The article underlines the significance of ideological
stability in the ranks of officials, especially leading officials,
since the reform is certain to affect the position of some
officials. Leading officials should be taught to give priority to
the whole situation and the interests of the Party and the people,
and should participate in the restructuring effort.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasizes the importance of continuity in the
government during the restructuring process to maintain the normal
government operation.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will be in compliance with the requirements
of the socialist market economy, changing the functions of
government to separate government administrations from enterprise
management and to hand over managerial power to enterprises. An
efficient, well-coordinated, and standardized administrative
system should be set up, the article says, and comprehensive
economic departments should turned into macro-economic control
departments, specialized economic departments should be adjusted
and trimmed, law-enforcement and supervision departments should be
reformed, and intermediate organizations formed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders should work hard and seriously prepare for handing over
power, the article says, and new leaders should take their new
posts as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
All government work should be orderly, with strict management
and discipline, and during institutional restructuring,
disciplinary and inspection work should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Profiteering or other infractions of the law and rules that
make use of the restructuring must be dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
The article quotes the late leader Deng Xiaoping as having said
in 1982 that institutional downsizing is a revolution and the
government cannot win the hearts of the people unless the
restructuring is carried out.
</P>
<P>
It further says that long-existing problems like the mixing of
government and business, the overlapping of different government
departments, the bloating of government offices, overstaffing,
inefficiency, and high levels of bureaucracy have hindered social
productivity, and affected the relationships between the Party and
Government, and the people.
</P>
<P>
The current reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive can
not speed up unless these problems are solved, the article says,
and officials in need should be helped to cope with the problems
they meet in their work and life, so as to ensure the smooth
implementation of these significant reforms.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Marketing Season Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco marketing
season opened Tuesday with prices ranging from 0.65 U.S. Dollar
to 5.9 U.S. Dollars per kilogram at the country's three auction
floors, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The highest price was offered at Boka tobacco auction floor
where the first bale fetched 5.9 Dollars, followed by the tobacco
sales floor where the first bale was sold at 2.3 Dollars while at
Burley Marketing Zimbabwe the crop was being sold at 0.65 Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The three floors expected the prices to firm as the season
progresses in view of the shortage of tobacco on the world market
due to reduced production from some of the major growing
countries.
</P>
<P>
This year's production of 220 million kilograms was expected
to earn the country in excess of seven billion Zimbabwean Dollars
(about 420 million U.S. Dollars) which the crop brought in last
year.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.
Zimbabwe's tobacco auction market is one of the world's largest
tobacco auction markets.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the market is still cautious but we have a nice
crop which gives us hope that the prices will pick up later given
the shortage in the world," said Chris Molam, chief executive of
the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association.
</P>
<P>
However, some farmers were not satisfied with the prices and
quickly indicated that they would be taking their crop back to
their farms while they watched the market.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Dips to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
fell below the 5 Rand per U.S. Dollar mark Monday to its weakest
ever level after the release of poor economic data and a
resurgence of the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
A narrower than expected trade surplus in February helped push
the Rand to a record low of 5.0210 against the Dollar from 4.9740
at the start of the day's trading, Business Day paper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures showed that South Africa recorded a trade
surplus of only 511.5 million Rand (102 million Dollars) in
February, slightly up from 475.9 million Rand (94.8 million
Dollars) in January. Exports increased 5 percent to 11.06
billion Rand (2.2 billion Dollars) from the January figure.
</P>
<P>
Economists blamed this year's lackluster trade performance on
the Asian crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"With several economies in Asia still struggling to stay on
their feet and Zimbabwe - South Africa's largest trading partner
in Africa - suffering from its own currency and political crisis,
South African commodity exports have been hit," the paper quoted
Mike Schussler, a bank economist, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Combined exports to Asia and Africa account for 45 percent of
the country's export volume.
</P>
<P>
The firmness of the dollar also contributed to the slip of the
Rand.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Transport Department to Go Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Parts of South Africa's
Transport Department will be commercialized this week, saving
huge sum of money for the government, Transport Minister Mac
Maharaj said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Three chief directorates would operate as autonomous statutory
agencies along business lines from Wednesday, which would save
the state 91 million Rand (18.1 million U.S. Dollars) a year,
South African Press Association quoted Maharaj as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Each of the new bodies will have its own income stream,"
Maharaj said, noting that the transfer of 405 staff from the
department to the agencies would save an annual 50 million Rand
(10 million Dollars) on the state's wage bill.
</P>
<P>
The three new bodies are the South African National Road
Agency (NRA), the Cross-border Transport Agency (CBTA) and the
South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA), Maharaj said.
</P>
<P>
The NRA would be responsible for providing and managing the
country's primary road network, including road safety and traffic
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Its income would originate from petrol levies, toll fees and
fines, and parliament might also allocate money to it from time
to time.
</P>
<P>
The CBTA, responsible for regulating cross-border road
transport, would get its income mainly from fees charged for
cross-border permits, and it would be self-sufficient from its
inception.
</P>
<P>
SAMSA's mission was to serve the maritime industry by ensuring
the safety of life and property at sea and preventing sea
pollution by ships, Maharaj said.
</P>
<P>
A civil aviation safety agency would be set up in October,
saving an additional 34 million Rand (6.8 million Dollars) a
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agencies have signed formal agreements with the minister,
detailing their mandate and responsibilities, and they would have
to submit an annual business plan to him, Maharaj added.
</P>
<P>
"My task is to ensure that they operate on business principles
and exercise their powers correctly," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier in London to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
Tuesday that his on-going visit to Britain was aimed at deepening
understanding, expanding common ground, enhancing friendship and
promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks upon his arrival at London airport Tuesday
afternoon on a three-day official visit at the invitation of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
He said the smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong has
created favorable conditions for better and closer China-Britain
relations.
</P>
<P>
"At this important cross-century historical juncture, I believe
that, to develop the friendly relations of long-term stability and
cooperation between China and Britain on the basis of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two countries, but also facilitates
closer cooperation between Asia and Europe, and benefit world
peace, stability and prosperity," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said he looked forward to having an in-depth exchange of
views with Prime Minister Tony Blair on bilateral relations and
international issues of mutual interest, and working together for
the establishment of the 21st century-oriented China-Britain
relationship.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Britain, the Chinese premier will also
attend the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM II).
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to exchanging views with the leaders of the
participating countries on governing the cooperation between Asia
and Europe and on issues of common interests," Zhu said. "ASEM II
conference will have important impact on establishing partnership
between Asia and Europe oriented toward the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
At the ASEM summit from April 3 to 4, leaders of 10 East and
Southeast Asian countries and 15 member states of the European
Union (EU) will discuss concerned issues in economic, political
and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Zhu will also meet Queen Elizabeth II and local business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The China-Britain relationship has been developing steadily
over the past 50 years. Britain declared recognition of the
People's Republic of China in 1950. In 1972, the two countries
signed a joint communique to upgrade their relations to
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese government resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, bilateral ties have
turned a new page with more high-level exchange of visits and
further expansion of trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the volume of Sino-British trade reached 5.79
billion U.S. dollars, a 13.9 percent increase over the previous
year. Britain has become China's second largest trade partner
among the EU member states.

<HEADLINE> Former French PM Defends Rwanda Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur defended France's decision to launch the
"Turquoise" military operation in Rwanda during the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Balladur, who was then prime minister, told the daily Le Monde
Tuesday that France was the only major power "to have taken
initiative to avoid the more tragic consequences of this genocide."
</P>
<P>
France sent thousands of troops in 1994 to the central African
state to curb the horrifying atrocities. The bloody ethnic
violence between Hutu and Tutsis raging over Rwanda from April
through July have claimed one million people's lives and sent
millions into refuge.
</P>
<P>
Balladur also said that the French government had stopped all
arms deliveries to Rwanda since the summer of 1993. Paris was the
major arms supplier to Rwanda, which is one of the world's least
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"All (deliveries) were stopped since the summer of 1993 and no
authorization of export of war materials had since been given by the
Matignon," he said, referring to the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Some French historians have suspected that the operation was
aimed at protecting the retreating Hutu troops and militias who
were held responsible for the million people's death.
</P>
<P>
Suspicion is now focused on some staff members of the then President
Francois Mitterrand, who was suspected to have played dubious roles in
Rwanda before the genocide took place.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly has set up a committee, headed by
socialist member of parliament Paul Quiles, to probe the role
France played before and during the genocide.

According to the RENAMO president, the National Electoral

<P>
MAPUTO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Osorio Mateus, director of
Mozambique's National Committee of De-mining (CND), announced
here Tuesday that Canada will provide about seven million U.S.
Dollars to help the country in landmine clearance.
</P>
<P>
The aid, he said, will be used mainly in three special areas,
namely the improvement on conditions in landmine investigation,
the digitalization of maps in mine-heavy zones and technological
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will be completed in two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, the governments of United States
and Japan have also announced about two-million-Dollar aid to rid
landmines in Mzassingir Dam in Gaza Province, southern Mozambique
and its environs, which had been regarded as the barn of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reports said there were two million landmines planted all over
Mozambique during the 16-year civil war. Last year, over 50,000
mines were cleared. But there is still a long way to go.

<HEADLINE> Botswana President Retires From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President
Ketumile Masire Tuesday retired from active politics after 18
years in power, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Masire, 72, handed over the reins to his deputy, Festus Mogae,
who is to be sworn in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Masire, a former school-teacher who is retiring to farming,
leaves behind an economy renowned as one of Africa's economic
successes despite a severe wealth gap.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has a single-digit inflation, strong economic growth,
falling interest rates and foreign exchange reserves that rank,
on a per capita basis, as the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
But stark income disparity has been the main drawback of the
Masire government's economic policies: the landlocked country's
official unemployment rate stands at 21 percent, while about 40
percent of the 1.5 million population are estimated to live below
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Masire's retirement a year ahead of scheduled general
elections is seen as an effort to help consolidate Mogae's
standing within the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). Mogae
will become head of the BDP Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The BDP, which has ruled the country since independence in
1966, faces strong challenges from the opposition Botswana
National Front in the 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
Mogae is due to announce a reshuffled cabinet within days of
assuming office.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Seretse Khama, commander of Botswana
Defense Force, also retired earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Masire announced his retirement in November 1997, after a
referendum approved amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution limits a Botswanan president's term of
office to 10 years, lowers the voting age from 21 to 18 years and
provides for an independent electoral commission to watch general
elections.

Most of the aircraft flew too high to be identified, but on 29
occasions they were identified as aircraft used by the coalition
forces in the region, although nationalities could not be

Still, the secretary-General observed that "UNIKOM continued

The U.N. chief also reports that UNIKOM has destroyed a total

"Unexploded mines and bomblets inside the demilitarized zone,
mostly on the Iraqi side, continued to cause casualties to

<HEADLINE> EU Begins Entry Talks With Six Front-Runner Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union
(EU) Tuesday began accession talks with five eastern European
countries and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The six front-runners -- Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus -- finally got down to business after
a total of 11 EU candidates presented their credentials for
joining the bloc on Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"Today marks the formal start to the accession negotiations,
the beginning of a series of inter-governmental conferences," said
an EU diplomat.
</P>
<P>
However, even the most hopeful candidate out of the six is not
expected to join the wealthy club until 2002 or 2003 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
The EU candidates have to do what they can to reform their
economies and public administrations in order to meet the strict
criteria set by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wealthy western bloc must radically restructure
itself to prevent gridlock in a future Union of over two dozen
member states and a single market of nearly 500 million people.
</P>
<P>
Some present EU member states will have to give up coveted farm
subsidies and regional development funds to the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, chairing the meeting of
EU foreign ministers as EU president, Tuesday welcomed the six
with a general opening statement and also offered individual
remarks to each of the EU hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
"We must now press ahead with the detailed business of the
negotiations...I hope our work will make swift progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
The six were scheduled to have a 30-45 minute session with EU
foreign ministers on Tuesday, setting out key elements of the
accession process.

TUNIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian government signed here
Tuesday a funding accord with the European Investment Bank, under
which the bank would provide Tunisia with a 50 million-U.S.-dollar
loan to finance a number of environmental projects in 19 cities.
</P>
<P>
It was the first agreement of its kind concluded by Tunisia and
the European Union since the partnership accord between the two
sides signed on July 17, 1995 went into effect on March 1,
according to the Tunisian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The projects to be financed by the bank, including the
establishment of a network to recover waste water and a water
purification station in each of the cities concerned, are within
the framework of the country's ninth development plan from 1997
to 2001 in the environmental field.
</P>
<P>
About 380,000 inhabitants will be benefited from the projects,
the agency said.
</P>

The accord was signed by Tunisian Minister of International
Cooperation and Foreign Investment Mohamed Channouchi, and the
bank's deputy chairwoman, Arian Opolanski, who is currently

<HEADLINE> VW Mulling Counterattack in Rolls-Royce Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Volkswagen AG did not see
itself out of the race to take over the British luxury carmaker
Rolls-Royce and is considering a higher bid to outgun the current
winner, BMW, German press reports said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Bild newspaper, Volkswagen is planning
to raise its current bid for Rolls-Royce by 200 million German
marks (110 million U.S. dollars) to about 1.7 billion marks (920
million dollars). It is offering to buy the Cosworth engine-making
unit of Vickers PLC, the British engineering group which is the
current owner Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen, however, declined to make any comment on the press
report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six months after putting Rolls-Royce on the market last
October, Vickers announced on Monday that it had agreed to sell
the company to BMW for 340 million pounds (570 million dollars)
after considering separate offers from BMW, Volkswagen, a British
investment bank and a consortium of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts who
hope to rescue their beloved company from foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the sale to BMW has still to be approved by
Vickers shareholders in May. Each bidder still has a chance to
improve its offer.
</P>
<P>
However, BMW chief Bernd Pischetsrieder on Tuesday expressed
confidence that his company would win the final approval in May.
Meanwhile, he also reiterated his threat to cease supplying V-12
engines for Rolls-Royce's new Silver Seraph limousines if BMW were
unable to take control.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Munich, Pischetsrieder also
outlined a plan about Rolls-Royce, saying that the company would
remain independent after the takeover and retain its headquarters
in Crewe.
</P>
<P>
BMW has also said that it could pump some 1.6 billion dollars
into Rolls-Royce to gradually broaden its product line and to
triple its output to 6,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a good business year in 1997, both BMW and
Volkswagen are now eager to enter the rarefied niche market of
super-luxury automobiles symbolized by Rolls-Royce.

JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, due to visit Beijing on April 9, said
that his forthcoming visit to China shows that South Africa
attaches great importance to promoting relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive meeting with Chinese ambassador Wang Xuexian
in Pretoria, Mbeki said he had been looking forward to starting
the visit, which would be his second since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said China is a very important country, and that South
Africa and China have "a solid and stable political foundation
for establishment of bilateral relations".
</P>
<P>
South Africa expects to further its cooperation with China in
political, economical and many other fields following his coming
trip to China, during which bilateral trade issues will be top on
the agenda, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
China established diplomatic relations with South Africa on

</P>
<P>
Referring to cooperation in international affairs, Mbeki said
South Africa, currently the chairman of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, has been trying to play its
positive role in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa, which will host the summit meeting of
the Non-Aligned Movement at the end of the year, can not well
fulfill its internationalist duty without support from China.

<P>
It will be instrumental to regional and international
cooperation if South Africa and China take same position over the
important world issues, the deputy president added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Revenue Collection Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
continued to record unsatisfactory fiscal performance in February
with revenue collection dropping further to 43.3 billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 65.6 million U.S. Dollars) from 47.9 billion
shillings in January.
</P>
<P>
The collection is also 9.4 billion Shillings lower than the
target of 52.7 billion shillings, according to a monthly economic
review by the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) made available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the government collected 53.6 billion
shillings.
</P>
<P>
On cumulative basis, the government also failed to meet the
target of revenue collection during the past seven months.
Between last July and February this year, the government
collected 403.2 billion shillings, or 92 percent of the target.
</P>
<P>
The recurrent expenditures, fortunately, decreased from 63.3
billion shillings in January to 56 billion shillings in February.
The expenditure accounts for 72.4 percent of the targeted
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of the 1997/98 fiscal year
starting from last July, the government spent 430.8 billion
shillings, or 46.4 percent of the annual budgeted expenditure of
927.5 billion shillings, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The low level of expenditure has been attributed to the
continued adherence to the cash budget system whereby expenditure
depends on the revenue collected.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the government reduced its external
debt by 4.3 billion shillings during the period under review
while bank borrowing increased from 7.1 billion shillings in
January to 9.9 billion Shillings in February.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures continued to decline reaching 14.7
percent in February, against 15.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The decline is partly attributed to small increases in prices
in all non-food groups such as rents, fuel, power, water,
clothing and footwear, compared to the previous month, the report
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Commonwealth team
arrived in Freetown Tuesday for talks with President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah on how to rebuild Sierra Leone and ensure lasting peace
the country, report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the team was led by Zimbabwean Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge, and included British Junior Foreign Office
Minister Tony Iloyd, Ghanian Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho plus
senior officials from Malaysia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The team is meeting the president on how the Commonwealth can
help in national reconstruction and also build peace," Justice
Minister Solomon Berewa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The visit of the Commonwealth team is a symbolic show of
support for the return of democracy to Sierra Leone," a western
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's military coup last May had sparked off fierce
fightings between the military junta of Johnny Paul Koroma and
the West Africa peace-keeping force, ECOMOG.

Though the junta was toppled by ECOMOG in mid-February and
ousted civilian president Kabbah had resumed office earlier this
month, fighting is still on in the eastern part of the country.

<P>
The war has severely damaged Sierra Leone's infrastructure
facilities and economic basis, and has forced tens of thousands
of people to flee their homes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Company to Develop Nickel in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Anglo-American
Corporation of South Africa has said the mining of abundant
deposits of nickel discovered in west Tanzania will take off by the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the New Mining Business Division of the company,
Robert Danchin, told reporters in Dar es Salaam Monday evening that
his company has spotted nickel resources in the Ngara District of
Kagera Region bordering Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Danchin, who held talks with President Benjamin Mkapa and Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye Monday in different occasions, said
that the company has also discovered interesting gold deposits in
Kahama and Geita.
</P>
<P>
He said other gold deposits also earmarked for mining are in the
regions of Mara, Mbeya and Iringa, where small scale miners are
operating.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to start mining gold deposits in the country in the
next four to five years," Danchin said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also hinted that the Anglo-American company has pumped
some 90 million US dollars into prospecting activities since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, a country rich in gold, diamonds, rubies, nickel, copper
and cobalt, has attracted mining companies from South Africa,
Australia, Canada, Britain and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is paying greater attention to the
development of minerals. According to official sources, the
country's mineral sector is currently contributing 1.4 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), up from a mere 0.5 percent in
the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Former Liberian Warlord Named Envoy to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Roosevelt Johnson, a former key
warlord in Liberia's civil war and Minister of Rural Development
in the post-war government, was named Tuesday the country's new
ambassador to India.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was described as a "safety measure" taken by
President Charles Taylor to reduce the current tension in the
Liberian capital Monrovia, according to a British Broadcasting
Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a major rival of Charles Taylor in the civil war,
alleged last week that there had been two attempts to murder him
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He had accused security operatives attached to President
Taylor of carrying out the heinous act, which was immediately
denied by Minister of Information John Molba.
</P>
<P>
A press release issuded by the Executive Mansion, the seat of
the government, Tuesday afternoon was quoted as saying that
Johnson's appointment is in pursuance of Charles Taylor's good
governance policy.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's previous job of rural development minister has been
given to the former chief of army staff of Liberia, who, like
Johnson, also comes from the southeastern Grand Gedeh County.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Johnson is currently ill and has not
publicly responded to his new appointment.
</P>
<P>
The official press release also said that President Taylor has
instructed his Finance Ministry to assist Johnson in travelling
to the United States for medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's ambassadorial appointment followed a lengthy meeting
Monday afternoon between President Taylor and members of the late
President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe, the ethnic group to which
Johnson belongs.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that citizens from Grand Gedeh County presented
a statement of support to the Taylor government during the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Slams Israeli Indifference to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Tuesday criticized what he described as Israel's
indifference to the peace process and its desire to maintain
occupation of Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Egypt's Middle East News Agency upon his
return to Cairo from Riyadh, Moussa brushed aside the Israeli
claim that it has made offers to salvage the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli offers are so far insufficient and not in line
with the right and sound balance that is inherent to any balanced
agreement to revive the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomier prospects facing the peace process, Moussa
ruled out the imminent possibility of convening a mini Arab
Summit, saying that "we should not jump quickly to conclusions."
Egypt hosted the last Arab Summit in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, top-level Arab meetings have been held to examine the
outcome of intensive contacts to start the crumbling peace process
and to discuss the latest American initiative to revive the
moribund process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa visited
Saudi capital of Riyadh Monday evening for talks with their Saudi
counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal to discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place after U.S. Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross
flew to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks
with Egyptian leaders on the outcome of his three days of shuttle
diplomacy with the Palestinian and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process have been deadlocked for
over one year over Israel's construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. The two sides are also
wrangling over the scope and schedule of an overdue Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly seeking to break the logjam by
suggesting 13.1 percent of second Israeli pullout from the West
Bank. But the suggestion has been spurned by the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as "unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> Democrats Propose Banning High Capacity Ammunition Clips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Congressional Democrats
Tuesday proposed legislation that would ban sales of the type of
high-capacity ammunition clip used in the school shooting in
Arkansas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat, said the measure was
a "common sense solution that takes dangerous weapons off the
streets and playgrounds without threatening the rights of
sportsmen."
</P>
<P>
DeGette, who was joined by Senator Dianne Feinstein, also a
Democrat, in sponsoring the legislation, said that the two boys
accused in the Jonesboro, Arkansas, shooting last week possessed
four large ammunition magazines, and that of 24 shots fired, 15
came from one 15-round magazine.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 law banning some types of assault weapons also
prohibited the manufacture and sale of ammunition magazines of
more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
However, in a concession to gun sellers, those magazines
produced before September 1994 were exempted from the ban, with
the expectation that stockpiles would disappear in several years.
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the legislation said those supplies, possibly
bolstered by illegal imports, have not dwindled. Their bill would
end the exemption and ban the import, sale or transfer of
magazines of more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
But DeGette and Feinstein acknowledged that at present they had
few Republicans on their side.
</P>
<P>
Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, said the ban on magazines was unenforceable and would
lead to law-abiding citizens being entrapped into breaking the
law.
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, said those who oppose
gun control should "have the good grace not to grieve" incidents
such as the Jonesboro killings "because this didn't happen by
accident and it will happen again many times."
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a family tragedy," he said. "It is a
national tragedy."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Keeps Short-term Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite labor shortages and
rapid income increases that could trigger off inflation, the U.S.
Federal Reserve policy-makers decided to leave short-term interest
rates unchanged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market
Committee, concluded its four-hour, closed-door meeting by leaving
the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate has been maintained at the level since March 1997,
when policy-makers raised it a quarter percentage point higher,
expressing concern that the strong economic demand at the time
would result in increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision was widely expected and financial markets
showed little reaction.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said Fed policy-makers maintained rates steady
today because they found the Asian crisis has been much less
devastating to the U.S. economies and probably expect the worst of
the Asian impact to hit the U.S. economy during the second half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed among the signs indicating the economy's
momentum has continued largely unabated since growth hit a
nine-year high of 3.8 percent in 1997 include: record sales of
both new and existing homes in February; a return after a blip
upward to 4.6 percent unemployment, the lowest in 24 years; robust
income growth and a slight growth in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
But no inflation is in sight just yet, partly because oil
prices have plunged and partly because Asia's currency
devaluations have reduced the price of imported manufactured goods
and commodities. Consumer prices increased at a scant 0.4 percent
annual rate during January and February.

<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II of Britain and
visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on Tuesday both expressed
satisfaction with the development of Sino-British relationship
after the handover of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the talks held at Windsor Castle outside London, Premier
Zhu extended President Jiang Zemin's cordial greetings to Queen
Elizabeth. The queen asked Zhu to pass on her warm congratulations
to Jiang on his re-election as Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, whose plane touched down at London's Heathrow Airport
around 14:30 GMT earlier Tuesday, said that Britain and China are
both great nations in the world with long-standing history and
splendid cultures.
</P>
<P>
The British and Chinese peoples, who are both industrious and
creative in nature, have made active contributions to social
development and human progress, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit Britain in 13 years,
noted that since the smooth handover of Hong Kong, the
Sino-British relations have entered a new period of development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also expressed his hope that the friendly
and cooperative relationship between China and Britain would make
further progress as it not only conforms to the fundamental
interests of both peoples but also promotes world peace, stability
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth told Zhu that it is inspiring that the
relations between Britain and China have moved into a fresh period
of development and she has been told that great changes have taken
place in Shanghai and other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The queen expressed pleasure over the positive developments in
Hong Kong after the handover last July. Her husband Prince Philip
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Britain, Premier Zhu is expected to hold
talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and attend the Second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM2) on April 3-4.

ABU DHABI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates' (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan reiterated Tuesday
that his country will continue to back Lebanon's struggle to take

The UAE president made the remark while meeting with his

unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.

Israel seized south Lebanon in 1978. It set up a

its northern towns from cross-border attacks by the anti-Israeli
Hezbollah guerillas.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Predicts Price Rise After Oil Output Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi Al-Banbi
Wednesday predicted a upward revision of world oil prices if oil
exporting countries deliver their promise on production cuts, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"World oil prices would well return to the pre-November 1997
level provided that the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) first output cut in a decade is seriously implemented,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The minister was commenting on a landmark pact some OPEC
members and non-OPEC oil producers reached on Tuesday to trim oil
output to shore up collapsing crude prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi said Egypt's decision to shave oil output 20,000
barrels per day (bpd) starting June is a kind of "consensus" with
oil-exporting countries to put brake on the oil price slide.
</P>
<P>
As a non-OPEC oil producer, Egypt will maintain its production
at 850,000 bpd until the end of May while some other countries
already started the cut April 1.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices fell 40 percent from October to mid-March as a
result of weak demand in cash-strapped Asian countries, a
10-percent rise in OPEC's 1998 production ceiling, a mild northern
hemisphere winter and increased Iraqi exports.
</P>
<P>
A broad accord reached by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC
Mexico in Riyadh on March 22 garnered support from other oil
producers, who have pledged a total of 1.5 million bpd in overall
cuts.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the promised cuts, oil prices on world markets
rallied Tuesday but then eased a bit due to doubts over if the
pledges will be delivered or if production cheatings will be
employed again.

BONN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Border controls between Germany,
Austria and Italy have been formally eliminated up from Tuesday
midnight as a result of the expansion of an European Union
open-border pact to Austria and Italy.

<P>
Under the so-called Schengen agreement, border controls between

Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- have already been eliminated

countries which became full members of the treaty.

The Schengen accord was designed to realize free movement and
promote free trade within the EU border. Meanwhile member states
are also expected to tighten their exterior borders to guard
against illegal immigrations from non-EU countries.

Greece has also adopted the treaty and hopes to become a full

<HEADLINE> Jews From Former Soviet Union Demand Swiss Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli parliament member has
demanded to include Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union
in a Swiss Bank scheme to compensate Jews whose assets and
property were seized by the Nazis in the World War II.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the World Jewish Congress (WJC), Marina Solodkin
from Yisrael Baaliya party, that represents the immigrants from
the former Soviet Union, said it is reasonable for those
immigrants to get compensation, local newspaper Haaretz reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three leading Swiss Banks last week agreed in principle with
WJC that they should set up a fund to aid Holocaust survivors in
return for a waiver of any further claims against the banks, in
which the plundered Jewish funds were deposited by Nazi officials
during the second world war.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the amount of the fund are to open in New York on
April 24, but the sum is expected to be in the region of 3 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jews from the Soviet Union were excluded from the scheme under
the argument that they had no private property and could not
therefore have lost it to the invading Germans.
</P>
<P>
But Solodkin said that the facts prove otherwise. "Many Jews
managed to hold on to considerable fortunes, mainly in the form of
gold coins from the Tsarist period," she said.
</P>
<P>
Various estimates, accepted by Jewish, Russian and Ukrainian
analysts, put the amount stolen by the Nazis from Jews of the
former Soviet Union at around 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of immigrants from the former Soviet Union have
testified that the Germans had three main methods of squeezing
valuables from their victims.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after occupying a town all the Jewish men were
ordered to assemble in the main square and told that they
would be killed unless they paid a ransom. At a later stage,
Jewish homes were raided and stripped of valuables.
</P>
<P>
A third method was to simply collect assets abandoned by
Jews fleeing the advancing German army. During the occupation of
Ukraine and Belarus many Jews fled to eastern Russia, leaving
behind houses, gold coins and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Evidence gathered by Solodkin over the past two years showed
there are 132 families from about 40 Jewish communities in the
former Soviet Union who say that their property was seized by the
Nazis, and most of them have documents supporting their claims.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Solodkin suggests that compensation be made
both directly to the victims and also be used to fund community
projects to help Holocaust survivors.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh City Registers Slower Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest
city, registered a 10.3 percent year-on-year growth in its
industrial production in the first quarter of 1998, local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate was the lowest of the corresponding
period in the last four years, the city's Department of Statistics
said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial production was valued at 9,480 billion
Vietnamese dong (roughly 732 million U.S. dollars) during the
first three months of this year, with 11 out of 20 local
industrial sectors reporting slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested industrial sector topped the growth list
with a 19.7 percent increase, which was only half of the growth
rate recorded by the sector in the same quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ever increasing competition in export and a drop in domestic
consumption are attributed to the slowdown in industrial
production, said the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The city's import-export turnover in the first three months of
this year experienced a drop from the same period last year, with
export value standing at 881 million dollars, down by 2 percent,
and import value at 672 million dollars, down by 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the tourism sector rose 2.5 percent, the average
local hotel occupancy rate was only 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss U.S. Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday held talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat on the Middle East situation in light of the latest
U.S. mediation efforts to save the peace process, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Mubarak on the results of his three rounds of
meetings with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross last week and the American
plan to resume negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
Tuesday night, a day after the U.S. envoy wrapped up his shuttle
tour between the Palestinian leader and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to explore their final replies to the U.S.
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who started his task mission last Thursday night, also
held talks with Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Sharm
el-Sheikh Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, after meeting Ross, said Egypt would not apply pressure
on the Palestinians to accept certain U.S. ideas to break the
peace impasse, saying that Egypt would accept nothing short of a
balanced peace.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
cooperation as part of a package deal to end a year-long Mideast
peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to withdraw from the Middle East
peace process if Israel rejects its new initiative.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, upon his return from a three-way meeting with Syrian
and Saudi foreign ministers in Riyadh Tuesday, brushed aside the
possibility of an imminent mini Arab Summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has expressed support for a U.S. proposal for a
mini-summit, hosted by President Bill Clinton and attended by
Saudi Arabia, Britain, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt, the
PNA and Israel, to bless implementation of a withdrawal accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Prime Minister said earlier in an interview with a German
newspaper that European nations should be seen to be concerned
about the economic turmoil in Asia and change the public
perception that they are holding back from helping.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, European investors should look at countries in Asia
individually and put their money in those with a good track record
and which are doing very well despite the ongoing crisis.
</P>
<P>
On another front, as some Asian countries are voicing their
fears that European countries might react to the crisis by closing
up their markets to cheaper Asian products, an inevitable outcome
of some much depreciated Asian currencies, the analysts said that
the Singapore Prime Minister is expected to play his role by
alerting the leaders to the danger of the rise of an insular Asia.
</P>
<P>
To forestall such tendencies and keep Asia supportive of global
trade liberalization, Goh is expected to ask Europe to keep its
own markets open and not succumb to protectionist pressures to
block cheaper Asian goods.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the observers here said that Goh will tell his
Asian counterparts at the meeting that Asia, too, must do its part
by recognizing its own weakness and by taking steps to reform and
restructure its economies to meet market expectations.

Besides, there will also be documents reiterating European

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Terms Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday termed Israeli proposal to pullout its troops
from southern Lebanon as a plot and trap aimed at destroying
Lebanese unity and creating confusion among Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks at a joint news conference with his
Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz at the Beirut Airport before
winding up a three-day visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country's position on this issue is in
harmony with that of Lebanese and Syrian governments, adding that
Israel is looking for excuse for further hegemony and continuous
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, had
firmly rejected the Israeli proposal that it will comply with the
U.N. resolution 425 and withdraw from south Lebanon if negotiated
security arrangements are agreed by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the U.N. in 1978 following Israeli
first invasion of Lebanon calls on Israel to withdraw its troops
from south Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
the event of Israeli withdrawal, the Iranian foreign minister said
that this is Lebanon's internal affairs, adding the withdrawal will
be a victory for the resistance of Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The most concern for Israeli unconditional withdrawal is
Hezbollah which has so far declined to say whether it will
continue attacking Israel after Israeli pullout from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war against a
2,000-strong Israeli forces which have been occupying a
1,200-square-kilometer area in south Lebanon since 1985 to protect
Israel's northern towns from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here on Monday, Kharrazi also held talks with
Syrian leaders on the Israeli offer in Damascus.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Ministry Begins Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The first Chinese government
ministry to come into being as a result of restructuring opened
for business here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A low-key ceremony was held in front of the former Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications in the afternoon, where the plaque
containing the name of the former ministry was replaced by one
saying: "Ministry of Information Industry".
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, former minister of posts and telecommunications,
was appointed head of the new ministry. Liu Jianfeng, former
vice-minister of electronics industry; Yang Xianzu, former
vice-minister of posts and telecommunications; and Lu Xinkui,
former vice-minister of electronics industry, all became
vice-ministers in the new ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry is one of four new
ministries set up by the Ninth National People's Congress. After
the restructuring work was done, the number of ministries in the
State Council went from 40 to 29, and the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, Ministry of Electronics Industry, and Ministry
of Radio, Film and Television were abolished.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Ministry of Information Industry will greatly
help develop the information industry and have a positive effect
on industrial restructuring and developing a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will meet the challenges of the technological
revolution and promote information technology, Wu said. Therefore,
it is not merely a combination of former ministries, but an
institutional restructuring to streamline, unify, and improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the new ministry will coordinate operations,
research and development, manufacturing, and other departmental
work and will strengthen administration of manufacturing of
information products and operation of telecommunication networks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- With Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong in London for the second Asia-Europe Meeting, or
Asem II, observers here say that he is going to play a moderating
role at the meeting, of which, however, not very much can be
expected.
</P>
<P>
As the Asian financial crisis is already ten-month-old and is
continuing to drag on, it is quite natural that this crisis
situation will feature prominently in the meeting's agenda. The
test at the Asem II, as the observers pointed out, is whether the
26 European and Asian leaders can come to an accommodation with
one another on what they must do about it.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian countries, including Singapore, have been urging
European countries to show that they do care about Asia by coming
forward to help. Whereas Europe has stressed repeatedly that it
can or will act only within the international institutional
framework, such as within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
So the issue here is how much the Europeans are prepared to do,
one analyst said in an article in Wednesday's Business Times. He
said this is where Prime Minister Goh may play his part, namely,
to try to convince the Europeans by working closely with host
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement on Tuesday,
shortly before Goh's departure for London, that leaders at the
Asem II will consider endorsing two initiatives to help send a
positive signal to the market. One of them is a Trade Facilitation
Action Plan (TFAP) and the other is an Investment Promotion Action
Plan (IPAP).
</P>
<P>
Besides, a "road map" to guide cooperation well into the
future, called the Asia-Europe Cooperation Framework for
political, economic, cultural and people-to-people cooperation, is
also expected to be adopted at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> African Peacekeeping Force Very Important: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Wednesday that an African crisis response force is
very important for the peace and security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Such a force could help Africans stop their problems before
they are out of reins, said Clinton at a press conference in
Dakar, capital of Senegal, quoted by a Cable News Network report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who arrived in Dakar Tuesday night, was
excited by the "more or less sense" among African leaders for the
establishment of such a peacekeeping force to "settle their own
troubles", the report said.
</P>
<P>
The African Crisis Response Initiative was also the key issue
in the discussion between Clinton and Senegalese President Abdou
Diouf.
</P>
<P>
In discussing the initiative, Clinton said the U.S. would
provide assistance and training in order for African countries to
conduct their own peacekeeping exercises on their own continent.
</P>
<P>
Diouf's response to the initiative is yet to be known. But
South African President Nelson Mandela implied earlier that he
would agree or support such an initiative on certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
The concept of establishing an African peacekeeping force,
which is a very important part of Clinton's on-going shx nation
tour to the continent, met with resistance from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would consider the U.S.-initiated African
peacekeeping force unless it is under an African commander, the
Organization of African Unity and the umbrella of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton began his African tour on March 23 and has visited
Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana, in a bid to
promote new partnership relations with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Apart from peacekeeping, there are other major issues for this
relations Clinton has discussed with other African leaders,
including democracy, education, economic reforms and trade, as
well as environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that all the countries Clinton has visited are
clearly in the most-favored-nation category. The continent's
economic giant Nigeria is out of Clinton's itinerary due to its
"military dictatorship".
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. president said, he would accept Nigeria's
military ruler General Sani Abacha to contest the forthcoming
election as a civilian and then promote democracy in the most
populous black African country.
</P>
<P>
It seems to be left for President Mandela to convey the
continent's view that any U.S. attempt to lay down pre-conditions
for assistance would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose any attempt by any country to impose conditions on
our freedom of trade and that we cannot accept," the South
African president said.

<P>
The object of passage of the bill is to make amendments to

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss U.S. Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday held talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat on the Mideast situation in light of the latest
U.S. mediation efforts to save the peace process, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Mubarak on the results of his four rounds of
meetings with U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross last
week and U.S. plans to resume negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
Tuesday night, a day after the U.S. envoy wrapped up his shuttle
tour between the Palestinian leader and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to explore their final replies to the American
peace-saving proposals.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, starting his task mission on Thursday night,
also held talks with Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in
Sharm el-Sheikh Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, after meeting Ross, said Egypt would not apply pressure
on the Palestinians to accept certain U.S. ideas to break the
peace impasse, saying that Egypt would accept nothing short of a
balanced peace.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
cooperation as part of a package deal to end a year-long Mideast
peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to withdraw from the Middle East
peace process if Israel rejects its new initiative.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, upon his return from a three-way meeting with Syrian
and Saudi foreign ministers in Riyadh Tuesday, brushed aside the
possibility of an imminent mini Arab Summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has expressed support for a U.S. proposal for a
mini-summit, hosted by President Bill Clinton and attended by
Saudi Arabia, Britain, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt, the
PNA and Israel, to bless implementation of a withdrawal accord.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House narrowly approved 2.9 billion dollars for
emergency military spending and aid to disaster victims, but the
White House said President Clinton would veto the bill because it
is financed by cutting some of the Administration's prized
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo
on Yugoslavia, intending to press its President to make
concessions to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. China
abstained from the vote, saying the resolution would not help
negotiations on giving more autonomy to the ethnic Albanians, who
make up about 90 percent of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Attorneys for Paula Jones asked a federal appeals court to
delay the scheduled May trial in her sexual harassment lawsuit
until they can gather and use evidence related to allegations that
President Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky and urged her
to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
-- Mothers in the United States and other industrialized
countries appear to be giving birth to proportionally fewer sons
than they did decades ago, researchers reported Tuesday. However,
other scientists, dismissed the connection to pollution as highly
speculative, and the authors themselves acknowledged that more
research is needed to establish such a link.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate approved a nonbinding resolution to deny legal
relief to cigarette makers. The 79-19 vote offers a glimpse of
antitobacco sentiment in Congress as a Senate panel prepares to
consider a key bill.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. farmers intend to plant a record soybean crop this
spring and the most corn in 13 years, says an Agriculture
Department survey, signaling good business for the farm economy.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Ministry Begins Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The first Chinese government
ministry to come into being as a result of restructuring opened
for business here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A low-key ceremony was held in front of the former Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications in the afternoon, where the plaque
containing the name of the former ministry was replaced by one
saying: "Ministry of Information Industry".
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, former minister of posts and telecommunications,
was appointed head of the new ministry. Liu Jianfeng, former
vice-minister of electronics industry; Yang Xianzu, former
vice-minister of posts and telecommunications; and Lu Xinkui,
former vice-minister of electronics industry, all became
vice-ministers in the new ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry is one of four new
ministries set up by the Ninth National People's Congress. After
the restructuring work was done, the number of ministries in the
State Council went from 40 to 29, and the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, Ministry of Electronics Industry, and Ministry
of Radio, Film and Television were abolished.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Ministry of Information Industry will greatly
help develop the information industry and have a positive effect
on industrial restructuring and developing a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will meet the challenges of the technological
revolution and promote information technology, Wu said. Therefore,
it is not merely a combination of former ministries, but an
institutional restructuring to streamline, unify, and improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the new ministry will coordinate operations,
research and development, manufacturing, and other departmental
work and will strengthen administration of manufacturing of
information products and operation of telecommunication networks.

<HEADLINE> 296 Turkish Kurdish Rebels Killed in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 296 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed by Turkey's
security forces in southeastern Turkey in the first three months
of 1998, a Turkish government official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted the official
from the office of the Region of Emergency Rule, who asked not to
be named, as saying that the Turkish security forces also
captured 39 PKK militants and 17 others surrendered in this
region in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that 20,215 PKK rebels have been killed, 560
others wounded, 2,566 captured and 2,111 surrendered to the
security forces during the military operations in southeastern
Turkey since the year of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have also killed 4,287 civilians including
508 women and 487 children in their attacks and shot dead
173 policemen, 1,050 village guards and 4,477 security personnel
including 3,254 soldiers in the armed clashes in the region
during the year, added the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has decided to extend the state of emergency in
southeastern Turkey for another four months starting on March
30, 1998 in a bid to fight against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Emergency rule has been imposed in the region since 1987,
giving soldiers and police more extensive powers of arrest and
detention in the fight against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting an almost 14-year-old separatist
war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 to 3,000 PKK militants, who have sheltered
themselves in northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, often
cross into Turkey from northern Iraq and attack military and
civilian targets in the country.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Threatens to Step Up Attacks Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) has threatened to step up terror attacks against Israel
in response to an investigation result that one of its leaders was
murdered by Israeli secret agents.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Abdul Aziz Rantisi said in Gaza Strip on
Wednesday that he has no doubt that Muhie Eddine Sharief, who had
been wanted by Israeli security forces, was murdered by "Zionists".
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted an Palestinian security source as saying
that Sharief was shot in the chest before his body was moved into
a car, which blew up in an industrial zone in the West Bank city
of Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi stressed that Hamas has never let the blood of its
people go in vain, and will launch more terror attacks against the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Sharief was on his way to Israel to
carry out a terror attack when his car exploded prematurely in
Ramallah. However, an autopsy has showed he had been shot three
times even before the car bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the report of identification of Sharief's body
on Wednesday, Palestinian officials suggested that it was Israeli
General Security Service (GSS) that assassinated him and left his
body in the car.
</P>
<P>
The source said the GSS intended to send a signal to the
Palestinians that they are not doing enough to fight terrorism.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has flatly denied
that Isreali agents were behind the case and refused to comment on
the identity of the dead man.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian side is looking into the possibility
that Shariff was killed by other Hamas members in an internal
struggle among leaders of the fundamentalist organization's
military wing, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Israel submitted a formal request to the Palestinian National
Authority for Sharief's extradition two years ago and held him
responsible for an array of attacks in Israel in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sharief was suspected of having masterminded the two suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem last summer, in which over 20
Israelis were killed and more than 300 hundred others injured.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Economy to Improve, Says Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi economy will improve
with the end of the recent weapons inspection crisis and amid
mounting calls for lifting the sanctions on Iraq, said the trade
minister.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jumhuriya (The Republic) Wednesday quoted Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh as making remarks when inaugurating the first Italian
Industry fair in Baghdad Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said Iraq maintains economic relations with companies of
friendly countries which had taken positive stance towards Iraq
especially during the recent weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the crisis, the U.S. and Britain had threatened to launch
military attack to force Iraq to open some places suspected to
housing banned weapons to U.N. inspectors. The crisis was defused
with the reaching of an U.N.-Iraq agreement late February.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will give priority when signing contracts under
the oil-for-food deal to companies of friendly countries, and that
Iraq does not want companies of hostile countries to get
commercial opportunities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which is hit hard by seven-year-old U.N. sanctions since
its invasion of Kuwait, is allowed to export 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over ever six months' period to buy back
badly-needed items like medicines and food.
</P>
<P>
He also said the participation of 30 Italian industrial
companies in the on-going Baghdad International Fair will promote
economic cooperation between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction of China's first
ecological residential quarter has been launched in Liangxiang, a
satellite city 20 kilometers from downtown Beijing, according to
"Science and Technology Daily."
</P>
<P>
The Beiluyuan residential quarter will consist of four parts,
and the first ecological part is to cover an area of 160,000
square meters, which can house 4,200.
</P>
<P>
Two tree belts 60 meters and 90 meters in width will be built
along the highways near the residential quarter to shield them
from auto emissions and noise. Each household of the residential
quarter will be equipped with independent heating systems instead
of using a central boiler as its collective heating source. These
natural gas heaters are expected to reduce dust and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Wastewater treatment plants will be built and two man-made
lakes and one ditch will be filled with water discharged by the
plants.
</P>
<P>
Garbage burning, which will take the place of underground
disposal, will recycle the daily waste into energy, and various
other steps will be taken to reduce noise pollution and make the
residential quarter more energy-efficient.
</P>
<P>
"The ecological residential quarter will provide a living
environment which supports the sustainable development both for
mankind and nature," said Huang Hui, chief architect of the
project, which is expected to be completed in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Economy Not Affected by Asian Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has expressed its confidence
that it will not experience the type of southeast Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Egyptian Gazette Wednesday quoted Minister
of Economy Youssef Boutros Ghali as attributing the Asian economic
turmoil to structural inadequacy in their economic administration.
</P>
<P>
The economies of Southeast Asian countries will not recover
before 18 to 24 months, according to his estimates.
</P>
<P>
"The recent economic crisis has taught all world countries a
lesson to steer clear of mal-administration, excessive external
debts and indirect foreign investments," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is totally different from the economic
conditions in Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
He laid an emphasis on the strength of the Egyptian money
market, noting that the national economy is being steered in a way
designed to avoid adverse impacts of turmoils in other world
economies.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has a considerable foreign currency reserve estimated at
over 20 billion U.S. dollars and it does not deal with indirect
investments," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Public Business Sector Atef Ebeid noted
that the Egyptian economy is not strongly connected with foreign
economies, referring to the limited amount of short-term
investments within the Egyptian economies, especially foreign
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Cairo Watch Program of the Nile TV Wednesday, Ebeid
noted that the great reserves of hard currencies at the Central
Bank, which are enough to pay for 18 months' of import, help
stabilize foreign exchange rates against the Egyptian pound.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Egyptian Stock Exchange Sherif
Rafat pointed out that foreign investment in Egypt which stood at
500 million U.S. dollars last year is relatively small compared
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The new Asian economies have raked in around 58 percent of the
total world investments since 1990 while Africa has a share of 3
percent of which Egypt obtained only 0.5 percent, he said.

(PATA) 47th annual congress ended here Wednesday with calls for
the region's travel industry to undertake unprecedented
cooperation in order to recover from the current economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, some 1,500 tourism and travel
industry leaders and professionals from the region discussed the
Asian financial crisis and other challenges facing the region's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
All sectors of the tourism industry should bury rivalry and
enhance co-operation in face of the financial crisis, economic
downturn, and the fire-related haze, PATA officers told reporters
at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asia's travel industry must rethink how to train and motivate
staff to control costs and prepare for the regional economic
recovery, they said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the region's financial turmoil, Asia-Pacific nations
lost 12 million tourists in 1997, according to figures given by
the World Tourism Organization during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Dawid de Villiers, deputy secretary-general of the
organization, told reporters Tuesday that tourism in the
Asia-Pacific took a sharp plunge after the financial crisis began
last year because about 80 percent of its tourists come from
within the region.
</P>
<P>
De Villiers, who is attending the PATA meeting, warned of
continued downturn in the tourism industry in the next two years
due to the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1952 in Hawaii, PATA is a non-governmental and
non-profit association. It has 79 chapters worldwide and about
16,000 members in the region, including some 40 government
departments, 76 airlines and cruise lines, 2,200 travel and
tourism-related businesses and organizations.
</P>
<P>
PATA, which held its last congress in Beijing, will hold the
next annual congress in Nagoya, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Hit 5 Provinces in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- At least five provinces in the
southern Philippines have been hit by the forest fires which have
killed two people and damaged hundreds of hectares of woodland
worth about 4 million pesos (105,263 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Wednesday said the provinces are
South Cotabato, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur and Sarangani on the
southern island of Mindanao and Palawan in the west.
</P>
<P>
Palawan is adjacent to northern Indonesia where a similar
forest fire is currently blazing after it broke out anew a few
weeks ago. Last year, forest fires razed to ground thousands of
hectares of forests in Indonesia and spawned a haze that blanketed
much of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian forests have become easily susceptible to
forest fires as a result of the long drought brought about by the
El Nino phenomenon that has caused dramatic and serious weather
disturbance throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 56 houses have been burnt down by
the fires in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A team of Canadian forest fire control experts are coming to
the Philippines to help assess the raging fires in Palawan and
determine what assistance Canada could extend to the country.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said the Philippines is mobilizing
elements of the Armed Forces and the Philippine National Police in
helping extinguishing the fires.

</P>
<P>
Six experts from the two countries attending today's Beijing
University symposium joined more than 100 scholars from research

Japanese Economy, noted that Japan is China's leading economic
cooperative partner in terms of trade, loans and direct
investments.

Their coordination of both financial and industrial policies
will become a major part of bilateral economic cooperation
following the financial crisis, according to Feng.

Economic cooperation, the foundation of bilateral ties, fully
accords with the development of the productive forces and market
economies of both countries, and is a vivid demonstration of
economic globalization.

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan

prevent armed conflicts so as to protect human lives, boost
human development and guarantee the security of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese
government, made the comments during an afternoon speech on the
role of the United Nations in maintaining world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has devoted itself to the prevention of
crises since inauguration of the UN Charter, said Annan, adding
that UN secretary-generals throughout the years have scored
achievements in related mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Annan's assertions came in front of an audience of over 300
Chinese officials and scholars.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the UN should serve as a global center for
visionary and effective preventive actions in the 21st century.

The United Nations should take preventive actions to seek
universal security, said Annan, adding that the security of
mankind in the economic, political and social sectors will reflect
the outcome of effective preventive actions.

diplomatic solution to the Iraqi weapons inspection crisis, adding
that it is vital to his successful mission to Iraq.

of the United Nations, the Middle East peace process, human rights
and China's role in the organization.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Exchange Starts Designated Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Starting today all stock
investors who have opened trading accounts at the Shanghai Stock
Exchange (SSE) have to process transactions through designated
securities operations.
</P>
<P>
A set of rules on this new practice drawn up by the SSE took
effect today.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the rules, every investor has to name a
securities operation as his trustee for stock trading and clearing
services.
</P>
<P>
The SSE's computer trading system will automatically reject the
trading orders of those investors who have not made such
designation by today, according to an SSE official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the new practice is intended to help
improve trading practices, strengthen market supervision, control
market risks and curb securities-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Securities operations will take effective measures to guarantee
investors' trading safety and will establish an investor database,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official also urged securities operations to guard against
short-selling by investors and to keep investors' trading records
and other related figures confidential.
</P>
<P>
Applications for designated stock trading through the SSE are
still being accepted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has more than 32 million
stock investors who have opened trading accounts at the SSE or the
country's other exchange in the special economic zone of Shenzhen
in south China's Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Israel's Decision Not Just </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu stressed Wednesday that the inner Cabinet's endorsement
of United Nations Resolution 425 on South Lebanese pullout was a
significant move and not just a political declaration.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks following the vote by the
inner Cabinet to approve the U.N. Resolution 425 calling for
Israeli unilateral withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was significant because this was the
first time that Israel expressed its determination to leave South
Lebanon under necessary conditions.
</P>
<P>
The inner Cabinet, chaired by Netanyahu, adopted the
U.N. resolution 425. But it also demanded for holding security
talks with the Lebanese government to ensure that Lebanon will
assume responsibility for the security in South Lebanon following
Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called once again on the Lebanese government to hold
talks with Israel on South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader meanwhile dismissed the charges that
Israel's initiative on South Lebanon was a ploy to deviate
attention on the deadlock on other tracks of the Mideast peace
process. He said Israel is committed to advancing peace talks
with not only the Palestinians but also Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli inner Cabinet's decision culminated months of
intensive discussion within the Israeli government on pulling out
from South Lebanon, where Israel has been fighting a tough
guerrilla war against anti-Israeli Hezbollah (Party of God) forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel's debate over Lebanon was triggered by the continued
blood-shedding of Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, where an
average of 35 Israeli soldiers are killed annually. Under
increasing domestic pressure for a withdrawal from Lebanon, the
current Likud-led government has changed its attitude toward the
U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resolution 425, passed in March 1978 by U.N. Security
Council, calls for Israeli unilateral withdrawal from the occupied
South Lebanon to ensure the territorial integrity, sovereignty and
political independence of Lebanon. Israeli governments in the past
have never formally endorsed the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the so-called South Lebanon Security Zone in
1985 allegely to protect its northern border from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet is now considering several plans on
unilateral Lebanese pullout. One favorable plan was put forward
by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who said the unilateral
pullout must be carried out after reaching a security arrangement
with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Despite the endorsement of the U.N. Resolution 425, it remains
doubtful if Israel could actually carry out the unilateral
withdrawal soon without the cooperation of the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has so far rejected Israel's call for taking security
control over South Lebanon and assuming responsibility for the
safety of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
The common belief is that, in the absence of an agreement
between Israel and Syria which has great influence over Lebanon,
the Lebanese government is unable to accept the Israeli
demand. Syria is regarded as holding South Lebanon as a bargaining
chip in forcing Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights
occupied by Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The future of philately is looking
up in China, according to Niu Sujuan, in today's "Economic
Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
Niu, general manager of the China Philately Corp., said the
good prospects for stamp-collecting are illustrated by the
continuous economic and social progress represented by the 15th
congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Philately already
had attained a solid foundation, she said, adding that the current
environment is conducive to its expansion.
</P>
<P>
China Philately Corp. chalked up 960 million yuan in business
volume and earned a profit of 435 million yuan in 1997, Niu
said. Both figures show marked increases over corresponding
statistics for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The corporation adjusted the structure of philatelic works,
developed new products and issued 23 million sets of philatelic
works in 165 kinds in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation also imported stamps from overseas and earned
270 million yuan from their sale in 1997. The company held and
participated in 16 philatelic activities in cooperation with local
companies across the country.
</P>
<P>
Niu pledged to strive harder and achieve greater progress this
year by making a success of seven major tasks including the
establishment of a stronger network for designing and producing
philatelic works, construction of more marketing organizations at
the provincial level and improving philatelic service.

MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica Wednesday urged residents of areas that maybe
affected by haze caused by the on-going forest fires in the
western province of Palawan to take the necessary precautions
against its hazardous effect.
</P>
<P>
Haze due to forest fire can cause air pollution which can
brought about increased risks for respiratory tract infections and
heart ailments, the health chief said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
While there is still nothing to worry at this point, Reodica
said, it would be wise for the public to take the early
precautionary measures to avoid the haze-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The statement cited an earlier health advisory issued in
connection with the dangers of haze due to forest fire in
Indonesia that the elderly, children and those with respiratory
and heart ailments were advised to stay indoors with good
ventilation and to wear dust masks when going outside the house.
</P>
<P>
The public were also told to stay away from low-lying areas
where smoke and suspended particles may settle.
</P>
<P>
Those exposed and maybe experiencing difficulty in breathing
and having cough, chest pain, increased tearing of the eyes, nose
or throat irritation should immediately seek medical consultation,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires in Palawan which started last week has so far
destroyed 54 houses and a church. Local reports earlier said that
two girls have been killed by the fires.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Army Wednesday deployed two engineering
battalions to Palawan to combat the raging forest fires.

CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The "extremely weak" data
released by the Australian Bureau of statistics (ABS) Wednesday
has pulled down the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 66.19 U.S. cents from 66.34,
recording a continuous fall since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS reported a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent fall in
retail sales in February, an outcome which was much weaker than
economists' average forecast of a 0.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The data, which followed weak building approvals figures on
Tuesday, was interpreted as indicating the economy was proceeding
at a slower pace than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
But despite the bond market's reaction, financial market
economists Wednesday ruled out the likelihood of a cut in rates by
the Reserve Bank of Australia for the time being and attributed
the result to volatility in the statistical series.
</P>
<P>
"It remains our assessment...that we are experiencing a patch
of apparently weak data, rather than a significant deterioration
in the real world," said Bankers Trust Australia chief economist
Chris Caton.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia has decided to provide
one million U.S. dollars for de-mining activities in Mozambique
and Angola, an Australian official announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia will contribute one million Australian dollars
(670,000 U.S. dollars) over three years to the United Nations
Development Program's (UNDP) Accelerated De-mining Program in
Mozambique, said Kathy Sullivan, parliamentary secretary to
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Australian special
representative on de-mining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly half a million Australian dollars (about
33o,000 U.S. dollars) will be used by the Australian aid
organization (AUSTCARE) to expand its de-mining activities in
Angola during the next 12 months, Sullivan added in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDP program will help save the lives and limbs of
subsistence farmers in Mozambique, involving clearing mine fields
in the province of Inhambane, releasing arable land for
cultivation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In turn, the province will be able to provide work and food
for an increased number of people, reducing migration to the
cities and boosting Mozambique's exports."
</P>
<P>
The AUSTCARE project will use highly trained dogs to clear land
mines laid along several thousand kilometers of roads.
</P>
<P>
The number of land mines laid in Angola is estimated at between
10 and 14 million following 30 years of conflict with more than
one million people internally displaced, plus more than 100,000
Angolan refugees in neighboring countries who cannot return home
until the treacherous land mines are located and removed.

loans will continue to focus on the restructuring of
State-owned enterprises, according to Hu. Key projects related to
water conservancy, environmental protection, transportation and
telecommunications are expected to record moderate increases in
syndicated and joint loans.

Financial service for residential housing will be increased,
said Hu, adding that efforts will be made to restrict bank loans

<HEADLINE> German Business people Wish to Increase Activities in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Most of the German companies in
Hong Kong rate the investment climate here as "good and "very
good" and many intend to increase their activities in the Special
Administrative Region (SAR), the German Chamber of Industry and
Commerce said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated here, the chamber stressed: "As a
gateway to the Chinese market and regional headquarters for
business activities in Asia, Hong Kong's location and expertise
remain indispensable assets for German companies."
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority, or 83 percent, of the German companies in
Hong Kong have not noticed any significant change in the
investment climate since the handover on July 1, 1997. On the
contrary, some say the situation has improved and over a third
plan to increase their activities in the SAR over the next five
years," the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the results of its recent "Survey on German Business
in the SAR," the chamber said more than three quarters of the
polled companies confirm that their regional headquarters is based
in Hong Kong and 93 percent want this to remain the case in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China has been pursuing the principle
of "one Country, two Systems" in Hong Kong, and has not interfered
in any affairs of the SAR, the chamber said, adding that it only
has control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs and defense.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's currency is still the HK dollar, assured of its
stability through its fixes peg to the U.S. dollar, there is free
transfer of capital; Hong Kong continues to be a free port,
practises an independent legal system; foreign business people and
tourists may still enter the SAR without a visa, etc.," the
chamber noted.
</P>
<P>
It said Hong Kong remains an important economic and financial
center for German companies and that its good transportation,
telecommunications and information infrastructure, the excellent
services and not least the available know-how are the main
investment motives for German companies here.

<HEADLINE> Iran Appreciates EU's Decision on Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday expressed its
appreciation for the decision of the European Union (EU) to resume
political dialog with Tehran, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU's decision has indicated its "further realistic approach
and better understanding of the realities of the Islamic Republic
of Iran," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
said.
</P>
<P>
It has also proved that the EU is moving away from its past
decisions which were inspired by their lack of correct information
about Iran, Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers on Tuesday decided to resume "critical
dialog" with Iran and called for promotion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and the EU became tense in April
last year after a German court ruled that the Iranian leadership
was behind the killing of four Kurdish leaders in Berlin in 1992,
and the EU member states, except Greece, recalled their
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The ties were improved in November when the EU ambassadors
returned to Tehran after a compromise was reached between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Promoting political contacts can help "remove misunderstandings
and ambiguities on certain EU policies," the Iranian spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
It would enhance bilateral cooperation and political, economic
and cultural dialogs based on mutual respect and mutual interests,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Building Contingent of Cadres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), recently underlined the
importance of enhancing the quality of medium to high ranking
Party officials and pointed out that the quality of officials is
crucial to the future of the Party and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expounded his point of view during an address to national
conference on organizational work held in December. The full text
of Jiang's speech was carried in today's publication of the
Beijing-based journal "Party Building Study".
</P>
<P>
Jiang not only reviewed China's achievements China made in 1997, but
also listed existing problems and cautioned that related problems
"merit immediate and due attention and must never be overlooked".
</P>
<P>
The top Party leader cited the following three factors as being
decisive for China's ability to sustain development and attain
cross-century goals -- correct guidance in terms of theory and
Party line, uniting the enterprising spirit of the broad masses
and ensuring competent Party organizations at all levels.
</P>
<P>
"The contingent of cadres is the most important factor of the
three and we will rely on cadres to implement correct policies and
guidelines, mobilize and organize the broad masses, and study and
seek resolutions to problems undermining our progress," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He noted the fact that CPC has scored major victories in
revolution, modernization, construction, reform and opening due to
a contingent of competent cadres fully capable of meeting the
challenges of changing times.
</P>
<P>
"Our Party shoulders historical missions at the turn of the
century which require that medium and high ranking officials have
a comprehensive and thorough understanding of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and are fully capable using the theory in solving problems
cropping up in the modernization drive, while at the same time
continuously enriching the theory," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Medium and high ranking officials should first and foremost
have the capability to provide competent leadership. Simply
stated, they must be able to render scientific judgements on
prevailing situations, grasp overall situations in an appropriate
way, make major decisions in a practical and realistic manner, and
stand the test of all forms of turmoil, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He called on Party officials to maintain close ties with the
masses and set an example of frugal living and hard work.
</P>
<P>
"It is far from an easy job to cultivate good living and
working styles, while diligently, prudently and wholeheartedly
serving the interests of our people. Nonetheless, we must strive
to accomplish the tasks, with medium to high ranking officials
bearing particular responsibility," said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Govt Protects Alleged Witches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has set up
witches' homes throughout the country in a move to offer refuge
to victims of witch-hunting, a report reaching here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of homes for witches was designed to give
suspected witches a safe place to live after being expelled from
their communities, the source quoted Ghanaian Minister for Social
Welfare Mohammed Mumuni as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Witchcraft is common in many African countries and witches are
often fished out by witch doctors after some rituals, and jungle
justice mete out punishment to them, usually by lynching them.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it was the duty of the government to
protect suspected witches from being lynched by hostile people
and to provide them with safe abodes after they have been
ostracized from the communities.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many of the women ostracized from their
societies for alleged witchcraft were not witches, but events
surrounding them made the society portray them as witches.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the belief in witchcraft is so wide
and cuts across religion and social barrier in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Traditional bodies will be responsible for the manning of the
witches' homes in their respective communities, he said, adding
that such bodies are going to be made up of people who can
ostracize the witchcraft from the witches.

<HEADLINE> Global Environment Facility Assembly Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Global Environment
Facility (GEF) assembly opened here Wednesday to exchange views on
the policies and operations of the GEF since it was created in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 161 member countries as well as
international and non-governmental agencies participated in the
meeting. It is the first time that India as a developing country
has hosted the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The GEF is a multilateral financing mechanism to address global
environmental issues that do not normally get funded through
national, bilateral, and international finance. Following its
restructuring and replenishment in 1994 at the level of 2 billion
U.S. dollars, it has emerged as the principal international
funding mechanism for the global environment.
</P>
<P>
The GEF has four defined focal areas, namely biological
diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer
depletion. So far, the GEF has programmed 1.9 billion U.S. dollars
in grant funding to more than 440 projects in 119 countries, while
leveraging another 5 billion U.S. dollars for actions to reduce
the risk of climate change, to conserve and use biodiversity
sustainably, to protect international waters and to phase out
ozone depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the assembly, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee urged the developed countries to strictly enforce
stringent emission norms and limit pollutants to prevent an
ecological disaster.
</P>
<P>
He said that high levels of economic activity and consumption
in the industrialized world contribute to environmental
degradation. Different strategies are required from the developed
and developing countries along with an incentive structure that
encourages conservation and discourages the scavenging of nature,
without compromising economic development and rapid alleviation of
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Okays U.N. Resolution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- In an important vote Wednesday,
Israeli inner Cabinet formally approved the United Nations
Resolution 425 calling for Israeli unilateral withdrawal from
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The inner Cabinet, in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, also demanded the Lebanese government take
responsibility for the security in South Lebanon following Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
The vote culminated months of intensive discussion within the
Israeli government on pulling out from South Lebanon, where
Israel has been fighting a tough guerrilla war against anti-Israeli
Hezbollah (Party of God) forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel's debate on the issue was triggered by the continuing
blood-shedding of Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, where an
average of 35 Israeli soldiers are killed annually. Under
increasing domestic pressure for a withdrawal from Lebanon, the
current Likud-led government has changed its attitude toward the
U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resolution 425, passed in March 1978 by U.N. Security
Council, calls for Israeli unilateral withdrawal from the
occupied South Lebanon to ensure the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli governments had never formally endorsed the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the so-called South Lebanon security zone in
1985 allegely to protect its borders from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet is now considering several plans on
unilateral Lebanese pullout. One favorable plan was put forward
by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who said the unilateral
pullout must be carried out after reaching a security arrangement
with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Despite the endorsement of the U.N. Resolution 425, it remains
doubtful if Israel could actually carry out the unilateral
withdrawal soon without the cooperation of the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has so far rejected Israel's call for taking security
control over South Lebanon and assuming responsibility for the
safety of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
The common belief is that, in the absence of an agreement
between Israel and Syria which has great influence over Lebanon,
the Lebanese government is unable to accept the Israeli
demand. Syria is regarded as holding South Lebanon as a bargaining
chip in forcing Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights occupied
by Israel.

<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday on renewed uncertainty over the country's economic
health.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues at the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 285.51 points or 1.73 percent to
16,241.66 on the first day of Japan's 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index declined 20.17 points
or 1.61 percent to 1,231.53.
</P>
<P>
Volume at the First Section was estimated at 550 million
shares, down from Tuesday's 650 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Investors were discouraged by news reports that the government
and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party planned to discuss a
relaxing of the Fiscal Structural Reform Law in the next special
Diet (parliament) session, later than expected, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index was down more than 350 points at one stage in
the morning, influenced by the yen's depreciation against the
U.S. dollar, and rekindled fears of credit risks in Japan, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover New Beneficial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A beneficial bacterium
producing a natural pigment and having many uses in food
production, medicine, cosmetics and biotechnology has been
discovered by Israeli geneticists.
</P>
<P>
The friendly microbe, named Paracoccus marcusii, was discovered
by a research team headed by Professor Joseph Hirschberg of the
Genetics Department of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the
Jerusalem Post daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bacterium produces the natural pigment astaxanthin, which
is a major natural component in the diets of many types of fish,
including salmon and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
The pigment is one of the carotenoids, a family of colors that
produces intense yellow, orange, and red hues in many organisms.
They are powerful antioxidants and thus considered to be
beneficial food additives, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In nature, astaxanthin is produced by microalgae, which can be
eaten by various living creatures and passed up the food chain. In
Scandinavian countries, manufacturers have started to feed
chickens with it to get eggs with yolks of a richer color.
</P>
<P>
In humans, the pigment is found to play a key role in
preventing cancers and deterioration of sight as well as promoting
the immune system.
</P>
<P>
Until now, natural astaxanthin has been extracted from
crustacea and algae in an expensive process with whose production
is limited. It can also be synthesized, but then it does not have
the same molecular structure as the natural product.
</P>
<P>
Hebrew University researchers have discovered that the
Paracoccus marcusii bacteria secrete the pigment outside their own
cells, a phenomenon that has not been observed in natural bacteria
before.
</P>
<P>
The pigment is produced in easily collectible bubble-like
structures from which the color can be extracted in its natural
form, the report added.
</P>
<P>
This method will lower the cost of astaxanthin and lead to
even wider application for food, cosmetics, and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
But additional research is needed before this can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The microbe has been flown to the official European bacteria
depository, which according to the Budapest Covenant insures that
commercial rights for the discoverer are protected.
</P>
<P>
The university's Yissum Research and Development Company has
patented the process for manufacturing astaxanthin based on using
the new bacterium.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Group Inspects 6 Iraqi Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special group
responsible for inspections of Iraqi presidential sites has
finished visits to six sites, said the group leader, Janayatha
Dhanapala, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, commissioner of the special group of senior
diplomats and arms experts, said in front of the Rasheed Hotel
where he stays that in the past few days, they have visited six of
the eight Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
He said they have visited Radwaniyah sites in the suburb of
Baghdad, Tharthar, Tikrit, Jabal Makhul and Mosul sites in the
north and Basra site in the south, and that they have revisited
three of them.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala said their visits received cooperation from the
Iraqi side, and the special group will finish their visits to the
remaining two presidential sites -- the Republican and Sijood
palaces in Baghdad by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the first round of visits to those sites,
his group will submit two reports, one by the arms experts and
another by the diplomats, on the results of their inspections to
Richard Butler, the chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the special group has not
visited all the buildings in those sites, more careful visits
will be made in the second round of visits.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly 1,058 buildings in the eight Iraqi
presidential sites, which, according to U.N. surveyors, cover a
area of 31.5 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed late February by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, Iraq agrees to open its eight presidential sites to a
special U.N. group of senior diplomats and arms experts drawn from
the UNSOCM and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted unless the
UNSCOM verifies that it is free of prohibited weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province last
year eliminated its accumulated fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu did not have any new fiscal deficit in the last three
years and eliminated its previous deficits last year, said Shi
Xuedao, director of the provincial fiscal bureau.
</P>
<P>
As a major economic powerhouse in China, Jiangsu had suffered
from a cycle of rapid economic and revenue growth accompanied
with a snowballing fiscal deficit, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Jiangsu made it a major objective of economic
readjustment to eliminate its fiscal deficit and strike a balance
of revenue and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Jiangsu beefed up the implementation of
the Budget Law and compiled rigorous annual budgets.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Jiangsu's fiscal revenue grew by
an average 27.5 percent while fiscal spending was up 24.4 percent
annually in the last five years. Both rates were significantly
higher than the province's 15.1 percent economic growth rate
during the period.
</P>
<P>
Shi attributed the rapid revenue growth and deficit elimination
to the introduction of a national revenue-sharing fiscal system in
1994. China's national fiscal revenue has grown by 100 billion
yuan annually in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Quality and Price are Key to U.S. Market Access: US Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese businesses were advised
today to adhere to three principles if they want to enter the
U.S. Market: preparation, more preparation and even more
preparation.
</P>
<P>
That was the advice of Edward Morrison, president of the
U.S.-China Association for the Promotion of Economy and Trade, who
said that enhancing quality and lowering prices on their products
are the major steps Chinese companies should take because "quality
and price are key to entry into the U.S. Market."
</P>
<P>
The products with high quality and low prices are highly
competitive in the U.S. market, Morrison said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Although many products processed by Chinese enterprises have
gained a large market share in the United States, the products are
registered with brands of companies of other countries. Therefore,
the major part of the margin is gained by brand owners, and
Chinese businesses earn only a processing fee, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
To gain more profit, Chinese manufacturers should license their
brands directly in the U.S. market, Morrison added.
</P>
<P>
In a global world economy, Chinese businesses should strengthen
their sense of brands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, former mayor of New York City and a lawyer, said that
Chinese businesses should also be familiar with U.S. market rules
and relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon anti-dumping, Morrison said that the cheap labor
and resources rather than government subsidies lead to the low
prices of Chinese products, and this should not be regarded as
dumping. Therefore, Chinese companies should not worry about it.

<HEADLINE> Top Fine Arts Academy Celebrates 80th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The cradle of Chinese painters,
the Central Arts Academy, celebrated its 80th anniversary here
today.
</P>
<P>
The school, founded in 1918, is the first state-run fine arts
institute in China and home to the country's most influential
painters and sculptors.
</P>
<P>
"The academy has seen rises and falls, and it has trained many
gifted artists, combining Western and Chinese traditions," said
Jin Shangyi, president of the academy.
</P>
<P>
He said the academy's development is closely related to the
fate of the country.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students had painted Mao Zedong's picture hanging
over the Tiananmen Rostrum, and completed many political works for
the country.
</P>
<P>
The academy was overshadowed by its Soviet model in the 1950s
and experienced setbacks during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76)
when many professors were persecuted.
</P>
<P>
After the reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, the academy
entered a new stage, Jin said. Many students have won
international prizes.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners eye it as one of the first destinations to learn
Chinese culture. Newly 130 overseas students are studying in the
academy.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided funding for building a new
campus in the suburbs of Beijing, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of graduates, teachers and officials joined in today's
celebration featuring a series of exhibitions.

<HEADLINE> Organized Crime Gang Steals Beijing's Oldest Buddha Statue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An organized crime gang
"premeditatedly" stole Beijing's oldest statue of Buddha, a local
official in charge of cultural relics said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 165-centimeter-high stone statue, which was carved in 499
A.D., had remained safe and intact in a stone house in the village
of Dong'erying in the western part of Beijing for 1,500 years.
</P>
<P>
The four or five robbers carried the stone statue on a
two-wheeled handcart to the main road then used a truck at
midnight on March 25, said Xu Ming, an official with Beijing's
Municipal Cultural Relics Administration.
</P>
<P>
"The Buddha statue is as heavy as two tons," Xu said, "but we
were left no trace after the well-conceived criminal plot."
</P>
<P>
Police said they are expediting the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Local government has listed Beijing's oldest statue of Buddha,
allegedly having high historical and aesthetic value, as a rare
relic since 1957. However, the house was not equipped with any
automatic warning device.
</P>
<P>
Police had previously advised local people to use better
anti-theft measures after they decided to open the house to the
public.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing vice mayor immediately urged all levels of cultural
relics administrations to re-examine security precautions,
especially at ancient sites in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Suburban Beijing now has more than 7,000 ancient relics and
ruins, including precious stone tablets, ancient towers, tombs,
stone bridges and statues, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to See Troops, Slave House in Senegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
end his African tour in Senegal Thursday after Promoting an
African peace-keeping force and Visiting an island where slaves
were shipped to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in the Senegalese capital Dakar late Tuesday with
his wife Hillary on his six leg of a 12-day Six-nation African
tour, and was met at airport by Senegalese President Abdou Diouf.
</P>
<P>
A report from Dakar quoted Clinton as saying he felt that "the
whole Africa trip has been very good" and that he is to meet
Diouf at the presidential palace Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night in midway during his eight-hour flight from
South Africa to Senegal, Clinton got permission from Zimbabwe to
let his plane enter its airspace so that he could take a peek at
the magnificent Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
"It really took your breath away. It was spectacular," Clinton
told White House Press Secretary Mike Mccurry when describing his
view of the spectacular natural wonder.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also made a courtesy phone call to French President
Jacques Chirac on his flight and they talked for 15 minutes about
Africa.
</P>
<P>
On midday Wednesday Clinton will take a helicopter to nearby
Thies military base to review Senegalese troops being trained by
U.S. army special forces for peace-keeping duties with the
African crisis response initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative aims to provide equipment and training to
between 10,000 and 12,000 African soldiers in companies and
battalions commanded by African officers.
</P>
<P>
Some African states frowned on the U.S. move and after a
difficult start, the force is now beginning to be operational.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has completed initial training with troops from
Senegal, Uganda and Malawi and begun training a Malian battalion.
Ghana and Ethiopia have also signed up for training.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Clinton will tour Goree island, a 20-minute ferry
ride from Dakar. The island was a major shipping point for the
slave trade, mostly to north and south America, and is now a
tourist destination with its slave house restored to show the
horrible conditions slaves endured before sailing to the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over two million Africans were sent as
slaves from Goree island to the American colonies between 1680
and 1786.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leading Aircraft Company Turns First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI), the largest state-owned company of Israel, turned a profit
of 24.3 million U.S. dollars in 1997, after five years of
continuous losses, local newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted IAI board of directors, which formally
approved the result on Tuesday, as saying that it attributed the
profit to the fact that the firm's recovery plans have finally
been fully implemented, and are now bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
The company's goal is to achieve earnings of 2 billion dollars
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
IAI's revenues jumped 15 percent in 1997, to 1.69 billion
dollars. The company also signed 2.3 billion dollars worth of new
contracts last year, bringing its order backlog to an all-time
high of 3.2 billion dollars as of the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The company succeeded in substantially increasing its sales to
the civilian market last year. Civilian sales totaled 600 million
dollars, or 35 percent of IAI's total sales.
</P>
<P>
IAI was also Israel's leading exporter last year, selling 1.3
billion dollars overseas. This constitutes 9 percent of Israel's
total exports.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Affected by Asian Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam must review and if necessary
readjust the major socio-economic goals set for this year to deal
with the negative influence caused by the Asian economic crisis,
said some of the country's leading economists.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the country must find and mobilize domestic
sources to replace decreasing foreign investment, reported the
latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review (VIR).
</P>
<P>
Due to the crisis, some donors of Official Development
Assistance (ODA) have almost frozen their commitments to Vietnam
while the depreciation of regional currencies has reduced value of
those ODA packages that have been committed.
</P>
<P>
They along with policy makers have warned that cash flow from
foreign direct investment will be greatly reduced this year,
adding pressure to the country's investment capital for
development.
</P>
<P>
Such a tendency will create more difficulties for Vietnam in
achieving socio-economic development targets, not only this year
but in the near future as well, the VIR noted.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, a number of foreign-owned projects
have either been forced to slow down or been canceled due to
shortage of capital.
</P>
<P>
The regional crisis has also adversely affected several other
sectors of Vietnam including import and export, aviation and
tourism as well as industrial production.

<HEADLINE> Annual Headline Inflation Falls in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Annual headline inflation dropped
in March to a record low of 4.8 percent from 9.7 percent of last
year, the New Vision paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annual headline inflation is a comparison between the rate of
inflation at this time last year and the rate at the same time
this year.
</P>
<P>
The indices collected by the Statistics Department of Uganda
showed that this is the lowest record in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
A release published by the government Tuesday said that food
prices also decreased in March.
</P>
<P>
It said that prices of staple foods in eastern Mbale district
dropped by two percent, in Kampala by 13 percent, in eastern city
of Jinja also by 13 percent, and in southwestern Mbarara by nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the prices of manufactured consumer goods such as clothes
and footwear, utilities such as electricity, personal goods such
as soap, remained stable, the figures indicated.
</P>
<P>
The food prices dropped partly because the rains securing
harvest were abundant.
</P>
<P>
The indices showed that the Ugandan currency is stable,
interest rates are falling and the government expenditure is
within the budgeted limits.

The Maguindanao provincial health office is now in the midst of
preparation for emergency measures to control natives in the towns
of North Upi and South Upi from eating the wild root crop again.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of information drive could persuade the natives not
to eat the poisonous crop even if it means death. They would
rather take the risk than die of hunger," provincial health chief
Tahir Sulaik noted.
</P>
<P>
He said they managed to save other victims by letting them eat
"gata" (boiled coconut milk) with sugar.
</P>
<P>
Patients suffered from symptoms of food poisoning, that of
severe stomach pain and vomiting after eating the wild root crops,
the health officer said.
</P>
<P>
With this, Sulaik has also called on the local government to
look and respond to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the southern provinces of Columbio, Sultan
Kudarat, at least 600 native families "were already pushed to the
wall" due to poverty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"They, too, are eating the poisonous crop just to survive," it
said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: East Asian Currency Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Most East Asian currencies have
advanced to four-month highs against the greenback during the past
two months, but the recovery by regional currencies may be not
sustainable and would soon draw to a close.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-January, the currencies of Thailand, the Philippines,
Malaysia, South Korea and even Indonesia, have recovered by 15
percent to over 35 percent, though their falls have been reported
at some trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the Thai Baht was traded at around 39 against the
U.S. dollar, the Philippine peso around 38, the Indonesian rupiah
8,600, South Korea's won 1,380, compared to 57:1 for the baht,
46:1 for the peso, 10,000:1 for the rupiah, and nearly 2,000:1 for
the won two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The steady rise in East Asian currencies reinforced the belief
by some people that the worst of the nine-month old financial
crisis in the region is over.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said that the rising trend may not last for
too long because the strengthening of the currencies are
attributed to several factors which do not reflect the reality of
the regional economic health.
</P>
<P>
According to them, technical corrections have partly pushed the
undervalued currencies higher.
</P>
<P>
Since the East Asian financial crisis broke out last July, the
regional currencies depreciated sharply by 15 percent to 76
percent. But by usual methods of calculation, such as purchasing
power parity, these currencies are undervalued between 10 percent
to as much as 30 percent, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
When the financial situation began to stabilize, technical
corrections in the undervalued currencies would also start, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor behind the currency recovery is less
speculative buying of the dollar by local corporations recently.
In mid-January, when the regional currencies fell to their record
lows, lot of companies were involved in speculations in fear of
further devaluation of the currencies.
</P>
<P>
Such activities stopped gradually when local companies saw the
continuous rise in the currencies, and less demand for the dollar
boosted the strengthen of East Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
But the most important driving force behind the stronger
regional currencies is the inflows of U.S. dollars from foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms undertaken by East Asian countries, the
relaxation of exchange control in Thailand and the lift of trading
band in the Philippines, the rescheduling of South Korea's
short-term debts, are among the positive measures which are
restoring investors' confidence in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, investors have been pumping funds to
the region to pick up less-expensive assets and helped lift the
regional currencies. Since the beginning of the year, foreign
funds in South Korea's stock market reached 3.2 billion dollars,
further strengthening the won's position.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the recovery, to some extent, is not always good
news for regional economies, which have yet to bottom up from the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
When the economies are still week, economists said, the
regional currencies may have rallied too far and too fast for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
The earlier and stronger recovery at the current economic level
could only appeal for market volatility again, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Other economists also believe that as political and economic
uncertainties, such as the May elections in the Philippines, the
outcome of talks between the International Monetary Fund and
Indonesia, remain in the region, the recovery could not be
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Akapol Sorasuchart, spokesman of the Thai government, warned
earlier this week, the Thai economy has not recovered sufficiently
to justify the currency's advance, which is unsustainable at
current levels.
</P>
<P>
Since the stronger currencies will also hurt East Asian
countries' exports, central banks may intervene in the market when
their currencies become too strong compared with their economic
reality.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday, East Asian currencies eased in the
trading after recent runs. Some analysts predicted that the
two-month recovery may finally be drawing to a close.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 31 (Xinhua) -- With goals from Pablo Islas,
Diego Latorre and Walter Samuel, Boca Juniors of Argentine
trounced Mexico 3-1 in a World Cup warmup here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico scored the opener through Jaime Ordiales with only two
minutes into the game which attracted a few hundred spectators.
</P>
<P>
However, the advantage enjoyed by Mexico with Ordiales' header
died down as both teams played an excessively friendly match with
few scoring chances for either side.
</P>
<P>
After 24 minutes, Islas scored the equalizer with a grounder
from a great pass by Claudio Caniggia for a 1-1 at break.
</P>
<P>
In the second half Boca mounted its attack, while Mexico just
tried to weather the storm. In the 75th, Diego Cagna passed the
ball to Latorre who scored with a chip shot from outside the box.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, a great shot by Caniggia smashed into a goalpost
before Samuel headed in the ender in the 85th minute.

SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's consumer prices
dropped 0.2 percent last month, the first month-on-month decline

</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the prices in April are expected to

<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to its family
planning policy in tandem with social and economic development,
said Zhang Weiqing, the newly-appointed minister in charge of the
State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with People's Daily, Zhang said China
planned to establish a benefit-oriented mechanism together with
strict management to reach the population growth target set by the
government, the paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two decades of population control have resulted in 300 million
fewer people, Zhang said. The annual population net increase,
however, still remains at some 13 million.
</P>
<P>
The commission has decided to keep the total population under 1.3
billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and other health institutions should provide proper
advice and good services for pregnant women. Consultation services
for the Chinese regarding sex should also be strengthened, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2021, China will have improved its people's
physical and intellectual quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the country will reach a population peak
of 1.6 billion in the middle of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged improvement in family planning organizations
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
While ensuring the implementation of the policy, the government
must help people in poverty-stricken areas, he added.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim has been chosen as the
new chairman of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Development Committee, the Malaysian news agency Bernama reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar replaces Driss Jettou, the former finance minister of
Morocco, who has served as the committee chairman representing the
Near Eastern and North African group of countries over the past
three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Anwar as the Development Committee chairman
was announced in Washington Tuesday, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Malaysia is serving as chairman of the
committee representing the Southeast Asian group of countries made
up of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Fiji, Laos, Myanmar,
Singapore, Tonga and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is expected to serve for two years as the new
chairman, would be leading discussions on the implications of the
Asian financial crisis, debt relief for the highly-indebted
countries and capital increase for the World Bank's Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), Bernama said, quoting
executive secretary of the committee Alexander Shakow as saying in
Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar will chair the committee's next meeting on April 17 in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The committee meets every six months -- during the World
Bank/IMF's Spring and annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee's 24 members -- mostly ministers of
finance or development -- represent the full membership of the
bank and the fund.
</P>
<P>
This unique multilateral forum, created in 1974, is the only
broadly representative group of key policy makers focused
specifically on developing country issues.
</P>
<P>
Anwar has served as Malaysia's finance minister since March
1991 and as deputy prime minister since 1993.

CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimmer Richard Upton
was fined 2,000 Australia dollars (1,320 U.S. dollars) and given a
severe reprimand on Wednesday after he was found guilty of taking
a banned drug.
</P>
<P>
Upton, who won a relay silver medal at this year's world
championships in Perth, tested positive for the masking agent
probenecid in an out-of-competition test on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Upton told a hearing on Saturday that he unwittingly took the

The Australian Swimming (ASI) disciplinary committee said in a
statement that Upton had been found guilty of a doping offence
even though he had taken the drug inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old escaped a susupension of maximum three months
and will be eligible to compete in next month's Commonwealth Games
trial in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Warned of Lightning Hazards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Experts have warned residents in
the Chinese capital to be on guard against lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 300 television sets, 200
telephones and 100 Internet-connected computers were destroyed by
lightning in 1997, in addition to serious damage to buildings and
power transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that 86 percent of the damages occurred
because of a lack of good-quality lightning arresters on
buildings, Today's Beijing Daily quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said other factors for the disasters included: an
increase in the number of tall buildings; poor management and
anti-lightning equipment; electrical equipment and instruments that
are not up to the standards against lightning; and people's lack
of knowledge of how to prevent lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
To prevent lightning strikes and reduce economic losses,
concerned departments established a testing center on the safety
of lightning arresters in 1993, and opened 48 testing stations in
both urban and suburban areas of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Regular training courses are held each year to improve the
quality of workers in these stations.
</P>
<P>
At present, 85 percent of lightning arresters installed in the
city have passed quality examinations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Exports of machinery and
electronics rose to 8.77 billion U.S. dollars in the first two
months of this year, a 33.2 percent increase from the same period
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is 17.5 percent higher than that of China's
foreign trade and the exports account for 35.2 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
The increasing exports should be attributed to efforts made by
manufacturers, said officials from the Machinery and Electronics
Export Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They said that manufacturers have paid more attention to
product quality and adopted a multi-outlet export strategy.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronics imports were worth 7.77 billion
U.S. dollars for the same period.
</P>
<P>
To further increase exports of machinery and electronics, the
Import and Export Bank of China will provide more than 20 billion
yuan in loans to manufacturers, 60 percent more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country had a total of 59.32 billion U.S. dollars worth of

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Communist Party Wins Parliament Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party has strengthened
its hold on the Ukrainian parliament, winning the largest share of
the vote -- 24.96 percent -- in the parliament election.
</P>
<P>
According to initial results released Tuesday by the Central
Election Commission, the rightist Rukh Party ranks second, polling
9.3 percent and the Socialist-Peasants alliance third with 8.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Three others including the Green Party, the Popular Democratic
Party and the Progressive Socialist Party, have gained entrance
into the parliament by only clearing the four percent hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 450 parliament seats will be apportioned among the
six parties and the other half go to winners of individual races
in 225 electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary poll results for the 225 districts showed that 114
winners had no party affiliations while 37 belonged to the
Communist Party, 13 to the Popular Democratic Party, and the
remaining 61 to more than 20 parties.
</P>
<P>
Observers have noted that the Communist Party, which opposes
drastic reforms and advocates protecting the interests of the
general public and developing ties with the nations in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), has gained greater
popularity.
</P>
<P>
Its policies, together with a growing nostalgia among older
voters due to worsening economic conditions, have helped increase
the party's influence in the eastern and southern parts of the
country whose inhabitants are mostly Russian.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to the split of votes in the parliament, the
Communist Party fails to become a majority party despite its
apparent lead in the election.
</P>
<P>
Even with alliance with the Socialist Party and the Agarian
Party, it can at best win a simple majority and still have
difficulty to honor its pledge of revising the constitution,
authorizing the parliament to form government and eliminating the
presidency -- because each requires a two-third favorable vote.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, since 22 parties have entered the parliament,
competition among them might intensify the internal conflicts
within the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the strengthened status of the Communist Party
and other uncompromising parties in parliament may signify a
continued power struggle between the parliament and the president.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said his country will maintain
its domestic and foreign policies after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine held its Supreme Soviet (parliament) and local
elections Sunday, with some 65 percent of the 37 million eligible
voters voted.

foreign-owned sector will finally amount to roughly
some 30 percent, the VIR said.
</P>
<P>
The VIR said this has been brought about by such industries
that face increased difficulties due to lack of markets as
television and radio sets, electric and diesel generators as well
as telecommunication equipments.

<HEADLINE> Luxury Hotels in Beijing Cash in on Non-smoking Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua)-- High-grade hotels in the Chinese
capital are designating non-smoking rooms to accommodate overseas
tourists.
</P>
<P>
When reserving rooms at luxury hotels in Beijing, a customer is
asked his or her preference for non-smoking accommodation.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have smoking-free floors, customers who dislike
cigarettes would give us up for other hotels," said a clerk with
the New World Hotel at the Beijing-Shanghai Plaza. "Such rooms and
floors are preconditions to winning potential customers."
</P>
<P>
Lin Zhaoxiu, with the reservations department of the Palace
Hotel, said: "It has become a necessity for hotels to open
non-smoking floors as people are becoming more health-conscious."
The five-star hotel in downtown Beijing now has 22 percent of its
rooms labeled as non-smoking rooms.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy of the smoking-free rooms in high-grade hotels is
generally higher than ordinary rooms, and the customers are mostly
foreign business people.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Lin, director of the reservations department at
the four-star Great Wall Hotel, 70 percent of American customers
prefer non-smoking rooms, followed by people from Europe and
Singapore. Male customers seem pickier, with 60 percent of them
asking for non-smoking accommodations, while only 40 percent of
females want to stay away from a smoking environment.
</P>
<P>
People in the hotel business in Beijing point out that it is
still too early for hotels with three stars or less to designate
non-smoking floors, as people's environment and health awareness
is largely decided by their economic status.
</P>
<P>
An attendant with an ordinary hotel in western Beijing
dismissed the idea as impractical. "We can only ask our customers
not to spit," she said. "If we tell them smoking is not allowed
here, who will come?"
</P>
<P>
Her hotel attracts only domestic business, she said.

<HEADLINE> 315 Buildings in Bangkok Rated Poor on Fire Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 315 buildings, or 22
percent of those inspected in Bangkok over the past year, are
considered by city officials as lack of sufficient fire safety
measures, the Bangkok Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's office
of municipality conducted 10 rounds of inspection from March 4 to
November 19 last year and checked 1,081 buildings.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 133 were rated good, 787 fair and 89 poor.
</P>
<P>
Another 432 buildings were inspected during four rounds of
inspection conducted this year. Of these buildings, 48 were rated
good, 157 fair and 226 poor. One was not evaluated.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, poorly rated buildings totalled 315 among the 1450
buildings inspected.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministerial regulation, buildings built before 1992
are required to have six fire safety measures --fire escapes,
posting of building plans in rooms or walkways inside the
building, mobile extinguishers, fire alarms, exit signs and
lights, and lightning conductors.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Helps Jobless Youth With Self-employed Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
distribute 2.47 billion taka (53.7 million U.S. dollars) in loans
for creating self-employment opportunities for the country's
jobless youth, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament on Tuesday that
arrangements had been made to disburse 1.02 billion taka (22.17
million dollars) during the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
To help the unemployed youths to get jobs, an employment bank
would be set up, for which 500 million taka (10.87 million
dollars) had been allocated in the 1997-98 national budget, Hasina
said. The fund would be gradually raised to 3 billion taka (65.22
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government wanted to help the youths, instead of searching
for jobs on completion of education, set up their own business,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hasina rejected a proposal for giving "unemployment allowance"
to the jobless youth, saying that would encourage them to be
involved in criminal and anti-social activities such as drug
addiction, smuggling and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We want to establish our youth with full honor and dignity in
the society," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> Jones Signed to Show up in Fastest Woman Race in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- American world champion Marion
Jones has signed a contract to show up in the world fastest woman
100 meters race scheduled on May 12 in Chengdu, southwestern city
of China, an official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Duan Shijie, head of the Chinese Athletics Menagement Center
told Xinhua through a telephone interview:"Jones has signed the
contract. According to the contract, She cann't skip the race
unless she is hit by unexpected injury or illness."
</P>
<P>
Duan said U.S. Olympic 100-meter champion Gail Devers still
needs to settle some details with CAMC before reaching the deal.
</P>
<P>
The official press conference will be delayed till next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Duan refused to reveal how much appearence fees for Jones and
Devers, saying:"We have the international standard in mind, and we
know that our guests are unwilling to expose their appearence
fees."
</P>
<P>
If Devers decides to compete, it will be the first time for the
veteran Olympic winner and young world champion Jones vying
head-to-head in a big race. Devers withdrew from the world 100
meters last year.
</P>
<P>
According to CAMC, Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine and Sevatheda
Fynes of Bahamas, the world 100 meters silver and bronze
medallists in Athens last year, plus Susanthika Jayashinghe of Sri
Lanka, the world 200-meter runner-up, have settled the deal with
CAMC to run the unprecedented challenge at an outdoor 30,000
stadium.
</P>
<P>
The prize money for the winner is not available to know. The
idea of the race was triggered off by the 150-meter challenge
between Donovan Bailey of Canada and Michael Johnson of the United
States last June. Bailey won one million U.S. dollars as the
winner. The appearence fees were 500,000 dollars for each.
</P>
<P>
China's Li Xuemei, a quarter-finalist at the Athens Worlds last
summer, will challenge the big names in her hometown, capital city
of Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Li shocked the world with a 10.79-second run in the 100 meters
at the Eighth Chinese National Games last October in Shanghai. It
was the listed second fastest time in the world last year to
Jones' 10.76.
</P>
<P>
Li's coach Zhang Rongwei said yesterday:"We have given up
several races in the earlier months to focus on the
showdown. During the winter training, Li undertook a lot of
running ranged from 200 to 300 meters. That has boosted her
stamina and strength magnificently.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, I will let her run some 100 meters. Her first
100m outdoor race will be arranged in April. Li will give it her
best in the challenge race. I hope she can turn up a sub-11 second
clocking at the time."
</P>
<P>
Zhang also pointed out the hope of beating Jones is very
slim. "We know Jones is very strong and fast, but Li has a heart
to kill some giant names and is ready to pose some tough challenge
to the world medal winners," he added.

<HEADLINE> Karen Guerrillas Torch Market in Thai Border Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Suspected Democratic Karen
Buddhist Army (DKBA) guerrillas from Myanmar torched a market in
Thailand's northern province of Mae Hong Son, the Bangkok Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified number of armed foreign fighters reportedly
crossed the border river between Thailand and Myanmar and torched
a restaurant in Ban Mae Sam Laeb market Tuesday afternoon, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Fanned by strong winds, the blaze quickly spread and destroyed
more than 100 houses, living quarters of rangers and border
officials and the building of a public health station.
</P>
<P>
It took villagers, soldiers, local police and officials more
than five hours to put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
The damage was initially estimated at no less than 10 million
baht (263,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A border official said the arson attack might have been
launched by a group of DKBA guerrillas who had earlier been
arrested by Thai rangers on border intrusion charges.
</P>
<P>
Some guerrillas had warned of sabotage activities in some
border areas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the DKBA was planning to attack two refugee
camps which house more than 10,000 Karen refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai army said it welcomes a greater role for
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
taking care of Karen civilians sheltered in camps along the
Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as a shift of Thailand's policy on Myanmar
refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative in Thailand, Amilia Bonafacio, met with
Thai army chief, Gen. Chettha Thanajaro, and agreed with the
latter's proposal that the Karen camps be moved 10 kilometers
deeper inside Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. body was ready to fund the building of refugee camps
and public utilities.
</P>
<P>
The Karens now housed at the 19 camps will be resettled at
eight new camps. Authorities are looking for suitable sites to
ensure the new camps won't pose a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Thai army chief also asked the UNHCR representative to make
sure the refugees would not be allowed to stay too long in
Thailand. They must be sent back home though their repatriation
would depend on the situation in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Victims of School Shooting Remembered in Jonesboro, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday told mourners in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to remember and
honor the memories of the four students and one teacher killed in
a school-yard shooting a week ago.
</P>
<P>
In a taped message televised to Tuesday night's "Service for
Hope and Healing" on the Arkansas State University campus, Clinton
said the five victims "had much to live for and much still to
give. For now, you must all be thankful for the cherished memories
you have."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 people attended the memorial service for
the four girls aged 11-12, and a 32-year-old teacher killed in the
March 24 ambush, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said: "Like all of you, I do not understand what dark
force could have driven two young people to do this terrible
thing. ... For now, all we can do is pray for peace and healing
for their families and for Jonesboro. And, indeed, we should pray
for the families of the two young suspects, for their suffering
too must be grievous."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno, who attended the service, said
each of the victims "represented the joy and the wonder of life
itself, and then they walked out of school and into the hearts and
minds of America. They have touched our lives and they have
touched the spirit of this nation and raised us up, even as we
grieve for them."
</P>
<P>
Townspeople who gathered for the community memorial heard a
reading of the victim's names, followed by the tolling of a
memorial bell and a moment of silence.

populous state, has thrown its 20-billion-dollar market for
electricity open to competition, affecting 10 million customers of
the investor-owned utilities.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation, which will enable customers to have a choice
in selecting an electric provider, is the beginning of a vast,
complex undertaking destined to point the way for the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
A new state law has made more than 70 percent of Californian
consumers eligible to make the switch. Most of the people are
customers of three major investor-owned utilities.
</P>
<P>
The state legislation also requires existing investor-owned
utilities and new competitors to cut rates 10 percent for all
residential and small business consumers. The reduction went into
effect on January 1 for those customers of the big three utilities
and will remain in place during a four-year transition period,
after which the market will be fully deregulated.
</P>
<P>
But none of these changes apply to the 30 municipal-owned
utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
which are exempt from the law. Customers of these public
utilities will have to wait a few years until market pressures
force the providers to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
As far as households are concerned, the response to the
deregulation, or revolution as some people put it, has not been
too enthusiastic. Fewer than 40,000 of the state's 10 million
eligible electricity customers have told their utility company
that they want to switch to a different electricity provider.
</P>
<P>
But big commercial and industrial users appear to be paying
more attention. They use a lot more electricity and have leverage
to negotiate the best deals.
</P>
<P>
Residential users can also band together to wield more clout. A
few cities have announced plans to turn their municipalities into
buying pools to get lower rates for residents.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 companies have registered with the California Public
Utilities Commission to enter the new market. But only 55 of them
have signed the necessary agreement to get power for their
customers.
</P>
<P>
Legislators and market experts believe deregulation will cause
the price of electricity to drop. But consumers have been told
there are no guarantees that competition will definitely produce
these results.

<P>
KIEV, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
Tuesday promised to help Ukraine to build closer ties with the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Finland, which takes up the EU presidency for the second half
of 1999, backed the development guidelines followed by the
Ukrainian government, said Ahtisaari in a joint conference with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he and the Finnish president exchanged views on
strengthening cooperation between the Baltic and Black Sea
countries, adding that Ahtisaari had agreed to participate in the
Baltic-Black Seas Summit in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said Ukraine regarded Finland as a major strategic and
political partner in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari also met Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and talked about expanding cooperation in
agriculture, energy, timber processing and paper making.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Weakening, Peru's Sea Water Temperature Cooler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sea waters off Peru's coast are
nearing normal temperatures as the "El Nino" phenomenon gradually
diminishes, the El Comercio journal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino," which means "The Baby" (the Christ Child) in
Spanish, refers primarily to a warm current of water in the
eastern part of the southern Pacific Ocean that occurs during the
Christmas season. It often raises water temperatures along the
coasts and leads to widespread and serious climatic changes,
including unusually warm weather and storms and/or droughts in
many countries throughout the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to Ena Jaimes, director of Peru's Meteorological and
Hydrological National Service, the sea waters in the Pacific Ocean
near Perus now register a temperature two degrees above the normal
level for this time of year, down from five degrees above normal
last December.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the atmospheric conditions will probably be
normal by June.

<HEADLINE> First Express Railway to Link Beijing with Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to start construction
of an express Beijing-Shanghai rail line in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the first high-speed railway in China is
estimated at 100 billion yuan (12.05 billion U.S. dollars), said a
Ministry of Railways official today.
</P>
<P>
Shen Zhijie, director of High-Speed Railway Pre-Feasibility
Research Office under the Ministry of Railways, said in an
interview with Xinhua that this will be a barred and electrified
double-deck railway of 1,300 kilometers with a designed speed of
more than 250 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic funds will be the major source to build the express
rail line," Shen said. "As the line is expected to generate good
profits, we are probing the possibility of using foreign
capital. We are also willing to conduct technical cooperation with
overseas."
</P>
<P>
While the existing Beijing-Shanghai rail line mainly takes
cargo transport, as well as small amounts of short-distance
passenger transport, the new express railway will be for
passengers only.
</P>
<P>
The transport capacity of the existing Beijing-Shanghai rail
line is nearing "saturation," Shen said. The Xuzhou-Nanjing
section reports the heaviest cargo load in the country, and the
Nanjing-Shanghai section reports the heaviest passenger traffic.
</P>
<P>
China raised the speed of trains on April 1, 1997. "Limited by
track conditions, it is hard to increase the capacity of the
Beijing-Shanghai rail line by a big margin," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The railway line linking the Chinese capital with the country's
largest industrial center also passes through a number of
economically advantaged and densely populated areas whose economic
activities and tourism have increased transportation demand.

Shen, former general engineer of the Ministry of Railways, said
that "to build a Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line signals
a big breakthrough in Chinese railway technology, with an
epoch-making significance expected to offer experience for the
country to build more high-speed railways.
</P>
<P>
China started the pre-feasibility research work for the line
in late 1994. Currently, only a few countries such as Japan,
France, Germany, Spain and Italy have high-speed railways with a
speed of more than 200 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that it will be necessary to build the railway
section after section. When one section is completed and put into
operation, that experience will be applied to building another
section.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safety, about one-third of the line will be
bridges. High-speed railway demands a higher quality of track
base, Shen said, making it necessary to use new land on some
sections.
</P>
<P>
Another source said that China is speeding up research efforts
on high-speed trains. At the test ground of the Beijing-based
Railway Sciences Institute, a China-made express train has been
tested at speeds exceeding 210 kilometers per hour. A
quasi-express train, designed by the Ministry of Railways, is
running well on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line, with a per hour speed
of 160 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> World Talent Boosts Chinese Pro Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- From Brazil to Bulgaria, from
Nigeria to Netherlands, from Argentina to Australia, never was it
like today that there are so many overseas footballers to show
their talent in Chinese professional league.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 57 players from 26 countries
are playing in China's first and second division leagues, all
setting records in history.
</P>
<P>
All but two of the 14 first division teams -- Shandong Luneng
and Chinese Army -- signed foreign players this season, some of
whom were transferred from world-famed clubs.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1994, when the pro league was inaugurated after China
failed to qualify for the World Cup finals, Chinese fans believed
that it would be a long way for China to form a multi-nation league
like Italy's Serie A or England's Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"It may be unimaginable four years ago that we have so many
foreigners here," said Guo Hui, an official from the Professional
Department of Chinese Football Association (CFA). "And the
imported players' level has seen an steady improvement."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a player from second or third division leagues in
western countries can play as a backbone in China's Division A
clubs, while national players might be rejected by a second
disivion team this season, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 of the 57 foreign players have played for the national
sides or Olympic teams at home.
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Nemecek of China's Division A champion Dalian Wanda, 31,
who moved from Sparta Parague, was reported to be the captain of
Czech Republic early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Edward Kangwa, James Phiri, Sidney Mambwe, all of Qingdao
Hainiu, were chosen from Zambia's national squad, with Phiri
playing the African Nations Cup finals early this year.
</P>
<P>
Vanguards Huandao signed Cveiba Ahrik and Chihrace Djordje,
former national player from Russia and Ukraine
respectively. Sichuan Quanxing's Zoran Masic was one of the best
strikers the Yugoslavian league.
</P>
<P>
But the most familiar one was Beijing Guoan's midfielder Jorge
Campos, who was voted Footballer of the Year 1997 for leading
Guo'an to runners up in the first division league and champion of
the CFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Paraguan was called up last week by national
coach Paulo Carpegiani to start a World Cup tuneup match against
Colombia in Connecticut. But he failed to show up in the match
after he did not get his entry visa to the U.S. in time.
</P>
<P>
Campos' teammate Olivas Rubio Andres of Spain, 31, also found
his fame in China by scoring 10 goals last season for Guo'an,
placing third in the individual goals tally.
</P>
<P>
Of all the 33 goals by Guo'an in the league last season, 21
were scored by these three foreigners, with another Paraguan
Casiano Wilberto adding six and Campos five.
</P>
<P>
And as a whole, 108 players left their marks on the goals
standings last season, but 25 overseas scored 134 of the 366 total
goals.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that foreign players have decided the outcome
of every match, a team's relegation or promotion," said Su
Yongshun, former head coach of Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
The overseas players have again showed their spectacular
performance in the first round of the new season.
</P>
<P>
Rudinei Amandid of Brazil proved his talent from the soil of
triple World Cup Champions by scoring a hat trick for his second
divison Shaanxi Guoli's 4-3 win over Guangdong Hongyuan.
</P>
<P>
Kangwa of Hainiu, Brazilian Camargo Moura of Shanghai Shenhua,
Bulgarian Iassen Petrov of Jiangsu Jiajia and Canmeroon's Alex
Agbo of Chongqing Hongyan all opened the scoring for their clubs
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"They give a boost for China's soccer," said Zhang Jilong, vice
president of CFA, "especially when we suffered a setback after
failing to qualify for the France World Cup Finals for the fifth
consecutive time."
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that foreign players will play a more important
role with the new season running. "They will work better together
with their Chinese teammates on and off the pitch with time going
on. Then they will bring their talent into better play."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Cuban Military No longer a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's military forces no
longer pose a threat to the United States, said Commander
Charles Wilhelm of the U.S. Southern Command on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban forces have been reduced by half since the former
Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, and they have turned to
farming to survive, Wilhelm told a hearing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider the current Cuban armed forces to be a
threat to the United States," Wilhelm said, adding, "It is a force
that can no longer project itself beyond the boundaries of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We have convincing evidence that as much as 70 percent of the
effort of the existing forces is being expended on agricultural and
other self-sustaining activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm said the U.S. had no indications that Cuba was
fomenting instability in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
"It is a force that maintains internal order. It is no longer
an offensive force," he said during a hearing on U.S. anti-drug
policies in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when asked about a Pentagon report
requested by Congress on the military threat posed by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald reported on Sunday that a study, conducted by
the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that Cuba poses no
significant threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Pentagon intelligence portrays Cuba's
Revolutionary Armed Forces as a severely diminished military and
downplays the risks posed by chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The classified report also suggested that the U.S. and Cuban
armed forces should begin working together to reduce tensions in
the region, the Herald said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon was expected to release the report on Tuesday but
it was reported that it decided to delay the release for more
revisions.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that such a report may lead to a gradual
lifting of the embargo against Cuba imposed by the U.S. 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, some legislators in the Congress oppose lessening
sanctions against the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. administration decided to soften
the sanctions by allowing humanitarian flights to Cuba and to
allow Cubans living in the U.S. to mail cash to relatives still
residing in Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Croatian citizens, who fled their
country during the war, are being allowed to return, the Croatian
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a return program, a person who wishes to go back should
personally submit an application for return to a Croatian
diplomatic mission in the country of residence.
</P>
<P>
The applicant should present valid personal documents or other
papers. Without papers, they must fill in a questionnaire and
write a biography.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Interior Ministry will process the request within
three months.
</P>
<P>
A person who receives a citizenship certificate will then
submit a request for a travel document to the authorized
diplomatic mission so they can return.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic mission will in the meantime get a certificate
on the returnee's accommodation conditions from the Reconstruction
and Development Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The government wanted to show again its willingness to enable
all those who want to return to do so," said Lovre Pejkovic, head
of the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Pejkovic said Yugoslavia had 24,000 people who want to return
while Republika Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, does not have a
detailed list.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated however that about 3,500 people want to return
from Republika Srpska to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Serbs were returning to Croatia, but around
450,000 Croatian citizens remained abroad, according to Pajkovic.

JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stanley Fischer will arrive in
Jakarta on Thursday for talks with Indonesian government
officials, an IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Fischer's visit was to review the reform plan in
Indonesia, said PR. Narvekar, IMF senior adviser to Indonesia,

</P>
<P>
"Fischer wishes to discuss everything. He has to be satisfied
so he also can tell the managing director he's satisfied," local

</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss has

agreement on economic and financial reforms on January 15, under
which Jakarta promised to conduct wide ranging economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF refused to provide its second tranche of 3
billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia early February, citing what it
said to be the lack of reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Liberalize Import of Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to implement a conditional liberalization of the import of
films, the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will reconstitute the National Film Corporation
to include among others a cinema owner, a lawyer and a cinema
critic, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In future, public performance will include the cinema screen,
television, video and other similar media.
</P>
<P>
These measures are being implemented on the recommendations of
a Presidential Committee which examined the situation of the
cinema industry.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also recommended that government control and
interference in the field of cinema should be minimized and
producers should be encouraged to produce quality films with
active state patronage, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Cinema owners will be allowed to import films on some
conditions which include the confirmation of 60 percent of
exhibition time for local films and channelling of a considerable
portion of additional income from the import of films to encourage
local production, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A sound code of conduct for the Public Performance Board and
laws to classify television films are among other recommendations.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Tuesday denied press reports that suspected Saudi
terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hakim Mujahid, the newly appointed Taliban ambassador to
Pakistan, said in a telephone interview that Osama was still in
Kandahar, Taliban's stronghold in southern Afghanistan, as a guest
of Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that U.S. commandos had arrived in
Afghanistan for the arrest of the 41-year-old Saudi
multi-millionaire.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the United States contacted the Taliban
about Osama, Mujahid said American authorities made a complaint in
New York that Osama had issued a decree for the killing of
Americans but "we dispelled the impression."
</P>
<P>
Taliban spokesman Hakim Akhund said in Kandahar by telephone
that Osama, who is wanted both in Saudi Arabia and the U.S., was
"very much safe" and spending his life independently.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened this week in the U.S. missions
throughout Pakistan following unconfirmed threats from Osama, who
reportedly directed his followers around the world to take actions
against the U.S. interests.

<HEADLINE> China, Full of Investment Opportunities: Coca-Cola Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- "China is a country full of
investment opportunities," M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief
executive officer of The Coca-Cola Company, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ivester said that
Coca-Cola's investment in China always takes a long-term
perspective.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on China's investment environment,
Ivester, who became Coca-Cola chairman in October, said he
believes the adoption of an international standard will help
promote trade and that China has been progressive in adopting such
standards.
</P>
<P>
"China is integrating itself with the world economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world's leading soft-drink maker has opened 21 bottling
plants in China, with annual sales topping 320 million
cartons. The local content of the products has reached 98
percent. Three more bottling facilities will be added by early
1999.
</P>
<P>
"Our business in China is very successful," said Ivester, who
came to China to attend the March 28 launch of a bottling plant in
Shanghai's New Pudong Area. The 50-million-U.S. dollar facility,
which is the largest Coca-Cola plant in China, makes China Coke's
sixth largest market in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ivester, whose last visit to Shanghai was in 1995, said he was
very impressed by the "tremendous changes that have taken place in
Shanghai over a short period of time."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the current financial crisis in Southeast Asia,
Ivester said one should look at the crisis from a long-term point
of view and that he sees the crisis as an opportunity for
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in Asia. Our investment in the region
will increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that he thinks China is an exciting
place full of opportunity. "If I were younger, I would move here,"
said the 50-year-old Ivester with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Housing Reform Benefits Both State and General Public (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The welfare system for residential
housing distribution that has operated in China for decades is
expected to come to an end this year and a new market-oriented
system will be established to take its place.
</P>
<P>
Policy-making departments recently released details of a scheme
aimed at commercializing urban residential housing which will be
formulated in May. It is scheduled for nationwide implementation
in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
In his administrative program, Zhu Rongji, China's newly elected
premier, has included residential housing reform as one of the key
reforms that need to be strengthened, a move widely acclaimed in
economic circles.
</P>
<P>
Economists say residential housing is the best choice for China
to deepen its economic system reform and foster a market economic
system. They believe it will be beneficial both to the country and
to the masses of residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's urban residents have been living in
government-allocated houses for low rents. The result of this
welfare housing distribution policy is that more and more
residents are queuing up for houses despite the government's large
amount of money channeled to residential housing construction
every year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that presently China has more than three
million families with less than four square meters of living space
per person.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials say the essence of the upcoming
housing reform is to replace the system of direct housing
distribution with a system of subsidies. Residents will no longer
get their housing from the organizations they work with, but
instead will buy houses in the market.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Housing Reform Benefits Both State And General Public (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By reforming the residential housing policy, the Chinese
government is aiming to kill two birds with one stone: cultivating
the real estate industry into a new leg of economic growth while
solving the housing difficulties of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Economics Professor Guo Songhai said the government needs to
stimulate domestic demand to offset the negative impact of the
Southeast Asia financial crisis on the country's national economy,
and housing reform is one of the most important measures in this
direction.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China is
expected to build 240 million square meters of residential
housing, which can result in an annual consumption of 400 billion
yuan, about one-tenth of the outstanding amount of residential
deposits.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that to some extent residents have the ability to
afford buying a home of their own," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
China's well-known economist, Li Yining, said that when the
residential housing market is generally mobilized it will surely
spur demand for many products and industries, and fuel the central
government's objective of an economic growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the reform is coming at the right time because the
market economy has brought about fundamental changes in residents'
investment consciousness. Pilot housing reforms carried out in the
past two years in Shanghai, Guangzhou and some other cities have
been well-received by local residents, showing a solid social
basis, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made sufficient preparations to
ensure a smooth reform process. The key is a corresponding
financing system, which is taking shape and playing an
increasingly bigger role in raising funds for residential housing
development.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has announced
that this year it will set up a residential financing service
system and increase its input in residential housing to 100
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all commercial banks are allowed to handle
individual housing mortgages. The Construction Bank of China has
announced that this year it will channel 10 billion yuan into the
residential housing sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the public housing reserve system which originated
in Shanghai in 1991 has been extended to large- and medium-size
cities throughout the country. A nationwide residential housing
financing insurance system has been established.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest that there should be no worries about "bubbles"
in the real estate sector. The main reason is that the medium- and
low-price houses encouraged by the government have great demand
potential. This year the government allocated 42 billion yuan for
the development of moderately priced houses.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom May Benefit from Ministerial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China United Telecommunications
Corp (China Unicom) is likely to benefit greatly from the current
ministerial restructuring designed to free business from State
interference, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The three ministries of the electronic and power industries and
the railways, which jointly formed China Unicom in 1993, lost
their business administration when two of them, along with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, were combined to
establish the Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
The State Council defines the Ministry of Information Industry
as a macro-control watch-dog to supervise the development of
telecommunications, software and electronics-related products.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the new ministry will establish a vigorous climate
under which companies are able to compete fairly and rationally,"
the daily quoted Lu Jiangguo as saying.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom emerged at a time when China Telecom, owned by the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, monopolized the
country's huge telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
"Ending the monopoly situation meets the demands of both market
and technology development since one company can not cope with the
mushrooming telecommunications industry," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Unilateral Ceasefire With Leftist Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has approved a 91-day unilateral suspension of offensive military
operations against the leftist rebel group, the New People's Army
(NPA), starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire, which will end until the expiry of Ramos' term
on June 30, is the longest truce ever called by the government
with the insurgents, according to local press reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat to instruct the
military to immediately observe the suspension of military
offensives against the NPA guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The truce aims to encourage maximum participation of the
people, including the rebels, in promoting a "free and peaceful
atmosphere" for the May 11 elections, Abat said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ramos said, it would further strengthen the
gains that the peace negotiations between the government and the
NPA's political wing National Democratic Front (NDF) had achieved
thus far.
</P>
<P>
The government and the NDF signed an agreement on human rights
in the Netherlands last month, which they said could pave the way
for an eventual political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, the political arm of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, has been fighting the government for more than three
decades in some areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Military statistics estimated that from a high of 26,000 NPA
fighters in 1986, the number of the NPA members has gone down to
6,000 by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Launch "Lavatory Revolution" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of farmers in
northwest China's Gansu Province have turned to more sanitary
lavatories, a sign of improved living standards and the arrival of
more urban lifestyles in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The province has installed more than 700,000 lavatories in
rural areas, of which 450,000 are sanitary ones, government
sources say.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shengqiang, a farmer in Shuijiayao Village of Weiyuan
County, is one example. He built a pigsty, a lavatory and a
greenhouse in a line, with a methane-generating pit under the
pigsty and lavatory.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the manure and waste vegetables are fermented in
the pit to generate methane, which then is pumped into the kitchen
and the greenhouse for lighting, cooking, and heating.
</P>
<P>
The lavatory is clean and tidy, equipped with a bath heater.
"Back from farm work, it's so pleasant to take a shower before
cooking," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
A methane-generating lavatory saves a household some 600 yuan
annually, and helps raise vegetable quality because of the carbon
dioxide it provides for the greenhouse crops.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that farmers have spent more than 100 million
yuan on lavatories. In Linze County, for example, 90 percent of
farmers built sanitary lavatories. As a result, local farmers'
awareness of health care has increased and the rate of epidemic
diseases has been reduced by half, compared with 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that 80 percent of contagious diseases in rural
areas are caused by intestinal infections which are mainly caused
by unsanitary lavatories and water sources.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Exploiting Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
will map out a plan for water-resource exploitation this year.
</P>
<P>
As the place of origin for such main rivers as the Yellow,
Yangtze and Lancang, Qinghai has abundant water resources. It has
278 rivers and lakes with a basin area exceeding 500 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In the next 13 years, Qinghai will invest 30 million yuan
annually for five years to reinforce water-conservation projects
and develop 66,700 hectares of irrigated land.
</P>
<P>
The province will also expand water-saving technology, improve
irrigation systems and build up two water supply zones in the
western and eastern parts of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to curb soil erosion and reinforce farmland
infrastructure will also be taken in areas around the Huangshui
River, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and inland lakes,
</P>
<P>
A series of hydro-power stations will be established in areas
with abundant water resources such as Tarim, Datong and Baoku
lakes. Qinghai will also build a husbandry center in areas around
Qinghai Lake.
</P>
<P>
While exploiting water resources, the provincial government
will accelerate its regulation of water conservation structures
centering on water supply and hydro-power development.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Qinghai will repair 700 rundown water
conservation projects by 2000, with installed generating capacity
of 200,000 kilowatts. The provincial government will issue
regulations on management, fund input, price and reform of water
conservation projects.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Count Myna as First Step to Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists are going
to conduct a nationwide survey of the myna as the first step to
control the population of the aggressive and cheeky bird
introduced from India in the 1860s, warning it could become a
national problem for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Mynas are such a pest they have earned the name "garbage birds"
and "They're the common thugs of the bird world," said Chris
Tidemann of the Australian National University.
</P>
<P>
"They forcibly evict native parrots from tree hollows and
destroy their eggs and chicks. Like many introduced species they
have a very negative impact on native wildlife," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Tidemann, scientists are preparing a
major survey of myna numbers across Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The information we gather will help us decide if conservation
agencies need to be concerned, whether myna numbers need to be
controlled, or if their nests should be relocated," Tidemann said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a survey showed there were about 1,220 mynas in
Australia's capital city of Canberra. By 1998, numbers had soared
to more than five times of the 1990s figure, the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or the nation's
academy of sciences, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The myna is taking over territory and nesting sites from native
Australian birds and small mammals in Australia's eastern states,
</P>
<P>
Australian scientists said the myna is comparable to the cane
toad, the rabbit or the European carp, all of which were foreign
before white settlement in Australia and caused ecological
problems after they were introduced to the continent during the
past century or more.
</P>
<P>
In 1968, a resident in Canberra, reportedly nostalgic for the
sounds of Asia, released twelve common mynas in a suburb of the
capital.

<P>
On March 1, a wildcat well in the basin's hinterland gushed out
34 tons of light oil and nearly 50,000 cubic meters of gas a day,
representing a major breakthrough in oil exploration in the
Mosuowan area, of which 2,000 square kilometers are estimated to
have great potential oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
During the following two days, the Ke82 wildcat well in the
western part of the basin produced 210,000 cubic meters of gas
daily, while another wildcat well in the eastern part reported a
daily capacity of 56 tons of oil and 2,800 cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
The basin covers an area of 130,000 square kilometers in
northern Xinjiang. In the past four decades, 21 oil and gas fields
have been verified there.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the oil and gas fields there pumped 8.7 million tons
of crude oil and 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas, ranking fourth
in the country.

WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday
cited some progress in the latest talks on reviving the Middle
East peace process, which she said, however, was far from enough
to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the comment after speaking with U.S. special
envoy Dennis Ross earlier in the day to obtain his assessment of
the situation. Ross wrapped his four-day shuttle diplomacy in the
Middle East Monday, following his talks with Israeli, Palestinian
and Egyptian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some progress as a result of his most recent
trip, but really it's not nearly enough, I think, for us to say
there has been a breakthrough," Albright told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Ross's mission was to try to break an impasse between the
Israelis and Palestinians over the percentage of pullout of
Israeli troops from the West Bank. (US-Mideast)

BEIRUT -- Five Lebanese civilians were killed and one seriously
wounded by a bomb explosion Tuesday evening in south Lebanon,
Lebanon's Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place on a road near the village of Kaoukab
in the western sector of the Israeli self-styled security zone, 75
kilometers south of capital Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The roadside bomb went off at about 7 p.m. local time (1600
GMT) as the van carrying the Lebanese was passing by.
</P>
<P>
The victims were believed to be relatives of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen who were returning home from
their jobs inside Israel. About 2,500 SLA militiamen are helping
1,200-strong Israeli occupation troops patrol the security zone
set up in 1985.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. But a
spokesman of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said
that before the explosion, one of its guerrilla units attacked the
SLA post near the explosion site. Hezbollah is spearheading the
war to oust Israeli troops. (Lebanon-Roadsite Blast)

BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Border controls between Germany,

expansion of a European Union (EU) open-border pact.
</P>
<P>
Under the Schengen Agreement, border controls between seven EU

The Schengen accord was designed to realize free movement and

MINNEAPOLIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian ice dancers Anjelika
Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov dominated the compulsory dance at the
World Figure Skating Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Though an obvious misstep by Krylova on the second compulsory

"I think we skated well today, especially the first dance, the
Golden Waltz," said Krylova. "We had a little mistake in second
dance, but we did well."

<P>
Only the Hungarian and Swiss judges regarded Canadians
Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz the highest scores while the
other judges gave Canadians third.
</P>
<P>
Bourne and Kraatz and French pair of Marina Anissina and
Gwendal Peizerat shared for second after scores for the Silver
Samba and Golden Waltz were combined.

<P>
Another Russian team, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh, ranked
fourth, while Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow were
fifth.

<P>
ROME, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An 89th minute goal by Brazilian
midfielder Ze Elias brought Inter Milan one step closer to the
UEFA Cup final in Milan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-final first leg match, Inter Milan defeated Spartak
Moscow 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Inter, who squeezed past holders Schalke 04 in the
quarter-finals after extra time and twice overturned first leg
deficits in the earlier rounds, took the lead through Ivan
Zamorano. He powered a header in off the underside off the
crossbar on the stroke of halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Russians pulled level two minutes after the interval when
highly-rated midfielder Dmitry Alenichev danced through the home
defence and beat Ginaluca Pagliuca with a coolly placed shot which
bounced off the inside of the goalkeeper's inside post and
trundled across the line.
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the second half Inter pounded a stubborn and
well-organised defence marshalled by sweeper Dmitry Ananko.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo fluffed two chances he would usually be expected to
bury with his eyes closed, Argentine Javier Zanetti fired a shot
just over Aleksandr Filimonov's crossbar and Uruguayan substitute
Alvaro Recoba hit the post with a long-range effort.
</P>
<P>
In the end it was left to another South American to give Inter
a win which takes them a step closer to their eighth UEFA Cup
final and their second in succession.
</P>
<P>
With the seconds ticking away Ronaldo curled in Inter's
umpteenth corner of the night. Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu saw his
header blocked but Ze Elias made no mistake with the rebound.

four-year Whitewater investigation to just over 35 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In January, Starr's probe was expanded to include the relations
between former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and President
Bill. Dozens of witnesses have been subpoenaed to appear before
the Whitewater grand jury, one from as far away as Japan.

MADRID, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Lazio is one step away to reach
their first European final after a 1-0 victory over Atletico
Madrid in their UEFA Cup semifinal first leg here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rome side started slowly and had to withstand some early
Atletico pressure but made the vital breakthrough after 33 minutes
when an inch-perfect Alen Boksic pass found the unmarked Vladimir
Jugovic.
</P>
<P>
Jugovic blasted the ball beyond the reach of Francisco Molina
to score. Atletico again turned on the pressure for 15 minutes
after the break but ran out of steam in the later stages.
</P>
<P>
Atletico will be without both captain Santi Denia and striker
Jose Luis Caminero for the second leg after they received their
second yellow cards of the competition.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gov't Charges Japan, 48 Others for Unfair Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative released Tuesday its 13th annual report on foreign
trade barriers, specially charging Japan and the European Union
for erecting unfair barriers to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
The 411-page 1998 "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign
Trade Barriers" covered the alleged improper activities of 49
countries and regions as well as three regional trading groups.
</P>
<P>
The countries and regions ranged from Argentina to Zimbabwe as
well as the Arab League, the European Union and the Gulf
Cooperation Council are listed in the report, which puts countries
on notice that they could be subject to potential U.S. economic
sanctions if they do not mend their ways.
</P>
<P>
"There is much work that must be accomplished to ensure that
rules for fair and open trade are applied around the world," U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement
issued with the report.
</P>
<P>
She said the administration would continue to use all the trade
tools at its disposal including complaints before the World Trade
Organization and bilateral negotiations to open markets to the
U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's top priorities in market-opening
efforts were displayed in the report and, judging by the number of
pages taken up in the report, were likely to be Japan, with 50
pages, and the 15-nation European Union, with 30 pages.
</P>
<P>
The report also dedicated significant space to South Korea, 22
pages, and China, with 18 pages.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 was an exceptional good year for both U.S.
exports and the U.S. economy. In its seventh year of expansion
last year, the U.S. economy grew by a robust 3.8 percent in
constant 1992 dollars, while U.S. exports of goods and commercial
services expanded three times faster than the overall economy,
rising over 12 percent in constant dollar terms last year. As a
matter of fact, of the 260 billion U.S. dollar increase in U.S.
GDP last year, 106 billion dollars, or slightly over 40 percent,
was accounted for the increase exports.
</P>
<P>
The report listed all significant trade barriers including
policies restricting the import of good and services, export
subsidies, deficiencies in intellectual property protection, and
investment barriers.

<HEADLINE> China To Host International Symposium on Hui Ethnic Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will host an international
symposium on the Hui Ethnic Minority Group in October in the
capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhengui, director of Ningxia Academy of Social Sciences,
says that more than 100 specialists and scholars from various
countries and regions will be present to discuss the history,
culture, trade, religion, and education of the ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The Hui minority group has nine million people in China,
ranking third among its 55 ethnic minority groups. They can be
found in many provinces and autonomous regions across the country,
such as Ningxia, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. Up
to now, China has already held ten symposia on the subject.
</P>
<P>
The Hui people contain a mixture of many races from ancient
Persia, Arab countries, and China.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is China's only Hui autonomous region, and also is
China's center in the study of the Hui group.

<HEADLINE> Quality of U.S.-China Dialogue Will Be Enhanced: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to China James
R. Sasser said he firmly believes that the quality of the dialogue
between the U.S. and China will be enhanced by the wisdom of the
policy that both sides pursued in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he delivered the speech "From the
National People's Congress to the Next Summit: U.S.-China
Relations in 1998" at the Asia Society in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sasser, who has served in Beijing for over two years and seen
improvements in bilateral ties in the last two years, said much of
the future U.S.-China ties "will depend on how the U.S. as an
established power engages China as an emerging power."
</P>
<P>
He said the 21st century will be a century of great achievement
for the Asia Pacific region including China despite what happened
in Asia since last July when the financial crisis began.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, he said the two countries "have
accelerated efforts to address challenges confronting us" since
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. last year. He believed
that the relationship will be promoted with the forthcoming
visit of President Bill Clinton to China.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have laid the foundation for discussions on
climate change, reforms of energy and environment and other
issues, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Emergency Spending With Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday voted for a midyear spending bill but
offset President Bill Clinton's request with nearly 3 billion U.S.
dollars in domestic spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
The vote was a narrow 212-208 in favor of the bill along the
partisan line. Thwarted in their effort to eliminate the spending
cuts, Democrats lined up against the measure, even though Clinton
made the initial request for the new spending.
</P>
<P>
The bill would provide funds to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia
beyond an abandoned June deadline, pay for the recent military
buildup in the Gulf and provide disaster relief from last winter's
El Nino-driven weather.
</P>
<P>
Among the House-proposed cuts were reductions in low-income
housing subsidies, bilingual education and Clinton's
American-corps youth volunteer initiative.
</P>
<P>
The House version does not include the administration's request
for 18 billion U.S. dollars to help the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) weather the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, a version of the mid-year spending bill passed by the
Senate last week would finance the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The House-Senate conference committee on the spending bill is
expected to complete its work in late April.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Shen: Kosovo Issue, Yugoslavia's Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The question of Kosovo is,
in its essence, an internal matter of Yugoslavia and should be
resolved properly through talks between both parties concerned on
the basis of the principle of respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, said Shen Guofang Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese deputy representative to the United Nations made
the remarks at the Security Council of the United Nations before
voting on a draft resolution on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the government of Yugoslavia has taken a series of
positive measures in this regard, and the situation on the ground
is moving towards stability. China does not think that the
situation in Kosovo endangers international peace and stability,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen said ethnic issues are extremely complicated and
sensitive, especially in the Balkans. On the one hand, the
legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic groups should be
protected. On the other hand, secessionist activities by various
extremist elements should be prevented.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said many countries in the region are
multi-ethnic. If the Security Council is to get involved in a
dispute without the request from the country concerned, it may
create a bad precedent and have wider negative implications.
Therefore, the council should be cautious when addressing these
issues.
</P>
<P>
Shen stressed the priority issue in solving the question of
Kosovo of Yugoslavia is for the parties to start the political
talks early. However, the draft resolution before the council
would not help move the parties to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Shen said, it is inappropriate to bring into the
council the differences between the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Yugoslavia and the human rights
issues in Kosovo. Nor is it proper to link Yugoslavia's return to
the international community with the question of Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China has stated its principle position repeatedly at
the consultations in the council. Since the contents of the draft
resolution do not conform to its principle position, China has no
choice but to abstain, he added.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up, Paris Hits New Closing High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
reversed early losses and ended higher Tuesday, boosted by Wall
Street's strong opening, a firmer dollar and a rebound in Tokyo
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares had earlier drifted
lower, depressed by a weak oil sector and many institutions'
reluctance to trade ahead of the end of the first quarter, but later
Wall Street's strength helped the market close 0.34 percent or 20.3
points higher at 5,932.2.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that sterling's strength, interest rate concerns and
weaker index futures also kept stocks down for much of the session.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris surged to a fresh closing high, up
75.58 points or 1.99 percent at 3,875.81, boosted by a higher
dollar, Wall Street gains and a rebound in Tokyo stocks.
</P>
<P>
Among leading gainers, shares in French construction, engineering
and telecommunications group Bouygues were up on speculation about
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's DAX-30 index closed above the important
5,100-point level, up 92.59 points or 1.85 percent at 5,102.35, also

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans Demand U.S. to Ease Embargo on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans
went to the Capitol Hill Tuesday to demand unrestricted sales of
humanitarian goods such as food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The visitors, most of whom come from Miami, Florida, designated
Tuesday as the "National Day of Education and Advocacy for Food
and Medicine Sales To Cuba."
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-Americans sought to make their case in congressional
offices and at a news conference, buttressing their arguments with
a petition signed by 12,000 sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
They wore buttons saying, "End the embargo on food and medicine
to Cuba" and said they get the support of business, farm,
humanitarian and medical groups.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government imposed embargo on Cuba 36 years ago, food
sales to the Caribbean nation are still barred at present and
licenses must be obtained for the sale of medicines and medical
supplies now.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, some bipartisan proposals to end the restrictions
have been gaining momentum, but proponents of maintaining the
status quo still appear to have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia told the news
conference the United States cannot project itself as a caring
nation if it puts limits on humanitarian sales to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton decided earlier this month to allow
direct humanitarian flight to Cuba, permit Cubans in the U.S. to
post 1,200 U.S. dollars every year to their relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Sheehan, who recently retired from the military after
serving as commander of U.S. forces in the Atlantic, told the news
conference Tuesday the administration's decisions don't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
"Cuban-Americans, and religious and humanitarian groups that
currently send aid to Cuba, are here today to push for sales of
food and medicine because they know from experience that sending
more charity alone simply cannot solve the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy towards Cuba has been criticized worldwide both
by developing countries and the U.S. allies. After the anti-Cuba
Helms-Burton law was enacted in 1996, the European Union, Canada
and other countries insist the law runs against the free trade
principles.

<HEADLINE> 5 Lebanese Civilians Killed in Roadside Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese civilians were
killed and one seriously wounded by a bomb explosion Tuesday
evening in south Lebanon, Lebanon's Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place on a road near the village of Kaoukab
in the western sector of the Israeli self-styled security zone, 75
kilometers south of capital Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The roadside bomb went off at about 7 p.m. local time (1600
GMT) as the van carrying the Lebanese was passing by.
</P>
<P>
The victims were believed to be relatives of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen who were returning home from
their jobs inside Israel. About 2,500 SLA militiamen are helping
1,200-strong Israeli occupation troops patrol the security zone
set up in 1985.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. But a
spokesman of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said
that before the explosion, one of its guerrilla units attacked the
SLA post near the explosion site. Hezbollah is spearheading the
war to oust Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 1,200-square-kilometer zone after two
invasions of south Lebanon, under the pretext of protecting its
northern villages and towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, the cost for keeping Israeli troop presence in south
Lebanon has been high and this put pressure to bear on the Israeli
government for an early withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it is willing to comply with U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 which calls for Israeli pullout from Lebanon
provided security arrangements are worked out with Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, however, rejected the Israeli offer, citing that the
U.N. resolution demands unconditional withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Some Progress in Mideast, But No Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Tuesday cited some progress in the latest talks on
reviving the Middle East peace process, which she said, however,
was far from enough to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the comment after speaking with U.S. special
envoy Dennis Ross earlier in the day to obtain his assessment of
the situation. Ross wrapped his four-day shuttle diplomacy in the
Middle East Monday, following his talks with Israeli, Palestinian
and Egyptian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some progress as a result of his most recent
trip, but really it's not nearly enough, I think, for us to say
there has been a breakthrough," Albright told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Ross's mission was to try to break an impasse between the
Israelis and Palestinians over the percentage of pullout of
Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He brought so-called "new ideas" of the Clinton administration
to the region, suggesting Israel withdraw its troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in several stages with 12 weeks with the
Palestinians to make further efforts in security to meet Israel's
need. But he has failed to convince the Israelis with the
proposals. The Israeli government has rejected the proposals on
the ground of its security.
</P>
<P>
Albright said there was "a level of frustration" both in
Washington and in the Middle East because the stalemate had gone
on.
</P>
<P>
She said that because of lack of action, there had not been the
promised pullback of the Israeli troops from the West Bank. "The
multilateral aspects of the peace process have not been carried
out, and there's also no movement on the other tracks involving
Syria and other nations in the region," she said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the United States would disengage itself from the
Middle East mediation, Albright said nothing suggested she was
quitting. Instead, she said, "We want to keep making sure that the
process moves forward and that the gaps are narrowed."

<HEADLINE> Train Derailment Causes Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- At least seven railroad cars
and two locomotives derailed and caught fire Tuesday, producing
toxic smoke that forced authorities to evacuate five blocks and an
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
One of the cars contained thousands of gallons of acetone, a
flammable solvent that produces poisonous fumes when burned.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to a storage building near the tracks where
unidentified snow-removal chemicals are stored, The Associated
Press quoted police spokeswoman JoAnn Martin as saying.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The derailment occurred at 9:37 a.m. as railroad workers were
uncoupling several cars on a track about two kilometers from
downtown Lynchburg,Virginia, Ms. Martin said. The cars rolled down
the track and hit other rail cars.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate estimate of the number of people forced
to leave their homes and businesses. About 200 youngsters from an
Elementary School were taken to another school while authorities
contacted their parents.
</P>
<P>
Acetone is a colorless, flammable liquid widely used to remove
paint, varnish and fingernail polish.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Martin estimated the loss to the storage building at
750,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Efforts to Integrate With Greece Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and northern Cyprus
reaffirmed here Tuesday that they would take all corresponding
measures to fight against Cyprus's endeavor to integrate indirectly
with Greece within the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a six-point joint declaration issued at the end of the
first meeting of the Turkish-northern Cypriot Association Council,
the two parties harshly criticized the EU for launching the
accession process with Cyprus, dubbing it as "historical mistake."
</P>
<P>
"The membership talks between the EU and Greek Cyprus is a
flagrant breach of international law...by overlooking the
principle of two peoples with equal legal and political status on
which the independence of the island is based, the EU has opened
the way for Greek Cyprus' integration with Greece and will bear
the heavy responsibility of the partition of Cyprus," the
declaration read.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that the EU's decision to take in Cyprus had
completely changed the nature of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In order to deepen the "special relationship" between Turkey
and northern Cyprus, the council also said in the declaration that
Turkey and northern Cyprus will continue joint efforts to lift
all the barriers blocking northern Cyprus' integration with the
international community in any realm.
</P>
<P>
A common economic area will be established on the basis of the
harmonization of customs regulations, free circulation of goods,
services and capital, transfer of technology and investments
flow, said the council.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the council, which started here on Monday, was
presided over by northern Cyprus "Foreign Minister" Taner Etkin
and Turkish State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Etkin said "if we are left with no
other alternative, we will not hesitate to integrate with Turkey
to preserve our presence on the island."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops intervened and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are reportedly stationed in
the northern part of the divided island to protect the security
of the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The EU started the accession talks with Cyprus on Monday. A
proposal by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides for the
participation of Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus' negotiating team was
turned down by the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> UK to Withdraw Air Power Over Bosnia Early in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Tuesday that Britain plans to withdraw its
contingent of air power based in eastern Italy on April 6 due to
the improving situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The entire British contingent of air power designed to be used
primarily over Bosnia consists of six Jaguar fighter-bombers and a
supporting tanker.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 230 UK air force personnel will also be
returning to Britain or moving to units elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in the House of Commons, Robertson said,
"This results from our assessment that it is no longer necessary
to have the Jaguars based in Italy on a full-time basis given the
improving situation in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
"The Jaguars will, however, remain on short notice to resume
participation in operations over Bosnia if required," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, it was reported that some 5,200 British military
personnel are still in Bosnia as part of NATO's peacekeeping
Stabilization Force.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 79 Mln Dlrs for Humanitarian Aid to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Tuesday
launched the 1998 consolidated inter-agency appeal for Somalia,
requesting 79 million U.S. dollars to ensure the continuation of
urgently needed humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance this
year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the United Nations agencies operating
in Somalia have developed a common assistance strategy, in close
conjunction with non-governmental organizations and donor
governments.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is based on the principle of joint programming and
greater coordinations of efforts of area-based planning and
implementation. United Nations agencies will continue to target
much of their assistance towards vulnerable groups, including
women and children, returnee refugees, internally displaced
persons, and the poorest segments of Somali society.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a national government and institutions, the
United Nations agencies have been required to play an even greater
role in Somalia to ensure that potentially manageable emergencies
do not develop into major humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire Somali population lacks access to education
and basic health services. After seven years of internal conflict,
most public infrastructure has been destroyed. Repeated outbreaks
of cholera, malaria, and one of the world's highest incidences of
tuberculosis have drastically lowered life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The deleterious impact of the recent floods in Somalia which
displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, devastated arable
lands, and adversely affected up to 1 million people, will
continue to be felt well into the year.
</P>
<P>
The international community is requested to respond generously
to the appeal, to relieve the protracted suffering of the Somali
people and to provide a basis for the longer-term rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the country.
