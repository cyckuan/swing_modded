<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A flag carrier of
French naval forces arrived at Dar es Salaam port Monday for a
three-day goodwill visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the ship "Le Var", Rear Admiral Patrice
Puy-Montbrun, said that the visit aims to develop links with
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We have a tradition to come by sea," Puy-Montbrun told a press
 conference on the 157-meter-long, 21-meter-wide ship, which has a
 displacement of 18,000 tons and a draught of 8.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Puy-Montbrun, who is also Commander of French Fleet in the
Indian Ocean, said that the ship sailed into Tanzanian water in
the morning amid light rains.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the vessel had visited Durban port of South Africa and
the Mozambican capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The commander revealed that the French naval forces regularly
have over 10 ships in the Indian Ocean, adding that more ships
will be deployed if there is an emergency.
</P>
<P>
After the visit, the ship will head for Arabian countries for
other visits, he said.

CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Foreign investments in Morocco increased by 132
percent in the first half of 1999 as compared to the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign investments amounted to 4.1 billion dirhams
(about 420 million U.S. dollars) by the end of last June, the best
indicator since 1997 when foreign investments exceeded 1.2 billion
dirhams.
</P>
<P>
France ranked first on the list of investors in Morocco with
total investments amounting to 1.52 billion dirhams (about 160
million dollar). The United States was the second, followed by
Spain, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Ministry of Industry and Electricity has
allocated several plots of land to industrial investors in Riyadh,
Jeddah, Mecca, Al Qassim, Madina, Asseer and Ha'il.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quotes the minister, Hashim
Abdulla Yamani, as saying that the total area allocated to each
industrial project amounted to about 4,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Chemical and plastic industries claimed the highest percentage
of projects that benefit from land distribution, namely, 42
percent, followed by mineral industries, 16 percent, engineering
and food industries, 14 percent and 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman is planing to set up permanent display
centers for its products in some of the key export markets such as
Yemen, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Netherlands and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first of them will be opened soon in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, a spokesman for the Oman Center for Investment
Promotion and Export Development was quoted by the UAE's Khaleej
Times daily as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As Rotterdam is the gateway to Europe and other markets,
displaying their products at the Oman Business Center will help
Omani companies gain access to the huge market," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> German, Spanish Aerospace Concerns Prepare to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua)-The Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace
(DASA), the aerospace and defense unit of the German-U.S.
automotive giant Daimler-Chrysler, will merge with the Spanish
aerospace concern CASA in the next month, a high-ranking German
aerospace official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two partners are now close to the last stage of the fusion,
said Rolf Stuessel, deputy chairman of German Aviation and
Aerospace Association, at an aerospace congress in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
According to Stuessel and officials of DASA, the new
German-U.S.-Spanish aerospace concern will be named DASACASA,
which will be the third largest aerospace company with an annual
turnover of about 20 billion marks (11 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fusion is mainly aimed to strengthen German and Spanish
sides' weight while negotiating with their French and British
partners to transform the European Airbus consortium into a modern
joint-stock enterprise, Stuessel said.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, DASACASA will become the No.1 stockholder of
the Airbus with 42.1 per cent of the share. The Airbus, together
controlled by the DASA, the CASA, the US-British GEC/British
Aerospace and the French Aerospatiale Matra, is the world's second
largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan, first disclosed in this June, grew out of
DASA's failure to overtake British Aerospace last spring.
Disappointed by British Aerospace's quick tie-up with the U.S.
General Electric (GEC), DASA began the talks with CASA.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the partners in the Airbus consortium have not yet
brought out a detailed plan of structural alteration, Stuessel
said, "the will of the industry is just like before, but the steps
must also be supported by the politics."
</P>
<P>
The major problem lies in French government's much involvement
in Aerospatiale Matra and its opposition to the idea of
modernization, thus the Airbus remains a consortium, Stuessel
said.
</P>
<P>
The other three governments of the Airbus partners have
complained that the industrial side had found no concept on the
new structure of the Airbus, he added.

TUNIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian Prime Minister Hamed
Karoui held a meeting here Monday evening with visiting Secretary
General of the Libyan General People's Committee (prime minister)
Mohamed Ahmed Al-Mangoush.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mangoush arrived in the Tunisian capital Monday to head his

<HEADLINE> French PM Announces Measures to Protect Right of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin announced on Monday some measures to protect the right of
employment, including punishment for those who employ too many
workers on short-term contracts and lay off employees in an
abusive way.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the parliament deputies of the Socialist Party
in Strasbourg, Jospin said that the government will present a law
to punish financially the enterprises which employ short-term
contract workers in an excessive way.
</P>
<P>
He said that public aid will not go to those enterprises which
are laying off workers while making profits.
</P>
<P>
``It is inacceptable that an enterprises announce substantial
benefits and at the same time ask the government to pay for a part
of its restructuring leading to many layoffs,'' said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists were earlier embarrassed by the lack of
intervention from the prime minister after the Michelin tire group
announced earlier this month that it would lay off 7,500 workers
while its profits have risen 20 percent in the early half this
year.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was apparently trying to reaffirm the stand of the
leftwing government on employment, after being sharply criticized
by his major ally in the leftwing majority, the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the government will increase charges on those
enterprises which lay off workers, while decreasing charges on
those keeping employees and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
``We want to install a link between the rise of contributions
to the charge of enterprises and their behavior in the field of
economic layoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the government will also provide life long job
trainings to workers to help them keep or find jobs.

QUITO, September 27 (Xinhua)-- Ecuador's government assumed

Authorities from the Bank Committee said they'd deepen
investigations regarding the bank's financial situation, which
will keep on going.

<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) - European stock markets closed
firmly higher Monday, boosted by speculation over the strength of
the banking sector and Wall Street's opening rebound after last
week's falls.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the heavily weighted banks sector here continued to
surge ahead, dragging the wider market higher in the wake of last
Friday's hostile offer for NatWest from Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed at 6078.6, up 141 points, or 2.37
percent.
</P>
<P>
National Westminster Bank continued to dominate the market,
adding 9 percent to Friday's more than a third gain following an
unsolicited takeover offer by Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The boost came as expectations of a counter-bid, notably from
Royal Bank of Scotland, gained favor among investors.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt ended the session up 53.11 points
from Friday's close at 5239.64 after moving in a range of 5201.58
to 5247.63 during the day.

<P>
Veba stock rose 6 percent and Viag shares tumbled 14 percent
when the boards of the two German utilities confirmed their plans
to merge in a 14 billion US dollars deal.

In Paris share prices closed higher in relatively thin volume
as merger speculation lifted several shares in an otherwise
lackluster session.

<HEADLINE> EU, Mexico to Hold Talks on Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Mexico have decided to start on October 7 their eighth round of
talks on a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a latest report that this round is considered as
"decisive" by all negotiators. The last round of negotiations in
July did not turn out to be very successful, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 9-day talks will conclude on pending issues, such as
industrial products, agricultural products, public procurement,
services and investment.
</P>
<P>
On industrial products, the EU said Mexicans are very reluctant
to open further their market to products from EU member countries.
In this case, the EU offer "is not that interesting to them since
they already benefit from the Generalized System of Trade
Preferences".
</P>
<P>
The EU's objective is clearly equivalence with the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), "a target which Mexican
industry thinks is a bit much to swallow at once", the EU report
said.
</P>
<P>
EU negotiators fear that North American products might only get
a Mexican rubberstamp before being reexported to the EU,
encouraging trade deflation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of traded products have already been agreed on,
but some sensitive products such as textiles, motor vehicles and
agricultural products still need some discussion, it said.
</P>
<P>
The EU report also said the European Commission, the EU
executive body, has introduced a "conceptual breakthrough" in
making up its offer on services. Instead of offering a list of the
services it wants to liberalize, they came up with a "negative
list", outlining exemptions to liberalization, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This rather new approach is to be used in other trade
negotiations, but EU member states have had difficulties with it,
since they were afraid of "forgetting" something to be put on the
list, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans and Europeans are to discuss these reciprocal negative
lists at their next round of negotiations, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Program on Title Deeds to Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Commission of Lands
has embarked on a program to educate people in both the rural and
urban areas of the country on the importance of having title deeds
to their lands.
</P>
<P>
Chief Registrar of Lands and Deeds Abdul Khan said here Monday
that about 90 percent of Zambians owning land have no title deeds
as most of the country's land is held under customary tenure.
</P>
<P>
The state has only eight percent of the country's land, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Khan said Zambia is an agricultural country so it is important
that people have titles to their lands as this will enable them to
acquire loans for land development and also to prevent ownership
wrangles in the future.
</P>
<P>
The commission has great respect for customary right but it is
retrogressive to possess land without title especially when there
are so many investors in the agriculture sector in search of land,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 75 million hectares of land in the country, 43
million hectares, or 56 percent, is available for agriculture, he
said, adding at present less than 10 percent of the 43 million
hectares has been utilized.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Paints Mixed Picture of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Monday issued a report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the
progress in curbing conflict and promoting peace in Africa,
painting a mixed picture of what is like on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Africa today, on the eve of the new millennium, reveals a
remarkable combination of accomplishments and unresolved problems,
of opportunities seized and chances missed," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The birth of so many new states in Africa this century, with
all the attendant euphoria and high expectations, has been quickly
followed by disillusionment and disappointment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are places in Africa where governments persist in
spending money on weapons they can ill afford for wars they should
not fight; where conflicts are seen as business opportunities for
arms merchants and rebel groups alike; where poor governance
deprives people of basic needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is place in Africa "where silence about AIDS exacerbates
the epidemic; where corruption thwarts economic growth; and where
crushing debt burdens, trade barriers and declining aid make it
extremely hard for African nations to attract investment and stave
off further marginalization from the global economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are, in short, places where the widely held view of
Africa as a region in perpetual crisis is not just an image but an
all-too-grim and painful reality," he said. "Civil war prevents
many sick, hungry civilians from receiving international
humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Annan presented a report to both the
Security Council and the General Assembly, shedding light on the
causes of conflict in Africa and the promotion of durable peace
and sustainable development on the continent, where the least
developed countries outnumber the other parts in the world.
</P>
<P>
The report attracted wide interest and attention and has been
discussed and analyzed in various forums, within and outside the
United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a very encouraging response to the report from
governments, research and academic institutions, civil society
groups, non-governmental organizations and individuals, many of
whom have used the debate surrounding the report as an opportunity
to contribute to the search for peace and development in Africa,"
Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Parties Launch Electoral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A former Mozambican rebel
movement and 10 minor opposition political parties Monday signed a
document to formally launch a union for contesting the forthcoming
presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The document, necessary for registering the Electoral Union
with the National Elections Commission (CNE), recognizes Afonso
Dhlakama, leader of the rebel movement Renamo (Resistencia
Nacional de Mozambique), as the president of the union and Renamo
General Secretary Joao Alexandre as the secretary.
</P>
<P>
The minor parties which have tied their fortunes to Renamo are
Mozambique United Front (MUF); National Convention Party (PCN);
Mozambican People's Progress Party (PPPM); Democratic Renewal
Party (PRD); Mozambique National Union (UNAMO); Mozambican
National Movement (MONAMO); Patriotic Action Front (FAP);
Independent Alliance of Mozambique (ALIMO); National Unity Party
(PUN); and United Democratic Front (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Union has adopted Renamo's colours and flag, with
Dhlakama as its presidential candidate. It is believed that in
exchange Renamo has offered the minor parties seats on its
parliamentary lists in winnable positions, though this was not
specifically spelt out at Monday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
PRD leader Manecas Daniel becomes deputy president of the
coalition, and Maximo Dias, general secretary of MONAMO, is
chairman of the Electoral Union's General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Dias said that the
Electoral Union arises from the need to defeat the 24 years of
"political hegemony" imposed by the ruling Frelimo (Frente de
libertacao de Mocambique) party.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to put an end to this hegemony," he said,
adding that each party has sacrificed its individual political
interests with the aim of better serving the country.
</P>
<P>
The people are tired of Frelimo and it is time for it to
slacken its grip on power, Dhlakama said.

Colombia is facing its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Colombia central bank sold more than 400 million dollars from
its international reserves in a bid to defend the peso from
speculative attack, and reserves were set to fall below the
psychological support level of 8 billion dollars. The peso had
devaluated twice in less than a year, which had undermined the
currency regime's credibility, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the peso closed at an all-time low of 1,994.29 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the peso could first fall to as much as 2,100 or
2,300 per dollar, but expected it to recover after a period.

<HEADLINE> UK Develops Electronic Nose to Smell Out Infections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Britain have
created an electronic nose which could dramatically cut diagnosis
time for infections by sniffing urine.
</P>
<P>
The device, called Diag-Nose and developed by Dr Selly Saini
and Dr Jan Leiferkus at Cranfield University, England, can also
identify the particular bacterium causing the infection, making
rapid treatment possible, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Urinary tract infections, such as thrush, are among the most
common adult infections needing medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Compared with currest diagnostic tests which are done in
laboratories and take up to 48 hours, the Diag-Nose can deliver
its diagnosis in a few hours and sit in a family doctor's
surgery.
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis begins with a small sample of urine being mixed
with a specially-developed growth fluid, which encourages the
micro-organisms to multiply and produce the tell-tale smells which
gives away their presence.
</P>
<P>
A syringe is then used to push a sample of the gas into the
electronic nose which identifies the particular aromas.
</P>
<P>
Initial trials of Diag-Nose have identified over 80 percent of
urinary tract infections. The researchers are planning clinical
trials to make a full evaluation of the device.

JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- South African
politicians expressed shock at the death oeremy Cronin, chairman of the National
 Assembly's transport
portfolio committee, said he was deeply shocked by the incident,
which came so soon after four other serious bus crashes.
</P>
<P>
He extended the committee's condolences to the families of the
26 victims, and to the12 other tourists who were injured.
</P>
<P>
Cronin said the accident highlighted the need for the
high-level summit on road safety proposed by Transport Minister
Dullah Omar.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly underlines the need to look firstly at enforcing
safety regulations, and also increasing capacity to enforce those
regulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is a great dearth of traffic officials on the road, for

vice versa. Whatever the case is, the country has to find the will
to resource the measures that are needed for greater safety and
enforcement, Cronin said.

Democratic Party transport spokesman Paul Swart said he was
shocked at the accident, and offered his personal and the DP's

Available information indicated it was "just an accident", but
the cumulative effect of this type of incident on the country's

"We don't want our roads also to be questioned as another
unsafe part of our country for tourists," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- South African Transport
Ministry Monday said it was devastated at the news of another bus
accident, which claimed the lives of 26 elderly British tourists.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the 38 passengers died at the scene when their
bus overturned on the Long Tom Pass between Lydenburg and Sabie in
Mpumalanga, about 300 kilometers east of Johannesburg at 12.20
p.m., police spokesman Gerrit Smit said.
</P>
<P>
He said that another three died shortly after they arrived at
Lydenburg hospital, with the rest 12 still in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the scene of the accident, Smit said police were
at 3 p.m. still carrying away the bodies of the dead and gathering
up the tourists' luggage which was strewn all over the hillside.
</P>
<P>
The bus driver, who was not injured in the crash, told police
the brakes failed as he was driving down the pass and the bus
ended up lying on its side about 10 meters from the road, with its
top ripped off.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Dullah Omar was shocked by the news and
immediately arranged a meeting with the country's bus operators
scheduled for Thursday, his spokesman Mike Mabasa said.

<P>
"The minister wants to see what precisely needs to be done to
bring down the high rate of accidents," Mabasa said.
</P>

Press Association that the commission had yet to receive official
confirmation of the accident from the police, adding that the
consular staff in Pretoria were making enquiries.
</P>
<P>
Monday's crash was the fifth bus accident in a week, taking the
total death toll to 58 and more than 160 injured.
</P>
<P>
Hours before Monday's crash a bus driver appeared in the
Kokstad Magistrate's Court to face culpable homicide charges after
his bus crashed into a tree in mist at midnight on Friday, killing
14 people and injuring 30.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, six people died when two buses carrying

<HEADLINE> Investment Levels Down In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Investment Center
(ZIC) Monday said it approved 65 projects worth more than 9.8
billion Zimbabwean dollars (257 million U.S. dollars) during the
first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Ncube, executive director of the ZIC, said that
although  the investment levels this year were lower than that of
last year, they were set to improve in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The commercial sector accounted for the largest slice of
approvals within the sectors at 5.1 billion Zimbabwean dollars
(134 million U.S. dollars) while mining was second at 1.8 billion
Zimbabwean dollars (47.3 million U.S. dollars) and the tourism
sector was third at 1.4 billion Zimbabwean dollars (36.8 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total projects, the highest amount of five billion
Zimbabwean dollars (131.5 million U.S. dollars) was raised by
Britain and 2.7 billion Zimbabwean dollars (71 million U.S.
dollars) by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ncube noted that his country was still failing to get direct
foreign investment because of the size of its market while
established markets in Nigeria and South Africa were capitalizing.
</P>
<P>
It did not mean that the country was not being effectively
marketed abroad, but that some things had to be put into
perspective first, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ncube said: "There are legal frameworks being worked out that
are meant to liberalize the communication sector and the
privatization process which will encourage more investment into
the country."
</P>
<P>
Last year ZIC approved more than 300 projects worth 60 billion
 Zimbabwean dollars (1.57 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment in Africa Down: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) in Africa declined to about 8.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1998
from about 9.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a senior United
Nations official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the newly released "World Investment Report 1999", Ali
Gadir Ali , economic and social policy division chief of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said FDI flow
to developing countries decreased from about 174 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 to about 166 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
None of the top 100 multinational corporations in the world is
from Africa, he said, adding that out of the 50 top multinational
corporations in the developing countries, only three are in Africa
-- in South Africa precisely.
</P>
<P>
Referring to FDI development in other parts of the world, Ali
said Asia also recorded a decline from 95.5 billion U.S. dollars
in 1997 to 84.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that China is an exception, adding that FDI
in China was constantly growing from 25.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1993 to 45.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ali attributed the steady increase of foreign investment in
China mainly to its government's economic reform. What is more
important, he said, China has become an expanding and major market
for transnational corporations.
</P>
<P>
"I think the wake of China in the world economy will qualify
her to receive more FDI as we go," Ali said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Ruling to Compensate Torture Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Monday
ruled that the Ministry of Interior compensate two alleged Muslim
Brotherhood members for tortures by police during the late
President Gamal Abdel Nasser's rule.
</P>
<P>
Under the unprecedented ruling, the ministry should give 30,000
Egyptian pounds (8,800 U.S. dollars) each to Mohammed Abdel Adhim
and Hassan Mohammed in compensation for physical and mental
tortures they claimed to have suffered when they were jailed in
1954-56, court officials said. Both men are now in their late
seventies.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time an Egyptian court has ordered such
redress for victims of torture who were political detainees during
Nasser's rule.
</P>
<P>
The court stated that its ruling was based on an international
agreement signed by Egypt in 1986 on the prevention of torture. It
said there is no time limit for defendants to seek redress in
torture cases.
</P>
<P>
Nasser banned the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamic
movement, after an alleged assassination attempt on him in
Alexandria in 1954. Thousands of group members were detained
without trial and many of its leaders were executed.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if the Interior Ministry will appeal the ruling
and ministry officials could not be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 150 business executives
and government officials from the United States and the European
Union (EU) will hold "a brainstorming meeting" in Berlin to set
final stance on the agenda for the new round of talks within the
World Trade Organization, EU said in a newly published report.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen will meet at the fifth annual conference of the
Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) to push for the new WTO
round to include a new Information Technology Agreement (ITA II),
an agreement on a permanent standstill on customs duties for
electronic transactions, and WTO support for a business-led
framework for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
To be held exactly one month before the opening of the WTO's
key ministerial meeting in Seattle in which a new round of global
trade talks is due to be launched on November 30, the Berlin
meeting also aim for an agreement on accelerated tariff
liberalization (ATL), where possible, in agreed on sectors,
including ITA II, can be settled earlier than more complex
negotiations, the EU report said.
</P>
<P>
Other TABD priorities include an agreement on transparency in
government procurement, a standstill on tariffs on E-commerce, and
improved market access for the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"The TABD wish-list backs the as-yet unshaped plans to
strengthen global investment rules through the WTO, as well as
continue to examine the interface between trade and environment
and trade and competition," the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the Berlin meeting, the business leaders and government
officials from Europe and the United States will call for a
strengthened dispute settlement mechanism, as well as
clarification of some of the WTO's ambiguous dispute settlement
articles, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) The Financial Services Authority
(the FSA) Monday publishes a Policy Statement about the use of its
powers to give guidance and waivers to financial firms under the
new Financial Services and Markets Bill.
</P>
<P>
The FSA aims to develop and sustain an open and responsive
two-way relationship with regulated firms and its approach to
guidance and waivers is being developed within this context.
</P>
<P>
The overall approach is to be responsive, helpful and
forthcoming while providing firms with the means to stand on their
own feet when working out how to meet regulatory standards and
requirements, according to the FSA.
</P>
<P>
The statement makes the following points on the three principal
areas covered -General Guidance, Individual Guidance and Waivers.
</P>
<P>
General guidance will be used to explain regulatory processes
and arrangements and to clarify the application of the new
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Individual Guidance is the one given to a particular firm or
person in relation to their own circumstances or plans.
</P>
<P>
And Waivers are dispensations which can be given to individual
firms in special circumstances. The effect of a waiver is to
change or disapply a rule applicable to the firm concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Services and Markets Bill received its Second
Reading in the House of Commons on 28 June and is expected to
become law during the first half of 2000.

into a modern society based on technology and science."

<HEADLINE> GA President Urges Solidarity in Addressing Small  Islands' Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the
United Nations General Assembly Theo-Ben Gurirab on Monday called
for unity and solidarity of the international community to address
the problems facing the small islands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the special session of the General Assembly on small
islands, Gurirab said this is the last special session of the
General Assembly before the next millennium, and the small islands
states, the international community and future generations expect
from it a successful outcome from this timely and important
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said the small island developing states had made
remarkable efforts to tackle their special ecological and economic
vulnerabilities and to put in place policies and measures to
implement the Program of Action adopted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Many small island states today are facing the continued
deterioration of the marine environment and have to contend with
over-fishing, marine spills, dumping of ship-borne wastes in their
neighbourhoods, transport of nuclear and other toxic materials
through their territorial waters and watershed destabilization, "
the President said.
</P>
<P>
"A common hurdle faced by most small island developing nations
is the insufficiency of funds relative to the enormity of the
challenges at hand. External support has not been forthcoming on
the scale promised," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us reinvigorate the spirit of unity and solidarity, and
adhere with a purpose to the global partnership. If we join
forces, we can, must and will help open up new vistas for
development, prosperity and progress for the small island
developing states," the President added.

<HEADLINE> Remains of U.S. World War II Pilots Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A US expert team left Guilin
for home today with the remains of American airmen from a B-24
bomber which crashed into a mountain in southern China during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
So far, after three years of joint exploration, the remains of
all ten airmen who died when their B-24 crashed during a return
flight to Guangxi after a bombing mission against Japanese ships
near Taiwan on Aug. 31, 1944, have been repatriated to their
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the bomber was first found in October 1996 by
two local peasants, and the finding aroused immediate attention
from the two governments.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin informed President Bill Clinton about the
discovery at the APEC leadership meeting in November 1996, and
presented him with the five identification cards found and a video
tape about the site of the crash.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Defense Minister Chi Haotian visited the US
and handed over part of the discovery to his US counterpart
William Perry.
</P>
<P>
The joint research work formally started in January 1997, and
altogether four research actions were carried out before the
complete handover.
</P>
<P>
The rough terrain of the Mao'er mountain where the bomber
crashed made this a tough task. In the first search in 1997, a
female journalist from the Voice of America slipped over a cliff,
and it took a rescue team of more than ten Chinese over four hours
to finally rescue her.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, more than 1,000 Chinese people were
involved during these operations over three years, and lasted
until it was called a complete success by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou: Athens Will Start Dialogue With Turkey on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Monday that Greece would be prepared to start
dialogue with neighboring Turkey on the remaining "high-impact"
issues if the two countries could sign cooperation agreements on
the "low-impact" issues such as tourism, trade and culture.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Athens daily "Ta Nea", Papandreou said
that the recent improvement of the climate in Greek-Turkish
relations could not have negative efforts on the Cyprus issue,
while the expansion of the "low-impact" Greek-Turkish dialogue to
other secondary issues in no way meant that Greece had shelved the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cyprus government also regarded the recent
Greek-Turkish rapprochement as particularly positive.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the present conjuncture was unique for
enabling progress in the Cyprus problem and the U.S. would move
actively in that direction.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU),
Papandreou said that Turkey's future EU membership would be in
Greece's long-term interests, but Greece's position at December's
EU summit hinged on Turkey's attitude on Greek-Turkish affairs and
the Cyprus issue and on the Guarantees Greece would secure from
the EU on its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have
been strained for decades over their disputes in the territorial
waters, air space limits, the delimitation of the continental
shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the two neighbors, which have nearly gone to
war three times in the past 25 years, have been trying hard to
improve their relations with the start of low-level talks between
senior Greek- Turkish foreign ministry officials, but they have
not touched the sensitive issues such as territorial disputes and
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes in Turkey and Greece also provided an
opportunity for both sides to show their willingness to better
bilateral time. Rescue crews from Greece and Turkey have fought
side-by-side in pulling earthquake survivors out of the rubble of
the collapsed buildings in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The progress made in the talks and the good feeling generated
by mutual help over the earthquake tragedies are hoped to pave the
way for both sides to eventually better their bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Expand State-run TV and Radio Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia plans to expand
the coverage of state-run television and radio in the whole
country to reduce the damage of Khmer culture by the foreign
programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Information Lu Laysreng, the
government would spend about one million U.S. dollars over the
next year to ensure that all areas get Cambodian broadcasting.
Only 28 percent of the country can get Cambodian broadcasting at
present.
</P>
<P>
Foreign televisions now cover the whole country, the minister
said, "the government wants rural people to get their programs
through our broadcasting."
</P>
<P>
The people in northern and western Cambodia get television and
radio broadcasts from Thailand while the people in central and
eastern areas pick up Vietnamese channels.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cable televisions and satellite televisions make
foreign TV and radio programs easy available since cable and
satellite dishes are inexpensive these days.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has six television stations, but even the
state-run TVK can not cover the whole country without tapes being
sent to the provincial broadcasting stations.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has struggled to rebuild its culture and tradition
from the devastation of the decades of civil war. Earlier this
year, the minister issued a 13-point order, urging the television
and radio stations to "use dignified language and avoid foreign
words" and to play Cambodian-made programs.
</P>
<P>
Pornographic and violent films are banned in Cambodia, any
program that encourages children to smoke or drink alcohol is also
banned.

<HEADLINE> 3.2 Million Angolans Badly Need Emergent Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Angolan official
announced here on Monday that in his country, the number of the
people in dire need of emergent assistance is about 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there exist over two million displaced people
living in abject poverty due to the endless civil war.
</P>
<P>
Albino Malungo, minister of Assistance and Social
Reintegration, told the press that the deteriorating situation in
the provinces all over his country, especially in Malanje, Huambo,
Bie, Cuando Cubango, Moxico, Lunda- norte, Lunda-sul and Luanda,
requires emergent assistance or a humanitarian intervention.
</P>
<P>
Every day, dozens of families in "extremely difficult
situation" arrive in the capital city of Luanda. And at this
moment, there are more than 500, 000 displaced people without
assistance in the city with a total population of three million,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Malungo also announced an increase of the amount of the flights
with humanitarian aid for the interior part of the country, adding
that the government is making efforts to help the poor residents
in the interior Angola and the Province of Bie.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that the trucks circulating between Benguela and
Bie are exposed to attacks by the "armed band" of Jonas Savimbi,
referring to the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), but assured that "everything is ready" for giving
Bie the maximum assistance.
</P>
<P>
With the help of international humanitarian organizations, the
Angolan government will succeed in providing the residents in the
Bie Province with seeds and farming utensils, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) and a guerrilla of the anti-Israeli
military group Hezbollah were killed in south Lebanon on Monday,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi Saghir, chief of SLA's outpost at Beit Yahoun, where is a
crossing point in the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon, was killed when his car was blown up by a bomb on the
village's road.
</P>
<P>
Three other SLA militiamen and a school teacher were also
injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, adding one of its fighters was
killed Monday in fire exchange with Israeli forces inside the
border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed a number of villages and wadies in
and around the zone to revenge the casualty its SLA ally had
suffered in the day.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatality raised to 17 the number of SLA members
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 13
Israeli soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops and SLA out of
the country.

LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan women runner Tegla
Loroup, who won the Berlin marathon race with the world best time

<P>
"They just don't care about women. They only added me to the
World Championship's team two weeks before Seville, and that was
only because Nike paid my fare. That made only six Kenyan women
altogether in Seville," said Loroupe, who has confirmed to take
part in the London marathon on April 16 next year.
</P>
<P>
"I would like them to tell me now that I'm selected for Sydney,
so that I can prepare properly," she added in a press release.

Loroupe clocked two hours 20 minutes 43 seconds in Berlin to
better her own world mark set in Rotterdam last year by four

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier: China Values Foreign Experts' Efforts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua)-- China values the contributions
made by foreign experts to China's construction in all spheres,
said Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
made the remark today at the National Day reception in honor of
foreign experts and hosted by the State Bureau of Foreign Experts
Affairs at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China
and Premier Zhu Rongji, Li expressed his warm welcome and extended
his sincere regards to all the foreign experts, overseas Chinese
experts, and international friends participating in, concerning
with and rendering support to the Chinese revolution and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that among the foreign experts present, some are old
friends and old comrades who came to China prior to or in the
early period of the founding of New China, adding that the
majority are new friends who came to China to help Chinese people
with their work after the policy of reform and opening to the
outside world was introduced.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past 50 years, over 800,000 foreign
experts have come to China to work. "All of you are witnesses to
the brilliant history of New China. You have worked
conscientiously and with a high sense of duty," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the achievements made by China in all spheres
of endeavor also include the fruits of the foreign experts'
diligent work.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the foreign experts on
behalf of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, I hope that you will continue to cooperate closely
with your Chinese colleagues, work conscientiously, and make even
greater achievements," said the vice premier.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Meets Leaders of International Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin met
here today with scores of foreign businesspeople who are attending
the '99 Fortune Global Forum which began today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the event will have a positive impact on the
development of China and the world. He said that well-known
business leaders coming from across the world to join economists
and leaders of relevant Chinese departments for discussing the
development of China and its influence on world economy provides
an opportunity for cooperation at the time of the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 businesspeople, including those from nearly 60 of
the Fortune magazine top 500, are attending the forum, which will
last through September 29.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that over the past 50 years,
especially the past 20 years, China has scored major achievements
in its modernization drive. History has proved that the socialist
road charted by Deng Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the development road suitable for China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China will carry out more reforms and opening
wider to the outside world. He urged Chinese firms to test their
ability and get to know the international market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China welcomes more overseas investment
and hopes that overseas entrepreneurs will actively participate in
competition on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The businesspeople extended their warm congratulations on the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
and expressed their deep appreciation for the achievements China
has made since the beginning of reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
They also displayed great enthusiasm for further cooperation
with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
About 50 chairmen of the board and CEOs of such big names as GM,
Ford, GE, Volkswagen, National, Fiat, AT&AMP;T, and Sinochem were
among those participating in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> UK's Mowlam Says N.Irish Peace Process Still Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 27 (Xinhua) -- British
Secretary for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam said on Monday that the
peace process in the province is still working.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Labour Party's annual conference, Mowlam said
"the process is succeeding, but there is still a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
She admitted that none of the democratic bodies set out in the
Good Friday Agreement are working properly, as "there's no
executive, no Ministers, no North/South Council, no Council of the
Isles."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she added, none of the major paramilitary
organizations has been dismantled, nor has the process of
decommissioning begun in any meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that attitudes are changing, the two sides
simply do not trust each other enough," she said. "There is a
gulf of distrust between them that neither side will deliver
because they can't believe the other will respond."
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish Governments have tried and were very
close to success, but they "can't make it happen," she said. "The
will has to be there on the part of the political leaders
themselves if this is going to work."
</P>
<P>
George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who chaired the peace
process last year, is holding a formal review of the Agreement,
but he "hasn't got a magic wand," she said, adding that "change is
difficult for people."

Chatumongkul hoped to form a management layer comprising the
governor, deputy governors and assistant governors, with 25 units
operating directly and indirectly in a non-hierarchical structure.
</P>
<P>
The new structure divides the central bank's tasks into five
areas, including monetary policy, financial institution
supervision, administration, financial institution rehabilitation
and planning.

ADDIS ABABA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will open its
telecommunications sector to private firms in hope to speed up the
industry' s development, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Girma Birru, minister of Economic Development and Cooperation,
said at a meeting of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation
(ETC) that the government has decided to work with potential
entrepreneurs having a small share to boost the communications
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Working in partnership with enterprises known for their
managerial expertise, technology and capital can improve the
quality and services of this sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers noticed that Ethiopia made the announcement when the
state- owned telecommunications corporation was reportedly facing
financial problems and being criticized for its low efficiency and
poor management.
</P>
<P>
It was reported in late August that of all 13,000 mobile phone
subscribers in Ethiopia, 6,000 had cancelled their subscriptions
in ETC due to high tariff and high down payments of the cellphone
service.
</P>
<P>
Cellphone service is only available in Addis Ababa, the capital
of Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Study: Climate Change to Impact U.S. Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is likely
to impact both the availability and quality of the U.S. water
supply, according to a new study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, sponsored by the Pew Center, an environmental
organization, finds that as climate change alters precipitation,
evapotranspiration and runoff in the United States, these changes
are likely to affect the magnitude, frequency and costs of extreme
weather events as well as the nation's water supply.
</P>
<P>
As one of consistent impacts identified by the study, higher
temperatures in mountainous watersheds will increase the ratio of
rain to snow, accelerate the rate of spring snowmelt and shorten
the overall snowfall season, leading to more rapid, earlier and
greater spring runoff.
</P>
<P>
In already arid regions, there is likely to be greater flux in
the water supply, while higher temperatures fuel an increased
demand for water. In other areas, new instances of flooding and
droughts also will impact the availability of water.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, while higher water flows could improve
water quality in some streams, the increased runoff of pollutants
and saltwater intrusion could accompany climate change induced
sea-level rise.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the most important step to take today is to reduce
the greenhouse gas omissions that cause climate change, the study
suggests opportunities to develop water marketing and trading
strategies and improve the management of water systems. Other
steps include expanding the existing infrastructure such as
reservoirs and dams.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes 6,000 U.N. Troops for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday recommended the establishment of a 6,000-strong
U.N. peacekeeping force to help implement a July accord aimed at
ending an eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL), Annan said that he hoped the force would be able
to incorporate a substantial number of troops from the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), whose own 12,000-member
Nigerian-led military observer group called ECOMOG is being phased
out after serving in Sierra Leone for two and half years.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has agreed
to his proposal to deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force which would
include some Nigerian and other troops in the proposed force for
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The July 7 agreement was signed in Lome, capital of Togo, by
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah and Corporal Foday Sankoh,
head of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Nigerian troops, who make up the bulk of
ECOMOG, began on August 31, but was suspended following a
meeting between the Nigerian and Sierra Leonean presidents,
Annans said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that, without security, it would not
be possible to carry out a program of disarming and demobilizing
some 45,000 ex-combatants, many of them children, and thus remove
a threat to the West African country's stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief also called for the immediate return
to Sierra Leone of Sankoh, to "assure important functions within
the government of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the commitment of Sankoh and his senior
associates, including Johnny Paul Koroma, leader of the Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council, to the Lome agreement was an
essential element in its effective implementation.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Condition Peace Talks with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAFE DE BOGOTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The National
Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second guerrilla force, Monday
suggested the government start a "politics of reciprocal gestures"
to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from Venezuelan capital city of Caracas to
Colombia's radio stations, Victor Orlando, one of ELN's leaders,
said Monday the guerrillas could free some of the 63 persons his
organization has kidnapped, if the government has a "gesture of
reciprocity".
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla leader said, it is not a question of prisoner
exchange, but rather "reciprocal gestures" between the government
and Colombia's guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to establish a buffer zone to carry
out meetings with civil society in honor of a national convention.
</P>
<P>
Orlando went to Venezuela where he met with delegates of
Colombia's civil society on September 16 and 23.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Referendum to Be Held in June Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coming referendum,
which will decide the country's future system of governance, will
be held during June 2-16 of 2000, Aziz Kasujia, chairman of the
Electoral Commission, announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This follows the dismissal by the Constitutional Court of the
petition by some MPs in opposition parties, Kasujia said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kasujia said that the exact date for referendum will be further
fixed, adding that the result will be respected regardless of the
turnout at the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Constitution, enacted in 1995, provides that a
referendum will be held in five years to decide the country's
political system by its people. The Referendum Act states that the
date of the coming vote should be between June 3 to July 2 of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Opposition headed by the Democratic Party has argued that
general elections, instead of a referendum, should be held next
year because at the referendum the ruling National Resistance
Movement (NRM) and other parties will not be competing on the same
footing.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has stated on several
occasions that the referendum is contained in the constitution and
therefore any opposition to the referendum should be regarded as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Though confronted with much resistance from multipartists, it
is widely believed that the referendum will be held in time and
the ruling NRM is expected to win.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Call on Congress to Pay U.N. Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Republican and
Democratic lawmakers came to the United Nations headquarters in
New York to demand the U.S. Congress pay the nation's some 1.7
billion U.S. dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous and embarrassing that the United States -- the
wealthiest country in the world -- is the biggest deadbeat at the
U.N.," said Rep. Nita Lowery, a Democrat from New York.
</P>
<P>
She was joined at a press conference by Chris Shays, a
Republican from Conn., and Eliot Engel, a Democrat from New York,
to draw attention to the debt and release a letter to the
congressional leadership demanding the dues be paid.
</P>
<P>
The letter, to House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Minority
leader Richard Gephardt, warned that U.S. foreign policy was being
undermined by the arrears.
</P>
<P>
The United States is again threatened this year with its vote
at the General Assembly if it doesn't pay an estimated 350 million
U.S. dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Congress has held up to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars for years,
demanding the United States streamline its organization and
institute a no-growth budget. Legislation that would have paid off
the bulk of the bills was vetoed last year by U.S. President Bill
Clinton because it contained unrelated restrictions on U.S.
spending for overseas family planning organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Those who insist on linking these two issues now hold U.N.
arrears funding hostages," Lowery said. "As this nonsense
continues, these opportunities squander the successes we have
gained through out participation in the U.N."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Proposes Popular Elections for Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said here Monday that free and fair elections could
contribute to the settlement of African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South African Development Community (SADC)
Electoral Commissions Forum in the Tanzanian capital, Mbeki said
many powerful persons in Africa "abused their power to gain undue
wealth and advantage for themselves, their relatives and friends
by illegal or immoral means".
</P>
<P>
These persons in power consider "the enhancement of
transparency, accountability and accessibility" as the enemies of
"good governance", said Mbeki, who arrived in Tanzania Sunday on a
two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past Ghana was a victim to a succession of
military coups, but "since Ghana returned to democratic rule there
has been no further recurrence of these coups".
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain that all of us would agree that any democratic
settlement in countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and Sudan, to
mention only some, would require that special constitutional and
political measures are introduced to ensure both majority rule and
the protection of national minorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we have to grapple correctly with the issues
of the ethnic, linguistic, religious and other diversity of our
societies".
</P>
<P>
"Regular elections must be held," he said. "Preferably, these
elections should be managed by independent electoral commissions."
</P>
<P>
"The regular exercise by the citizens to participate in free
and fair elections indeed constitutes one of the basic guarantees
of regional peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual forum, the first of its kind, brings together
representatives of electoral offices or commissions from 14 SADC
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day forum, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
said people in southern African can and must work together to
create an even large and more prosperous home through free, fair,
transparent and periodic elections.
</P>
<P>
The forum was set up in Cape Town, South Africa, on July 27,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his visit to Tanzania Monday, Mbeki told
reporters that he had discussed with Mkapa on how to strengthen
economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Tanzania by Mbeki who came to power
last June.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Provide Maintenance Documents Via Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company began
a pilot program Monday to provide direct access to airplane
maintenance documents over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
Access to these documents will require only a personal
computer, standard Internet connection, web browser and Boeing
password account, the company said. Customers no longer will need
lengthy user training, special software or costly equipment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Boeing was the first airplane maker to provide online
access to digitized maintenance information from a central
database. That service, known today as Boeing On-Line Delivery
(BOLD), is based on an older software standard called "X-Windows."
It required customers to be trained on the use of custom search
and retrieval software and to purchase specialized computing
software and network connections.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of web browser technology and newer
software standards, Boeing has now repackaged BOLD for use on the
web. The company's ultimate goal is for its customers to obtain
all the information they need to operate and maintain their Boeing
fleets through a single network connection.
</P>
<P>
Initially, web access is limited to the current 95 BOLD
customers in a pilot program that runs until next spring. These
customers may use the web to access service bulletins, maintenance
tips, configuration change data, in-service fleet reports and
other documents, the company said.
</P>
<P>
As the system evolves, web access will be expanded to include
detailed technical drawings, all major maintenance manuals,
product standards and other information. The web-based BOLD system
will also accommodate more features, including self-paced training
programs and e-mail communication between the customer and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
By next spring, at the conclusion of the pilot program, Boeing
will designate the web-based BOLD as the standard offering and
making it available to all customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said a key benefit of going online is that customers
eliminate the need to distribute, store, file and retrieve huge
quantities of paper and microfilmed documents. In addition, the
BOLD database is updated daily, providing customers with the
latest, most accurate information for airplane maintenance, repair
and operations.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Registers 1.3 billion-U.S. Dollar Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ghana Investment
Promotion Centre (GIPC) registered 780 projects involving an
estimated capital of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars between 1994 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
About 78 percent of the projects, involving over 997 million
U.S. dollars, are in foreign equity and loans, according to the
World Investment Report launched under the theme "Foreign Direct
Investment and the Challenge of Development" in the Ghanaian
capital Accra Monday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 780 projects, 534 (over 68 percent) were registered
as joint venture projects and 246 (31.54 percent) were wholly
foreign-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghana's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) declined to 45
million U.S. dollars last year from 82 million U.S. dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It was the second successive decline compared to the 120
million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Gyasi, director of GIPC Research and Development,
acknowledged that Ghana has to strengthen its efforts to enable it
to become a strong investment location.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain has been the major source of FDI into the
country with 81 projects. China follows with 59 projects and the
United States with 58 projects.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, innovative and proactive measures for sourcing
investments into Ghana need to be undertaken," Gyasi said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only to sustain Ghana as a competitive investment
location, but to enhance the business environment, particularly in
reducing establishment cost and time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gyasi said the GIPC is reviewing the legal framework for
investment and shifting its promotion from a general to a more
targeted approach.

<HEADLINE> German Doctors Revive Man Whose Heart Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A man whose heart stopped
beating for sever hours was revived by heroic efforts of a team of
German doctors, according to a report published in the current
issue of British medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year old man in Berlin, Germany, believed to have eaten
toxic berries, was found comatose in a park and was taken to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Doctors then tried electric shocks, heart-stimulating drugs and
a pacemaker. They kept his circulation going, maintaining oxygen
to the brain by constant external massage of his heart.
</P>
<P>
After seven hours, a normal heart rhythm was restored and the
man gradually regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
The incident raised questions over whether enough effort was
made to resuscitate young, otherwise fit patients suffering
cardiac arrest, said the chief author Professor Friederich Luft,
from the Franz Volhard Clinic of the Humboldt University of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"I have worked in the U.S. and I am sure they would have given
up there after one and a half hours," he says, "In this case, the
German team was very good physicians and they wouldn't give up.
They saved his life."
</P>
<P>
"In an 80-year-old with heart disease it would be a different
matter, but in a younger person with a cardiac arrest of unknown
cause you shouldn't give up. This is the message." he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Two German Energy Giants Begin Merger Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- In the largest case of corporate
fusion in Germany this year, Veba and Viag, both giants in the
energy branch, Monday began their steps of tying up to the largest
energy supplier in the world.
</P>
<P>
This message was announced in Duesseldorf and Munich,
respective headquarters of the two firms in the early morning
after the supervisory board of Viag approved the merger plan
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Duesseldorf-based Veba AG and the Viag AG, based in Munich,
together have an annual turnover of 150 billion marks (80 billion
U.S. dollars) and a staff of 200,000. The new company after merger
will become the third largest German industrial concern after
Daimler-Chrysler and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
"In the energy branch where there is a pressure of becoming
giant, this fusion is only the first step," said Ulrich Hartmann,
chairman of Veba, at a press conference in Munich. He added that
the ultimate goal of the new concern was to become a world player.
</P>
<P>
The new company, the name of which to be decided in October,
will have its headquarters in Duesseldorf and be co-led by
Hartmann and his counterpart in Viag, Wihelm Simson.
</P>
<P>
Two main areas of the new concern, chemicals and power supply,
will be launched on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the power supply units of Viag and Veba,
respectively Bayernwerk and Preussen Elektra, will tie up to a new
energy group based in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Other major units of Veba and Viag will be merged in the next
two or three years, Hartmann said, adding, "We will not let
ourselves in a rush."
</P>
<P>
According to the merger plan, shareholding in the new concern
will be weighed at a ratio of 67 percent for Veba and 33 percent
for Viag. And Viag shareholders will receive one Veba share per
2.8 Viag shares.
</P>
<P>
Hartmann and Simson expected the approval of the Federal Cartel
Office, Germany's anti-trust watchdog. And in next February, the
merger plan will be passed by major shareholder sessions of the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
Besides energy supply and chemicals, the new concern will also
operate in the fields of telecommunication and real estate. Other
operations, including packaging, logistics, trading and aluminum
refining, will possibly be divested off step by step, Hartmann
said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, those units to be sold will account for 55 billion
marks (30 billion U.S. dollars) and a work force of almost
100,000.
</P>
<P>
The way for the merger was cleared after the Bavarian state
government decided to back the plan and sell 10 percent of its
stake in Viag to Veba for 3.1 billion marks. By now, the Bavarian
government holds 25.1 percent of the Viag stake.
</P>
<P>
Bavarian state premier Edmund Stoiber called the merger plan
"by far the most attractive solution for Viag and for Bavaria."
</P>
<P>
Energy supply, chemicals and telecommunication, all covered by
Viag, are three most important industrial fields of Bavaria, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If Bayernwerk (the power supply unit of Viag) had remained
alone, sooner or later it would become a takeover target with
unforeseeable consequences for the company and for the jobs in
Bavaria," said Stoiber.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say two main reasons for the merger are the fierce
competition in a liberalized German domestic energy market, and,
more important, the tougher pressure facing German companies in
the European and world stage since the European common currency
has been launched.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the merger, the two companies will save at least
1.6 billion marks annually by 2002. And about 2,500 jobs, chiefly
in the energy unit, will be cut.

<HEADLINE> FDI Flows to Africa Drop: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) in Africa accounted for only four percent of the total for
the developing countries, down from nine percent in 1989, a
United Nations report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Africa benefited from a rise in FDI inflows since the early
1990s, but the growth in FDI flows to the region was much less
than that in FDI flows to other developing countries, leaving much
of Africa's potential for FDI unutilized," said the newly released
World Investment Report 1999 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reforms that have taken place and the progress
expected in a number of African countries in terms of improving
the business environment,
</P>
<P>
further work is needed to change the image of the continent,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Africa attracted 8.3 billion U.S. dollars of foreign direct
investment (FDI) in 1998, about 12 percent less than that in the
previous year, according to the report sponsored by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The decrease was largely due to a dramatic drop in FDI flows to
South Africa, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
South Africa witnessed an unprecedented peak in terms of
privatization- related FDI inflows in 1997 but a drop in 1998 to
levels of previous years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of the continent registered a moderate
increase, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by UNCTAD shows that the leading industries
that attracted FDI were telecommunications, food, beverages,
tourism, textiles and clothing as well as mining and quarrying
during the 1996-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Between 2000 and 2003, they are expected to be tourism, food
and beverages, telecommunications as well as textile and leather,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The five countries ranked most attractive to foreign investors
in Africa for the period 2000-2003 are South Africa, Nigeria,
Botswana, Cote d' Ivoire and Tunisia, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> HK's Exports Continue to Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports
continued to pick up in August 1999, according to external trade
figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) in August 1999 increased by 4.4 percent over a year
earlier to 124.3 billion HK dollars (15.93 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports rose by 6.7 percent
to 108.5 billion HK dollars (13.91 billion U.S. dollars), while
that of domestic exports decreased by 9.5 percent to 15.9 billion
HK dollars (2.03 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports in August 1999 increased by
1.7 percent over a year earlier to 121.9 billion HK dollars (15.62
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade surplus of 2.4 billion HK dollars (307.6
million U.S. dollars), equivalent to 2.0 percent of the value of
imports, was recorded in August 1999, in contrast to the deficit
of 0.7 billion HK dollars (89.7 million U.S. dollars), equivalent
to 0.6 percent of the value of imports, recorded in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the further pick-
up in Hong Kong's total exports in August was mainly led by the
strong recovery in demand in East Asia and sustained robust demand
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Exports to China's mainland should have also arrested its
downtrend since April 1998, in line with the distinct rebound in
the mainland's exports lately.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that with the further improvement in
exports alongside the still modest absorption of imports, Hong
Kong's visible trade account attained a surplus in August 1999 for
the first time since January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Annan Questions "Usefulness" of "Six Plus Two "group on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday voiced concern over the "usefulness" of a
group of countries working to end the fighting in Afghanistan,
saying he would review the UN's approach to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The unabated external involvement in the Afghan conflict
leads me to raise the question of the role of the 'six plus two
group'", said Annan in a report obtained by the press this
morning. The group, which includes Afghanistan's six neighbors,
the Russia Federation and the United States, was originally
established to adopt a joint strategy for a peaceful solution to
the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreements on texts and declarations, the group
has not been able to make real progress on a more unified
approach vis-a-vis the warring parties, the U.N. chief said,
adding that words must be put into political practice. "By their
continuous support for certain Afghan factions, some members of
the group appear to "paying mostly lip service to their stated
intentions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I thus share the particular concern of my Special Envoy,
Lakhar Brahimi, about the practical usefulness of the 'six plus
two 'group for the United Nations peacemaking efforts in
Afghanistan," said the Secretary-General. He said he intended to
present to the General Assembly and the Security council a
review of the UN's approach to the Afghan conflict, including
the mechanism of Members States's support.
</P>
<P>
The report describes the Taliban's new military
offensives in July as "profoundly disturbing " and said its
leadership evidently continues to believe in a military solution
to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
External forces are continuing to fuel the fighting in
Afghanistan with deliveries of weapons and ammunition and are
also taking part in the actual conflict and planning military
offensives, said Annan. "If this trend is not halted and
reversed, the conflict will evolve into an even more widespread
and destructive regional conflict."

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin urged Chinese enterprises to go out and temper themselves in
the winds and storms of economic globalization and build up their
own competitiveness in his address to the '99 Fortune Global Forum
held at the Shanghai International Convention Center Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
A great number of successful Chinese enterprises are working
toward this goal, as they try their best to become ranked among
the top 500 multinational corporations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ruimin, president of the Qingdao-based Haier Group, said
his group is endeavoring to be one of the world's top 500
corporations by introducing an advanced management mechanism,
improving product quality, and developing its brand name, at a
seminar hosted today by the Fortune Global Forum.
</P>
<P>
This embodies the aspiration of numerous Chinese enterprises
who wish to expand their scale by entering the world market.
</P>
<P>
Haier, one of China's leading consumer electronics producers,
put forward a global business strategy in 1995 when its annual
output equaled only one-nineteenth of the smallest corporation on
the top 500 list. By the end of 1998, Haier's annual output
accounted for a quarter of the smallest firm of the leading 500
multinationals. In recent years, Haier has maintained an annual
growth of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang stated, "Haier still lags far behind prestigious
multinationals such as GE and Siemens. The road to catch up with
the world's top 500 is also a process of absorbing advanced
technology and expertise of the multinationals."

The Chinese government has decided to give energetic support to
the development of six companies including Haier, Baoshan Iron and
Steel Complex, Beijing University Founder Group Corp., Huabei
Pharmaceutical, Sichuan Changhong and Jiangnan Shipyard by
allocating at least 20 million yuan to each enterprise annually in
an effort to make them part of the top 500 by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Five Chinese enterprises, SINOPEC, China Grain Conglomerate,
China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation, Bank of
China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, have now been
listed among the top 500 multinational corporations. SINOPEC ranks
seventh among the world's petrochemical companies.
</P>
<P>
Li Yizhong, general manager of SINOPEC, said he felt great
pressure to maintain this position. The group must enhance its
competitiveness on the world market through readjusting industrial
structure, promoting sales, improving efficiency, restructuring
assets and carrying out technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China, which has been on the top 500 list for 10
years running, underwent a substantial reform in its management
and operating mechanism last year. It has set up a market-oriented
system centering on services and risk prevention, and cultivated a
strong sense of management, investment and service in the course
of cooperation with overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Both China Grain Conglomerate and SINOPEC have turned from
import-export companies to international groups which combine
trade with manufacturing, technological development and financial
and information service.
</P>
<P>
Fan Gang, a noted economist, said at today's Fortune Global
seminar that Chinese enterprises are experiencing a change from
the planned economy to a market economy, and their business
operations abroad are confronted with many difficulties. They must
guard against the tendency of aiming too high and seeking too
large a scale, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing British Defense Secretary on European Defense Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing British
Secretary for Defense George Robertson, who has been appointed the
next secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Tuesday defined the European Defense Initiative as a program to "
meet tomorrow's threats, not yesterday's enemies."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the need for "nations of Europe to have the right
armed forces to fight and win," Robertson told the Labor Party's
annual conference that "forces to meet tomorrow's threats, not
yesterday's enemies, are what the new European Defense Initiative
is all about."
</P>
<P>
He expounded on the importance of "getting the troops to the
crisis, in the right time, with the right training, the right
equipment and the ability to supply and protect themselves,"
saying: "It is urgent that we do it and that the Europeans do it
together."
</P>
<P>
Britain has led the way in this regard, as the country's
Strategic Defense Review is seen as the most radical modernization
of Britain's defenses in a generation, said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
But responding to crises as they happen is not enough, he said.
"We must do all we can to prevent these conflicts from happening
in the first place."
</P>
<P>
That is why that for the first time in British history, the
Labor Government has transformed conflict prevention and defense
diplomacy from a secondary task for British forces to one of their
primary missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
After an account of the Government's defense endeavors in the
past year and more, Robertson said "Britain is back where it
should be -- leading in Europe and leading in the world."

In his view, a criterion for the world's most competitive
company should be evaluated in terms of assets, market share,
creative ability, management skills, business turnover and
development potential.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the 200 Chinese enterprises participating in
the current Fortune Forum regard the occasion as a good chance for
them to enter the world market.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xinxian, president of Shenzhen-based Sanjiu Group, pledged
that he will turn his group into the world's largest and most
advanced herbal pharmaceutical plant in five years.
</P>
<P>
And Huayuan Group said it will take the advantage of the
government's new policies on trade expansion for enterprises to
build 10 production bases and 20 trade companies overseas in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China has established 5,666
overseas enterprises with a combined investment of 6.32 billion U.
S. dollars from the Chinese side. These cover a wide range
including trade, manufacturing, resources development, processing,
transport, medicine and tourism. Non-trade firms constitute 40
percent of the total. The most active sectors include household
electric appliances, tourism, telecommunications, and textiles.
</P>
<P>
At present, 30 of the 225 largest global contractors in the
world are Chinese, with a total workforce of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Chinese entrepreneurs all hold the view that more Chinese firms
will be added to the list of the top 500 when the country's
overall economic strength is improved, though many enterprises
still lack experience and brand-name recognition at the present
stage.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Promotes Active Europe Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook told the Labor Party in the Party's annual conference
on Tuesday that "Britain is leading Europe" as a result of the
Party's efforts to have Britain's voice heard in and out of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Contrasting what he called Labor's "new internationalism" to
the Conservative Party's "isolationism", Cook said that "under
Labor, Britain is leading Europe, not leaving Europe."
</P>
<P>
Britain is leading the reform of Europe, making it more open,
more in touch with people, he said, adding "but Britain will not
be taken seriously on the case of reform, if Europe does not
believe we want to make it a success."
</P>
<P>
It will be a disaster for Britain to be withdrawn from Europe,
because Britain sells most of its exports to Europe and Britain
needs to be there when rules are drawn up in Europe, he said. "
Because we and our neighbors face the same problems of cross-
border crime, the same challenges of protecting our environment,
and we need common solutions. Besides, we need the united
strength of Europe when we talk to the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
If it becomes clear that the "five tests" are met and that
Britain's interests would be better served by joining the Single
Currency, the Labor Government will invite the British people in a
referendum to make the right choice, Cook said. "If the economic
conditions are right, Labor will not let Britain lose out by
staying out."
</P>
<P>
For many British people, out of Europe would mean out of work,
he said. "Isolation in the modern world carries a big penalty in
the global economy."
</P>
<P>
"We recognize globalization demands a New Internationalism," he
said. "And our internationalism recognizes that we cannot deliver
our domestic program working alone in the world."

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 people
gathered happily together Tuesday evening at the Chinese Embassy
here to cerebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Attending the grand reception were President of the National
Assembly Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Prime Minister Hun Sen and
other government ministers and senior officials, as well as
ambassadors from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in his congratulatory speech, highly
valued China's development and achievements in the past 50 years,
saying that "China's success is a great contribution to the whole
world, including Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"Since the founding of the People's Republic of China 50 years
ago, China, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and
its leaders as well as the decades of hardwork of the Chinese
people, has changed greatly and its rapid development has
attracted worldwide attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of "China's correct foreign policy" that
is to maintain the world peace, respect other countries'
independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, insist on the
peaceful coexistence, and promote the cooperation among countries.
</P>
<P>
"The facts have proved that China's success in reform and other
fields is a valuable experience to Cambodia and other countries,"
Hun Sen stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, meanwhile, reiterated Cambodia's One China
policy, saying "Cambodia will never change its stance and will
always stick to One China policy as we enter the new century."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Yan Tingai gave a warm welcome to the
attendance. He said that "the friendly cooperation between China
and Cambodia proved to be time-tested, despite the ever-changing
international situation in the past 50 years."
</P>
<P>
He thanked the precious sympathy and support that the King, the
Cambodian government and people extended to China's cause of
building socialism and its fight for defending the state
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"after 50 years of repeated exploration and on the basis of
summing up both the positive and negative experiences from itself
and others, China has found the proper way for national
rejuvenation in accordance with the national conditions of China,"
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
"As the result, the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics was created. Under the guidance of the banner of
this theory, the Chinese people showed great power of cohesion and
creation. The Chinese economy entered a new period of sustainable,
rapid and coordinated development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the prime minister and the ambassador very much valued the
traditional and friendly Sino-Cambodian ties that were fostered by
King Norodom Sihanouk and older generations of Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
They expressed full confidence in the future relations, saying
the friendly cooperation between the two countries based on the
five principles of peaceful coexistence will certainly be further
developed and consolidated in the new century.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Achieve Sustainable Growth: Forum Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China is capable of solving
environmental problems and achieving sustainable economic
development while maintaining rapid growth and improving people's
living standards, according to participants at the ongoing '99
Fortune Global Forum.
</P>
<P>
China will settle environmental problems just as it has done
with other difficulties, for Chinese people are more and more
conscious of the importance of environmental protection, said
participants at a discussion on energy and the environment held
here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, when the reform and opening-up policies
were implemented, China has become one of the countries developing
most rapidly, with an annual growth rate of 9.7 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, environmental problems, including industrial
pollution, soil erosion, and the dwindling of arable land, have
had a severe negative impact on economic development in some areas.
</P>
<P>
However, China has paid attention to these problems and a
series of effective measures have been taken to prevent and
control pollution, said Kenneth L. Lay, Chairman and CEO of ENRON
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most remarkable changes in China is that everyone
is very concerned about the environment," said Lay, who compared
the situation with that 12 years ago when he came to the country
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, China has made environmental protection a
state policy and has enacted some 15 related laws. Last year, its
investment in environmental protection reached a record 81.8
billion yuan, accounting for more than one percent of its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Goran Lindahl, President and CEO of Switzerland's ABB Ltd.,
said that China will gain a sustainable growth, although it will
not be as fast as the development of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Bonsignore, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell Inc. of
the United States, said that China has great potential in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, it can replace coal with other kinds of
energy, such as wind, oil and natural gas, all abundant in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the participants, the biggest challenge facing
China in environmental protection now is the lack of funds and
technology, and this indeed has provided many opportunities for
investors.
</P>
<P>
Liang Congjie, president of the Friends of Nature, a non-
governmental environmental protection organization in China, said
that more practical efforts should be made to further increase the
public's awareness of the importance of environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Protest Against Japanese Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people from all walks
of life and some friendly Japanese protested recently in Harbin,
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, over the
ruling by a Tokyo District Court on September 22 that the Japanese
government is not responsible for compensating 10 Chinese
plaintiffs, victims and surviving family members of Japanese
atrocities during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan inflicted tremendous sufferings on the Chinese people
during the war, but the court did not acknowledge the right of
foreign individuals to seek compensation for war damages from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling is regarded as unjust and extremely absurd, as it
tramples on international law and has deeply hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The protesters will continue supporting the plaintiffs in their
appeal to a higher court in Japan until the victims get their
deserved compensation.
</P>
<P>
During the war, Japanese military unit 731, based in Harbin,
conducted biological experiments using bubonic plague, anthrax and
cholera on thousands of Chinese prisoners of war and civilians.

OTTAWA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Montreal-based charter
airline, Royal Airlines, has confirmed that six of its 158 flight
attendants are suffering from TB as a result of ferrying Kosovar
refugees.
</P>
<P>

The six, two men and four women, have been off their jobs and
undergoing treatment since early June.

Meanwhile the Canadian Health Department has stated that there
is little chance of an outbreak of the disease although there has
been an overly fearful response to the TB reports.
</P>
<P>
Royal Airlines made some 23 flights to Kosovar to bring about 5,
000 refugees to Canada. A handful of refugees with TB were
identified soon after their arrival, earlier media reports said.

PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- France called on Russia on
Tuesday to seek a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya,
and expressed concern about the influx of refugees into the
neighbors of the Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a political solution can be put to work in the

Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the agreement reached by General Alexander

operations (by Russia) in Chechnya and by the influx of refugees
in the neighboring republics," said the spokesman.

targets in Chechnya for six days, killing hundreds of people, most

<HEADLINE> France Releases Mauritanian Officer Accused of Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A French court released on
Tuesday a Mauritanian army officer who was detained in July for
suspected crimes of torture in his own country, Agence France-
Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Accusation of the Appeal Court of Montpellier,
southwest France, released Captain Ely Ould Dah, who was accused
of torturing two Mauritanian officers in 1991 suspected of joining
a coup plot against President Maaouya Ould Taya one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The officer was studying as an infantry intern in France, when
he was arrested on July 2 after being accused by two human rights
groups in France.
</P>
<P>
His arrest caused a diplomatic crisis between France and
Mauritania, which expelled all French military advisors and
recalled Mauritanian students from France.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer of case, Luc Abratkieuwicz, said that the arrest
has caused trouble to "national and international public order
with its racist character."
</P>
<P>
The court said that Ould Dah could resume his study in the
School of Application of Infantry of Montpellier but cannot travel
out of the region of Herault in southwest France.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
today stressed the importance of Beijing's environmental
protection and pollution control work during his inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the local government to continue its effort to keep
clear skies and clean water, and speed up developing the city into
a highly civilized metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Beijing initiated a seven-year pollution control project for
its rivers and lakes in 1998, which is expected to cost a total of
16.5 million yuan. The first phase of the project was finished
recently, covering one billion square meters of water area.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the city has carried out a series of drives on the
control of vehicle exhaust emissions, reducing air pollution to
the lowest level in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also inspected sample buses that run on natural gas, and
visited the Gaobeidian Sewage Plant, largest in China with a daily
handling capacity of one million cubic meters of sewage, or 40
percent of the total sewage volume in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhu visited Wangjing, the city's largest
residential quarter, and some street reconstruction projects
around the city.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception in Honor of Overseas Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
today reiterated that there is only one China in the world, and
Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and the territory and
sovereignty of China cannot be divided.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a reception in honor of overseas Chinese
on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Chinese nationality advocates unification
and opposes separation, adding that the compatriots across the
Taiwan Straits are born from the same ancestors, which separatist
forces cannot resist.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed solicitude for the suffering of Taiwan
compatriots caused by the recent devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
All ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China, have worked together to make a poor and backward China
become a prosperous, strong, and vigorous China over the past five
decades, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong has remained prosperous and stable
since it returned to the motherland more than two years ago, and
Macao will also return to the motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
This is another important event in the cause of China's
reunification, Tang said, adding that the Chinese people both at
home and overseas should be proud of it.
</P>
<P>
Anna Chan Chennault, a notable Chinese-American, said on the
occasion that overseas Chinese are very excited about the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as

<HEADLINE> HK's Tourist Industry to Develop With Renewed Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourist
industry has experienced a year-on-year growth for 14 consecutive
months since the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The post-handover downturn was reversed during the second half
of 1998, and double-digit growth was recorded for the first
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was said here today by Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) Lo Yuk Sui during its 41st annual general
meeting being held at the Furama Hotel, in Central, Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the HKTA's 1998/9 Annual Report, Lo said that until
recently, Hong Kong was blessed by a conjunction of three positive
factors: global interest in Hong Kong, booming regional prosperity
and a highly favorable demand-supply situation.
</P>
<P>
But, after the handover, there had been a temporary downturn in
Hong Kong's tourist industry. Total visitor arrivals for 1998 was
9.57 million, down eight percent on 1997's 10.41 million, while
total tourism receipts fell 23.4 percent to 55.3 billion HK
dollars (7.08 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lo noted, however, that the temporary downturn was in many ways
a blessing in disguise. It has helped the HKTA and the industry at
large to focus on the medium- and long-term needs of visitors.
Sophisticated market research was being used to better identify
those needs to ensure that Hong Kong maintains a sustainable
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The key objective for the association for the coming year would
be the pursuit of higher yields and increased earnings, the
chairman said. "The major message gleaned from the past year is
that to remain competitive in the new millennium, the industry
must strengthen the perception of Hong Kong as being a destination
that offers better value for money. This is an image that must be
expanded and polished over the coming year through the provision
of quality services," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Through such initiatives as the newly established Heritage
Tourism Task Force and the cultural tourism round table we are
ensuring that we are developing attractions to meet consumer
demand," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas, our strategic directions and marketing efforts are
being geared to the needs of the individual markets. We can no
longer rely on being a destination whose reputation rests only on
food, shopping and hotels," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also noted that in the coming year, the HKTA will
strengthen its relationships with China's mainland and other Asian
destinations in order to develop multi-destination itineraries and
capitalize on Hong Kong's hub position and status as the preferred
gateway to Asia and China. The association will also be utilizing
new media options -- such as the Internet -- for communications,
sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan, Commissioner for Tourism Mike
Rowse and other members of the Board of Management also attended
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Israel Conducts More Jet Raids in Security Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters
conducted more air raids against the Hezbollah targets inside the
security zone in South Lebanon Tuesday morning and all fighters
returned to their base safely, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF Air Force fighters struck several Hezbollah targets in
the eastern sector of the security zone and caused considerable
damage to the targets, the IDF added.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were conducted following more military attacks
against the positions of the Israeli-allied South lebanese Army
(SLA) earlier, as the IDF said, and 45-year-old Fawzi Sagghir,
chief of the SLA intelligence in the central sector of the
security zone, was killed Monday in a roadside bomb explosion. The
IDF and SLA blamed Hezbollah, or Party of God, for carrying out
this attack.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered an almost day-long mortar, rocket and
artillery battle between Hezbollah and SLA and IDF inside the
security zone, accompanied by IDF's air raids.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Office (PMO) on Tuesday criticized Syria
for not stopping the Hezbollah in carrying out attacks against
the SLA as well as its attacks on SLA civilian targets in the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of fighting inside the security zone showed
Syria is not ready to resume peace talks with Israel, a PMO
official told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The IDF said it took a very grave view of the wounding of
Lebanese civilians and damage to their property and noted that it
was yet another "flagrant violation" by the Hezbollah side of the
Grapes of Wrath cease-fire understanding signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-proclaimed security zone in South Lebanon
in 1985 and since then, Hezbollah and other local military groups
have been waging resistance against the Israeli occupation.

ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghan opposition Tuesday
claimed that some 300 Taliban troops have been killed while scores
of others injured in the last four days of fighting in the
northern province of Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of a number of towns in the province to the
control of Taliban forces, fighting continues to rage in
Dasht-i-Archi, opposition spokesman General Hussain Anwari said
in a statement reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources had claimed to have captured the towns of Sahih
and Dasht-i-Archi, which the opposition had admitted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said Kunduz's flat terrain will leave the Taliban
vulnerable over the coming days and so they do not view the loss
of some territory in the province as serious.
</P>
<P>
Additional opposition troops have been sent to the province to
assist in the defense of key posts there, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Taliban militia launched a major offensive in Kunduz
and neighboring Samangan province on Saturday against the
opposition.

BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Airbus Company, a European

the most sophisticated planes of the company outside Iraq on its
own account.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) on Tuesday quoted Nicolas Girop, Airbus'
regional sales director in the Middle East, as saying the training
will be in Jordan or perhaps in some other countries.
</P>

According to a contract Airbus company signed with Iraq before
U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, Airbus will supply five planes to the Iraqi Airways.

Iraqi Airways has been grounded since the U.N. air embargo on
Iraq, part of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leaders to Sign Pact on Charter-change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will sign with leaders of Congress this week a tripartite
covenant binding lawmakers to take up only proposed economic
reforms to the 1987 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Tuesday in a statement that this pact would be the
strongest proof yet that he wants only economic reforms to the
Charter to attract more foreign capital, and that he is not
seeking political reforms like the extension of term limits.
</P>
<P>
The president said that there would be a ceremonial signing of
the covenant by himself, Senate President Blas Ople and House
Speaker Manuel Villar Jr. at "anytime within this week."
</P>
<P>
Ople, a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission that
drafted the present constitution, said this covenant is meant to
convince the public that Estrada has no hidden political agenda in
proposing the Constitutional Corrections for Development (Concord)
process.
</P>
<P>
Ople said the tripartite covenant, which defines the scope of
the constitutional amendments, will have the force and effect of a
law.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Estrada also reiterated his appeal to some
lawmakers not to pursue their personal interests and concentrate
instead on coming up with concrete measures to improve the
people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Political reforms, he added, can be taken up by the next
administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada started the Concord process by creating the Preparatory
Commission on Constitutional Reforms, which he tasked to study
proposed constitutional amendments and come up with its report by
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign capital appears to be the only way of closing
the widening gap in investments that the government needs to
create jobs, improve the delivery of basic services and gear up
local industries for rapid globalization into the next century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Newspaper Groups Expect to Flourish in New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Gu Xingwei, general manager
of the Wenhui and Xinmin United Newspaper Group, said at the
current '99 Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai that they are
preparing to take a "rich breakfast" for the new century.
</P>
<P>
Gu was talking about the intensifying competition that has led
to a new round of reforms in Chinese newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He said all kinds of newspapers are looking for ways to get
their share of this "rich breakfast", especially after the "last
supper" of the planned economy, or the end of the old system under
which newspapers had to depend on administrative orders for
distribution rather than market competition.
</P>
<P>
The first two newspaper groups, Guangming Daily and Economic
Daily, appeared in China in June of 1998. Since then, only six
newspaper groups have got government permission to organize, but a
large group of powerful newspapers are still planning to establish
newspaper groups and purchase other papers.
</P>
<P>
In the socialist market economy, Chinese newspapers have had to
follow government policy while providing information for readers,
explained Li Yuanjiang, chairman of the board of the Guangzhou
Daily Newspaper Group. The newspaper's social and economic
benefits lie in readership and establishing a group is the best
way to increase this, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
After merging 10 newspapers, three magazines, and a publishing
house over the past seven years, the Guangzhou Daily News Group
increased its readership to 1.2 million, which means two billion
yuan (about 240 million U.S. dollars) in annual output value.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper group is now trying to enter the stock market
overseas to obtain more funds for expansion. It has already
established a chain of more than 100 bookstores and will build
several large book distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
Wenhui Xinmin United has a readership of more than three
million for its two major newspapers, Wenhui Daily and Xinmin
Evening News, and about 10 small newspapers and a dozen companies
involved in publishing, distribution, advertising, hotels, and
taxis.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that his group is expecting to increase profits by more
than 100 million yuan this year and is planning to establish in
Shanghai China's first large advertising and trade center and
promotion network early next year.
</P>
<P>
This development has become the general trend for various news
groups which share the common goal of combining economic and
social benefits, according to Wang Chen, head of the Guangming
Daily Newspaper Group.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The prices of basic
commodities are not expected to go up despite a looming round of
oil price increases, a senior official of the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, DTI Assistant Secretary Zenaida Maglaya
reminded traders that price controls remain in effect over basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
"We are still monitoring and enforcing the price control on
basic commodities. We expect no price adjustments in the next few
weeks," she said.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya urged consumers and retailers to report to DTI any
price increase, even as she urged wholesalers to practice goodwill
and not exploit the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to receive petitions for price increases in the
first week of October. But as of now, we have received no such
petitions. Nor have manufacturers advised us about making price
adjustments," Maglaya said.

<P>
Thus, she said, the public should not expect any increase in
the prices of basic commodities in the next few weeks despite the
expected increase in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya said the DTI will issue again advisories on the prices
of basic commodities to serve as a guide for consumers and a
reminder to retailers.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ)
Serafin Cuevas said his office is coordinating with the Department
of Energy (DOE) in protecting the public.
</P>
<P>
Cuevas said the DOJ and DOE are keeping tabs on the increases
in prices effected by oil firms operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are reviewing the reports given by the DOE. We
will help build airtight cases against abusive oil firms," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Shell Corp. and Petron Corp., two of the "Big Three"
in the country's oil industry, confirmed Monday that they will
increase the price of gasoline again before the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Readjusting Telecommunications Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua)-- China is planning to readjust
its telecommunications fees to conform with the international
price situation, said Wu Jichuan, minister of Information Industry
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu told Xinhua that compared with nearby countries, China's
local telephone calls and mobile phone calls are less expensive,
but Internet service providers (ISP) and the cost of international
phone calls are both more expensive.
</P>
<P>
"The fees adjustment will bring down the income of the
telecommunications industry in the short period, but with the
increase of users, the sector stands to win in the long-term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China lowered the its ISP charges and telephone installation
fees in March, resulting in an income decrease of 12.5 billion
yuan to the telecommunications industry, but the number of
Internet users and telephone users has increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China's information industry will
gradually focus on the development of micro-electronics, software,
information infrastructure construction, and market construction,
because at present China supplies itself with less than 20 percent
of its micro-electronics products.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese electronics industry ranks fifth in the world in
terms of production scale. In 1998, China produced 2.9 million
computers, 8.6 million mobile phones, and 36 million color TV sets.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO to Build 400 Secondary Schools for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will
build 400 secondary schools for Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This project is part of a cooperation agreement signed on
Monday by UNESCO's Deputy Director-General Colin Paul and Iraqi
Education Minister Fahd Salim Ash-Shakrah, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Paul said after the signing ceremony that UNESCO will also
supply books and equipment to Iraqi students.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO will write off some of Iraq's debts to provide
necessary funds for the project of building schools, said Paul.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq is one of the leading countries in education
before the U.N. sanctions were imposed on the country in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, "embargo has crippled all the chances to improve the
education system because of the U.N. Security Council's ban on the
imports of pencils, papers and other basic prerequisites for
education," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted
soon, saying the embargo has caused grave impacts on education,
culture and science of the country.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ash-Shakrah said that cooperation with UNESCO
goes beyond the scope of building schools. "There are many other
projects in the field of culture and science," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO delegation led by Paul is paying a several-day
visit to Iraq to examine the effects of U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Sees Earth-Shaking Changes in Past Half Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Earth-shaking changes have
taken place in Sichuan Province, southwest China, in the past half
century, where 85 million residents now have access to a
sufficient food supply, the most prominent achievement for the
province since 1949, the year New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
So said Zhang Zhongwei, acting governor of the province, during
an interview.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province, known as "the Land of Abundance," had the
largest population, 110 million, of any provinces in the country,
until its city of Chongqing was promoted to Municipality status in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Grain output in Sichuan rose from 10 million tons in 1949 to
more than 36 million tons in 1998, with per capita grain
consumption exceeding 420 kg last year. Sichuan accounts for one-
third of the grain produced in ten provinces and cities in western
China, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The local GDP reached 358 billion yuan last year, indicating an
average annual growth rate of more than nine percent over the past
half century. Sichuan now contributes one-third of the GDP for all
of western China.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has transformed the famous water conservancy project at
Dujiangyan, which was built 2,200 years ago and turned the Chengdu
Plain into fertile land. The total irrigated area benefited from
the project has been expanded to 6.67 million hectares from the
former 180,000 hectares, creating one of the largest gravity-
irrigated areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province has also become the most important grain and non-
staple food producer in the country's western region, and now has
more than 1.21 million township enterprises, which contribute to
half of its total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
The province has also made great headway in industry, science
and technology, transportation, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Expressways there now extend for more than 400 km, with more
than 700 km now under construction. By the end of 1998, a total of
more than 80,000 km of highways had opened to traffic in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan also has become the country's largest base for
developing water energy, and its local "Silicon Valley" in
Mianyang has attracted worldwide attention.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Says China's Accession to WTO Achievable in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said here today that he believes China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is achievable this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a luncheon reception at the ongoing Fortune
Global Forum, Kissinger said that China's participation in the WTO
"should be in the interest of China, of the U.S. and of the world
community." He said the negotiations failed in April because of
domestic American politics, and that it cannot resume exactly at
that same point.
</P>
<P>
"But with the wisdom of both sides, ...I believe a solution
should be achievable within this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. diplomat, who was met by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin here on Monday, said that maintaining a cooperative
relationship between China and the U.S. will be in the interest of
both nations and indeed the entire world. Therefore the two
countries should resolve their disputes through diplomatic
channels on the basis of mutual understanding and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The two have no conflict on principle issues, although they are
quite different in their ideology and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot consider that we can have stability and progress in
Asia if China and the United States are in a cold war with each
other," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced great changes over the past two decades,
and its opening to the outside over the past 10 years was much
greater than that of the previous 200 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. should continue its "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Every American president,...has agreed that Taiwan should be
part of China," he said. "Every single American president, of both
parties, including President Reagan, who explicitly stated, and
President Clinton repeated last year, that America affirms 'one
China,' and not 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.'"

DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's second private
export processing zone (EPZ) will be set up in the country's
southeastern Chittagong district soon, the official BSS news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will lay the foundation stone of
the second private EPZ on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EPZ will be constructed on 121 hectares of land on the
northern bank of the Karnaphuli River in the district, five
kilometers off the Bangladesh Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
A private company will spend 2 billion taka (40 million U.S.
dollars) for the development of infrastructure at the EPZ and the
site development work is expected to start in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 industrial units could be accommodated at the EPZ,
which is expected to create employment for 50,000 people when the
industries in the zone go into production, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The first private EPZ, a Korean export processing zone, is
being constructed on the other side of the Karnaphuli River.
</P>
<P>
There are two EPZs in the country at present, one in the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Urgent Meeting to Solve Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting has been
launched to find way out of the current crisis forcing the
close-down of the 3.8- billion-U.S. dollar Nigeria Liquefied
Natural Gas Plant.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the government, the management of the Nigeria
Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. and local traditional leaders opened in
Port Harcourt, capital of Nigeria's east Rivers State, Monday
after President Olusegun Obasanjo paid a one-day visit to Bonny
Island, Rivers State, where the plant is located.
</P>
<P>
Basically, Bonny indigenes want five managerial positions in
the gas plant, employment of 50 skilled hands, supply of
electricity and water and strict adherence to the mitigation
measures in the Environmental Impact Assessment report on the
project, according to sources at Monday's meeting in Port
Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door parley was convened to clear "the grey areas"
which Obasanjo did not address during his visit to the plant, the
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the restive youths Sunday, the president
stressed that the face-off between the community and the companies
was hurting the country's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for training program to engage the
indigenes, appealing, however, for time to attend to their
demands.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo also told the youths that the fulfilment of their
wishes depended on the restoration of peace in the area.
</P>
<P>
The president had admitted that failure to plan for the future
of the youth who worked at the construction site of the Nigeria
Liquefied Natural Gas, was responsible for the shut-down of the
multi-billion plant.
</P>
<P>
The huge plant in southeast Nigeria has been closed since last
Thursday, following the continued siege to the plant by local
protesters.
</P>
<P>
The project is Nigeria's largest joint venture jointly invested
by Nigeria's National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell,
Italian group Agip and France's Elf and other major western oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's new civilian government has put high hopes on the
multi- billion-dollar plant in a bid to diversify its too much
reliance on oil export and reduce gas flaring causing severe
environment pollution.

<HEADLINE> HK Exports in August Rise by 4.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports
continued to pick up in August 1999 as shown by the external trade
figures released Tuesday by the Census and Statistics Department (
CSD).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's value of total exports comprising re-exports and
domestic exports in August this year increased by 4.4 percent over
a year earlier to 124.3 billion HK dollars (15.93 billion U.S.
dollars), obtaining a surplus for the first time since January
1998, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman said the further pick-up in
Hong Kong's total exports in August was mainly led by a strong
recovery in demand in East Asia and sustained robust demand in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Exports to China's mainland should have also arrested its
downward trend since April 1998, in line with a distinct rebound
in the mainland's exports lately, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With the further improvement in exports alongside the still
modest absorption of imports, Hong Kong's visible trade account
attained a surplus in August 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 6.7 percent
while the domestic exports decreased by 9.5 percent in August over
a year earlier, according to the CSD figures.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's value of imports in August also increased by 1.7
percent over a year earlier to 121.9 billion HK dollars (15.62
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, for the first eight months of 1999 as a whole, the
value of total exports was lower by 4.4 percent over a year
earlier, according to the CSD figures.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Vows to Restore Peace in Karachi at All Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Tuesday said strikes and rallies will not be allowed
to disturb peace and economic activity in Karachi, the country's
biggest commercial city.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been successful in maintaining peace in the
city and people are now satisfied," he was quoted by the
Associated Press of Pakistan as telling reporters while on a tour
of the southern province of Sindh, where Karachi is located.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the "law breakers" will not realize the
gravity of the situation unless they go out and earn a living on
their own.
</P>
<P>
"They would not have given strike calls if they had been used
to earning bread at their own," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's remarks came at a time when his government
has been facing waves after waves of strikes and rallies in the
port city and the whole Sindh Province during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen opposition parties have formed a grand
opposition alliance and called for strikes and anti-government
rallies in a bid to oust Sharif from his post.
</P>
<P>
They accuse the Sharif government of corruption and failure in
bringing the economy back on track after the nuclear tests last
year.
</P>
<P>
Police have carried out frequent operations to arrest
opposition leaders and workers to forestall those anti-government
rallies and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that in doing so his government's aim is to restore
the old glories of Karachi and maintain peace which is the
prerequisite for the revival of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
"Revival of economic activity will then open up more job
opportunities and weed out frustration from among the masses.
There are infinite advantages if peaceful conditions prevail," he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is a matter of great concern that foreign
governments imposed travel embargoes due to the law and order
situation in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"Actions of politicians are confined to newspapers only whereas
people want peace alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "People want peace, employment and
bread. They have no fourth desire."
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif admitted that it is not an easy task to bring
economic prosperity to a country which faces international
sanctions.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Call Center
Association (CCA), which provides a platform for sharing
experience and disseminating the latest technologies for call
center professionals, was launched here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Henry Ching, branch
director of the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), said call
centers have grown in importance with an increasing focus on front-
line marketing and customer services.
</P>
<P>
"Practitioners of the call center industry must proactively
conduct telemarketing and turn these data into relevant
information for strategic planning by management," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Recent surveys indicated that Asia-Pacific is the fastest
growing call center region in the world, with call center agent
jobs growing from 24,000 in 1993 to 94,000 in 1997, reflecting an
annual increase of 41 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
With administrative support from HKPC, the CCA is a non-profit
association that promotes excellence in three key business areas --
process improvement, people management and technology, according
to Lynda Janas, chairwoman of CCA.
</P>
<P>
Major activities of CCA will include exhibitions, benchmarking
exercises, training programs and industry surveys, she said,
adding that CCA welcomes participants from Hong Kong, as well as
call center practitioners in the vicinity of Macao and south China.

<HEADLINE> Feature: For Golan Settlers, Israeli Withdrawal Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIBBUTZ EN ZIWAN, Golan Heights, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Since
Shsehf Sror bought a supermarket and a cafeteria from the
collective farm Kibbutz on the Golan Heights six months ago, he
has been wondering how long he can keep them.
</P>
<P>
As Israel is warming up for resuming peace talks with Syria,
Sror said he would not be surprised if being told some day to
abandon the kibbutz. "If the government decides to give the Golan
back to Syria for peace, then we will have to leave," Sror said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to give up the Golan if we want to avoid wars
with Syria," said Susan Korda, a cashier in the supermarket.
Korda, who came from Britain and settled down in Golan 12 years
ago, estimated that 90 percent of the 260 members in this kibbutz
share her view.
</P>
<P>
The future of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War, has been the
focus of the on-and-off talks between the two sides since the
Madrid Mideast peace conference in 1991. The latest talks broke
down in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, who swept to power
in the elections in May, has pledged to revive the peace talks on
all tracks, which were largely frozen during the era of his
hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He has also set an ambitious target of reaching a
comprehensive peace with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon next
year.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that no peace can be achieved without a full
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan overlooking a large part of
Israel and Syria. The Mount Hermon at the northern tip is an ideal
base for intelligence gathering and early-warning stations.
</P>
<P>
Besides its strategic importance, the Golan is also famous for
its fertile land and rich water resources. It had been known as
Syria's "grain field" before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Today, the 32 Jewish settlements set up since the end of the
1967 war on the plateau, with a population of 17,000, are among
major suppliers of farm produce in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kibbutz En Ziwan, which has 60 families, is situated merely
two or three kilometers away from the current Israeli-Syrian
border. Large stretches of apple orchards and vineyards surround
houses with courtyards and lawns.
</P>
<P>
In this otherwise idyllic farm, red-and-yellow warning signs
of land mines were erected in roadside fields. Within a stone's
throw is a base of U.N. disengagement forces and the "ghost
village" of Kuneitra, a deserted Syrian village.
</P>
<P>
Built immediately after the 1967 war, En Ziwan was destroyed by
Syrian shelling in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, during which Syria had
at one time regained most of the Heights. Photos hanging on the
wall of the cafeteria depicted a scene of what happened to the
Kibbutz - women and children were being evacuated by buses and
people were rushing to underground bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see my kids going to war again," said Sror,
the father of three. "We fought with Egypt, we fought with Jordan,
now we are at peace with them. So what did we fight for? It's for
nothing."
</P>
<P>
Well established in the Heights, Sror is reluctant to leave. "I
really don not know what I'm going to do after leaving all these
behind," he said, "we all want peace, but the problem is how, how
much we should give back to Syria."
</P>
<P>
He said he would stay as long as possible though he understood
this was not very realistic.
</P>
<P>
Such conflicting mentality is quite popular throughout the
country. A survey on the future of Golan conducted early this year
showed that 73 percent of Israelis were willing to give back none
or only a small portion of the plateau, but 54 percent believed
that Israel would anyhow give the Golan to Syria within the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
In the May election, about 60 percent of the Golan settlers,
traditionally Labor supporters, voted for the dovish Barak.
However, hundreds of them signed a letter to Barak, declaring that
this huge support should not be interpreted as an endorsement for
a withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Golan Regional Council Head Yehuda Wolman
announced that a new Israeli neighborhood of 52 homes would be
built in the region soon, a project approved by the Netanyahu
government,
</P>
<P>
Left-wing politicians criticized the house-building plan as
Israel and Syria are going to the negotiating table, saying it
would turn out to be a "waste of money."
</P>
<P>
Since Barak's election, a considerable number of messages of
peace have been exchanged between Israel and Syria through Jordan,
Europe and the U.S.. But the two sides are at loggerhead over how
the talks should be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Barak has claimed readiness to make "painful" territorial
concession on the Golan Heights, but has been vague on to what
extent.
</P>
<P>
As the Israeli-Palestinian talks back on track, the talks
between Israel and Syria have taken the central stage in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, both Israel and Syria have been
intensifying their diplomacy seeking international support on
their starting positions.
</P>
<P>
In various occasions recently, Barak has expressed belief that
the Israeli-Syrian talks can be revived in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about one year to reach peace agreement," Sror
said, "but we need two or three generations to build peace." The
trauma caused by decades of hostility between the two peoples need
time to heal, he said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The next part of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum will be
implemented this Sunday, with the start of construction on the
Gaza port and the opening of the southern safe passage route,
Palestinian officials said Monday. At this stage, only those
Palestinians with permission to enter Israel will be allowed to
use the safe-passage route, and they will ride on buses between
Erez junction and the Tarkumiya Junction near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister David Levy said Monday that he vehemently
objects to relations with Arab countries becoming conditional on
progress between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at
U.N. headquarters in New York, he cautioned against a scenario, in
 which "bilateral relations will be hostage to the Israel-Syria
track."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A team of Shas rabbis and officials signed an agreement with
the Education Ministry Monday, which guaranteed that teachers in
the religious party's school system will be paid their wages
Tuesday after a three-month wait.
</P>
<P>
The party also inaugurated a new leadership Monday at an
outdoor rally attended by thousands of supporters. Its spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef noticeably lauded his new hand-picked
political leader, Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai,
while strongman Aryeh Deri was pointedly missing.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ezer Weizman expressed personal impatience over
the inactivity of Syrian President Hafez Assad towards the
resumption of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "very disappointed" with Assad, especially over
the Syrian leader's remarks that he is disappointed with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak. Weizman said the time has come "to say it to
his face: you will not make peace this way."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Release Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An unspecific number of Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) are to be released unilaterally by Iran on
Wednesday, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Mohammad Balar, the spokesman and head of the Public
Relations and Publicity Department of POWs Commissions, said that
the Iraqi POWs will be released on the occasion of 100th birth
anniversary of late Iranian spiritual leader Imam Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis will be released in the presence of a red cross
representative.
</P>
<P>
Balar said that 55,438 Iraqi POWs have been released by Iran so
far, including 6,078 unilaterally, while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian
POWs since since 1981. There are still 2,806 Iranian POWs being
kept in Iraqi prisons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors fought a eight-year bloody war from 1980 to
1988, in which some 1 million people from both sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has become one of the major obstacles that
impeded improvement of relations between the two countries.

<P>
CHONGQING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Qijiang County in China's
largest metropolis Chongqing, began building a new bridge today to
replace the Rainbow Bridge that collapsed in January this year,
killing 40 people.
</P>
<P>
The notorious incident also led to six million yuan (720,000 U.
S. dollars) in direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Investigations discovered that the steel bridge, erected by a
private contractor in February 1996, was of inferior quality, and
the accident resulted from official dereliction of duty and
negligent engineering and construction.
</P>
<P>
The Bridge Engineering Bureau under the Ministry of Railways is
building the New Rainbow Bridge, the contract for which it secured
through public bidding on September 26. It is expected to take 13
months complete the 160-meter-long bridge.

<HEADLINE> Safe Corridor to Open Two Days behind Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The southern safe corridor
linking the Gaza Strip and Tarkumia near the West Bank city of
Hebron will be inaugurated Sunday, two days behind schedule due to
the weekend holiday of Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli sources said the opening ceremony might
be preceded by the signing of a protocol on the operation of the
passage.
</P>
<P>
The corridor will be open to all Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, seven days a week, from sunrise to sunset or 10 hours
at the least one day. However, it will be closed three days each
year on the occasion of certain feasts.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, any Palestinian who wants to pass the
corridor can apply to the Palestinian side for a "safe corridor
card." The card, valid between three months to one year, can be
easily renewed.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the "safe corridor card" does not
mean a passport for the holders to enter any Israeli town.
</P>
<P>
For those Palestinians whom Israel guards against for security
reasons, special cards may be issued enabling them to use special
buses running between the West Bank and Gaza three times a week.
</P>
<P>
The opening of passage routes is part of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement signed recently in Egyptian
Red Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the northern safe corridor linking
Gaza and the West Bank town of Ramallah will open to traffic
several months after the operation of the southern corridor.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Backs Off From Howard Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard backed further off from the so-called Howard doctrine
Tuesday amid claims that it had pushed Australia's regional
relations to a new low.
</P>
<P>
Howard had already disputed a magazine article which said he
wanted Australia to be the U.S. deputy in Asia as the regional
policeman.
</P>
<P>
Howard told the ruling coalition's parliamentarians Tuesday
that he had not called his plan for Australia to play a greater
role in regional affairs "the Howard doctrine."
</P>
<P>
"The reference to a doctrine was made by others not by him," a
coalition spokesman said.

<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Monday demanded that
Saudi Arabian government should give proper briefing before
execution of Nigerians according to  Arabic laws.
</P>
<P>
Conferring with the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Nigeria Anwar
Abd-Rabbuh in Abuja, Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister of State,
Dubem Onyia, also sought for greater cooperation by Saudi
authorities with their Nigerian counterparts, in making
participation of the yearly pilgrimage Hajj less cumbersome for
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Tuesday quoted the
minister as saying: "when offences are committed, we will like
prior contact with our government before the full wrath of the
law is brought to bear on our nationals."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to re-organize the way Hajj operations have been
done in the past to make it easier for all parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with the Saudi envoy, who had insisted that those who
come to the country have to play according to the rules, Onyia
pointed out that Nigerian and Saudi officials needed to work more
closely with each other to eliminate present lapses.
</P>
<P>
Abd-Rabbuh had requested for the greater commitment of the
Nigerian government to curbing drug trafficking by pilgrims. He
assured that the kingdom would remain a good ally of Nigeria in
the new democratic dispensation.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Appeals for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar has appealed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank to help reduce or cancel the over 28-billion-U.S.
dollar debt owed by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an investors' forum in Washington, the U.S.,
Abubakar said that this would provide brighter chances for the
country to improve its economy, Nigeria's This Day newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that his country's external debt
burden is too heavy to bear and could remain a deterrence to
growth and development if the creditors refuse to grant it debt
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria's external debt stock stood at 28.49
billion dollars in March this year compared to 28.77 billion
dollars by last December. The debt service ratio is about 40
percent in 1998 and the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar pointed out that principles and maturities in 1999
amounted to 3.15 billion dollars, out of which 1.68 billion
dollars were budgeted for.
</P>
<P>
This had left an unfunded balance of 1.47 billion dollars which
will be added to the arrears, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria is prepared to consider strategies for
reducing its debt burden on the basis of the Naples Terms which
can qualify the country for substantial Net Present Value debt
reduction, a six-year moratorium, and repayment over 23 years.
</P>
<P>
At the investors' forum, IMF Deputy Managing Director
Shigemitsu Sugisaki said that the IMF and Nigeria is scheduled to
have discussion in January next year with the Nigerian government
on the possibility for reducing its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Sugisaki said that by January 2000, Nigeria and IMF must have
concluded a standby arrangement which would set the stage for
negotiations on debt reduction with the international monetary
agencies.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the IMF and the World Bank would help Nigeria
in designing a comprehensive reform program which would include
the development and full liberalization of the nation's foreign
exchange system.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official noted that Nigerians had the capacity to turn
their economy around, adding that the abundant resources in the
west African country could not be developed due to frustrations
created by bureaucracy and government intervention and
manipulations.

<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday urged indigenous scientific inventors to
inculcate the culture of standard engineering design and
practices into their operations, to ensure speedy technological
growth of the country.
</P>
<P>
Represented by Science and Technology Minister, Chief Ebitimi
Banigo, at the first National Conference on Engineering Design,
Abuja, Obasanjo said proper engineering design was an important
tool for national economic development, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper Tuesday.
</P>

Bemoaning the people's attitude towards made-in-Nigeria
automotive parts, Obasanjo emphasized that the country could not
continue to live under the stigma of inferior quality for
products emanating from the nation' s small and medium scale
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government, according to him, believed firmly that it was
only through strict adherence to design specifications in
manufacturing that made-in- Nigeria goods would appeal to the
people.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, asked local engineers and investors to take up
the challenge of ensuring the country's rapid technological
advancement.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Science and Technology, Mrs. Pauline
Tallen, explained the objective of the conference which is to
include identifying and assessing the current level of
engineering design capability and practice in the country and to
prepare a blueprint for fostering engineering design as a tool
for national economic growth.

GENEVA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More than two million people
of all ages will stage a "walkathon" worldwide on October 2 as the
World Health Organization (WHO) launches a global movement for
active aging.
</P>
<P>
The million-walk will be the biggest health promotion event in
history by and for older people in more than 1,500 cities in 86
countries, the United Nations health agency announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The walk, known as the Global Embrace, also celebrates the UN
1999 International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
Active aging is WHO's response to the rapidly growing number of
men and women over 60 in the world's population. There are now
about 590 million older people, according to WHO estimates. In
just 25 years, that number will double to 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
By active aging, WHO refers to the process of seizing and
optimizing opportunities for physical, social and mental well-
being throughout the entire life in order to extend life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The global walk will follow the rising sun from Fiji, New
Zealand and New Caledonia, and continue non-stop through more than
1,500 large cities and small towns in Australia, Japan, China, the
Philippines, India, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas, and
end once again in the Pacific, according to the WHO schedule.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Terrorism Opens in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Symposium on
International Terrorism was inaugurated Tuesday in Colombo, the
capital of Sri Lanka, amid tight security for fears of Tamil
rebels' sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, held under the auspices of the
International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), has been
shrouded in secrecy in Sri Lanka which has been plagued by a
16-year-old civil war between government troops and the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
There were few reports about the symposium in the local media
and even the venue of the symposium is not known to the public
until Tuesday due to security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will focus on the financing of international
terrorism, the biggest concern for countries like Sri Lanka which
sees LTTE's overseas funding prolong the disastrous civil war.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's acting Minister of Defense Gen. Anuruddha Ratwatte
told the inauguration ceremony, "The government of Sri Lanka has
made a strong commitment toward combating and suppressing this
scourge of terrorism which is taking a heavy toll of the lives of
thousands of innocent men, women and children in almost every
corner of the globe."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983, has been branded by the
government as a terrorist organization and was banned at home as
well as in India, Malaysia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE's complex overseas fund-raising network has
enabled it to survive the government's economic sanctions and
successive military offensives and has been the headache of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte said that combating international terrorism requires a
concerted global effort. "No state however strong could by itself
deal effectively with combating terrorism, given the international
dimensions of this phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
The symposium is attended by 72 experts from different police
agencies of 37 countries and regions, including Canada, China,
China's Hong Kong, France, Germany, Sri Lanka, the United States
and Britain. Several international organizations are invited to
the symposium.

<HEADLINE> FAO Urges Africa to eradicate Cattle Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Africa must eradicate cattle
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and east coast fever (corridor
disease) so as to ensure livestock growth and sustainable
development, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international workshop in Lusaka on monitoring the
corridor disease in Africa on Monday, FAO country representative
Gana Diagne said cattle diseases in the region have had a negative
impact on the development of the agricultural sector as cattle was
the major source of animal draught power.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, the post, Tuesday quoted Diagne as saying
there was urgent need for researchers and scientists to find
methods of combating the diseases if agriculture was to improve.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which has drawn researchers and scientists from
east and central Africa, southern Africa, America, Austria and
Sweden, is aimed at sensitizing researchers to use serological
tests.
</P>
<P>
Diagne said monitoring of the disease using enzyme immunoassays
was being promoted by FAO.
</P>
<P>
He said the international Atomic Energy Agency was capable of
detecting clinically infected animals and is currently being used
in some parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Low Prices Force Tobacco Sales Closed in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- All the three tobacco auction
floors in Malawi have been closed with growers grumbling about the
decline in prices, Zambian newspaper, The Post, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Prices are going down at a time when the cost of production is
rising," Malawian Agriculture Minister Aleke Banda was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed this mainly to lack of buyer
competition at the close of the selling season on September 10
when burley fetched as low as 0.5 U.S. dollars per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Sales opened in April with prices averaging over 15 percent
higher than last year's. The highest price was pegged at almost
2.25 U.S. dollars per kilogram, while the lowest was at slightly
over one dollar per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commercial banks are reluctant also to provide input
loans. For the past three years, farmers have failed to produce
enough and meet the buyers' demands due to increases in the price
of agricultural inputs.
</P>
<P>
In all, a total of 125 million kilograms of tobacco worth about
200 million dollars have been sold at the three floors, far below
the buyers total requirement of 180 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The fact that tobacco prices are getting increasingly lower is
not exactly accidental, the Zambian newspaper noted. There are
world-wide forces against tobacco's prosperity, and the tobacco
market is projected to keep shrinking.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is one of the world's biggest exporters of burley
tobacco. It also produces five other types of tobacco including
flue cured and dark fire cured, which are sold to more than 70
countries.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has started its own drive to reduce over-dependence on
tobacco. The crop accounts for 70 percent of the country's
foreign earnings, and about 1.5 million Malawians eke their
livelihoods from the industry.

The five-man committee had been set up by the Lagos State House of
Assembly to investigate allegations of forgery and perjury
levelled against the state governor.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

government in its quest to retrieve such monies.

The Post Express:

<HEADLINE> China Indignant at Anti-China U.S. Defense Act: FM Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua)-- China is intensely indignant
at and strongly opposes the anti-China U.S. Defense Authorization
Act, said Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Fiscal Year Defense Authorization Act, which was
passed recently by the U.S. Congress, contains many anti-China
clauses proposed by a small number of congressmen, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's routine press conference, Zhang described
the act as attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs and
impair Sino-U.S. relationship by making use of such issues as
Taiwan, China's construction for national defense, Sino-U.S.
scientific exchange, the alleged China "espionage case" and non-
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
It needs to be pointed out, said Zhang, that once the clauses
become law, they will severely harm the exchange and cooperation
between the two countries in many fields, and poison bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side demands that the U.S. administration fully
realize the disastrous and damaging nature and bad impact of the
act, and from the overall interest of the Sino-U.S. relations,
take immediate and effective measures to prevent it from becoming
law, in order not to set any new obstacles for the improvement and
development of Sino-U.S. ties, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Stability in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed the
hope that the stability in East Timor will be restored according
to relevant United Nations resolution, and it will make a
contribution to maintaining peace and stability there within the U.
N. framework.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the remarks at a
press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government has been concerned about
the situation in East Timor, adding that the United Nations
Security Council passed a resolution on September 15 which
authorizes a multi-national peace-keeping troop to enter East
Timor based on humanitarian consideration.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that China believes that it is not
appropriate for the human rights commission to convene a special
meeting on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Further more, it will not help settle the issue if a human
rights resolution on East Timor is passed through consultations by
different countries concerned, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
She said that China, together with other Asian countries, voted
against a motion that the U.N. would establish an international
investigation into human rights violations in East Timor.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Violence broke out in the
Pakistani city of Dera Ismail Khan, some 300 kilometers south of
Islamabad, after the killing of a senior leader of a Shiite group
in a terrorist attack on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen shot dead Secretary General of Shiite
Tehreek-e-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) Khurshid Anwar, whose daughter and
bodyguard in the same car were also killed. Anwar's wife was
injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Tension gripped the town and angry TJP activists took to the
streets and burned six shops of the rival Sunni Sipah-e-Sahaba.
They set tires on fire and blocked roads, according to sources
from the town.
</P>
<P>
The local civil administration called out paramilitary troops
in a bid to control the situation, sealing off the city and
putting the neighboring districts on alert. Many people closed
their shops after receiving the news of the killing.
</P>
<P>
The divisional president of TJP, Ghulam Abbas, has accused
three Sipah-e-Sahaba leaders of involvement in the case.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from Sipah-e-Sahaba. The two
groups usually accuse each other of killings their respective
activists.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dera Ismail Khan has been in tension after the
local administration banned the entry of Sipah-e-Sahaba leader
Maulana Azam Tariq, who was scheduled to address an Islamic
conference last month. A worker of the group was killed when
unknown persons opened fire on the group's procession against the
ban on the entry of Tariq in the city.

<HEADLINE> Israel Still Occupies Egyptian Land: Egyptian Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is preparing for a fresh
diplomatic battle with Israel to "restore the last bit of land the
Jewish state has continued to occupy since 1949," the Egyptian
Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the prevalent conclusion, Taba, a town close to the
border with Israel, "was not the last piece of land" Egypt has
recovered from Israel, "as Israel is still occupying Om i-Rashrash
area west of (Israel's) Eilat Port," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel handed over Taba to Egypt in 1988 after the countries
solved their disputes through international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has formed a special negotiation team to pursue the
uphill task of claiming this piece of land after a special expert
committee had found historical evidences supporting Egypt's right
to the claim, the English-language paper added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has assigned an American team to look into
the issue, a move which the newspaper said clearly indicated
Israel's desire to get Washington involved.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government paper accused Israel of trying to package
Egypt's claim as casus belli after the Jewish state failed to
respond to the historical evidences which the paper said affirm
beyond doubt that Om i-Rashrash belongs to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Salah Selim, a strategic studies professor at
Nasser Military Academy, as saying that the triangle of Om
i-Rashrash was under Egyptian sovereignty according to
Egyptian-Palestinian border arrangements before the British
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied this piece of land in the 1948 Arab-Israeli
war, the paper said without specifying its area.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Praises Australian Economic Strength: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan had singled out Australia for praise over
the way it weathered the Asian economic downturn, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made the comments during a speech to the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I had a look at Dr. Greenspan's remarks," Howard told the
parliament. "They are always worth reading."
</P>
<P>
"Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, the
Australian economy exhibited few signs of the contagion from
contiguous economies arguably because Australia already had well
developed capital markets as well as a sturdy banking system,"
Howard quoted Greenspan as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Greenspan's comments should be highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
"It has now been recognized at the highest economic level in
the world what a strong, robust, well-run, well-regulated economy
is Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also mentioned the former Labor government of Bob Hawke
as contributing to that strength.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared on this occasion ... to give the Hawke
government in particular credit for some of the steps that it
took in relation to the Australian financial system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But since we came to office ... the government has taken a
large number of steps to further strengthen the Australian banking
and financial system," he added.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Ministry of
Environment has won the World Health Organization's World No
Tobacco Day 1999 Medal for its contribution to smoking control in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the International Consultation on
Tobacco and Youth held here Tuesday, WHO presented this year's
World No Tobacco Day Medal to the ministry that has progressively
made more public places smoke-free over the past 30 years through
the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act.
</P>
<P>
A citation says the ministry is honored with this medal
"because of the strong support for three decades from the Ministry
of the Environment in Singapore for well-enforced legislative
measures enabling smoke-free environments and the protection of
the health of non-smokers."
</P>
<P>
Singapore introduced the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain
Places) Act in 1970 to encourage smokers to kick the deadly habit
and protect non-smokers from the hazardous cigarette smoke and the
government has continued to publicize the need for tobacco control
over the years.
</P>
<P>
The International consultation on Tobacco and Youth, the first-
ever convened, is jointly held by the Singapore Cancer Society,
the Singapore Ministry of Health and WHO to highlight the
effective approaches and interventions for prevention and
reduction of tobacco use among children and adolescents.

MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Long Distance
Telephone corporation (PLDT), the country's leading fixed-line
telephone company, signed Tuesday a formal agreement to acquire
Smart Communications, the country's leading cellular phone
company.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Pangilinan, PLDT's president and CEO, said in a
statement that the PLDT will acquire Smart by issuing 35.1 million
new common shares to Smart's shareholders at a value of 37.9
billion pesos (947.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The enlarged PLDT -- combining its own activities with those of
the Pilipino Telephone Corporation subsidiary and Smart -- will
initially have more than 1.85 million fixed-line customers and
approximately 1.34 million cellular phone customers.
</P>
<P>
Pangilinan said, "These transactions reflect the consolidation
in the worldwide telecommunications industry and will create a
stronger, more efficient PLDT."
</P>
<P>
The transactions will enable the PLDT to offer
fully-integrated, high-quality telecommunications services,
ranging from traditional fixed line and cellular phone networks to
high-technology Internet access, Pangilinan said.
</P>
<P>
He said they will also lead to significant cost savings by
combining overlapping operations in such areas as marketing,
information technology and customer service.

CANBERRA -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had
singled out Australia for praise over the way it weathered the
Asian economic downturn, Australian Prime Minister John Howard
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made the comments during a speech to the World Bank/
International Monetary Fund meetings this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, the
Australian economy exhibited few signs of the contagion from
contiguous economies arguably because Australia already had well
developed capital markets as well as a sturdy banking system,"
Howard quoted Greenspan as saying. (Australia-Economy)

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Rules out Amending Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- President Hosni Mubarak has
ruled out any imminent amendments of the constitution as called
for by the opposition, the Al Gomhuria newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think of any change in the constitution because I am
keen on the stability of the country," Mubarak said in an
exclusive interview on Monday with Al Gomhuria Chief Editor Samir
Ragab.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that he "will never allow" national stability to
"be shaken."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's words came one day after a national referendum
confirmed his fourth, six-year term in office. Some 80 percent of
Egypt's 24 million eligible voters went to the polls on Sunday and
gave the 71-year-old incumbent president 94 percent "Yes" vote.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to be sworn in on October 5 when the
parliament, the People's Assembly, convenes an extraordinary
session.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was the only candidate in the yes-or-no vote. Many
opposition parties called for a boycott, charging that the
referendum for the president is a sham. They asked Mubarak to
change the constitution to allow direct, multi-candidate
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian president reiterated that one of his
main occupations is to exert efforts to improve the living
standards of the limited-income classes.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tough responsibility. But I have pledged not to give
up my duty," Mubarak told Al Gomhuria, one of Egypt's major
pro-government newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to create more jobs for the country's young
people during his new term. "Youth will be at the center during
the next stage because they are the nation's mainstay in the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's unemployment rate is officially put at around 10
percent. More than 500,000 youngsters are estimated to enter the
labor market each year for the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak became president in 1981 after the assassination of the
former president, Anwar Sadat, by Islamic radicals. He was
re-elected in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
He has been highly respected internationally due to his efforts
to push forward the peace process with Israel. He has carried out
a privatization program, which has helped Egypt maintain one of
the best economic performances in the Middle East.

<P>
YINCHUAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Improvements in the
irrigation system have spurred the economic growth of northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The central government has invested more than one billion yuan
in building and upgrading Ningxia's irrigation works since New
China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The region's farmland acreage has been increased to 400,000
hectares from only 128,000 hectares in 1949. The Qingtongxia water-
control project alone has added 113,000 hectares of irrigated
farmland to Ningxia's total.
</P>
<P>
This brought about a 12.2-fold increase in the region's grain
output, which reached more than two billion kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
And over the past 50 years, the per hectare rice output has
risen to 9,000 kilograms from 3,000 kilograms, and wheat, from 735
kilograms to 6,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has vowed to become an important agricultural and
sideline-commodities production base by boosting its pillar
industries including grain, animal husbandry, wine, biological
pharmaceuticals, and fruits and vegetables, authorities note.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, farmland acreage will reach 670,000
hectares, they say.

WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Disgraced figure skater
Tonya Harding, who is serving a life-time ban from the Olympics
following an attack incident on her American compatriot Nancy
Kerrigan, will re-start her career in professional competition
next month.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old will compete in ESPN's Professional Skating
Championships on October 18, her first event since her ban after
the attack on her rival before the 1994 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The ESPN event in Huntington, West Virginia, is exclusively for
professional skaters who are ineligible for Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
Harding, who coaches about 15 young skaters at a Portland,
Oregon, skating club, has been training daily on her own for
several months.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Kerrigan came before the U.S. National
championships that were to decide the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.
Kerrigan was attacked by Harding's then husband and an associate
of his.
</P>
<P>
Harding went on to win the nationals but eventually was
stripped of her title and subsequently banned for life on charges
of hindering investigation.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor to Cost Australia 500 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The East Timor crisis would
cost Australia at least 500 million Australian dollars (330
million U.S. dollars) by next July and the final cost is unknown,
Defense Minister John Moore said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moore told a defense conference at the Parliament House that no
effort has been spared to give Australian troops all they need to
restore security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The final cost of the commitment cannot be known," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"But we estimate that between now and the end of this financial
year it will be at least 500 million Australian dollars, with more
needed to sustain and to reconstitute our ground forces," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Australian troops are leading a multinational force to restore
order in the territory following last month's vote for
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the multinational force would be followed by another
U.N. peacekeeping operation, hopefully within a year, to see East
Timor through to full independence.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard later told the parliament
the 500 million Australian dollars would cover 2,000 Australian
troops in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I should point out that the 500 million Australian dollars was
based on a deployment of 2,000 for a period of six months or so,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it turns out to be more than that, the figure could be
significantly higher," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Cabinet to Say No to Honor Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Human rights and pressure
groups in Jordan are making progress in their campaign against
honor killings as the Cabinet has agreed to cancel penal code
clauses that pardons or reduces the penalties against the crime in
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh,
during a closed-door meeting last weekend, approved a
recommendation by the Justice Ministry to abolish Article 340 in
the Penal Code, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The article included two clauses that either pardons or hands
down minor prison terms for men who kills their wives or female
relatives for actual or suspected illicit relationship with man
out of the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
The government said the decision to amend the penal code will
be presented to the parliament for approval during its next
ordinary session in November.
</P>
<P>
Campaigns to remove article 340 were getting more public
attention in the kingdom where dozens of young women were killed
by their husbands, brothers or fathers in the name of honor. At
least 14 Jordanian women died in honor killings this year.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists have garnered at least 8,000 signatures
during the first months of a national campaign to abolish Article
340, which they said seriously discriminated against the rights of
women.
</P>
<P>
If Article 340 is finally eliminated, alleged honor killers
might face death sentences. Currently they are either pardoned or
received lenient sentences ranging from three months to two years
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Greek Shipper to Compensate for Pollution Off California Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Greek operator of a
Liberian-flagged tanker, which left a large oil spill off
California coast last year, has agreed to pay 9.4 million U.S.
dollars to settle criminal charges, according to reports from San
Francisco Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ship's captain, Dimitrios Georgantas, also accepted a three-
year probation during which he will be barred from any ship
calling at any U.S. port, U.S. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller said Georgantas disobeyed U.S.
Coast Guard orders and directed his crew to transfer oil into a
faulty tank -- a process which resulted in an estimated 3,000
gallons of oil spilling into the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Instead of informing the Coast Guard, as required by U.S. law,
Georgantas told his crew to keep quiet about the spill and
continued his tour toward South America, leaving behind a 24 km
long oil slick that fouled beaches south of San Francisco with
dead birds.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard teams tracked the spill and eventually boarded
the tanker about 320 km west of Guatemala, finding a ruptured fuel
tank that they determined to be the spill's source.
</P>
<P>
"The coasts of California are a precious resource. Those who
criminally pollute that resource will be prosecuted criminally,"
Mueller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Georgantas issued a statement of apology through his lawyer.
Under the plea agreement, which must still be approved by a judge,
charges against the ship's owner, Pearl Shipping Corp. of Liberia,
were dropped.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Finance Initiatives for Helping Indebted Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund and its members Monday reached an agreement on financing the
Initiatives of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), the IMF told a
news conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the main elements of the financing package
will enable the IMF to make its contribution to the HIPC
Initiative and to continue concessional lending for sustainable
growth and poverty reduction in its low-income member countries,
according to IMF.
</P>
<P>
The main elements of the financing package, amounting to 3.9
billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on an "as needed" basis (3.5
billion dollars in end-1998 net present value terms), comprise
contributions by member countries and by the IMF itself, said the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
The financing of the cost of the HIPC Initiative to the IMF is
projected to account for about two thirds of the IMF's total
financing requirement.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral pledges amount to about 1.5 billion SDRs "as needed"
and come from a wide cross-section of the IMF's membership,
demonstrating the broad support for the HIPC and ESAF initiatives,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial countries as well as a large number of developing
countries, including some low-income countries that have had ESAF-
supported programs in the past, have also made pledges to the ESAF-
HIPC Trust.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's own contributions will amount to about 2.4 billion
SDRs "as needed."
</P>
<P>
The bulk of this will come from the investment income on the
profits from off-market transactions in gold of up to 14 million
ounces, estimated to provide about 1.8 billion SDRs "as needed."
</P>
<P>
The IMF will also contribute about 0.6 billion SDRs "as needed"
by foregoing compensation for the cost of administrative expenses
related to ESAF operations through 2004.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia: Developing Countries' Interests Need to Be Protected at WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday it
wants to see the interests of developing countries protected
during negotiations in areas such as services at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that the General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS) pays due consideration to the developing countries,"
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when
officiating at an international workshop on "WTO and
Liberalization of World Trade in Services" here.
</P>
<P>
He said development of new disciplines on emergency safeguards
was crucial whereby liberalization in the WTO takes into account
national policy objectives and the level of development of
individual members, and that this would be of utmost priority to
developing countries in the light of the trend towards increasing
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which has often taken the lead in trying to prevent
the WTO from becoming a tool to prise open markets of developing
countries, will at Seattle like to see the development of these
new disciplines on emergency safeguards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that within the GATS negotiations and the WTO in
general, the voice of the developing countries is either seldom
heard or never in unison, Abdullah said Malaysia would at the
meeting also call for the development of sectoral guidelines on
domestic regulations relating to qualifications and procedures,
technical standards and licensing requirements for professional
services.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to recognizing educational qualifications, for
example, developing countries are once again at a disadvantage, he
said, adding the limited recognition accorded to qualifications
and experience gained in developing countries have hindered the
progress of these countries' service providers ability to gain
market access abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that an economy might not be able to handle a sudden
influx of foreign service providers and that such a saturation
might adversely affect a country's economic policy objectives. "In
such an instance, developing countries must be allowed to protect
its economic interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is an inherent desire on the part of developing countries
to stay out of the process of liberalization to strengthen their
economic sectors so that they could play an equitable part in
world trade and so that globalization would have a more tangible
effect on the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia sees no reason to hold back on the liberalization of
certain sectors as it is now calling for better market access in
various service sectors including professional services,
education, consultancy, health services, construction and tourism,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the developed countries will place as much
stress on these sectors as we have on financial services and
telecommunications. For instance, even in these areas where the
developing countries currently have a competitive advantage,
Malaysia is preparing for liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing consolidation of the Malaysian financial sector and
the continued development of its telecommunication firms indicate
that Malaysia is strengthening its domestic capacity in line with
eventual liberalization, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia does not favor rushing into a new round of
multilateral trade discussions at the WTO as it might lead to
agreements concerning three issues which are of great concern to
Malaysia and the developing nations, namely, investment,
competition policies and government procurement.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia made its position clear that it favors transparency
but not market access, he said.

<HEADLINE> Biman Carries 40 Pct Int'l Traffic to, From Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's national airline,
the Biman, is now carrying only about 40 percent of the total
international traffic (about 2 million passengers) to and from
Bangladesh, The Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scenario was the other way round eight years ago and the
declining market share of the Biman is taxing the nation's foreign
currency basket quite shockingly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 900 million U.S. dollars worth of business - both
passengers and cargo - goes to foreign carriers, and the amount
almost equals the net retention of the country's biggest export
earner, the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Aviation sources were quoted as saying that half of the money
could be saved if the Biman or other Bangladeshi airlines (the
latter were not allowed to operate internationally) could make use
of the captive market.
</P>
<P>
But private airlines were not allowed to operate international
flights "to protect the national carrier," according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral air services agreement with foreign countries have,
in more case than not, failed to protect national interests in
granting traffic rights to foreign carriers, as the Biman has
failed to make use of its rightful share, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If the Biman could retain even 50 percent of the market share,
the country could be retaining at least 300 million dollars every
year in passenger and cargo revenue, more than five times the
entire tea exports (around 58 million dollars) of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The business is there, but we are not allowed to entry," a
local entrepreneur said.
</P>
<P>
"If foreign carriers are allowed to carry more passengers than
the Biman itself, then why should not the Biman and other domestic
carriers be part of the same team for Bangladesh and equalize the
score," he asked.
</P>
<P>
The Biman, as the designated airline of Bangladesh, has had a
much greater share granted by the bilateral air services
agreement, but inefficiency, corruption and lack of resources may
have handicapped the national airline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Biman simply cannot operate 30 flights a week
granted by the air services agreement with India on two routes
because of lacking enough aircraft to make so many flights, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes News Measures to Reform State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to allow about 30 percent of the state-owned enterprises
of the country to sell, lease, transfer or entrust their
businesses in an effort to speed up their shift to profitability,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to make such enterprises more attractive
to potential investors by clarifying their legal status, according
to a Vietnamese government's decree that went into effect last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
It applies to the following state-run businesses: financially
independent enterprises, member enterprises of corporations with
total capital of less than 1 billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (about
72,000 U.S. dollars), and enterprises with state-allotted capital
of from 1 billion VND to 5 billion VND (360,000 U.S. dollars) that
have been unprofitable for a long time but have not yet gone
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations could apply to as many as 900 of Vietnam's
3,000 state-owned enterprises and up to 35 percent of such
businesses in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
The decree of the Vietnamese government also stipulates that
those who have the right to buy a state-owned enterprise include
individual or worker collectives and businesses of any economic
sector excluding foreign-invested ones.
</P>
<P>
It also applies to Vietnamese citizens who are able by law to
set up or manage a business.
</P>
<P>
As for leasing, the decree states that the leaseholder can
either lease the whole state-owned business or only its property.
</P>
<P>
All measures are designed to ensure that the new business is
financially "healthy", Vietnam News quoted the local newspaper
Nguoi Lao Dong (Laborer) as saying.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Has Two Million Slum People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- As the slum people in the
capital of Bangladesh has now moved up to 2 million, experts here
stress the need for taking some effective measures to maintain the
healthy environment of the city.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by eminent urban expert Dr. Nazrul Islam and
sponsored by the government and the Asian Development Bank
detected three thousand and seven slums in the city area and found
fifty percent of those slums on private lands and under private
ownership.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published on Tuesday by The New Nation,
the study was initiated in 1996 and in the meantime the number of
slums have increased. The city population was enumerated at 6
million at that time and the study earmarked 1.5 million people as
slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Dr. Nazrul Islam indicated that the slum population
has now moved up to 2 million and the number of slums have also
increased.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the land tenancy policy in the country
upholds and ensures private ownership in land and as such,
evicting slum dwellers from the lands under private ownership will
be difficult. Besides, the development of the city as well as the
maintenance of its healthy environment will require some effective
measures to either evict and rehabilitate slum dwellers in order
to recover government and semi-government land or search for
alternative lands to facilitate development works.
</P>
<P>
Planned development of the city will also need some policy that
will help smooth supply of labor for development works and
productive activities within the city and reasonable dwelling
places for the working people, the report added.

<HEADLINE> World Financial Agencies Urged to Shift Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister
Xiang Huaicheng urged here Monday multilateral development
institutions to shift their focus and improve the overall world
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Their focus should be shifted from emergency assistance to
lessons-learning, consolidation of world economy and making a long-
term development agenda, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 60th meeting of the Development Committee of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Xiang
said that social policy, governance and institutional building are
undoubtedly essential to development and crisis prevention, but
the depth and breadth of these themes extend far beyond economic
development and crisis control.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the multilateral development institutions in
these fields, Xiang said they are encouraged to put more emphasis
on experience dissemination without imposing a straight-jacket of
any kind on its support for institutional building in developing
countries based on their own specific situations.
</P>
<P>
"The social and institutional development in each county is
subject to the particular stage of its economic development, as
well as values, culture and tradition," he said, "Therefore, no
standardized social and structural model will work."
</P>
<P>
The experience of developed countries in terms of social and
institutional evolution can be of important relevance to
developing countries, but they should not be regarded as an
international standard that can be universally applied to all
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister urged multilateral agencies to put more
emphasis on exploring appropriate processes, rather than on
expediency.
</P>
<P>
They should study and disseminate experience and lessons
learned from developed countries in such a process, and good
practice from developing countries as well, so that developing
countries can adopt the most suitable approaches and improve
social and structural systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The institutions are also urged to put more emphasis on getting
things done rather than mere deliberations.
</P>
<P>
"Increased concessional resources should be provided to
developing countries to meet their needs in their endeavor to
solve social problems," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
On international trade, Xiang said he welcomes the involvement
of the World Bank to provide developing countries with
intellectual supporting services in the new round of multilateral
trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We also encourage the bank to help developing countries in
risk management during trade liberalization through well-targeted
services," he said.
</P>
<P>
On poverty reduction and debt relief for poor countries, the
Chinese minister said the institutions should focus their efforts
on economic growth in developing countries through resource
transfers and the redistribution of production factors in favor of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries have their obligation to increase official
development assistance aimed at poverty reduction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xiang expressed his hope that major developed countries would
demonstrate their political willingness by promptly putting in
place additional financial resources required for the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

<HEADLINE> Work on Second Yangtze River Bridge Proceeds Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 28 (Xinhua)-- The four-year construction of
the Second Yangtze River Bridge is going on smoothly in Nanjing,
the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, according to
information provided by bridge-construction headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is situated 11 km downstream from the world-famous
Nanjing Bridge and connects with Baguazhou Island, the third-
largest island on the Yangtze. Thus far, half the total budget of
3.19 billion yuan (384 million U.S. dollars) has been spent on the
project.
</P>
<P>
The 21.197 km new bridge includes the Beicha and Nancha bridges.
The Nancha Bridge, 2.958 km long, is a cable-stayed bridge with a
main span of 628 meters, the longest of its kind in China, and the
Beicha Bridge is a 2.212-km pre-stressed concrete structure.
</P>
<P>
The new bridge, or the No.2 Yangtze Bridge at Nanjing, has a
road surface of 32 meters, and is 33.5 meters at its bed, with six
lanes designed for speeds up to 100 km per hour. It is scheduled
for completion by July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is expected to help ease the traffic jam on the
existing Nanjing Bridge and help the economic development of
Jiangsu and neighboring provinces.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows in Nepal in 1998 is estimated to remain much below
the 1997 level, according to a world investment report.
</P>
<P>

FDI in Nepal had gradually increased from four million dollars
in 1993 to six, five, 19, and 23 million dollars in 1994, 1995,
1996 and 1997 respectively. The average of FDI inflow for Nepal
from 1987 to 1992 was two million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the FDI rose by almost 40 percent to over 640 billion
U.S. dollars in the whole world last year.
</P>
<P>
The FDI inflow in 44 least developed countries of the world in
1998 increased to 2,948 million dollars, 468 million dollars
higher than the previous year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The FDI among the least developed countries from South, East
and Southeast Asia however went down by 28 million dollars to 558
million dollars from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FDI in South, East, and Southeast Asia also went down
significantly from 87,835 million dollars in 1997 to 77,277
million dollars in 1998. This figure is even less than 79,397
million dollars of 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Urges IAEA to Help Curb Nuclear Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to continue
with its efforts to make certain countries sign international
treaties on nuclear proliferation prevention.
</P>
<P>
At the opening here Monday of the 43rd annual conference of the
United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Zhang Huazhu, chairman of
the China Atomic Energy Authority, said that it goes against the
trend of peace and development for some countries to continue
developing nuclear weapons and refuse joining the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA should push those countries to sign the treaties as
soon as possible and to take concrete measures in easing tension,
not only for the sake of regional and global peace and security
but also for the sake of their own benefit.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said that the IAEA should continue to support the
development of nuclear power generation so as to reduce the
greenhouse gas emission.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA meeting will end on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Inter-country Meeting on Leprosy Elimination Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An inter-country meeting of
national program managers for leprosy elimination is being held
here to find ways and means to reach the global goal of
eliminating the disease by the year 2000 and to expedite work in
drawing projects for 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, which began Monday, is attended by
leprosy elimination project managers of nine Southeast Asian
countries, delegates of international non-governmental
organizations (NGO) including those of the Netherlands, the
United States and Japan as well as representatives of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Headquarters in Geneva and WHO Southeast
Asia region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Myanmar Health Minister Major-General
Ket Sein said there is a marked reduction of registered prevalence
rate in Myanmar as well as other countries with the detection of
new cases and putting them under Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT), leading
to total "cure".
</P>
<P>
With every country accelerating their activities to achieve
goals of leprosy elimination, the leprosy prevalence rate of most
countries is approaching 1 per 10,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Myanmar is prepared to conduct national
leprosy eradication campaign activities in coming October and
November.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is said to be one of the countries in which leprosy is
endemic. The country initiated leprosy control project activities
in 1951 which were gradually expanded to cover all townships in
1969.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WHO and the UNICEF provided assistance for the
implementation of the program from 1956 to 1982 and international
NGOs also extended help in strengthening the manpower from 1967 to
1976.
</P>
<P>
With the recommendation of WHO, MDT was started in 1988 and 100
percent MDT coverage was achieved at the end of 1995 for the whole
 country.
</P>
<P>
Although leprosy is still endemic in Myanmar, every effort is
being made to implement and provide an integrated MDT service to
reach the global goal of leprosy elimination by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Party Secretary Speaks About Poverty-Relief In Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- In the early 1970s, Premier
Zhou Enlai felt so sorry when he heard a report on poverty in
Gansu Province that he was in tears.
</P>
<P>
But the average per capita income of farmers there has gone
from 50 yuan (6 U.S. dollars) in 1949 to 1,393 yuan in 1998 and
more than 10 million farmers have solved the basic food and
clothing problem in the past 17 years, according to Sun Ying, the
Party secretary of this northwestern Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
Sun cites the reforms and opening up policy initiated in the
late 1970s and Party and State leaders' concern for Gansu as the
main reasons for this change.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is a land-locked, arid region that has historically been
one of the country's largest poor provinces. The number of poor
farmers with an annual per capita income of less than 200 yuan was
12.54 million 17 years ago, or 74.83 percent of the province's
rural population.
</P>
<P>
The State has spent heavily on poverty-relief work in the
province's 20 counties in the central part and 19 counties in the
Hexi Corridor since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Hexi Corridor has now become one of China's key grain
production areas and the poor and backward situation in central
Gansu has changed remarkably. The number of impoverished people
went from 12.54 million in 1982 to 1.76 million by the end of 1998
and farmers' annual average per capita income in 53 counties
increased 13.7 percent while per capita grain share climbed from
257 kg. in 1982 to 327 kg. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sun explains that the relocation of more than 540,000 people
and labor service outside the province have helped the poverty-
relief efforts.

VIENNA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Country's basket of seven
crudes remained at a high of 22.3 U.S. dollars per barrel last
week, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The oil Cartel's average oil price over the week was basically
on a par with the previous week's average of 22.31 U.S. dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Since OPEC oil ministers reached an agreement to cut production
to shore up prices in March, the organization's average oil price
has more than doubled, exceeding its benchmark price of 21 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
On September 22, the OPEC oil ministers decided that the daily
oil production ceilings imposed on its member countries will
continue to be implemented until the end of March next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that oil prices on the international oil
market will continue to soar in the winter of this year, to an
expected high of 25 to 28 U.S. dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Contribute 1,500 Troops for Peacekeeping Force in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has finally agreed
to send 1,500 troops to East Timor, Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The final decision came after a meeting, on Monday, between
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, also defense minister, and the
military top brass led by gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit, supreme
commander of the Thai armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a slight drop from 1,778 troops
originally planned. It was reported that Chuan wanted to send only
as many as necessary to join the international peacekeeping force
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Mongkol was quoted as saying on Monday that the government
would initially shoulder the expenses for the Thai contingent
estimated at about 100 million baht (2.5 million U.S. dollars) a
month. Thailand would be reimbursed later by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Thai troops were not going to East Timor to kill or harm
anyone, but to secure communication lines, to help East Timorese
in their reconstruction work, and to restore law and order, Gen.
Mongkol said.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 33 Thai soldiers left for Darwin of
Australia to join an advance multinational peacekeeping force in
East Timor. The second batch of 300 Thai combat soldiers will
leave Bangkok this Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai troops are to be based in Baucau, East Timor's second
largest city after the capital Dili.

<HEADLINE> 900,000 Indonesian Youths Abuse Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse is currently
affecting at least 900,000 members of Indonesia's youth, said Maj.
Gen. Hadiman, president of the Social Cooperation Agency for
Promoting Noble Citizens (Bersama Indonesia).
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 70 percent of 1.3 million known cases
from the age group of 12 to 55.
</P>
<P>
"Practically every social level, age group, broken and happy
family have been affected," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said drug distribution points in Indonesia have widened from
big ports like Medan, Jakarta, Ujungpandang and Bali to smaller
ports like Palu in Southeast Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the involvement of children of top government
officials in drug abuse, Hadiman said: "Drug distribution has
affected all segments of society."
</P>
<P>
Recently, five military officers were arrested on charges of
possession of 60 kilograms of drugs. Last month, the son of a top
Indonesian Army general was also implicated in a drug abuse case.
</P>
<P>
Bersama has set up information centers throughout Indonesia to
provide essential information on drug abuse, symptoms, existing
programs and future plans. It also disseminates educational
information to get parents and society participation in the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Hadiman urged parents to establish better communication with
their children and that they should guide and teach them to say no
to drugs and to attentively monitor their activities.
</P>
<P>
Society could also make their contribution by taking preventive
action and necessary steps to treat the addicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last few months, at least 30,000 people have died from
drug abuse," Hadiman said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Patent Law To Be Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Patent Law enacted 15
years ago is set to be amended soon, according to officials with
the National People's Congress and the State Intellectual Property
Office (SIPO).
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee will review the revision draft
before the end of this year. It is now being studied by the State
Council, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The revision is expected to simplify application procedures of
patents, offer strengthened protection for patent holders and
adapt the Patent Law to the Patent Co-operation Treaty, Ma
Lianyuan, SIPO deputy director, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
More serious punishment stipulations have been adopted in the
draft to crack down on infringement of patent rights, and patent
offices are allowed to investigate such cases, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Usually applicants have to wait for months and even years to
know if their applications are approved due to the complicated
application rules and the rapid increase of applications, which
rose over seven times in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
For example, the telecommunications and computer sectors have
over 4,500 and 4,200 applications that are waiting for review,
which will take all current appraisers 10 years to finish.
</P>
<P>
At present, the office has taken additional measures to speed
up the review process, officials said.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Sector Marks 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials and
executives of China's insurance industry gathered here Monday to
celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic
of China and the sector's 50 years of development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Ma Yongwei, chairman of the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission, said the country's insurance
sector has witnessed great achievements in the last 50 years,
despite the serious setbacks of the 1960s and 1970s when domestic
insurance was suspended.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's reform and opening up in the late 1970s,
the insurance sector has been growing rapidly. Official figures
show that insurer's premium income has been growing at an annual
rate of 38 percent, much higher than China's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the industry's total premium income hit 124.7 billion
yuan, nearly 200 times that of 1980.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1986, the People's Insurance Company of China was
the country's only insurer. But by the end of last year, there
were 25 insurance firms, including five joint ventures and seven
solely funded by foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the prosperity of the insurance sector in recent years
is the result of rapid economic and social development in China,
but by the same token, the insurance sector also contributed
greatly to economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1998, China's insurance firms paid out 260 billion
yuan in liabilities. As a result of the severe flooding that
struck China in 1998, insurers paid more than three billion yuan
for damages suffered by their clients.
</P>
<P>
The chairman expressed the belief that with the establishment
of the socialist market economy system in China, the insurance
sector will have a still brighter future and contribute more to
the nation's development.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 houses were

They said strong winds accompanied by thunder and heavy showers
hit the area around 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, uprooting many trees and
