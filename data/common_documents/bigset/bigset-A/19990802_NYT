   ``Inside the Oval Office'' &QL; 
By William Doyle (Kodansha, $28) &QL; 
What were they ``thinking,''``'' these powerful men who recorded
conversations that should have been left to our imaginations?
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a microphone hidden in his desk lamp, and
it preserved, among other things, his embarrassing responses to
civil-rights leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White, who in
1940 went to the Oval Office to push for integration of the U.S.
military. The tape of the meeting reveals the visitors to be
eloquent and firm, while Roosevelt is condescending and vaguely
racist. At one point, he addresses the issue of putting Black men
aboard Navy ships with this suggestion: ``Another thing (that) I
forgot to mention . . . is this. We are training a certain number
of musicians on board ship. The ship's ``band.'' There's no reason
why we shouldn't have a colored band on some of these ships,
because they're ``darn good at it.'' That's something we should
look into. You know, if it'll increase the ``opportunity,'' that's
what we're after. They may develop a ``leader'' of the band.'' And
consider this exchange as John and Robert Kennedy and their aides
deal with riots after James Meredith's attempts to register as the
first Black student at the University of Mississippi. JFK: ``It's
going to be a long fall in Oxford. I think we oughta get the
National Guard within, you know, shouting distance.'' RFK: ``Yeah.
We have control over the air. If you have gas, you got a pretty
good operation going. They got 500 marshals. You see, they're
sitting there, and they're throwing iron.'' JFK: ``Spikes?'' RFK:
``. . . spikes and they're throwing Coke bottles and they're
throwing rocks.'' JFK: What's Barnett (Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett) doing?'' RFK: ``I suppose laughing at us.'' (Laughter in
room.) VOICE: ``This reminds me a little bit of the Bay of Pigs.''
RFK: ``Yech!'' (Laughter in room.) Doyle looks at the bugging
habits of the past 11 presidents. The transcripts are brief but
fascinating, although they are faulty history. Less interesting is
the analysis Doyle offers as he explores the 20th-century tradition
of presidential eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weight of Dreams''By Jonis Agee (Viking, $24.95) &QL; 
Agee's new novel is so packed with stories that it's not easy to
describe. The central character is Ty Bonte, who has grown up on a
Nebraska ranch with an abusive father and a mother grown distant
after the death of Ty's younger brother, Ronnie. Ty is 17 when the
book begins and about to take part in an event that will govern the
rest of his life: One night, he and his friend, Harney Rivers,
brutally beat two Indians from a nearby reservation, and Tyruns off
before he can be arrested. He ends up in Kansas, where he builds a
life for himself as a horse trader. Now, 20 years have passed, and
although he is haunted by both Ronnie's death and that horrible
night with Harney, he has managed to reinvent himself enough to
begin a comfortable relationship with a woman who has secrets of
her own. It all goes well until Harney reappears and commits acts
so vicious that they make his previous sins seem like child's play.
All of this, astonishingly enough, takes place in the first 100
pages, leaving nearly 300 to resolve everything. This novel offers
violence, romance, ranch life, lots of horses, parental blame,
parental forgiveness, courtroom drama, a hate crime, lots of
remorse and even more redemption. And Agee's fans will be happy to
see Latta Jaboy and Cody Kidwell, characters from her novel,
``Strange Angels,'' who play supporting roles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for the Goal''By Mia Hamm (HarperCollins, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She can do anything he can do and better. Even Michael Jordan
must believe it by now. This book was released in April, but its
publisher is sending it around again for those of you who woke up
with the World Cup. Part autobiography, part soccer primer, part
paean to the joys of team play, it is earnest to the point of
stodginess, which just makes Hamm more admirable than she already
was. There are photos of skill and rough play, a glossary of soccer
terms, diagrams of maneuvers and even a page from Hamm's training
log, which we read but did not understand (New &AMP; Notable is not
intense). There are also words of wisdom, as when Hamm talks about
soccer's way of humbling its players. In any match, she says, there
are two opponents _ the other team and soccer itself. Sometimes,
you can outplay the different-color shirts. But you never beat the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Queen Mother's Century''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lacey &QL; 
(Little Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   She was awfully cute when she was little, and she's awfully cute
now. In between, there was a long succession of bad hats. And bad
jewelry, bad parasols, bad photo opportunities, as when she posed,
smiling sweetly, in a bombed-out London neighborhood after a Nazi
air raid. But if anyone could pull it off, it was the Queen Mother,
who was born in 1900 and whose plump, serene presence is certainly
a hook upon which to hang another century book. Lacey makes a lame
effort to mention news events over the years, but this is really
just an excuse to look at royal photos. Our favorite shows Princess
Margaret, Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother dressed in plaid
skirts and standing in a barnyard, frumpy women all. Queen Mum has
a Band-Aid on her shin and is gamely balancing a milk bucket on her
head. It's an improvement over those hats.

SAMPRAS WINS LATEST SHOWDOWN WITH AGASSI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They first faced each other at a juniors
tournament in Northridge, a lanky kid from Palos Verdes with bushy
eyebrows and another young man from Las Vegas with more hair than
he has now.
</P>
<P>
   That match doesn't much stick out in Pete Sampras' mind, except
that he believes he won it.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also triumphed Sunday in the latest meeting with Andre
Agassi, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-1), at UCLA, to claim his second
Mercedes-Benz Cup final, pocket the $46,000 winner's check and deny
Agassi a chance to repeat as champion.
</P>
<P>
   But since that first match some 15 years ago, a
mutual-admiration society and rivalry between Sampras and Agassi
have been born and nurtured through 25 matches, including a dozen
finals in which they have faced off.
</P>
<P>
   For Sampras, won also won the Mercedes-Benz Cup in 1991, it has
been a good week. By reaching the final, he regained the world's
No.1 ranking from Patrick Rafter; it will be his record-setting
271st week at the top, surpassing Ivan Lendl. Then he capped the
tournament by beating Agassi, making some cross-court and backhand
shots ``I didn't think I could hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has won 15 of 25 meetings, including seven of 12 finals,
and, again, the players declared they bring out the best in each
other. Sampras suggested an exhibition, similar to what Tiger Woods
and David Duval will do today at Sherwood Country Club, would be
viable and make for good television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor to compete,'' Agassi said. ``The older I
get, the more I treasure these opportunities. It is certainly a
privilege to play this kind of tennis. I'll remember the losses as
much as the wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Matches such as Sunday's serve to illustrate. The two broke each
other just once, in the first set, and held serve through the
second set. In fact, through the first 10 games of the second set,
a nonserver scored a point just seven times. For the match, Sampras
served 11 aces, Agassi had 10.
</P>
<P>
   They also took time to tease each other. After the match, Agassi
told the sellout crowd of 7,139, ``Everybody knows I beat Pete when
it counts. If he thinks this was good, I have a hunch if we tee it
up in New York (at the U.S. Open), it'll be rocking.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Sampras replied, ``I believe I'm 3-1 in the (Grand
Slam) finals.'' Then he walked over to Agassi and patted him on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   To which Agassi retorted: ``I let you win Wimbledon. You could
have at least let me win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras continued the duel later on. ``There's not a lot of
hatred between Andre and I,'' he said. ``It's more respect. The
fact that I know I have to play well and be on all cylinders calms
me down. It's ironic. I have to serve well each point. I can't
afford a (mistake). It's the history I have with him. There's no
time to (think). It's all instinct and reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The match hinged on two key points, which Sampras converted. In
the first set, Agassi had a break point and would have gone up 5-4.
Instead, Agassi's two-handed backhand went wide for deuce, and
Sampras held serve.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also had a chance to break Sampras and win the second
set, but he returned Sampras' serve too long. They went to the
second tiebreaker, and Agassi promptly double-faulted to start.
Sampras quickly went up 3-0 with an ace and a service winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against a guy like Pete, you're only going to get a few
chances,'' Agassi said. ``I had the break and I had the set point
at 5-6. Those were my chances. The third set is different. The heat
becomes a factor. The elements become a factor, but I also would've
taken the break at 5-4 and served for the (first) set. Those were
two significant opportunities I didn't convert and it cost me the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, the two will meet again soon, potentially in two
weeks in Cincinnati. Then there's the following week at
Indianapolis, and the Open in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday's match was so close, Sampras knows another tight
contest will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I got the best of him, but it's just a couple of
points,'' Sampras said. ``We could be out there playing the third
set right now. He plays me so close, eventually he'll take me
down.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ Following a 10-3 loss Sunday to the San Diego Padres,
Jose Lima took comfort in knowing he had gotten his worst start of
the season out of the way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surely, things can't get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lima struggled through 4 innings _ his shortest outing of the
year _ and allowed three home runs as the Padres snapped their
nine-game losing streak at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn homered, singled and doubled to move
within six hits of 3,000 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that bad start out of the way,'' said Lima, who allowed
a season-high eight runs. ``It was one of those games. I was up in
the (strike) zone. I didn't have great command of my changeup, and
I didn't have great command of my fastball. I was off. I can't make
excuses. I was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrible also could have applied to the Astros' offense for the
better part of the game. Apparently, the Astros packed their bats
for the trip back to Houston one day too early. Lefthander Sterling
Hitchcock held them hitless until Tim Bogar homered leading off the
sixth. Daryle Ward added a pinch-hit home run in the eighth, his
third in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the last time the Padres had beaten the Astros was
in Game 4 of last year's National League divisional playoffs, a win
that clinched the series for San Diego. The Padres lost the first
eight meetings this season but avoided their first season sweep
since going 0-12 against the Montreal Expos in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who aside from interleague play have never swept a
season series, completed their road trip 5-2. Their lead in the NL
Central dropped to 2{ games over Cincinnati, which beat San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored its first four runs off home runs, including a
two-run shot by Gwynn in the third inning. Phil Nevin, whom the
Astros selected with the top overall pick in the 1992 draft, went
3-for-3 with a solo homer, and Wally Joyner drove in three runs for
the Padres, who built an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (14-6) allowed nine hits and eight earned runs in 4
innings. His ERA ballooned from 3.15 to 3.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same thing that makes him a good competitor can be
his enemy _ getting emotional and fired up,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said of the righthander, who was visibly upset with his
pitch location throughout the game. ``That can work for him, but
when he starts getting angry when things are going wrong, that can
work against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Lima had not exited a game so early since lasting
3 innings in an 8-1 loss to Cincinnati on June 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock (10-8), who coincidentally was the last Padres pitcher
to beat the Astros, allowed three hits and two runs in six innings.
In the first five innings, he allowed only two baserunners _ both
on walks _ while forcing the Astros into nine popouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't hit his fastball,'' Dierker said. ``We were joking
around that it was the greatest fastball of all time. We kept
getting behind the count, and all we would do is foul it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Padres finally found an answer for Astros
pitching. In eight losses to the Astros this season, San Diego had
scored only 20 runs while hitting .218.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin hit his 13th home run leading off the second inning, and
Gwynn padded the lead with a two-run shot in the third. Eric Owens
hit a solo shot to start a one-out fifth-inning rally by the
Padres, who eventually sent 10 batters to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner and Ben Davis added two-run singles as the Padres turned
a three-run game into an 8-0 blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out swinging right from the get-go and jumped on us
quick,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``Once it got out
of hand, it's tough to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who was hitless in six at-bats during the first two games
of the series, finished 3-for-5, his first three-hit game since
April 29. Along with his homer, he added an RBI single in the fifth
and a double in the eighth for his 2,994th career hit. The Padres
open a three-city, 11-game trip today in St. Louis. At his current
pace, Gwynn would reach the 3,000 milestone this weekend in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of time,'' Dierker said. ``We figured he would
get a few hits. We hoped to play well enough to where we could win
anyway.''

BRAZILIANS STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ Huntington Beach should have been
renamed Little Brazil. Brazilian surf fans became the beach's vocal
focus as two of their countrymen faced off in the finals of
Sunday's Gotcha Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time since 1977 that two Brazilians were in
the finals of a World Championship Tour event, and the last time,
occurred in Rio de Janiero. So the enthusiasm the approximate 200
Brazilians showed finalists Neco Paradatz and Fabio Gouveia in a
sport dominated by Australians and Hawaiians was exceptionally loud
through cheers and drums.
</P>
<P>
   Paradatz slashed across three-foot waves, wowed the crowd and
took an early lead. He held on to beat Gouveia, 22.5 to 19.25, and
win the Gotcha Pro and $15,000. Paradatz did this, despite not
surfing on the WCT this year and being one of four wildcards in the
48-surfer event.
</P>
<P>
   This 22-year-old champ, who lived a year in Huntington as an
exchange student at Edison High, nearly wasn't admitted to the
event. He had to finish the highest of unranked surfers in last
week's 700-person U.S. Open of Surfing at Huntington to get his
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazilians have this feeling --- everything is in the blood,''
Paradatz said. ``If one guy gets the feeling, and then maybe
another gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Top performances flowed through Brazilian blood as three of the
eight competing Brazilians made it to the semifinals. Victor Ribas
joined Hawaiian Sunny Garcia in the semifinals before Gouveia
knocked out Ribas and Padaratz knocked out Garcia, the
second-ranked surfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Padaratz, who will remain unranked this entire year, also
knocked out top-ranked Mark Occhilupo and seventh-ranked Mick Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting bleach blonde hair and three facial piercings,
including a green spike under his lip, Padaratz has become the talk
of surfing. He did not grant an interview his entire two weeks at
Huntington until a handful of journalists chased him down Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interviews might have added to Padaratz's mystique
as the unique surf media concocted a story that Padaratz did not
allow interviews because his wife put a hex on him and he was
nervous about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Padaratz dispelled rumors about that spell as well as
others. At 22, he could be the first Brazilian to win a WCT title.
He surfed impressively last season and was ranked as high as 10th,
before he dropped out of the tour presumably to spend time with his
wife and newborn. That reasoning, however, also was concocted by
the bizarre surf media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out because I had a problem with my stomach,'' said
Padaratz, of a serious intestinal malady. ``People think it's
because of the kid, but that wasn't it at all. I had stress, a bad
diet and a lot of traveling, and it all hurt my stomach problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradatz surfed trouble free throughout the week at Huntington.
Runner up Gouveia, 29, wasn't far behind, but didn't have as many
workable waves as Padaratz, who is the younger brother of former
WCT surfer Flavio Padaratz.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Padaratz could be the answer that surfing needs.
Criticism has surfaced that younger surfers are not distinctive,
but Padaratz surfs in a distinctive quick, slashing manner and also
looks distinctive with his Red Hot Chili Peppers style.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's funny, but every guy has his own style,'' Gouveia
said of Padaratz's look. ``I know I couldn't put in one of those
piercings because it would hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it apparently didn't hurt Padaratz, who had a penchant for
pain since he followed his older brother to surf events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was younger, I'd pull his hair and pull him off the
ground,'' Gouveia said. ``He'd never cry and always said, `more,
more, more.'''
</P>
<P>
   __ A full day's surf: The Gotcha Pro started early with
quarterfinals. The day's first heat in which Sunny Garcia edged
U.S. Open champ Shea Lopez was the most exciting. Garcia beat Lopez
by grabbing a wave with two seconds left in the heat and scoring a
7.15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard part of the crowd cheering for Shea Lopez,'' Garcia
said. ``And I wanted to shut them up.''
</P>
<P>
   If any surprise happened in the day, perhaps it was Fabio
Gouveia handily knocking out six-time world champion Kelly Slater
in the quarterfinals, 19.25 to 12. ``It actually makes me want to
surf more, maybe go on a surf tour,'' Slater said of the loss. ``My
timing was off, and I think I struggled a little.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balllard wins crowd: Hawaiian Rochelle Ballard beat
Australian Trudy Todd in the women's final, 19.35 to 8.8, to claim
$6,000. Ballard had a 6.25 on her first wave and cruised to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The surf for the day's events was not ideal. In fact, it was so
low that both finals were augmented to 45 minutes instead of 30.
Ballard, among other pro surfers, said she is accustomed to all
conditions and pointed out that rhythm always is the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real good to be in touch with the ocean,'' Ballard said.
``If you can get in tune with the ocean, it makes all the
difference.''

`BRIDE' CATCHES BIGGEST BOUQUET AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers mobbed multiplexes to catch Julia
Roberts' comedy ``Runaway Bride'' as it led a record-setting
weekend at the nation's box office with a robust $34.5 million at
3,158 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bride'' topped an astounding performance by horror sensation
``The Blair Witch Project'' _ with $28.5 million at 1,101 theaters
_ with the mock-documentary continuing to generate sell-outs as it
expanded from the art-house circuit to mainstream locales.
</P>
<P>
   Summer continued to sizzle with overall ticket sales hitting
$155 million, obliterating the previous record for a three-day
nonholiday weekend _ set last weekend _ by an astounding 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of business right now is just mind-boggling,'' said
Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service.
``Everyone is going; it's become the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other notable records fell this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Top opening for an adult-oriented comedy by ``Runaway Bride,''
eclipsing the $31.5 million debut last year for ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Top per-theater weekend average by ``Blair Witch'' with
$25,885, beating the record set by ``Star Wars Episode 1: The
Phantom Menace'' by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Runaway Bride,'' with Roberts portraying a woman
who keeps getting cold feet at the altar, also represented the top
opening for a film by the comedy star as it easily surpassed the
$27.7 million debut by ``Notting Hill'' over the four-day Memorial
Day weekend. The reteaming of Roberts with ``Pretty Woman'' co-star
Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall should continue to prove
potent in coming weeks, with final gross in the range of the $127
million taken in by Roberts' 1997 hit, ``My Best Friend's
Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The weekend was well beyond what we expected,'' said Paramount
distribution chief Wayne Lewellen. ``We think the public was ready
for a film that was aimed at older audiences. The word of mouth
should be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Blair Witch,'' the made-on-a-shoestring project
achieved break-out hit status among teen-agers and young adults as
buzz continued to build over the unique tale of three filmmakers
disappearing into the Maryland wilderness. ``The desire to see
`Blair Witch' has been spreading like wildfire,'' said Bucksbaum,
who boosted his forecast for its final take to $150 million from
$85 million. ``Everyone is interested in this film.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan will add 800 to 900 theaters next weekend, many in
smaller markets, for ``Blair Witch'' as part of its strategy of
gradually building awareness. ``I think this film has become a
cultural phenomenon,'' said studio President Amir Malin. ``This
issue for us has now become saying `no' to exhibitors who want the
film because we want to avoid cannibalizing our audience in markets
where it's already playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other films posted impressive results, led by Warner
Bros.' first weekend of hungry-sharks-fest ``Deep Blue Sea,'' with
$18.2 million at 2,864 theaters to go with the $6.1 million it
swallowed Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another horror entry, DreamWorks' second weekend of ``The
Haunting,'' finished a respectable fourth with $15.1 million at
2,864 theaters as the tale of a demonic house dropped off 55
percent from its leading post last weekend. Disney's second weekend
of family comedy ``Inspector Gadget'' followed with $14 million at
2,877 locations, losing 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell noted the weekend represented
the ninth in a row in which a different film has led the box office
as summer moviegoing remains at a pace 20 percent above last
summer's record-setting level. ``The overall numbers are the
story,'' he said. ``It's not that people are going blindly to
movies; it's that attendance is being driven by good product flow
and the development of large megaplex theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   The next six spots on the weekend list were occupied by films
that have finished at No. 1 during the past two months, led by
Universal's fourth weekend of ``American Pie'' with $6.7 million at
2,436 sites, followed by Warner's third weekend of ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' with $4.1 million at 2,264 theaters as Stanley Kubrick's
final film continued its quick fade with a 61 percent decline from
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's sixth weekend of ``Big Daddy'' finished eighth with $3.5
million at 2,288 screens as it became the sixth 1999 film and 66th
of all time to join the $150 million club, posting $152.6 million.
20th Century Fox's 11th weekend of ``Star Wars Episode 1: The
Phantom Menace'' followed with $3.3 million at 1,640 sites to push
its 75-day total to $408.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's seventh weekend of ``Tarzan'' came in 10th with $3
million at 1,611 theaters, to go past $158 million and edge
Warner's fifth weekend of ``Wild Wild West'' with $2.7 million at
2,151 sites. The summer's business has been so powerful that
``West'' is viewed as a disappointment even though the high-budget
comedy has hit $109 million after 33 days.
</P>
<P>
   With five potentially solid openings next weekend and holdovers
expected to continue to perform well, business is likely to sizzle
for several more weeks. Disney, taking advantage of the horror
genre's strength, showed sneak screenings Saturday of ``The Sixth
Sense'' and reported strong response for the Bruce Willis vehicle,
moved up from fall to roll out Friday. Also opening will be MGM's
remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' and a trio of comedies _
Warner's animated ``Iron Giant,'' Universal's ``Mystery Men'' and
Sony's ``Dick.''

LEAVING THE GANGS TURNS LIVES AROUND

By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lying in the front yard of his family's home with
gunshot wounds in his arm and back, Jose Lopez knew it was time to
give up (italics) la vida loca (end italics).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the bullets that convinced him his days of running
with the Pacoima Brownstone Locos were over. It was his mother's
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had joined the Brownstones at 13 and had a record of
run-ins with the law by the time he turned 18. He knew that he was
leading a life on the edge but stayed with it until the day a rival
gang riddled his front yard with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   His mother ran out of the house and wept over Lopez, his body
sprawled on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my life. It feels real bad when you see your
parents crying,'' he said.``You don't want to see your family see
these things happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Lopez, 25, received his bachelor's's degree from
California State University, Los Angeles, making him the first
member of his family to graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   For Lopez, the motivation to break free was swift and clear, but
the challenge for him and other former gangsters is finding a way
to fit back into society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose is a star, an example that people can change,'' said
Steve Martinez, another former gang member who is now associate
director of Communities in Schools, a dropout prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's redirecting his energies to do what we do _ going out on
the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who brokered the 1993 truce among 75 of the San Fernando
Valley's gangs said Lopez and others like him are proof that gang
bangers can cross over to the straight life.
</P>
<P>
   There is the perception that former gang members are ``all no
good and there's nothing good you can find in Pacoima,'' said
William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez, executive director of Communities in
Schools, an agency that seeks to prevent youths from joining gangs
and intervenes when they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... there is something good from Pacoima ... there is
something good from the barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   And convincing the gang members is only half the battle, say
those who have left the life behind. An equal challenge is
convincing society _ from school admissions officers to employers _
to give gang graduates a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to find a job because you look like a gang member.
You're not doing that no more, but people prejudge you,'' said Mark
Arredondo. The 21-year-old former gang member found work as a
stagehand after getting a break through a training program
organized by the union local and Communities in Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rothstein, a probation officer who serves on a specialized
gang supervision unit of the Los Angeles County Probation
Department, believes the key to making the crossover is within the
gang members themselves. He estimates that only about 10 percent of
his probationers go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Jose Lopez. Another is former Brownstone Loco
Frank Jauregui, who followed Lopez to California State University,
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time that they were put on probation they were taking
care of business, looking to finish their education, get jobs and
work,'' Rothstein said. ``Going through the system itself got their
attention and their own character allowed them to make the changes
necessary to become productive members of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tattoos hidden under his shirt, the only remnants of Frank
Jauregui's gang life are a buzz cut and baggy khakis, styles that
don't stand out in his criminal justice class at Cal State L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui, 26, doesn't tell his classmates of his past and keeps
a low profile. But getting to college was a much bigger journey for
this graduate of the Pacoima Brownstone Locos than it was for most
of his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   From drive-by shootings to stabbings, Jauregui has seen more
than his share of gang life before calling it quits and seeking a
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still keep in touch with my homeboys, but as far as being
out on the streets that's not me anymore,'' said Jauregui, who was
part of the Brownstones for more than a decade and served prison
time for assault with a deadly weapon during a confrontation with a
rival gang.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eight months behind bars that changed Jauregui's
perspective. Once he got out, hanging with his homeboys didn't feel
right any more. He yearned to be more productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I said I've got to better myself,'' said Jauregui,
who enrolled in Valley College in 1994 and is now a criminal
justice major expecting to graduate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I got the other side of criminal justice, why not be
on the good side.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lopez, it was his parents who convinced him to leave gang
life. Between his mother's tears and the chidings of his
construction-worker father, Lopez decided to return to school after
dropping out of San Fernando High School in his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, you know what, I'm going to finish school so I can
prove that I can do something with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from San Fernando, Lopez worked part time as a
security guard but found the work unfulfilling and set his sights
on something more rewarding, a career helping others.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez keeps in touch with his homeboys but has left that life
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would be this old because of gang violence.
... I thought I might be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to take his story to classrooms, to tell the next
generation that they can escape (italics) la vida loca (end
italics).

ANGELS FINALLY SHOW SPARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Angels pitcher Steve Sparks' knuckleball
danced and darted so much Sunday night it made the Minnesota Twins
look like, well, the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks pitched no-hit ball for six innings before giving up a
single to Terry Steinbach leading off the seventh. He gave up an
unearned run in the eighth, but the Angels held on for a 2-1
victory before 24,045 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The win was only the Angels' third in 17 games since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense was the same ol' thing despite efforts by
manager Terry Collins to shake up the lineup. Mo Vaughn moved down
to fifth in the lineup and Darin Erstad moved down to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had two hits, including his ninth homer of the season,
but Vaughn went 0 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the way Sparks pitched, Erstad's homer and
Troy Glaus' RBI single in the second inning were enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks made just 66 pitches through six innings, allowing three
baserunners _ two walks and a hit batter. But on his 67th pitch,
Steinbach hit a sharp single up the middle to spoil the no-hit bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was thinking about it,'' Sparks said. ``After five
innings, I thought maybe, but, first and foremost, we were up by
only one run.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbach, though, was erased on a double play and Sparks took a
one-hitter into the eighth. Chad Allen got the Twins' second and
final hit of the game with one out; Marty Cordova followed with a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   That brought out pitching coach Dick Pole to the mound, and
whatever he said seemed to work. Sparks got pinch-hitter Torii
Hunter to hit a chopper to Glaus at third, which should have been
an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaus bobbled the ball and had no play, allowing the Twins
to load the bases with just one out. Sparks got out of it cheaply
enough, allowing a sacrifice fly to Denny Hocking before getting
Todd Walker on a comebacker to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth to earn his 24th save. Sparks
(5-7) gave up one unearned run and two hits in eight innings,
beating Twins starter Joe Mays (4-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best game he's pitched all season,'' Collins
said of Sparks. ``The use of his knuckleball was the best I've seen
it. He slowed it down and threw it soft, and he threw it hard. And
he threw both for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, with the help of Pole, changed his mechanics since his
last start, when he didn't make it out of the fifth inning despite
a 6-1 lead. Sparks changed his delivery so that instead of a lot of
arm action used by most pitchers, Sparks threw the ball as one
would throw a dart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the ball out of my glove by my right ear and push it
toward the plate,'' Sparks said. ``I don't feel like I pitched. It
almost feels like I played soft-toss catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said another key was changing speeds with the
knuckleball. He threw it slowly early in the game, then mixed up
speeds in the middle and late innings.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that even though the season is lost as far as
the team is concerned, there are players who are playing for
employment in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people whose future is uncertain for next
year, myself included,'' Sparks said. ``I'm very disappointed in
how I've pitched. Mostly not pitching a lot of innings. That's
where my value lies. It helps guys get the proper rest and doesn't
expend the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks handed the ball over to Percival to start the ninth,
which was a rarity of late. Sunday's save was his first since July
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because you've got a weapon like that down
there and you can't use him,'' Collins said. ``It's been tough on
everybody.''

   VENTURA, Calif. _ Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
suffered minor injuries Sunday afternoon when the vehicle she was
driving spun out of control on the Ventura Freeway and rolled over,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was driving alone in a blue 1999 Ford Explorer when it
overturned at 1:10 p.m., coming to rest in southbound lanes five
miles north of Ventura, said Bob Inman, a dispatcher with the
California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers responded and found the Ford Explorer sitting on its
side,'' Inman said. ``She was apparently awake and alert at the
scene and complaining of minor injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky had been driving to Montecito on the northbound Ventura
Freeway near Amphitheater Road when she took her eyes off the road
to get something out of her purse, CHP dispatcher Kathleen Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she looked up, she realized her vehicle was dangerously
close to a motor home. She swerved to avoid a collision, and the
Explorer spun out of control, crossed the dirt divider and
overturned on the inner lane of the southbound freeway, Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered cuts and scrapes to her left arm and complained of
neck pain, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics took Lewinsky to Community Memorial Hospital in
Ventura, 60 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, where she was
X-rayed and treated for the injuries, said a nursing supervisor who
declined to identify herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's father picked her up at 4:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other vehicles involved, and officers were
investigating the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, a former Beverly Hills resident, triggered the
impeachment of President Clinton when news of their affair was made
public last year and he attempted to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal came to light after Lewinsky confided in her friend
and Pentagon co-worker Linda Tripp, who secretly taped their
conversation and then brought the tape to Independent Counsel
Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was indicted Friday for taping the conversation without
Lewinsky's permission, a violation of Maryland's wiretap laws.

PARKS IN SUBURBS ABSORBING THOSE WITH NOWHERE TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Syringes in park sandboxes. Naked men in public
bathrooms. Drunks snoring in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they're sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Phoenix area homeless people are migrating to the
suburbs from downtown Phoenix, but few services have followed them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the homeless _ especially older, single men _ are
gathering in the streets and parks of Phoenix, Glendale, Mesa,
Scottsdale and Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   But doing something about the problem is a lot more complicated
than it sounds, officials say. Coping with the Phoenix area's
migrating homeless is hampered by the clash between every
resident's desire to enjoy his or her neighborhood and every
citizen's right to move freely about public places.
</P>
<P>
   ``People called us and said they wanted the homeless out of the
downtown park,'' Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved the people from the park . . . neighbors
screamed they had homeless people sleeping in their driveways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the homeless have to go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindie Kaye, who is homeless herself, agrees with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A park is a public place, and that's how it's gotta be,'' said
Kaye, 41, a tanned woman with a pleasant smile who began a recent
summer day, as she often does, drinking beer in Tempe's Daley Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be that way, she said, because there's no place
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were, that could make a difference,'' she added. &QL; 
Overwhelmed services &QL; 
About 12,000 homeless people live in the Phoenix area, according to
official estimates. For years, most homeless lived in downtown
Phoenix, which used to have many cheap hotels and where shelters
offered food, shelter, counseling and job referrals.
</P>
<P>
   But many low-cost hotels have disappeared with new developments.
Shelters and charitable agencies are overwhelmed by demand.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Richard Hudalla of Church on the Street in central
Phoenix is one of those trying to find other places for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeless families get help from the downtown Phoenix agencies,
but lots of the single guys, the hard-core, street-wise guys, are
getting run out of downtown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why people are seeing them in Mesa and Tempe and all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudalla said that with the new ballpark and restaurants,
downtown has become less hospitable to the homeless, particularly
men who demonstrate little desire to find jobs or a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys no longer can get drunk and lay on the sidewalks
downtown,'' Hudalla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police respond to the complaints of the business owners,
pick up the homeless guys, who then decide to head to other parts
of Phoenix or to Glendale, Tempe, where they hope to be left
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't welcome outside Phoenix, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daley Park ought to be called Homeless Park,'' said Martha
Galves, who lives in the Tempe neighborhood west of the park, which
is on College Avenue, two blocks north of Broadway Road.
</P>
<P>
   She stood on a sidewalk across the street from the park holding
her 3-year-old daughter's hand. Galves glared at a group drinking
beer at picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any day there will be 10, 15 homeless men and sometimes
women in the park, drinking, doing drugs, taking baths in the
restrooms,'' Galves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my little girl into the bathroom last week and there
was a naked woman cleaning herself at the sinks. I can't take my
kids over there any more and feel safe, and that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing park law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tempe officials estimate there are 300 to 500 homeless in the
city. Scottsdale claims 300 to 400 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale officials say the homeless certainly are with them, but
the numbers _ probably less than 300 _ have leveled off in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonsall Park, at 59th Avenue and Bethany Home Road, is where
we've had our biggest problem,'' Glendale police spokesman Matt
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were homeless men harassing citizens trying to use the
park, begging and so on. Then the homeless guys would go over into
the adjoining farmland and sort of thumb their nose at us because
we couldn't arrest them on private property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have permission to arrest the homeless on that
property, and we're enforcing the law that says the homeless have
to be out of the park at 10 p.m., and the problem is less.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale resident Sandra Banks has been riding her bicycle
through the parks along Indian Bend Wash almost every day for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, for the first time, I started seeing these homeless
guys asleep, drinking, wandering around,'' Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I see them all the time, all over the place, and I'm sorry
to say they worry me. I want to be charitable toward them, but they
still kind of scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Koppinger directs Vista Del Camino, a homeless outreach
service of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are guys camping along Indian Bend Wash,'' she
said. ``These are mostly the hard-core guys who are our greatest
challenge.'' &QL; 
`Hard-core' homeless &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeless men become ``hard-core guys'' usually through ``a sad
combination of a substance abuse problem, losing a job, losing
one's family and losing a place to live,'' Koppinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose your home, you begin a downward spiral. You
can't keep yourself clean. You lose all confidence. What seems like
a common accomplishment for us _ like filling out a job application
_ becomes overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix neighborhood activist Lisa Irwin said the park near her
home has been taken over by ``hard-core'' homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encanto Park sometimes just belongs to the homeless,'' she
said. ``And these are not families looking for help. These are
transients, mainly men who don't seem to want to change. They
drink, they do drugs. You find needles in the sandboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix parks officials and the Salvation Army have started
Project Hope to reach out to the homeless and get them out of the
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, a Project Hope van cruises Phoenix parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer to help them find shelter or showers or medical help,
anything they need,'' Project Hope employee Stacey Stopher said.
``The homeless are in parks all over town, so we sometimes offer to
drive them to where they can get help, or we offer them bus tokens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often take us up on our offer, but sometimes they just
want to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hall is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hall rides his luggage-laden bicycle from park to park between
Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa. His dog Dana follows along, if
slowly, because he has a broken leg that Hall put in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 47, wears sandals, khaki shorts and a khaki hat. He is
shirtless. He insists he is not homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just less a house,'' he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Hall does not smile when he thinks about being run out of the
parks that are his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors get us thrown out of the parks,'' he said
bitterly. ``Those people think the parks belong to them and only
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he would rather stay in parks than live in a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard horror stories about those shelters,'' he said.
``Besides, I can't take Dana into a shelter, so I ain't going
either.''
</P>
<P>
   `Harder to deal with' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moms and kids and families are relatively easy to help, said
Carol Kratz, home services manager for the Maricopa Association of
Governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who are older and probably have an alcohol or drug
problem, may have mental problems _ they are far harder to deal
with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kratz said efforts in cities like Seattle and San Diego to help
``hard-core'' homeless show if you provide a decent place to stay,
proper nutrition, counseling and training, you can succeed with
many of them.
</P>
<P>
   But she lamented that now, ``For all those homeless guys out in
north Phoenix, the other cities, there is almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no shelters for homeless men in Glendale, Scottsdale
or Tempe. There are only two shelters for the homeless in the East
Phoenix area, one of which houses about 70 and is for families. The
other, the East Valley Transitional and Training Center, opened in
December and houses 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shelter is a response to neighborhood concerns,'' center
executive director Pat Gilbert said. ``A few years ago, Mesa
residents were seeing homeless in the parks throughout the center
of town and wanted something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said that by the end of August, the center should be
able to hold 100 homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strict house rules, however. We are strict about
sobriety and insist everyone work every day,'' he said. ``Some of
the hard-core homeless guys aren't interested in that. Since there
are almost certainly more than 2,000 homeless out here in the East
Valle (the Phoenixarea is known as the Valley of the Sun), we still
have a long way to go in helping everyone. But we are a start.'' &QL; 
Tempe hunts solutions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano said he is only too aware that Tempe has little to
offer in the way of help for the city's many homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe this fall will begin what Giuliano calls a ``full needs
assessment,'' with experts on the homeless and citizens, ``looking
for the ways we can address this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano has an idea of his own. He said he sees a good use for
the building that is now Fire Station No. 1 on University Drive
east of Rural Road, but which will become vacant when the station
relocates to Mill Avenue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can reuse the fire station as an outreach center for
the homeless,'' he said. ``It could be a place they could take a
shower, get a meal, referrals for jobs and help.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindie Kaye said she would like a place to go. The men sitting
with her at Daley Park drinking Milwaukee's Best said they would
like a place to go as well.
</P>
<P>
   All say they hang out in parks in Scottsdale, Tempe and Phoenix,
because, as Kaye said, ``We don't want anything to do with that
homeless scene in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempe is pretty friendly. You can get day-labor jobs easily
here, and you can always find a place to sleep, even if it's only
the doorway of a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go hang out on Mill Avenue or stay here in Daley
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will, Kaye said, until ``something better comes
along.'' &QL;

BLEDSOE HAS PATRIOTS AIR-CONDITIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ One can watch the education of running back
Kevin Faulk, the crisp pass routes of Terry Glenn, the bulldog rush
of Chad Eaton, and the hard hits of Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   All will be essential to the Patriots' success this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when one stops looking at some of the more eye-catching
things at this camp, one always winds up focusing on Drew Bledsoe,
for there may not be another player with his ability to direct an
offense so effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly has no peer in terms of his significance to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, muggy morning before a thin crowd at the second day of
training camp, Bledsoe was making Mike Bartrum look like Ben
Coates. He'd make a throw with a soft touch downfield, then rifle
one over the middle. Even in practice, Bledsoe is far above anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing ugly about the 27-year-old gunslinger's game is
the right index finger he fractured when his follow-through took
his hand into Miami defender Shane Burton's helmet in a dramatic
game in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's legend grew further when he led the Patriots to
last-second wins over the Dolphins and Bills with the damaged
finger, before he couldn't continue, handing the reins over to
Scott Zolak, who went 1-2 the rest of the year, including a playoff
loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can crumble in 15 other areas, but if Bledsoe is
healthy _ as he claims he is _ they have a chance of staying in
games throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we come into training camp saying that we've got to
run the ball,'' said Bledsoe, ``and every year we come into the
season throwing it more than anyone in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made it to a Super Bowl with that philosophy.
Bledsoe threw the ball 623 times in the 1996 season and completed
59.9 percent of his passes. In the last two years under Pete
Carroll, Bledsoe has thrown it less _ 522 times in 1997 and 481
times in 14 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Patriots need Faulk to provide a strong running
game, they need to have Bledsoe throwing to his weapons all over
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're good at,'' said Bledsoe. ``We've got good
weapons in our passing game and we're going to throw a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe always has had Coates as his security blanket, but he's
not had Glenn for 14 games over the past three years. He can go
deep to the emerging Tony Simmons and veteran Shawn Jefferson,
underneath to Troy Brown, and now he has veteran Lamont Warren,
fullback Tony Carter, and Faulk, the team's major backs who happen
to be good receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to establish a running game to some extent,
but I think it's fairly obvious that the strength of our offense is
going to be the passing game and there's no denying that,'' said
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that over the past 10-12 years, the teams that have
won have been able to pass and run.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Bledsoe talks about the running game, he'd rather win
by throwing. It's the same mindset Dan Marino has had throughout
his career, and one John Elway had even at the end of his stellar
career when Terrell Davis was gaining 2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, let me throw it,'' said Bledsoe. ``That's always the
kind of football I've enjoyed. It does take a little bit of the
heat off if you can run the ball and get 4 yards on first down. But
at the same time, I'd rather win throwing than running. The bottom
line is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   With three Pro Bowls and the most passing yards by a quarterback
over the first six years of his career, Bledsoe reached the next
level in his development a year ago when he proved his mental and
physical toughness with his gutsy performances against the Dolphins
and Bills.
</P>
<P>
   With Elway out of the league, there's a chance for him to go
farther this year.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a quarterback in either conference with his arm. Now
he has to show that he can win the big game. He's been there, so he
knows what it would take this time around. And while it's obvious
Bledsoe can't do it without his teammates, there's no question he
holds the biggest stake in getting the Patriots a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has the ultimate amount of pressure on him,'' said
Carroll. ``We're faced with a tremendous opportunity and a
tremendous challenge. We're expecting everything to be first-class
out of this guy. He's prepared extremely well and he's ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first year in a while the Patriots stopped the
revolving door of offensive coordinators and quarterback coaches.
Bledsoe went from coordinators Ray Perkins to Larry Kennan to Ernie
Zampese. And his quarterback coaches have been Chris Palmer, Carl
Smith, and Jack Reilly. If he has his full arsenal, Bledsoe can
execute the precision passing offense Zampese implemented last year
but had to scrap because of an injured receiving corps. Now Bledsoe
can be precise and also take chances deep with a spread offense
that the Dolphins and Bills had trouble stopping a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to work with the same guy two years in a row,'' Bledsoe
said. ``That should be of benefit not only to me, but to our entire
offense, and hopefully we'll be able to advance because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe hasn't been shy about going to Glenn a lot in the first
two days of camp. He's worked Coates over the middle and Simmons
and Jefferson deep. He's thrown it long to Brown and to Vincent
Brisby, once a favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to get everyone on the team on the same page. He'd
like to keep team chemistry upbeat all year, believing that a happy
team will be a good team. Bledsoe has lost friends from the team
over the years, much as Milloy recently lost Willie Clay. One of
his best friends was Zolak, now with the Jets, and he had a special
bond with his center, Dave Wohlabaugh, and punter/quarterback Tom
Tupa, with whom he regularly played pool. The strongest thing he
ever said about the moves is he hoped the organization would have
done everything in its power to keep those players. He never blew
up _ and if one player is perhaps allowed to air his feelings, it
would be Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to accomplish some things,'' he said. ``We
need to keep people healthy and we need everyone working toward a
common goal.''
</P>
<P>
   One other thing irks Bledsoe: The Patriots generally have been
picked for fourth in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more a reflection of the strength of our division,'' he
said. ``It hurts a little bit to be picked at the bottom, but at
the same time we've got to go out and prove them wrong. That's as
simple as I can say it. Until we do, we don't deserve to have more
respect.''

REVIEW OF NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stevenson's New &AMP; Notable books:
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Oval Office'' &QL; 
By William Doyle (Kodansha, $28) &QL; 
What were they ``thinking,''``'' these powerful men who recorded
conversations that should have been left to our imaginations?
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a microphone hidden in his desk lamp, and
it preserved, among other things, his embarrassing responses to
civil-rights leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White, who in
1940 went to the Oval Office to push for integration of the U.S.
military. The tape of the meeting reveals the visitors to be
eloquent and firm, while Roosevelt is condescending and vaguely
racist. At one point, he addresses the issue of putting Black men
aboard Navy ships with this suggestion: ``Another thing (that) I
forgot to mention . . . is this. We are training a certain number
of musicians on board ship. The ship's ``band.'' There's no reason
why we shouldn't have a colored band on some of these ships,
because they're ``darn good at it.'' That's something we should
look into. You know, if it'll increase the ``opportunity,'' that's
what we're after. They may develop a ``leader'' of the band.'' And
consider this exchange as John and Robert Kennedy and their aides
deal with riots after James Meredith's attempts to register as the
first Black student at the University of Mississippi. JFK: ``It's
going to be a long fall in Oxford. I think we oughta get the
National Guard within, you know, shouting distance.'' RFK: ``Yeah.
We have control over the air. If you have gas, you got a pretty
good operation going. They got 500 marshals. You see, they're
sitting there, and they're throwing iron.'' JFK: ``Spikes?'' RFK:
``. . . spikes and they're throwing Coke bottles and they're
throwing rocks.'' JFK: What's Barnett (Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett) doing?'' RFK: ``I suppose laughing at us.'' (Laughter in
room.) VOICE: ``This reminds me a little bit of the Bay of Pigs.''
RFK: ``Yech!'' (Laughter in room.) Doyle looks at the bugging
habits of the past 11 presidents. The transcripts are brief but
fascinating, although they are faulty history. Less interesting is
the analysis Doyle offers as he explores the 20th-century tradition
of presidential eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weight of Dreams''By Jonis Agee (Viking, $24.95) &QL; 
Agee's new novel is so packed with stories that it's not easy to
describe. The central character is Ty Bonte, who has grown up on a
Nebraska ranch with an abusive father and a mother grown distant
after the death of Ty's younger brother, Ronnie. Ty is 17 when the
book begins and about to take part in an event that will govern the
rest of his life: One night, he and his friend, Harney Rivers,
brutally beat two Indians from a nearby reservation, and Tyruns off
before he can be arrested. He ends up in Kansas, where he builds a
life for himself as a horse trader. Now, 20 years have passed, and
although he is haunted by both Ronnie's death and that horrible
night with Harney, he has managed to reinvent himself enough to
begin a comfortable relationship with a woman who has secrets of
her own. It all goes well until Harney reappears and commits acts
so vicious that they make his previous sins seem like child's play.
All of this, astonishingly enough, takes place in the first 100
pages, leaving nearly 300 to resolve everything. This novel offers
violence, romance, ranch life, lots of horses, parental blame,
parental forgiveness, courtroom drama, a hate crime, lots of
remorse and even more redemption. And Agee's fans will be happy to
see Latta Jaboy and Cody Kidwell, characters from her novel,
``Strange Angels,'' who play supporting roles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for the Goal''By Mia Hamm (HarperCollins, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She can do anything he can do and better. Even Michael Jordan
must believe it by now. This book was released in April, but its
publisher is sending it around again for those of you who woke up
with the World Cup. Part autobiography, part soccer primer, part
paean to the joys of team play, it is earnest to the point of
stodginess, which just makes Hamm more admirable than she already
was. There are photos of skill and rough play, a glossary of soccer
terms, diagrams of maneuvers and even a page from Hamm's training
log, which we read but did not understand (New &AMP; Notable is not
intense). There are also words of wisdom, as when Hamm talks about
soccer's way of humbling its players. In any match, she says, there
are two opponents _ the other team and soccer itself. Sometimes,
you can outplay the different-color shirts. But you never beat the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Queen Mother's Century''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lacey &QL; 
(Little Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   She was awfully cute when she was little, and she's awfully cute
now. In between, there was a long succession of bad hats. And bad
jewelry, bad parasols, bad photo opportunities, as when she posed,
smiling sweetly, in a bombed-out London neighborhood after a Nazi
air raid. But if anyone could pull it off, it was the Queen Mother,
who was born in 1900 and whose plump, serene presence is certainly
a hook upon which to hang another century book. Lacey makes a lame
effort to mention news events over the years, but this is really
just an excuse to look at royal photos. Our favorite shows Princess
Margaret, Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother dressed in plaid
skirts and standing in a barnyard, frumpy women all. Queen Mum has
a Band-Aid on her shin and is gamely balancing a milk bucket on her
head. It's an improvement over those hats.

GRIFFIN SIGNS; TURNER NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics began Sunday morning by making Adrian
Griffin's one-year contract official. By the afternoon, they were
thinking about another deal that is almost a cinch to be made: the
signing of Wayne Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner impressed many in the organization with a Summer League
week at UMass-Boston in which he made more than 60 percent of his
shots and averaged 11 points and five assists. But it was his
final-seconds reverse layup against the Sonics Sunday that excited
everyone in the Clark Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino, watching the play from a press table, smiled and
clapped after Turner's shot helped keep the Summer Vacation Celtics
undefeated (14-0). Comedian Bill Bellamy, who was sitting
courtside, stood up and mimed the shot immediately after it went
through the net and gave the Celtics a 100-99 lead with 3 seconds
remaining. Long before the shot was taken, former college coach
Kevin Mackey looked at Turner and said, ``This kid is ready for the
NBA right now. I don't think people realize how good he is. And
look at his record (three NCAA title game appearances in four
years); he's a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of raves for Turner, who acknowledged that he
``had no idea'' the shot was going in the hoop. He does have an
idea where he'd like to work. ``I want to be a Celtic,'' he said
after the 102-99 win. ``I grew up here (in Mission Hill), so it
would be a great situation for me.'' Turner also pointed out that
his strengths _ playmaking and defense _ are what the Celtics want
from their lead guards.
</P>
<P>
   When Turner is eventually brought to training camp, it will not
be the only significant change to the Celtics' roster. There are
several areas/concerns that Pitino and general manager Chris
Wallace will be exploring in the next month:
</P>
<P>
   --The addition of Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old swingman received a guaranteed one-year deal
with a team option for a second season. Pitino said the
6-foot-5-inch player is one who can deceive you with his steady and
flawless game. The coach recalled a conversation he had with
assistant Jim O'Brien, who initially said he didn't think Griffin
could play for the Celtics. Then the team went to the LA Summer
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obie came back and I said, `OK, let's go over the roster,' and
we got to Adrian. Jim immediately said, `We've got to sign him.' ''
Pitino asked his friend why his opinion changed so quickly. O'Brien
told him, ``I just watched him. He didn't make one mistake in 10
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino envisions Griffin coming off the bench to score. Last
season with the CBA champion Connecticut Pride, Griffin averaged 19
points and 7.6 rebounds and was league MVP. He said he won't have
any problem in Pitino's system because the Pride ``tried to
actually imitate what Boston was doing as far as their full-court
press.''
</P>
<P>
   --The (failed) pursuit of Ruben Patterson; the possibilities of
Samaki Walker and Rodney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many teams watching the Summer League games, the Celtics
were interested in signing the 6-5 Patterson. Indiana president
Donnie Walsh watched Patterson defend and said, ``I love Ruben. Can
you imagine having to face him every day in practice?''
</P>
<P>
   But as hard as the Celtics tried to recruit him, Patterson
appears headed for Seattle. The Celtics still have an interest in
6-9 free agent Walker, although he never has played as many as 50
games in a season. The team continues to insist that rumors of a
sign-and-trade involving Walker and Ron Mercer are the wishful
musings of the Mavericks, Walker's former team. Pitino was
interested in Rogers, but he is leaning toward the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mercer/Tony Battie decision.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mercer, Pitino said Sunday that he believes the Celtics
offered the 6-7 guard a fair amount to extend his contract. Mercer
and his agent have said the number is unacceptable. Pitino said the
Celtics have to either find a way to give Mercer more money or
trade him. But it is unlikely that the team will be able to extend
both Mercer and Battie. And the 6-11 Battie has many fans in the
organization, especially after his 20-of-28 performance (71
percent) from the field in three games last week. It seemed that
whenever Battie was within 7 feet of the hoop, he was thinking
dunk. He was usually successful.
</P>
<P>
   --The status of Antoine Walker; the weight of Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   It is also becoming obvious that the Celtics are building the
team around Paul Pierce. If they could trade Walker for a
rebounding power forward, they would. But any deal involving Walker
most likely would be a three-way trade because of the complexities
of the forward's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics also have to wonder about Potapenko. He was
overmatched in the LA Summer League and had added 15 pounds that
the team viewed as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   --The status of rookie Kris Clack.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he likes the second-rounder's game but doesn't think
he can make the team this year. The Celtics still would like to
keep his rights, so they would like it if he played overseas for a
season.

ANCIENT HOHOKAM HALT WAL-MART PLAN: ARIZONA SITE MAY HOLD RELICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH GREENSPAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOLIDGE, Ariz. _ Five hundred years after their disappearance,
the Hohokam Indians are involved in a 20th century land battle _
this time against economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of a Wal-Mart store in Coolidge, scheduled to begin
in May, has been put on hold while company officials sort out
claims by archaeologists that the land contains valuable Hohokam
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's 35-acre plot lies across a highway from the Casa
Grande Ruins National Monument, the oldest archaeological reserve
in the country and the only national monument of the Hohokam Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an archaeological standpoint, it would be hard to pick a
worse spot to build on in Arizona,'' said Keith Kintigh, an
anthropology professor at Arizona State University who also is
president of the Society for American Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins date back to A.D. 1250 and are part of a critical
Hohokam period, Kintigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers across the Southwest are hitting historical
roadblocks these days as they make room for highways and housing
complexes.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California recently, archaeologists discovered an
unprecedented number of ice age animal fossils while building a
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in Chandler, archaeologists saved the bones of two
Colombian mammoths found on a housing construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists point out that it is rare to save remains
however. The state does not protect fossils or artifacts on private
land, and high excavations costs often lead developers to build
through ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago in Apache Junction, Ariz., a bulldozer
made quick work of an ancient Hohokam Indian pyramid to clear land
for a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Howard, curator of anthropology at the Mesa (Ariz.)
Southwest Museum, says that much of our heritage has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we destroy it, we're not going to get any Hohokam to do
it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Coolidge have a different take. They are upset that
the artifacts issue has held up a store project they say would help
their struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Gregory, of Coolidge, now has to drive 25 minutes to Casa
Grande to do most of his shopping, a trip he'd rather not make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather spend money in our town, not someone else's,''
Gregory said from his stool at a local diner.
</P>
<P>
   Spending money in Coolidge isn't easy now.
</P>
<P>
   Vacant, shabby storefronts just about equal the number of
diners, small shops and gas stations lining Coolidge's main road.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge City Manager John Baudek said the delay in building the
Wal-Mart has hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important piece to our growth as a city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more upsetting to Baudek is that city officials believed
they had an OK from archaeologists to build the store.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVANCY MADE A DEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Archaeological Conservancy, a non-profit group
that establishes archaeological preserves across the country, told
Baudek that it would not oppose development on Wal-Mart's site.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Conservancy's lack of opposition was part
of a deal it had struck with the landowner, Dalton Coles.
</P>
<P>
   In December, before he sold Wal-Mart its site, Coles sold the
Conservancy an adjacent 30-acre plot, with the agreement that the
Conservancy wouldn't oppose development of the Wal-Mart site.
</P>
<P>
   The group figured it was better to preserve a piece of the land
even if that meant agreeing to see the other site developed, said
Jim Walker, Southwest Regional Director of the Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Conservancy's silence, other archaeological groups
and Native American communities have come forward to stand in
Wal-Mart's way. These other communities, including the Salt-River
Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, Hopi Nation and Tohono O'odham
Nation, want Wal-Mart to build elsewhere in Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart put the store project on hold as soon as company
officials learned there might be artifacts on the site, said Daphne
Davis, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which purchased the plot for $285,000, is ``meeting
with involved parties to determine the next step,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who oppose building on the site, Wal-Mart
should have known about the contents of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prehistoric man didn't stop at the road,'' state preservation
officer Jim Garrison said. ``This has been known to be an important
site for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bohnee, spokesman for the Gila River Indian Community, who
claim to be descendents of the Hohokams, said his tribe wants to
make sure Wal-Mart ``protects burial sites, and other traditional
objects potentially there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull stepped into the controversy in May.
</P>
<P>
   She alerted the State Historic Preservation Office of the affair
after Roger Lidman, chairman of the Arizona Archaeology Advisory
Commission, asked for her assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But the preservation office has no power to resolve the issue
because the land is private, Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL LEGAL OBSTACLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only legal obstacle preventing Wal-Mart from building is a
1990 state burial law requiring company officials to return to
local tribes any burial remains they find.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists say it's very likely remains are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability approaches 100 percent for burials on the
site,'' said Lynn Teague, curator of archaeology for the Arizona
State Museum and coordinator of the state repatriation laws.
</P>
<P>
   If Wal-Mart chose to do so, it could dig up the site before
starting construction, pinpointing the burial sites and giving
archaeologists a chance to study other artifacts, Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be less of a hassle for Wal-Mart, since the builders
wouldn't have to stop in the middle of construction each time they
found remains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 16 meeting between Wal-Mart, Teague and Native
American communities, Wal-Mart said it would hire Northland
Research to make a test dig to sample the extent of the remains,
Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   Teague says she will meet with Wal-Mart after the test, which
she expects to occur in August, to discuss what the company will do
next: completely excavate the site or start construction. &QL;

MEXICANS HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The ball was bouncing loose in the penalty area in
overtime, with bodies jostling and sliding about. Cuauhtemoc
Blanco, Mexico's designated garbageman, went to kick it _ and
stepped on it instead. A second chance, a bit of open space, and
Blanco toed the ball into the back of the net from 5 yards out.
Yanquis, go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against us, it's just a typical Mexican goal,'' shrugged
defender Jeff Agoos, after the US was squelched, 1-0, in the 97th
minute of its FIFA Confederations Cup semifinal Sunday before
65,000 inside fabled Azteca Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the typical result for the Americans, who never (as
in 0-20-1) have beaten the Mexicans on the road since they first
ventured south of the border in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Yanks can defeat the Saudis (doused, 8-2, by
Brazil Sunday in a Guadalajara downpour) in Tuesday's third-place
match, it'll be their best finish in a FIFA tournament since their
bronze medal in the 1930 World Cup. ``If you look at the two teams
ahead of us _ Mexico at home and Brazil _ third would be a great
result,'' said keeper Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans thought they had a good chance at making
the final, they knew the odds were stacked against them. Besides
their 0-for-lifetime record down here against El Tricolor, they
were victims of the tournament draw and schedule, which was openly
tilted in the hosts' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play Friday night, travel, then play at altitude,'' said US
coach Bruce Arena. ``Very unfair. Mexico had everything going for
them. They had their whole team here, they were more rested . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did get two breaks they weren't counting on,
though. The temperature at match time (high noon) was 61 degrees
and rose to only 70. ``The weather was as good as it's going to get
here,'' said Brian McBride. ``It wasn't hot, and the air didn't
feel dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd, held down by exorbitant ticket prices and
Mexico's lackluster play in the prelims, was little more than half
of the eardrum-busting 115,000 that the Americans are used to
during World Cup qualifiers. Which meant that it was even better
than playing the Mexicans in Los Angeles. ``We came to Azteca and
had an opportunity to win,'' said Keller. ``We could have taken it
from them. They know they were in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the homeboys had most of the play, especially in the
final 20 minutes, Keller kept his mates even with eight saves.
Three were spectacular: a 10-yard ripper by Rafael Marquez that
Keller tipped over the crossbar in the 10th minute, a one-handed
stop on Ramon Ramirez in the 12th, and a block of German Villa's
running boomer from 6 yards in the 48th.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans had decidedly fewer chances, they had two
that could have been winners. But keeper Jorge Campos blocked Ernie
Stewart's shotgun blast from 8 yards in the 53d minute, and Cobi
Jones's shot glanced off the bar in the 66th.
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to overtime, with the Mexicans out of
substitutes and the Americans with two still available. Ben Olsen,
the 22-year-old midfielder who'd scored the winner against Germany,
was just about to come on for Jones when the Mexicans set up shop
in the US kitchen and the ball began ricocheting around like
Flubber. ``It was a scramble,'' said Keller. ``In most scrambles,
someone clears it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Blanco found the ball still at his feet with
Keller down, poked it through the sliding bodies, and put his mates
into Wednesday's final here against the Brazilians, who beat them
twice at the recent Copa America.
</P>
<P>
   Had this been a no-overtime World Cup qualifier, the rebuilding
Yanks would have left with a scoreless draw and a precious road
point, just as they did when they last came in 1997. ``We're
getting better,'' said Arena. ``To be able to play the Mexicans
even down here shows we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   And their performance in the tournament has submerged the bitter
memory of the Americans' instant exit from last summer's World Cup
in France. ``I think we've erased a lot of 1998,'' said midfielder
John Harkes. ``We'd done that even before we got here. We've moved
on.''

REVOLUTION DEFEND AGAINST ANOTHER SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The annual slump seems to have started. The
Revolution's 4-1 loss at Tampa Bay Saturday was their third in
succession, and now the players are hoping to avoid the MLS-record
nine-game losing streaks that plagued the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But they will have to either revert to the defense-first
mentality that marked the early part of this campaign, or at least
find a balance with a defensive scheme that complements what could
become a potent attack. They could be greatly helped by the return
of John Harkes and Joe-Max Moore from the Confederations Cup for
either Friday's visit to Colorado or the Aug. 12 match with San
Jose, though neither player can be expected to bolster the defense.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of the season, the Revolution were
competent and credible. Their goals were reasonable, as were
expectations. They were on a playoff pace, having earned 18 points,
scoring 23 goals, and allowing 23 goals. But they have collapsed in
the last three games, starting with a 5-2 loss to Los Angeles while
at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes and Moore departed after the Galaxy game, and the
Revolution have been outscored, 11-3, in the last three games. They
seldom seemed competitive against the Mutiny, as Mauricio Ramos and
Carlos Valderrama roamed the midfield uncontested. The Revolution
offense was boosted by striker Ariel Graziani, who displayed some
lethal touches, but they did not produce enough midfield spark to
capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was especially significant because it enabled the
Mutiny, playing their fourth game in nine days, to take over third
place from the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think this team has the makeup to get out of the
hole,'' Revolution captain Mike Burns said. ``No excuses for this
game, though. We looked like the team that had 48 hours of rest,
not them. It's disappointing because this was such a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution starters did not complement each other well
enough, and the team's obvious weaknesses in the back allowed the
Mutiny to keep constant pressure on goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up far too many chances, and Walter stopped it from
being worse,'' Burns said. ``They must have had 10 good chances,
and we haven't been allowing that. We've defended well this year,
but not in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too big a gap between positions. We weren't putting
good pressure on them in midfield, and everything had a domino
effect. We didn't put good pressure on Valderrama and Ramos, and on
offense we didn't create _ we were just kind of out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the start of another lengthy losing streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, but I'm optimistic,'' Burns said.
``We've made it more difficult on ourselves. We go from having a
6-point cushion, and now we are in a dogfight to the end, and we
have no one to blame but ourselves.''

WOODS, DUVAL STUDIO PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Lights . . . cameras . . . 7-irons!
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, Monday night you'll be seeing the premiere episode
of studio golf, the made-for-TV extravaganza in which Tiger Woods
and David Duval will duel over 18 holes of match play at Sherwood
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the purpose of this unprecedented prime-time
contrivance (8 p.m., Channel 5) is to determine the world's best
player, but it's really an excuse to hawk Motorola products and
hype ABC sitcoms. Serious golf fans, as opposed to wayward channel
surfers, know the only way to establish supremacy is through
legitimate competition, not some Madison Avenue boardroom
concoction.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, the scorching Duval was No. 1. By winning
three of four events before both finished as also-rans in the
British Open, Woods leapfrogged him, and nothing that happens over
this par-72, 7,025-yard Jack Nicklaus course Monday night _ when
the announcing team will outnumber the participants, 5-2 _ is going
to change that. A more fitting yardstick would be something trivial
like, oh, say, major championships, and between them, the world's
two top-ranked players have a career total of one, or half as many
as Mark O'Meara _ who, like the other PGA Tour interlopers, wasn't
invited to this private screening _ won last year.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one point of validity: the extremely rare
opportunity to see professional golfers engage in match play. In
that context, the so-called Motorola Showdown at Sherwood could
serve as an intriguing preview to the Ryder Cup Matches Sept. 24-26
in Brookline, Mass., where Woods and Duval will be prominent
members, however reluctant, of the US team that takes on Europe at
The Country Club. Even at that, there will be an element to this
match that both Woods and Duval claim is sorely lacking from the
Ryder Cup: obscene prize money for the combatants. The winner will
get $1.1 million, the loser $400,000, and while both have earmarked
$200,000 for charity, it sure beats playing for piddling
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Duval was about to tee off in this weekend's Greater
Hartford Open, where he finished 11th, his opinions hit the fan
when his question-and-answer session with Golf World magazine was
released. In it, he intimated that a Ryder Cup boycott could be
forthcoming if the prize money issue is not addressed. A day later,
amid a firestorm in which he was castigated by Davis Love, among
others, Duval retreated somewhat, claiming he had been speaking
hypothetically and that his answers may have been taken out of
context, a neat trick for a verbatim transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews supplied by the publicists of Monday night's event
_ you wouldn't expect an unscripted TV show, would you? _ both
Woods and Duval expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity to spread
the gospel of golf to nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it,'' Woods was said to have said.
``It's the first time that golf has been on prime time. We'll be
able to take golf to an audience where it traditionally hasn't
been. That's great for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a lot of fun,'' went quotes
attributed to Duval, who never looks as if he's having fun on or
near the course. ``It gives us an opportunity to kind of expose the
game in a little different light, in a different time frame, on a
different day, and probably to a different crowd than would usually
see the game.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't see all of this game. The match won't beam onto the
network until a half-hour into the proceedings, by which time two
or three holes will have been played. Perhaps the viewing public
will get to catch up on tape, if it doesn't conflict with Drew
Carey promos.

GEIBERGER GETS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 HARTFORD OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ For a few fleeting moments, Brent Geiberger's
runaway to his first PGA Tour triumph in the 48th Greater Hartford
Open at the TPC at River Highlands hit the skids. Before he had
time to worry about it, he left the 17th green after a watery
double bogey, knowing well that the victory walk up the 18th
fairway was still his to make.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a finishing bogey out of a trap, Geiberger finished at
18-under-par 66-63-66-67_262 to shatter by five strokes the course
tournament record held by Greg Norman (1995) and Stewart Cink
(1997). On an inviting layout that lured low scores, even runner-up
Skip Kendall (66_265) and third-place finishers Mark Calcavecchia
(64_266), Justin Leonard (67), and Ted Tryba (68) bettered the
former mark.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger, whose father, Al, was playing in the PGA Senior Tour
Utah Showdown in Park City and is remembered most as Mr. 59 since
he was the first to shoot that low on the regular tour, started his
round at 9 a.m. because of threats of severe weather (which never
materialized) and made the turn at 5 under, and suddenly the rest
of the field was playing for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Brent got off to a great start,'' said Kendall.
``I'm not exactly sure what it was, but every time I loooked up he
made another birdie. I knew the back side, pretty much, and unless
something really drastic happened to him on 15 through 17, we were
playing for second. All of us. I mean, he was already 20 under par.
So I pretty much knew we were playing for second place.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a joy ride for Geiberger, who had immersed himself in
basketball at an early age and played through his first year of
junior college before realizing golf was his forte. It's
interesting how he played in streaks. He was 1 over through eight
holes Thursday and birdied the next five. He birdied four of the
first six holes on the back nine Friday. He played a stretch of
nine holes in 7 under to overcome a rocky start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the final round, he was 15 under _ just 1 under on the
front nine, but 14 under on the back. He reversed that in Sunday's
breezes by making the turn in 5-under 30, but he played the
incoming nine 2 over with just a solitary birdie on the par-3 16th
when he hit an 8-iron to 3 feet. The 17th and 18th turned out to
take just a little luster off the performance Mr. 59 would hear
about in great detail later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After his drive on 17 went into a trap, Geiberger went for the
green in two, and it hit the back and backed up into the water.
Shades of Jean Van de Velde in the British Open? Geiberger went
back 100 yards, hit it to 15 feet, and took two putts. ``I was
surprised,'' said Geiberger of his second shot. ``I felt it would
be on the back of the green. I thought I hit it well. I still had a
four-shot lead.'' The walk up 18? ``It was special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was won over the front side when Geiberger
birdied the second (pithching wedge, 20 feet), third (8 iron, 12
feet), fifth (3 iron, 15 feet), seventh (6 iron, 8 feet), and
eighth (pitching wedge, 6 feet). He made the turn five in front of
Tryba and six in front of Leonard, who would earn enough Ryder Cup
points to jump from ninth to seventh on the point list for the
matches that will be contested Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club. The
five birdies in eight holes was hard to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice,'' said Geiberger, who was adopted at the age of
3. ``I tried to keep a nice level for myself. Not get too up or
down. I knew I was playing pretty well. I tried to hit fairways and
greens. I knew I was putting really well. I knew I had a good feel
for the greens. That was nice to shoot 30 and get myself off to a
decent start because I knew guys were going to be shooting decent
scores. I wanted to go out there and play my game today. I knew I
was capable of shooting a decent score.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who is also in pursuit of his first PGA Tour win,
birdied the second by sinking a 20-foot downhill putt and the third
when he hit a wedge to 3 feet, but he would manage only two birdies
the rest of the way. ``I'd like to win my first tournament,'' he
said, ``and I feel I'm on the verge.'' Perhaps next year at the
venue of first-time winners. Phil Blackmar (1985), Mac O'Grady
('86), Mark Brooks ('88), Billy Ray Brown ('91), Cink ('97), Olin
Browne ('98), and now Geiberger hit their first jackpot at River
Highlands.

</HEADLINE>
 200-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ As his truck spun and went hurtling toward the
wall in Turn 1 at New Hampshire International Speedway, Dennis
Setzer acknowledged, he thought, if for only a second, that his day
was done. Shrinking into his seat, Setzer braced for a violent
impact after he was rear-ended by Greg Biffle, but it never came.
Setzer managed to bring his truck to a stop within inches from the
wall, making what turned out to be the biggest save of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer rebounded from that altercation, which dropped him from
fifth to 22d, worked his way back to the front by passing Mike
Wallace for the lead on Lap 155, and won Sunday's NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series event, the 200-lap feature of the Pennzoil/VIP
Discount Auto Center tripleheader, before an NHIS crowd of 19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, a 39-year-old native of Newton, N.C., held off runner-up
Wallace and third-place finisher Stacy Compton, the pole-sitter, in
a two-lap shootout after the resumption of racing following Bobby
Hamilton's wall crash in Turn 1 on Lap 197. Setzer got a good jump
on the restart and steered his No. 1 Mopar-sponsored Dodge Ram 1500
to its third checkered-flag finish of the season after victories at
Texas and Nazareth, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But Setzer knew none of it would have been possible had he not
kept his truck from making a close encounter of the concrete kind
midway through the race on Lap 94.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we didn't touch the wall no worse than we did,
everything was going to be fine, but it was just one of those
unfortunate deals,'' said Setzer, who pocketed $45,630 for Sunday's
triumph, the fourth of his career, which helped him remain in
fourth in the points standings with 2,463. ``We didn't bump the
front tires, so everything's OK as long as you don't bump those
front tires in a deal like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he wince, anticipating wall contact?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Setzer said with a smile. ``I was drawn up in the
seat, waiting to hit the wall, and looking in the mirror to see how
fast it was coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Setzer avoided contact and brought his truck back
into the pits without so much as a scratch, needing only fuel and
four fresh tires. While Setzer dropped to 22d, Biffle was relegated
to the rear of the field when NASCAR officials cited him for
``overaggressive driving.'' Biffle, winner of five races this
season and four of the previous six, rallied from 24th to finish
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what happened when Greg got into the back of
me,'' Setzer said. ``I didn't check up and there hadn't been any
contact between us prior to that. We were lucky that we only
flatspotted the tires and didn't damage the truck. Once we changed
the tires, we knew that we had to work our way back through the
field in order to gain track position before the next caution flag
came out.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't occur until Lap 146, when the race's seventh yellow
was unfurled because of a fluid spill in Turn 2. After he gave a
mighty chase to Compton, running a close second on the track,
Setzer dove into pits for an 11-second pit, only to be beaten out
by Wallace, who emerged first out of pit row after his crew ripped
off a 10-second stop.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, though, surged to the point and took the lead for good
on Lap 155 when he dove inside of Wallace in Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really shows that Dodge has done their homework this
season,'' Setzer said. ``There has been so much work done in the
offseason, and I'm proud to be associated with Dodge and Mopar.
This race team is incredible. They made some great calls this
afternoon, and we were able to come from the rear of the field and
we spun and win this race. It's a credit to this team and Dodge.''

</P>
<P>
   Tom Carey of Orange, Mass., recorded an emotional victory _ the
first of his career at NHIS _ in the 100-lap Busch North Series
event and dedicated his $23,125 triumph to Mike Cianfarini, a
Riverside Park track official from East Longmeadow, Mass., who died
of cancer a week ago Sunday at age 26.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hirschman, of Northampton, Pa., became a two-time winner at
NHIS this season when he won the 100-lap Featherlite Modified
Series event.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschman, who won the first of three Featherlite Modified
events at NHIS last month, led four times for a total of 80 laps,
including the final 11, to finish ahead of runner-up Ted
Christopher of Plainville, Conn.

ADVANTAGE, RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Between chanting the usual insults that are as much a
part of a visit from the New York Yankees as pinstripes and
passion, another sellout crowd at Fenway Park could have taken a
moment to serenade the team they love to hate with a chorus of
``Auld Lang Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, was the Bombers' last scheduled visit to Yawkey
Way this century, barring a rendezvous in October when a pennant
would be at stake, affording the Sox a final chance this millennium
to lift the curse of You-Know-Who.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Sox fans in the crowd of 33,553 Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
bade the Yankees good riddance, but not before the New Yorkers
threw a mighty scare into the Sox before falling, 5-4. That gave
the Sox the rubber match of a weekend set in which they solved
Cuban nemesis Orlando Hernandez a night after grounding the Rocket,
Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of great games between these teams,''
said Red Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who retired the last 14
Yankees he faced and didn't walk a batter in seven innings to run
his record against the Bombers to 10-5 lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say this was one of the greatest ones, but there
was a lot of entertainment for the fans. Anyone who paid for a
ticket tonight got their share of highs and lows from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, down 5-2 after the Red Sox knocked out Hernandez
with home runs by rookie Brian Daubach and Troy O'Leary (his
team-leading 20th), scored twice in the eighth inning off Sox
closer Tim Wakefield. They then loaded the bases in the ninth on a
leadoff double by Chili Davis, a two-out walk to Scott Brosius, and
an infield hit by Chuck Knoblauch, gloved deep in the hole by Nomar
Garciaparra to keep the tying run at third.
</P>
<P>
   But Wakefield, who stranded Bernie Williams at third in the
eighth after the second triple of the night by the Yankees' center
fielder made it a one-run game, ended the game by inducing Derek
Jeter to tap to second baseman Jose Offerman, who got the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough one, it was ugly, but Jeter hit a ground ball
to end the game,'' said Wakefield, who held on for his 14th save in
15 games. ``It was ugly for me, but Sabes pitched a great game and
I was glad to preserve a win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who leads the American League in batting and is a leading
candidate to be the league's MVP, went hitless in his last 14
at-bats here, striking out three times and hitting into three
double plays.
</P>
<P>
   He had battled Wakefield through a 13-pitch at-bat in the eighth
inning, which allowed Knoblauch to steal both second and third,
before striking out. ``That took forever,'' said rookie Trot Nixon,
who singled home the Sox' first run despite shattering his bat.
``Wake battled, Jeter battled, and Wake won the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, with a chance to reverse that outcome, Jeter swung
at a 2-and-0 pitch. That, said Yankees manager Joe Torre, was
evidence of a rare instance in which his star shortstop was
pressing at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I expect him to swing at that pitch? No,'' Wakefield said,
``but I'm glad he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was equally surprised. ``If Wake falls behind
3-and-0,'' he said, ``the next pitch is a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   A playoff date seemed a remote possibility on Friday night, when
the Yankees pinned on the Sox a 10-run defeat that conjured
memories of the Boston Massacre, circa 1978. That night, the
Yankees looked every bit as intimidating as the 1998 powerhouse
that deserved its team-of-the-century consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But another Yankees-Sox go-round looked considerably less
farfetched Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. With one three-game set left to be played
in New York next month, the Sox have won five of nine head-to-head
meetings, four of six in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen spotted the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the first on Paul
O'Neill's double and Williams's triple and was touched for another
run in the third, but then set down 14 in a row from Williams's
sacrifice fly in the third to Shane Spencer's grounder to
Garciaparra to end the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In the matchup between El Duque and Team Duke, Hernandez came
into Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's game undefeated. Four times since he defected
from Cuba, the righthander had started against the Sox, and he'd
gone 3-0 with a no-decision and a 1.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players in the Sox starting lineup _ Damon Buford,
Daubach, Offerman, O'Leary, John Valentin, Nixon and Jason Varitek
_ were a combined 4 for 53 against Hernandez, whose grab bag of
pitches and arm angles are as varied as the last Cuban pitcher to
wear pinstripes: El Tiante.
</P>
<P>
   But after Buford doubled and scored on Nixon's single in the
third, Daubach hit a majestic home run into the right-field seats
in the fourth to tie the score, then doubled and scored the
go-ahead run in the sixth when Garciaparra dumped a single into
right field. O'Leary then hit Hernandez's next pitch into the Red
Sox bullpen for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach had gone hitless in his first nine at-bats this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy (Williams) talked to me before the game, told me to try
and relax,'' Daubach said. ``This was probably the worst I've
struggled all year. Actually, I wasn't expecting to play today. The
way I was swinging the bat, I wouldn't have put my name in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   By night's end, of course, he was glad Williams did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else tonight,'' Daubach
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, there were a lot more Red Sox fans here tonight.
I guess a lot of Yankee fans had to go home.''

FINLEY HERE TODAY, HERE NEXT YEAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Now that pitcher Chuck Finley is staying put
through this season, the next order of business for Anaheim Angels
general manager Bill Bavasi is getting him signed for next year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk that Finley could get a two-year deal worth
$7 million per season, but beginning serious negotiations is up to
him. Finley acts as his own agent, so Bavasi doesn't want to
distract him from his pitching by opening up talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it kind of hard because I'm used to dealing with
agents,'' Bavasi said. ``You can say things to agents you wouldn't
say to your players or even your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Angels didn't trade Finley, they certainly can't let
him sign somewhere else without getting compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have pitching,'' Bavasi said. ``It was
important that we signed him three years ago, and it will be
again.''
</P>
<P>
   One might think Finley would like to see the team make the
necessary improvements before he decides to come back. However, he
realizes he needs to pitch better these last two months if he's
going to command top salary. He's 5-10 with a 5.76 ERA in 22
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to see improvement in myself to be asked to sign
here,'' he said. ``I'm not going to knock on Billy's door and tell
him what we need. He knows already. I've got to get myself
straightened out and not worry about the rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Return delayed: Jim Edmonds was supposed to join the club
Sunday, but because he was scratched from the Lake Elsinore lineup
Saturday, he remained with the Single-A club to get at least one
more day's worth of at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds had a knot in a muscle on his left side _ unrelated to
his surgically repaired right shoulder _ that trainers were able to
rub out. Yet it prevented him from playing. Sunday, he went 3 for 5
and is now 9 for 20 in five rehab games.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to join the Angels tonight.
</P>
<P>
   __ Belcher coming back: Pitcher Tim Belcher, out since June 26
with a broken right pinky finger, is expected to return to the
starting rotation and start Friday's game against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   __ Batting changeup: Mo Vaughn was dropped from third in the
batting order to fifth for Sunday's game. And it was Vaughn who
brought the idea to manager Terry Collins. Garret Anderson moved
into the No. 3 spot and Tim Salmon remained the cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it (Saturday) and I may have suggested it,''
Vaughn said. ``Garret's swinging good and Timmy's taking his walks.
(Opposing defenses) can't shift on me (with runners on base). I
said I know I came here to hit third, but this is what I see. And
he said all right, we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to get Vaughn up more often with runners on base.
However, on Sunday he batted with no runners on base in all three
of his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starter up in air: The Angels haven't made a decision on who
Tuesday's starter will be. It could be Mike Fyhrie, who is
currently in the bullpen, or one of two Triple-A pitchers _ Scott
Schoeneweis or Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins wouldn't say who it will be, but he did
mention who it wouldn't be. Highly touted Ramon Ortiz, at Triple-A
Edmonton, is likely to be up before rosters are expanded beginning
Sept. 1.

SABERHAGEN GOT SOX OFF TO GOOD START

 SOX-SABERHAGEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Finishes are designed for drama. And sometimes a good
start can be overlooked by a bases-loaded thriller in the top of
the ninth. You could argue that was the case in the series finale
between the between the Yankees and the Red Sox at Fenway Park
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, Bret Saberhagen led the Red Sox to victory.
He surrendered just five hits and two earned runs in his 15th start
of the season. The veteran righthander who thrives on big games
also retired the last 14 batters he faced and didn't walk a hitter
for the ninth time this season, improving his record against they
Yankees to 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be ahead to be successful against everybody,''
said Saberhagen about retiring 14 in a row. ``You've got to work
ahead in the count and keep them off balance. You've got to make
them think out there. I was able to do that and just hit some
spots. It's a big part of my game and making them earn their way
on. I was happy to battle and pitch as well as I did. The arm
hasn't been feeling well since the All-Star break. I was happy to
do what I did as long as I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Added manager Jimy Williams: ``He pitched a really good game for
us, I mean seven good innings against that lineup. We had to fight
back. We got some big hits at the right time, but he really set the
tone with those seven innings he pitched. Strong performance . . .
With times up and down in seven innings, I thought he'd done his
job. I thought it was time to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the number seven remains significant and not just because
it matched Saberhagen's season high in innings for the third time.
The Red Sox failed to get solid starts in the first two games of
the series. The disastrous 1 1/3-inning performance by Mark
Portugal was followed by just four innings from Brian Rose. The
starters' lack of staying power stretched the bullpen. While the
home side fell behind early, Saberhagen remained steady and left
with his club ahead, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it easy for me tonight was winning (Saturday),'' he
said. ``It really took a lot of pressure off me. I was able to go
out there and not overthrow, stay within myself . . . I think
everybody loves to rise to the occasion. When you've got meaningful
games out there you just seem to concentrate a little bit more.
I've been fortunate to go out and do well in a lot of those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen did well after he settled down and made a few
adjustments with his off-speed pitches. After surrendering two hits
and a run in the first inning and retiring the order in the second,
Saberhagen knew he had to concentrate on keeping his curveball and
changeup down. Three out of five hits he gave up came on offspeed
pitches up in the strike zone. Bernie Williams hit a curveball for
a triple to center in the first. Chuck Knoblauch singled off a
curveball. Paul O'Neill sent a changeup to left for a double in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen didn't use his curveball all that much after the
first few innings, showing it only to keep batters off balance.
However, he established his fastball and that was a big part of his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get up for a Yankee game or an Indian game,'' he
said, ``you can't get up for any games.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Indians in town Monday, it's time to forget dramatic
finishes and start all over again.

OAKLEY HAS FEELERS OUT
</HEADLINE>

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Charles Oakley dropped into Los Angeles to
play in Magic Johnson's charity golf tournament, and, by the time
he leaves, he might be playing for Johnson's old team.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley will be walking the fairways of Mountain Gate Country
Club today, but his ulterior agenda includes a meeting with Los
AngelesLakers officials, who are in dire need of a bruising,
rebounding power forward.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old veteran fits the job description. But 10 teams
are seeking his services, including his present team, the Toronto
Raptors, who can pay him the most money. The Lakers can only pay
him $2 million, unless they work a sign-and-trade deal with
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley might be willing to play here for less, with a
championship the ultimate payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to see what happens. Money ain't the big
thing right now,'' Oakley said Sunday night, sitting courtside at
Johnson's charity basketball game at the Forum. ``It's about the
(players') attitudes and everybody wanting to do the same thing
every night on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley repeated that sentiment several times, sounding like a
man more concerned with the Lakers' suspect heart than its
available cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the foundation is here'' to win a title, he said. ``A
lot more little parts need to be added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta know everybody wants to be on the same track. If I
come here, there ain't going to be no bull. I'm all about
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said he didn't expect to make a decision while he's in
town, ``Unless they show me so much housewarming and get my
attention and just make me feel like I've been here 10 years. You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry, the Lakers' undersized stand-in at power forward,
said Oakley would be a good addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be best for the team. I don't think what's
best for the team is me trying to bang with Karl Malone,'' Horry
said. ``I don't really know Oak personally, but I think he's the
kind of guy that will do anything for a team to win. Anytime you
got a guy who can do that, it's a good fit.''

REFUGEES WEIGH RETURN TO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four months ago, Lummije Vlashi fled Kosovo when
Serbians ravaged her small town, executing ethnic Albanians. Now
the 22-year-old spends mornings at Woodland Hills adult school,
learning English and the ways of America.
</P>
<P>
   Even with peace breaking out in her homeland, she wants to stay
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing left in Kosovo,'' Lummije said in English
during a morning break at the Hughes Adult Learning Center.
``Everything is gone, and there are still troops. I want to stay. I
want to learn. I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, her 43-year-old uncle Ibrahim Vlashi is eager to go
back, because he is ``homesick for my Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for a young man to learn in America, and difficult
for older men,'' the former concrete factory worker said, also in
English. ``I have three children here and they all want to stay. We
will stay some time and let them grow up some more, then we will
decide if we all go or if they stay.''
</P>
<P>
   These two views reflect the conflict _ split mostly along
generational lines _ for the 33 Kosovar refugees who moved to the
Los Angeles area during the Serbian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even with their homes and town in shambles and stories of
persistent unrest throughout Serbia, older members of the Vlashi
family hope to follow the 300 New York refugees who left for Kosovo
last week _ the first to return since the NATO bombing campaign
ended.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Vlashi youths would rather start life over in
America. They have hopes of schooling, jobs, stability and, most
important, living free of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I want to stay,'' said 17-year-old Sevdije
Vlashi. ``America will be good. I feel safe here.''
</P>
<P>
   All Kosovar refugees have one year from their arrival date to
decide whether they want the United States to repatriate them. The
Vlashis have until May to decide whether to take the offer of a
free flight to Kosovo, said Miriam Prum Hess, spokeswoman for the
Valley Jewish Federation, which organized the Vlashi resettlement.
After that, they must find their own way home.
</P>
<P>
   If they choose to stay, the Vlashis can apply for citizenship
after four years and nine months, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is not one to take lightly, and in some cases
requires Solomonic wisdom, as families decide whether to split.
</P>
<P>
   Hajrush Vlashi's parents, the family patriarch, Hisman, 59, and
his wife, Shefije, 52, made the difficult decision to split up the
family if they return home. Their youngest son, Ahmet, 10, will
stay with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like he will be fine here,'' Hajrush Vlashi, a West
Hills man who brought 33 of his family members to Los Angeles after
the conflict escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one family so far _ my cousin Shukuri _ has for sure
decided to stay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them know it will be difficult, that they will have to
start over again, but the adults would like to be home instead of
being a refugee in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vlashi family came from the blue-collar town of Hani-Elezit,
where a concrete factory was the major industry. Some were truck
drivers, security guards or supervisors. Others were skilled
craftsmen or professional musicians. The women were housewives.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five months ago, Serbs stormed into the town and planted
land mines in the wooded area where the five brothers lived on the
same block. On March 25, the army and Serb police began torching
houses and killing ethnic Albanians. The Vlashis fled about three
miles, across the Albanian border, to stay with a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Those horrors made the decision to stay in the San Fernando
Valley easy for Shukuri Rexha, a cousin of the Vlashis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our homes are destroyed. We have nothing to go back to,'' said
Rexha, who brought his 21-year-old wife and 2-year-old son to the
valley along with his 14-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope here. We want to start over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vlashi clan's stay in the Valley has been eye-opening,
exposing the refugees to the difficulties of life in America as
well as the warmth of the culture. The family members have moved
into modest apartments in Chatsworth, Northridge and Culver City,
with the help of generous landlords offering discounted rent.
</P>
<P>
   They're learning to budget an average $1,400 monthly government
assistance, which includes up to $500 per month in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teen-agers already have mastered the Los Angeles bus
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of the kids know the buses better than I do,'' Hess
said. ``It just amazes me. They are learning fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they have a long road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not rich by any means. Everyone is doing their best
to help get them training and jobs _ to help them to become
self-reliant,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Training for jobs is a requirement for long-term temporary
residency in United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Vlashi said supporting his family of five is too
difficult on $850 in government aide and $355 in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo I could find a job and be able to support the
family,'' said Ibrahim. ``Maybe I will find a job here and I will
stay. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   And finding jobs is a matter of time, their teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are making furious progress in their language
skills. Two months ago many couldn't speak a word of English. Now
they can hold conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how fast they are learning, especially the
younger ones,'' said their adult school English teacher, Liz
Koenig-Golombek.

SLAM WINS SUMMER LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ After a thumb-numbing, 24-day hitchhike,
the Fat Lady finally arrived at the Pyramid on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And while she warmed up to belt out the closing notes of the
30th Summer Pro League, a team called Slam was chiming in with a
full-scale, trapping defense that put away the L.A. Pros, 117-109,
in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of Clipper point guard Pooh Richardson as
its lone NBA voice, the Pros sabotaged their own efforts with 30
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to sour notes, they weren't exactly goin' solo.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 23 days, the SPL seemed to honor its original
mission statement as employment office for undiscovered players.
But - between the lines - day 24 was a bit hairy.
</P>
<P>
   And it's official. Yeah, we mean referees. Due to a scheduling
blunder credited to the officials themselves, only two showed up to
work the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few bookie-defying roster adjustments, too (just
kidding), but the league's altruistic purpose was served when
Slam's Matt Garrison earned Most Valuable Player hardware.
</P>
<P>
   On the count of three ... Matt who?
</P>
<P>
   Well, unless you're a Biola groupie, the 6-foot-8 Garrison
probably is a stranger to you. But here's how popular he became
Sunday -- when it was over, a kid asked the 26-year-old Garrison
for his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty wild,'' said the versatile Garrison, whose MVP
performance included a game-high 25 points and 11 rebounds.
``That's definitely good for my resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we give you the resume roundup: Attended Billings Senior
High in Billings, Mon. and played collegiately at Biola. His
two-year, post-Biola tour included professional stops in the USBL,
IBA and some league in Austria. Mixed in were spiritual hoop tours
with Crossfire Ministries and Athletes In Action.
</P>
<P>
   His next goal is the NBA, right? Nah, this guy's as realistic as
he is religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get into the CBA,'' Garrison said. ``I don't know
how much this will help, but I think I deserve a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other championship-game stars who deserve to get paid to play
include former Lakewood High, USC, Laker and globetrotting point
guard Duane Cooper. The 30-year-old Cooper, who was added to the
Slam roster for its playoff run, did nothing more than win the game
by making wise decisions. His seven assists and 17 points -
including a 4-of-7 effort from behind the 3-point line - didn't
hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Checking in as SPL star material for the L.A. Pros was 6-6 power
forward Damien Cantrell, who used up his eligibility at the
University of San Francisco in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless Cantrell scored 18 points and grabbed 15 rebounds
Sunday. He probably could be had by some European team for a song.
</P>
<P>
   If justice gets involved, he won't be hearing the Fat Lady for a
while.

CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bragging rights are the best. Nobody remembers that the
Red Sox got clobbered by the Damn Yankees Friday night. Two out of
three ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Yankees were in a mood to tip their hats to the Olde
Towne Team after Sunday night's 5-4 loss to Boston at Fenway Park.
Why not? They came within one ground ball out of winning a superbly
played game. At the very least, they were able to recognize that
the Red Sox are not going to be a team they can take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into Boston is exciting,'' said Yankees manager Joe
Torre. ``And you want to beat this ball club, just like they want
to beat our brains out. But you never take any club for granted,
especially this one. Jimy Williams has done a terrific job. I know
he didn't come over here with any fanfare. But he has milked this
ball club and the guys are doing a good job. He's big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that held on to a narrow victory Sunday &UR;  &LR; night didn't
look anything like the sorry bunch that went down to a 13-3 loss
Friday night. For the third time in the series, New York took the
lead and seemed headed to an easy victory. For the second straight
time, the Red Sox came back and then held on with strong _ well,
adequate _ relief pitching. Bret Saberhagen left after seven
impressive innings with a 5-2 lead. Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield
came on, and normally a Red Sox victory would have been a piece of
cake.
</P>
<P>
   Not against the Yankees, who scored twice in the eighth and
loaded the bases in the ninth with two out. That Wakefield escaped
might seem ordinary to some. But it's a big thing when your closer
can come in and shut down a Yankee club that is playing well these
days. The Red Sox played better in a series that drew more than
100,000 to Fenway. There'll be twice that many at Yankee Stadium
when they meet again in September.
</P>
<P>
   And you can bet New York won't be taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we'd like to have won all three games,'' said Derek
Jeter, who grounded into a force at second in the ninth to end the
game. ``Today, it didn't happen. But all the way to the ninth
inning we had a chance. You tip your caps. They played well and
beat us two of three. We can't dwell on it. We've got to play
Toronto next and then go to the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter doesn't mind carrying whatever blame there is on his
shoulders. With the bases loaded, he swung at a 2-0 pitch. He said
he knew what he was doing. It just didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good my last time up with Saberhagen,'' he said. ``And
then I had to face Wakefield and I didn't do as well. It was a
strike, a knuckleball he left over the middle of the plate. You
look for a strike, he threw a strike. I didn't hit it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre had no problem defending Jeter. The Yankee approach to
Wakefield is painfully simple. Look for a pitch you can drive up
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an adjustment,'' said Torre. ``He did the thing you
try to do against a knuckleballer. You don't try to pull it. You
try to hit it up the middle. He just couldn't find a hole. Derek is
struggling. I don't care how good you are. When you stop getting
hits, you get a little anxious. That's where he is and he'll work
his way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not a team that will win 114 games this season.
But they play very good baseball. Two double plays and several
running catches remind that they are one of the best defensive
teams in the game. Bernie Williams ran down everything in sight,
and for good measure hit two triples and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out here and played good baseball,'' he said. ``Our
clutch hits didn't come today. It's disappointing because we felt
we had a chance the last two games. It's tough to take a loss by
one run. But you have to give it to them. They made the right
pitches when it counted and were able to capitalize on our mistakes
and score some runs. Despite not having their regular closer, they
were still able to win two of three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox lead the season series, 5-4 (4-2 at Fenway), and
trail New York by 5 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also won't take Saberhagen lightly next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept burying that ball in on us,'' said Torre. ``The ball
was going right after us. That's the Saberhagern you remember. Very
aggressive and he threw the ball good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Wakefield on the run. We got two in the eighth and we
had the bases loaded in the ninth. We were fine. We just couldn't
get that one big hit. In the absence of (Tom) Gordon, he's done a
good job for them. He could pitch every day. It's not like your
normal closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you win the first game of a series you have high
hopes. But it wasn't be.''

MARINERS COMPLETE SWEEP OF ORIOLES; WILSON STEALS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From the Safeco Field bulletin board, we have a few
new entries posted, tacked up intermittently Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lost: Two fly balls in the sun by Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Found: Jeff Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Lost: Mike Mussina's unbending domination of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Found: The lost art of bunting.
</P>
<P>
   Lost: A sellout, as empty upper-deck seats would seem to
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Found: A 45,149 sellout, a club official explaining that a
corporate sponsor failed to distribute 5,000 seats it had
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   What all this added up to was a day of the unexpected, with the
Mariners keeping adversity at arm's length while squeezing out a
3-1 victory over Mussina and the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome left the local club with a four-game win streak and
a sweep of the Orioles in a three-game series at home for the first
time in franchise history. Nothing was conventional about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had just three hits, none through the first five
innings. Dan Wilson stole home. Lou Piniella ordered bunts from
three consecutive batters. And, hold on, Jose Mesa went 1-2-3 in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good series for us,'' Wilson said. ``There's a lot
of things to take from it besides getting wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost was Fassero coming back from trade-deadline purgatory
to outduel Mussina. The night before, the left-hander attended a
wedding (Shawn Buhner's), fully expecting to be served with his
Mariners divorce papers. Fassero was the club's most shopped-around
guy. He didn't go anywhere. A Boston deal came undone at the last
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero next was expected to push aside all distractions and
match pitches with the American League's No. 1 active arm, and this
while suffering through a season-long slide. However, Fassero was
at his best, limiting Baltimore to one run in six innings, a run
caused by the two lost fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams wanted me obviously,'' Fassero said. ``Three or four
teams were really interested. Boston went to the last hour. It
didn't happen. I look at it like I got traded to a team six games
out of the wild card spot. Maybe we can catch Toronto or Boston or
whoever is ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey went 0-for-2 against Mother Nature, ducking away from
sixth-inning balls hit by Harold Baines and Jeff Reboulet, blinded
by the sun. The first ball to fall in led to the game's first run,
the second left Baltimore with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw either one of them,'' Griffey said of the fly
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Consoled Piniella, ``If Junior can't catch it, it can't be
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners escaped serious damage in the inning when Fassero,
his pitches turning wicked again, struck out the next two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, Mussina had won 12 of 13 decisions against
the Mariners, including two in the playoffs. Without a doubt, they
were his favorite whipping boys. But on June 2, he gave up a
three-run eighth inning and lost 4-2 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Mussina (13-6) got bunted to death.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't allow a ball out of the infield through three innings.
He had a no-hitter through five. He had people thinking David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth inning, Russ Davis smacked Mussina's first
pitch to left field for a double. Next up, Brian Hunter
successfully completed the first of four bunt attempts by Seattle
batters, moving Davis to third. David Bell tied the game with a
sacrifice fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Mussina permitted his second hit of the game,
watching John Mabry's liner hit off the glove of a diving Rich
Amaral in center. There would be no more swings for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson bunted down the line to Baltimore's Jeff Conine, making
just his fourth appearance at third base and first defensive play
there ever. The lack of work showed.
</P>
<P>
   Conine, playing for Cal Ripken Jr., who was scratched from the
lineup because of stiffness in his back, skipped his throw past
first, allowing Mabry to score with what would be the winning run.
Wilson was credited with the Mariners' third and final hit. But the
inning was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Davis bunted to Orioles first baseman Will Clark, moving Wilson
to third. With Hunter crouched in a bunt position, Wilson took off
running from third and scored when the pitch bounced in the dirt
and away from Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen base, Wilson, and a giant was slewn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I could have done differently,'' Mussina said.
``It's a funny game. Look at how we scored _ two balls lost in the
sun in one inning. You never would have seen that at the other
park. I thought I pitched pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott and Mesa finished up the last three innings on the
mound for the Mariners in hitless fashion, one gaining his second
victory, the other his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Found: A Seattle team with a sense of purpose.

LEAKAGE HAS GRIFFEY LOOKING FOR LIFE RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The good news for Mariners fans was that the local
club won 3-1 Sunday, making for a weekend sweep of the Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The better news is that no one died, either from green wieners
or pop flies.
</P>
<P>
   The dubious dogs have been a persistent threat since the Guilty
Pleasure opened, but the pop-fly danger almost wiped out Ken
Griffey Jr., who was nearly clobbered Sunday by balls camouflaged
as sunbeams.
</P>
<P>
   Although only one run resulted from the consecutive sixth-inning
solar flares, Griffey was in no mood to chat about it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he hasn't been in much of a mood to chat about
anything lately.
</P>
<P>
   Grouchy and irritable are two of the more polite terms used by
people around the club to describe Griffey recently. He was the
first to admit he was, to borrow loosely from the lexicon of the
new yard, red critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been mad for 10 days,'' he said finally in the clubhouse
in response to repeated inquiries. ``I don't say anything, and
people ask me what's wrong. Then I say I'm upset, and they wonder
why.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has been irked by stories about details of contract
extension offers made by the Mariners. He smells a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the information didn't come from me, my wife or my
agent,'' said Griffey, referring to a recent reported offer of $135
million over eight years. As he was with previous attempts by the
M's to re-sign him well before his contract expires after next
season, Griffey was non-committal.
</P>
<P>
   Saying neither yes nor no is, in his mind, imperative. To say
yes now means linking for his career to a franchise that has made
only a tepid commitment to winning during the offseason as well as
the weekend's trading deadline, despite the presence of a
revenue-rich stadium. To say no, he said, ``makes me the bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems Mariners ownership is determined not to make the same
mistake with Griffey as it did with Randy Johnson. By not making a
serious contract extension offer to their best pitcher, the bosses
were blistered by criticism. This time around, a paper trail of
millions will be left that can be pointed to, should Griffey walk.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Griffey has had long closed-door sessions with
manager Lou Piniella and general manager Woody Woodward. He wants
as many clues as possible about the team's direction. If he learned
much, he wasn't saying Sunday, but his demeanor didn't suggest his
heart was light with the virtues of summer, baseball and the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   As one drenched in the championship lore of Cincinnati's Big Red
Machine, Griffey reiterated his insistence on playing for a genuine
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be working on my golf game in October,'' he
said, ``Sure it's fun to play with Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara
(neighbors near his Florida home), but that's not what I do for a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey mentioned last winter's failure to replace Johnson or
sign a marquee position player. While he seemed OK with the
attempts in the last week to gain pitching, he was more upset with
the fact that an ownership he needs to trust found it necessary to
leak what he considered private business.
</P>
<P>
   His feeling was similar after word earlier in the season that
ownership was using the impending free agency of Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez as leverage against the Public Facilities District in its
argument over stadium cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership linked the surpluses generated by stadium-specific
taxes to their ability to re-sign both players. It was intimated
that Seattle doesn't get the players without the additional taxes.
Griffey raged then, complaining that he was being used in an
argument not of his making, with the potential to set fans against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the club on one hand had really done something in the
offseason to make the team better, then it might have been easier
to ask with the other hand,'' he said. ``Instead ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the club, at 51-53, is staring up at the Texas Rangers
and Oakland A's in the AL West, as well as Toronto and Boston in
the wild-card race. Except for Texas, all made substantive moves at
the trading deadline to get better, while the Mariners added minor
league pitching and subtracted offense and payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners may get a little something out of the young
pitching, but the moves generate little enthusiasm, certainly not
enough to overcome Griffey's pique.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly the first star player to lament about a team's lack
of initiative or creativity. What is unique about his position is
he:
</P>
<P>
   --Has been with the organization for 13 years, which is longer
than all the owners and most of the employees;
</P>
<P>
   --Is the game's most popular and talented player, and
</P>
<P>
   --Delivered them baseball's most spectacular, lucrative revenue
source.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be sufficient for most resumes. But it seems
ownership also wants him to be bargaining chip, recruiting tool
and, if need be, bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   There are some days, like Sunday, when simply playing center
field is more than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Cranky? He's entitled.

MARINERS SOAR AFTER RELEASE OF TRADE PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What do you do when you wake up and you're still a
Mariner?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero and Russ Davis had the answer. They went out to the
ballpark and helped the Mariners win.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to post-trading-deadline baseball, a place where the
Mariners are undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are riding a three-game win streak and calling
themselves wild-card hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah. And right in the middle of their longest homestand
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   We are here to celebrate these small pleasures since it helps
take our mind off the big picture _ which is cloudy and confusing,
if you like your home team to strike the pose of a big-market,
do-anything-you-can-to-win contender.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, did you hear Alex Rodriguez's new nickname?
</P>
<P>
   It's Shea-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the East Coast version of A-Rod's nifty moniker
and it comes from the New Yorkers whose new hobby, besides staying
cool, is visualizing Rodriguez in the royal blue pinstripes of the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   We think Rodriguez still looks pretty darn good in Mariner blue.
(Or is that black the Mariners are wearing on their new, super-dark
jerseys?)
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Rodriguez would play in Shea Stadium. Ergo,
Shea-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rodriguez has heard about Shea-Rod, not that he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good name,'' Rodriguez said Sunday inside wondrous
confines of Safeco Field _ the Mariners' new ballpark so big, so
beautiful, so outdoors that Ken Griffey Jr. lost two high flies in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rodriguez is still here. He is still our A-Rod, not that
there was much doubt ... this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Saturday's trading deadline, the Mariners'
other superstar was guaranteed by club officials there was no way
he would be shipped out as the clock hit midnight Eastern Daylight
Time, a la Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Mariners' flirtation with trading-deadline deals _
not to mention the wild rumors and innuendos that surfaced on TV
Saturday night regarding Rodriguez and the Mets _ came to an
inconclusive close.
</P>
<P>
   While all the big signs point to trouble in Marinerville, since
what happens to Griffey and A-Rod are our major preoccupations, the
little signs this past weekend weren't all that bad, considering.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, we loved Brian Hunter scoring from second on
Griffey's ground out in Saturday's win. You know what they say
about speed ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what deals they've made. I think ever since they
acquired Brian Hunter, there is an understanding about the reality
that we need a little bit of speed and to put pressure on the other
guys because we can't keep outslugging everybody,'' said Davis,
another Mariner about whom the front office conducted
trade-deadline talks. But instead of being shipped to the Padres,
Davis' trade died with the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, happy to still be here, nailed a double and scored the
tying run in the sixth _ the rare dent against Orioles ace Mike
Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the deals the Mariners made early last week in
trading David Segui for relievers Tom Davey and Steve Sinclair and
Butch Huskey for minor league reliever Robert Ramsay can't be
dismissed as inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the really big deals that boost a ballclub,''
Davis said. ``To the front office and to me, those deals were
something really important because we needed help in that area. I
consider those deals to be big deals.''
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of deals, or the lack thereof, Fassero woke up
Sunday and was still a Mariner. He started the game and, for a nice
change, it was a really good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a wedding (Saturday night) so the deadline was well
past before I got home,'' said Fassero, the 36-year-old
free-agent-to-be whose mechanical breakdowns have led him to a
disastrous 4-12 record and made it all but mandatory for the M's to
try to shop him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, though, Fassero pitched six solid innings in an engaging
duel with Mussina that reminded you of the Fassero of 1997, when
Fassero should have been credited for 20 wins, except that the
bullpen blew so many games that he left with the Mariners leading.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fassero, too, who won that single game in the '97 playoff
series against the O's, leaving Johnson to get beat twice by
Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   Could Sunday's post-deadline debut be the real Fassero again?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to think so, especially Fassero, who has
fought himself all season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero and the Mariners probably deserved the reprieve from
torment Sunday. After weeks of speculation about his trade, Fassero
was understandably frustrated when he commenced his postgame
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm not surprised I'm still here. After reading in
the papers how there really wasn't anything worth trading for, I'm
not surprised at all,'' Fassero said, poking at accounts of how his
career might be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lefty seemed relieved over his good day at the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time all season I didn't fight myself out
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, it was nice to see Fassero and Davis chip in for a
nice Sunday in the park. Everyone in a Mariner uniform, at Safeco
or watching the game on TV deserved that kind of break.

HOLMGREN IN HIS ELEMENT ON FIRST DAY OF SEAHAWKS PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ For almost 2{ hours Sunday morning, the
multititled and up-to-his-eyeballs-in-responsibilities Mike
Holmgren was just a football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why he couldn't hold back a smile as he strolled
onto the field at Eastern Washington University for the first
practice of the Seahawks' first training camp under Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day. This was fun,'' said Holmgren, who was
hired away from the Green Bay Packers in January and given the
cumbersome and all-encompassing title of executive vice president
of football operations/general manager and head coach. ``I love it.
This is the most fun for me. Once we get out on the field, there
isn't a lot of paperwork, just football. So it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork elements of his new job came later.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren conferred with senior vice president Mike Reinfeldt and
vice president of football operations Randy Mueller to discuss the
only two players not in camp _ unsigned first-round draft choice
Lamar King and leading receiver Joey Galloway, who is seeking a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also met with vice president of communications Gary
Wright to book times for interview requests and to go over other
non-football-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Holmgren was back on the field in 98-degree
heat doing what he likes best and, at this point, does best.
</P>
<P>
   The morning practice ran a tad long, ending at 11:10 a.m. rather
than the scheduled 10:45. That's because Holmgren huddled the
entire team around him twice during the workout _ first to explain
in exacting detail just how the next segment would and should be
run, then to emphasize with animated anxiety that mistakes cannot
and will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we jump offsides or something like that, he'll call us up
and tell us, `First of all, great effort ... (BEGIN ITAL) but (END
ITAL) we will eliminate these mistakes and we will not be a team
that makes these mistakes because we won't win,''' offered running
back Ricky Watters, who was a rookie for the San Francisco 49ers in
1991 when Holmgren was the team's offensive coordinator. ``He makes
his point and the point is clear. He's not degrading anyone or
putting anyone down, he just tell us, `You can't do these things
and play on this team.'''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who you are, or how good you are.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have talent _ more than the team Holmgren inherited
in in 1992 in Green Bay, where he led the Packers to six straight
playoff appearances and two Super Bowls; too much to go 8-8, as the
Seahawks did last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always so quick to say, `We're one of the most talented
teams in the league.' But talent only gives you an opportunity to
win,'' said All-Pro linebacker Chad Brown. ``There are a lot of
little things you have to take care of in order for you to win
football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Like not dropping passes. Like not jumping offsides. Like not
fumbling the snap. Like not making a play despite being on the pass
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were guilty of each in Sunday's practices, as they
began knocking off the rust that accumulates when the players and
coaches are off for almost a month before reporting to camp.
</P>
<P>
   That's knocking in its most literal sense. Each practice
featured a session that included tackling _ on the first day of
camp. And it was Holmgren who kept score, awarding the play to
either the offense or defense and challenging the ``losing'' unit
to bounce back on the next snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, today was a little less physical than the first day
last year,'' Brown said. ``But it was a little more crisp, a little
more disciplined. Coach Holmgren emphasized a lot of little things
and we're going to have to take care of those little things.''
</P>
<P>
   As Holmgren's actions proved, he will not tolerate mistakes. He
expects precision and demands accountability. There are so many
rules that some might seem a bit too rigid _ no rags or scarfs
under helmets; no tank tops at the dining hall; no jerseys
untucked. But they are attention-to-detail edicts that eventually
will translate to better execution on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has told me since I got the job that this is a very
talented team,'' Holmgren said. ``Unfortunately, they were ranked
27th in the league in defense and were 8-8. Talent is great to
have, but what does it mean if you're 8-8? We have to take our
talent and become disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's first step onto the practice field was a giant one in
that direction.

M'S BOSS SHRUGS OFF REPORT OF GRIFFEY SR. REPLACING PINIELLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two Griffeys won't be standing side by side again in
the Mariners outfield any time soon. But, according to an Ohio
newspaper, one might be positioning the other defensively in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News reported yesterday that the Mariners might
be considering firing manager Lou Piniella and replacing him with
Ken Griffey Sr. in an effort to retain center fielder Ken Griffey
Jr., whose contract runs out after the 2000 season. The source was
an unnamed baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Sr., the Cincinnati Reds' bench coach, was the Mariners'
batting coach in 1993, Piniella's first year with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed about this possible scenario on Saturday, Griffey Sr.
told the Daily News, with a smile: ``That might be the only way to
keep Junior. He said he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Shown the article in the Safeco Field pressbox yesterday,
Mariner president Chuck Armstrong shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reaction,'' he said. ``You hear those things all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his manager's position is secure, Armstrong replied,
``Piniella's signed through 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   STANDING PAT: Third baseman Russ Davis was in the Mariners
clubhouse yesterday before game time when Griffey walked up and
engaged him in current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still here?'' the center fielder asked kiddingly, offering
a handshake. ``Congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday night's trade deadline passed, Davis was
convinced otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mariners beat Baltimore 5-2 in a day game, the Alabama
native went home with his wife and two children to their Issaquah
apartment, put some chicken on the barbecue, turned the television
set to ESPN and awaited the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I was expecting a phone call,'' Davis
said. ``I don't know why. I got that feeling. Yeah, I really
thought something was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' name had been passed around freely during weeks of trade
speculation, with the San Diego Padres said to be his most ardent
pursuer. He had heard reports that the Boston Red Sox were willing
to send pitcher Jin Ho Cho and a young third baseman, Wilton Veras,
to the Mariners for pitcher Jeff Fassero _ a scenario that
seemingly made Davis expendable.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Davis struggled in the field, making 34 errors,
but never once thought he was Mariners trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the infielder has cut his errors to eight and is
hitting .235 with 19 home runs and 49 runs batted in. But a deal
was on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason I thought my Seattle days were over,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A change of scenary is not what Davis desires and Seattle suits
him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Davis said. ``I don't know if people
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says the fact he becomes arbitration-eligible with his
contract after this season might have the Mariners shopping him
around.
</P>
<P>
   He says his average could be higher, but he has solved his
defensive problems. He rates himself among the top third basemen in
the AL.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Mariners potentially having to shell out unwieldy
contracts to Griffey and Alex Rodriguez, Davis considers himself a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get better every year,'' he said. ``I'm still an
affordable guy. I'd love to stay here. I hope things work out in
Seattle. I don't want to be a guy that moves around all over the
place. As long as I'm happy, that's all I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want all that extra crap, millions and millions of
dollars. I just want to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING DOING: Woody Woodward, vice president of baseball
operations, said he received one late offer and had two on the
table when the trading deadline expired. Of the two standing deals,
the Mariners nixed one and another unnamed club vetoed the other.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he talked to every club except Texas about trade
possibilities. He wanted a position player or a veteran pitcher.
Most clubs wanted Mariners pitchers John Halama or Gil Meche, or
pitching prospect Ryan Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Fox TV caused a stir in the Mariners clubhouse after Saturday's
game by suggesting shortstop Alex Rodriguez might be headed to the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea where that came from,'' Woodward said. ``We had
not one discussion about Alex.''

 SUB   h,4,48,eb rc  Eddie _ the Man and the Myth
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; rt wrapper i  &LR; I f Eddie DeBartolo Jr. is leaving town to
less-than-rousing acclaim from all quarters, nobody will understand
that better than Eddie DeBartolo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The former 49ers owner's philosophy seemed to be, to paraphrase
Yogi Berra, ``It's over when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, DeBartolo dispatched coach George Siefert after
Eddie fell in love (football-wise) with a younger coach. We can
quibble over semantics, but Siefert left with Eddie's Gucci
toe-print on his wallet pocket.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference where the 49ers fumbled to explain the
easing-on-down-the-road of their highly successful coach, somebody
asked Eddie about the 49ers offensive coordinator, whose job was
thought to be in jeopardy. To that point, the team had issued no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo doesn't talk much in public, but he snatched the
microphone and snarled, ``He's gone!''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was a good owner because he was willing to spend huge
and because he created a family atmosphere that led to a winning
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But any claim that Eddie was a  &LR; great  &LR; owner rests upon whether
he personally  &UR; discovered  &LR; Bill Walsh or wisely followed some
brilliant advice in hiring the man who created the 49er dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard to overlook a few things that Eddie did:
</P>
<P>
   He drove out Walsh, then Siefert.
</P>
<P>
   He forked over a briefcase stuffed with cash to Mr. Shady
Character, and when threatened with prison time, turned state's
evidence against Shady.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, some say, showed its priggishly PR-conscious side in
coming down on DeBartolo for his extensive gambling ties and the
misdeed. But gambling, even the legal side of it, is a very real
threat to the integrity of the NFL, and the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL punishing an owner for paying bribe money in a gambling
deal isn't the same as the NFL fining a player for letting his
socks sag.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of OSTLER02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Hey, Eddie did good, Eddie did bad. His five rings won't be
forgotten. Now:
</P>
<P>
   He's gone.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WAIT A MINUTE,  &LR; says Nate Cohn, legendary S.F. attorney. If Linda
Tripp is being indicted in Maryland for allegedly violating
wiretapping laws, they've got to indict Ken Starr, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nate should know. He wrote the wiretapping laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn used to be very close pals with Jess Unruh, the late
speaker of the state Assembly. One day, Unruh phoned Cohn and said,
``Nate, don't call me at my office anymore. Everyone in Sacramento
is bugging everyone else's phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said, ``Why don't you put a stop to it? The law says it's
legal to record someone if one party is aware of the taping. Why
not make it illegal unless  &LR; both  &LR; parties are aware of the
taping?''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Cohn got a call from another close pal, private
eye Hal Lipset, famed for hiding a microphone in a martini olive.
Lipset said, ``Nate, your pal Unruh wants to pass a law on
wiretapping that will put me out of business. Please stop him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't,'' Cohn said, ``it was my idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Unruh not only got the law passed in California, but also used
his vast influence to spread the law around the country, and now
the Maryland version of it is being used to nail Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to indict Starr, too,'' Nate says, ``because he
granted Tripp federal immunity and encouraged her to do the
wiretapping of Monica, but he can't grant her immunity if he's a
conspirator. Without getting a federal court order, or state court
order, he suggested that she tape Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; GRASSROOTS  &LR; mayoral candidate Jim Reid had his grass ripped off,
roots and all.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is so grass rootsy that he's the only candidate who can
speak from personal experience about the conditions inside local
jails, homeless shelters and Muni busses.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of OSTLER02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  He drives a pickup truck with a campaign billboard mounted in the
bed, rising out of a real sod lawn he planted for the recent Garden
Show and which symbolizes his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The sod was lifted while Reid was in a meeting of the Green
Party.
</P>
<P>
   If the grass was ripped off by an old hippie, the thief is
probably trying to decide whether to smoke it, drink it or putt on
it.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SATURDAY MORNING,  &LR; Karl Hittelman checked his e-mail and found a
solicitation from Standard &AMP; Poor's ``Personal Wealth,'' an info
service.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was touting a new BusinessWeek Online feature: ``Day
Trading Doesn't Have to Be a Blood Sport.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; I MENTIONED  &LR; that my editors rejected my Muni-like strategy of
demanding a pay raise in return for promising to actually show up
for work.
</P>
<P>
   Suggests G.W. Farmer, ``Perhaps you should try promising  &LR; not &LR; 
to show up for work in exchange for a big pay raise.''
</P>
<P>
   G.W., you idiot. You think I didn't try that  &LR; first? &LR;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 1, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATION-SCHOOL-REVIEW (Celebration, Fla.) _ Trouble in
educational paradise: When the Celebration School first opened
three years ago in this town created by Walt Disney Co., it was
ballyhooed as an educational gem designed by top experts from
across the country. It was to be a world-class institution that
would take children from kindergarten through 12th grade using the
most advanced educational methods. But now, parents are withdrawing
their children from the school. By Douglas Frantz. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DICTATORSHIP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent developments in
China indicate that totalitarian regimes, already flummoxed by the
fax machine and the cellular phone, may be facing the biggest
high-tech challenge of all in the Internet. By Barbara Crossette.
(`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   RAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Atlanta office massacre seemed to
some like another gruesome indicator of a trend toward workplace
violence and rage. But it is far from clear that what has been
dubbed `workplace rage' is really on the rise, say researchers. And
similar doubts have been raised about other so-called `rages,'
namely road rage and air rage. Anecdotes are being christened as
trends, says one expert. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   WRITING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Creative individuals are
`workshopping' short stories, novellas and plays. Others have
screenplays or theater pieces `in development.' Still others engage
in `content' creation. They create content, or `provide' it, for
the Internet. Actively productive souls everywhere are developing
scripts. Workshopping books. Providing content. Doesn't anyone
WRITE anymore? Why don't they call it WRITING? By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-ASYLUM-REVIEW (Undated) _ No one denies that their stories
are horrific: rape, beatings, genital mutilation or the threat of
it. But foreign women seeking asylum from violence at the hands of
family members in their home countries have received a mixed
welcome in the U.S. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   HEAT-TV-NEWS-TEXT-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at contrived segues
to the weather on happy-talking local New York television
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ME.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Me.com, an Internet start-up
and IPO opportunity. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the Woodstock riot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-LEFT-REVIEW (Montevideo, Uruguay) _ The left in Latin
America is doing well with voters in part because it has shucked
old ideological trappings and moved toward the center. Its
acceptance of democratic pluralism and compromise, mixed with hefty
dollops of self-criticism and the rejection of old doctrines and
platitudes, are helping the left re-emerge as a winning force in
much of Latin America. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-FUNERALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Weren't funerals supposed to
be solemn affairs, where mourners whispered the right words and
shop talk was taboo? You wouldn't have known it last week in Rabat,
the setting for the latest in what this year in the Middle East has
become the year of the power funeral. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POLITICS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ What ever happened to the
moderate Albanian leaders in Kosovo? As the young fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army take control, Ibrahim Rugova, the diffident
and puzzling pacifist who was considered Kosovo's president, has
remained abroad, leaving his party and his reputation to wither. By
Steven Erlanger.

   GIVE GREED A CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   As the three-day happening called Woodstock '99 twanged to a
halt, a handful of revelers went wild, setting fires, looting and
even, by some accounts, raping. So now historians, who delight in
drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of
pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round
30-year interval since the original bash.
</P>
<P>
   Take those $4 bottles of water _ a sign of ``Commercialstock,''
as one festival-goer put it. But you don't see people burning up
trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
</P>
<P>
   As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills _ a
close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or
just plain old greed?
</P>
<P>
   Has life become one big violent video game? The reports of
sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has. Has media madness
taken over? Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home
to watch this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a
professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas
mask.
</P>
<P>
   But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it
was wet then, dry now. How does the poem go? ``Some say Woodstock
will end in fire, some say in mud''? Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   What now? Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from
the town that happens to bear that name? Or will the turn of the
millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
</P>
<P>
   And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear
those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?

   A SPOT FOR THE ETHICALLY CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how this society loves its sports stars! It pays them in a
single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year. It puts
them on towering pedestals. It deifies them.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the
mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special. The world's petty
rules don't apply to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider parking spaces for the handicapped. Athletes, one might
reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks. Their
physical prowess is so _ gosh! _ awesome that they should be able
to leap over vast parking lots in a single bound.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of football players at the University of California
at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in
their specialness. Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking
various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting
applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped
parking permits for the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at
all amused. As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse,
protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats
must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean
six months in jail, so the players got off easy. Each one was
suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to
pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service,
half of it with the Special Olympics. That should get them in shape
to jog across a parking lot.

   A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting
rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before
killing himself as the police tried to arrest him. Another 12
people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds. The police later
discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death
in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the
shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district. Officers finally
caught up with him in nearby Cobb County. In a note left near the
bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that
greedily sought my destruction.'' He wrote that he regretted
killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children,
Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living
without parents.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of
his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama. The
authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge
him.
</P>
<P>
   AN ARREST AND A CONFESSION IN THE YOSEMITE MURDERS
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of
three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February
were safely locked away on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the
man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the
motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a
suspect when he was interviewed in February.

   President Clinton settled Paula Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct
lawsuit last year for $850,000, hoping to be done with the sordid

settled added to that cost last week.

   UMPIRES FLIP-FLOP
</P>
<P>
   When your team loses, it's the umpire's fault. Every baseball
fan knows that. But umpires, perhaps tiring of the whipping-boy
role, decided to lash out. Barred from striking, though, they just
submitted resignations en masse _ certain that this would be a
devastating tactic. But the leagues said, go ahead and quit; we'll
hire replacements. No, wait, the umpires said, we didn't mean it.
But it was too late: a third of the 66 union umpires are out of the
game, though their leader still vows a ``fight to the death.''

   NEW RULES FOR REPORTING SHIPBOARD CRIMES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Facing rising concerns in Congress and elsewhere about crime on
ships, the cruise-ship industry adopted a uniform standard for
dealing with the investigation and reporting of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents 90
percent of the cruise business in the United States, said its
members agreed to report all allegations of onboard crime to the
FBI and other appropriate law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the cruise ships let victims decide whether to
report crimes, and some victims and their lawyers complained that
there was pressure to cover up assaults. Carnival Cruise lines said
there were 108 accusations of improper sexual conduct by crew
members in a recent 5-year period.

move would reward an oppressive government. But supporters said
engaging China was more productive than isolating it.

   Molecular biologists have finally succeeded in a seemingly

cancers and a third that allows cells to keep doubling without
limits. Scientists hope to use these precisely engineered human
cancer cells to find better ways to detect and treat cancer.

extra work they did as a result of his lying about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.

   INDICTMENT FOR TRIPP
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp was indicted by a Maryland grand jury on two charges
of illegal wiretapping related to her secret tapings of
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. Mrs. Tripp's spokesman said she
would plead not guilty and was the victim of a ``campaign of
politically motivated vengeance.''

   UMPIRES FLIP-FLOP
</P>
<P>
   When your team loses, it's the umpire's fault. Every baseball
fan knows that. But umpires, perhaps tiring of the whipping-boy
role, decided to lash out. Barred from striking, though, they just
submitted resignations en masse _ certain that this would be a
devastating tactic. But the leagues said, go ahead and quit; we'll
hire replacements. No, wait, the umpires said, we didn't mean it.
But it was too late: a third of the 66 union umpires are out of the
game, though their leader still vows a ``fight to the death.''

   It took a while, but finally it arrived. More than a century

``unconditional apology'' for its actions. Gandhi died 51 years
ago.

   NEW RULES FOR REPORTING SHIPBOARD CRIMES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Facing rising concerns in Congress and elsewhere about crime on
ships, the cruise-ship industry adopted a uniform standard for
dealing with the investigation and reporting of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents 90
percent of the cruise business in the United States, said its
members agreed to report all allegations of onboard crime to the
FBI and other appropriate law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the cruise ships let victims decide whether to
report crimes, and some victims and their lawyers complained that
there was pressure to cover up assaults. Carnival Cruise lines said
there were 108 accusations of improper sexual conduct by crew
members in a recent 5-year period.

   Relations between China and the United States are at a low, but
the House voted 260 to 170 to extend trade benefits for another
year. The annual renewal of trade privileges came amid allegations
that China stole American nuclear secrets, and critics said the
move would reward an oppressive government. But supporters said
engaging China was more productive than isolating it.

   MAKING CANCER GROW
</P>
<P>
   Molecular biologists have finally succeeded in a seemingly
simple task: to turn a normal human cell into a cancerous one. In
the end, it took just three genes, two that are associated with
cancers and a third that allows cells to keep doubling without
limits. Scientists hope to use these precisely engineered human
cancer cells to find better ways to detect and treat cancer.

   To: Potential Investors
</P>
<P>
   From: me(AT)me.com
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Internet Start-up and Initial Public Offering
</P>
<P>
   It's not just young upstarts from Silicon Valley or Silicon
Alley anymore. Even the old freight-delivery dowager UPS is
declaring itself an Internet player (it ships a lot of stuff bought
on Web sites) and announcing that it is going public. The IPO craze
has reached the point that the stock exchanges themselves are
hatching plans to sell shares. So I believe the time is right to
take the Internet-IPO phenomenon a pioneering step further, which I
plan to do, with my new company, me.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company promises to be an extraordinary opportunity for a
select group of investors, and I'm giving you a chance to be one of
them. Since I am in the pre-IPO stage, the exact details of my
company are still a closely guarded secret. Good buzz, as we all
know, can be worth billions in today's frenzied market.
</P>
<P>
   A careful blend of mystery and hype are key ingredients in the
marketing plan of any good Internet start-up. As part of the
comprehensive marketing strategy, I will also be shaving my head,
piercing two or three body parts (as yet undisclosed), and lying
shamelessly about my age.
</P>
<P>
   The company is positioned across three markets with explosive
growth potential _ the Internet (see company name above),
intellectual property (I have lots and lots of ideas) and the human
genome project (hey, I have as many genes as anyone else).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the company's losses are already mounting. But as we all
know, in the Internet era there are no losses, only investments. In
the hyperspeed land grab for mind share and market share in the New
Economy, actually making money is a character weakness _ a sure
sign of a worrisome lack of imagination in not being able to come
up with more and more ways to spend money. The financially meek,
after all, will not inherit the high-tech economy's Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Me.com has already attracted the financial backing of Dick
Digit, the Internet visionary and co-founder of harebrained.com, a
company I regard as nearly as path-breaking as my own. Dick, of
course, is now a gazillionaire because harebrained.com was acquired
only four months after it was founded for a stupefying sum by a
major computer company desperate to jump on the Internet bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to the company's long-term (a maximum of six
months) strategy, which is founded upon two plans that are
calculated to trigger results. Plan No. 1: Create some buzz and
persuade Microsoft that America Online is anxious to buy me.com,
which will prompt Microsoft to buy the company so that its
archrival will not get it. Plan No. 2: Plan No. 1 in reverse.
Convince America Online to snap up me.com to keep it out of
Microsoft's clutches. Either way, me.com is a decided winner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I think I should say a bit about an aspect critical to
business but regrettably neglected in most Internet start-ups _
management. The management structure and philosophy behind me.com
is, I'm proud to say, one of its unique features. It is the
ultimate ``lean'' company, quick and responsive, distinctively able
to react faster than flame mail over a T3 line. Me.com has a
totally flat organizational structure, no layers of bureaucratic
flab bogging down the decision-making process. I am the chairman,
chief executive officer, chief technology officer and sole employee
of me.com. It's all me, just me.
</P>
<P>
   Addendum: F.Y.I.
</P>
<P>
   The Net being the Net, if you actually go looking for www.me.com
on the Web, as many of you wannabe gazillionaires will doubtless
do, it will indeed take you somewhere, though, unfortunately not to
me(AT)me.com. Last week, Net surfers would find a page that was
part of the corporate Web site for Job 1 Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., a company that provides ``financing and strategic services
for start-ups.'' But Brian Job, a graduate of Stanford and the
Harvard business school, said he had just sold off the Web address,
or domain name, to an eager bidder. And like everything else on the
Net, me.com is changing fast.

   &UR; The Murder of Helen Jewett: The Life and Death of a Prostitute
in Nineteenth-Century New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Cline Cohen. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In 1836 it was possible to kill and get away with it, at least
if the victim was less than respectable. That is one of the lessons
of this history, which centers on the notorious bludgeoning of a
young prostitute by her lover, a small-time embezzler. ``Cohen does
a masterly job of identifying the mysteries at the heart of the
case,'' Janet H. Murray said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Natural History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Maureen Howard. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, Conn., the author's hometown, is a prominent player
in her sixth novel, first published in 1992. It deals with the
Brays, Irish Catholics whose patriarch, Billy, was the police
detective investigating the local murder of a soldier by a
socialite during World War II. The book details how the episode has
molded the lives of his grown children. John Casey wrote that the
novel is ``a synergy of Maureen Howard's meditative social vision
and storytelling immediacy, of her highly developed technical skill
and of her alert heart.'' Howard's autobiography,  &UR; Facts of Life &LR; 
(Penguin, $12.95), has also been restored to print. Reissued with a
new afterword, it chronicles her working-class girlhood with
parents who were ambitious for Howard and her brother but deeply
ambivalent about their children's successes. The book is
``interesting and enjoyable,'' Diane Johnson said in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salt Water &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A reimagining of Turgenev's novella ``First Love,'' this story
unfolds in the summer of 1963. The narrator, then 15, falls for an
older girl, who, he later discovers, is in love with his father.
The novel ``is a small masterpiece,'' Katharine Weber wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Black Notebooks: An Interior Journey &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Toi Derricotte. Norton, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a poet and teacher, is a light-skinned black woman.
In this memoir she examines the consequences, to herself and
others, of the various times in her life that she has chosen to
pass for white. The book is distinguished by ``poignantly realized
details of feeling,'' Benjamin DeMott said in 1997. Questions of
racial identity are also explored in  &UR; The Accidental Asian: Notes
of a Native Speaker &LR; , by Eric Liu (Vintage, $12). The successful
son of immigrants from Taiwan, the author defends his own feelings
that he is ultimately more American than Chinese. Last year Gary
Krist, called the book ``remarkable for its ... refusal to buy into
the party line of identity politics.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The World I Made For Her &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Moran. Riverhead, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator is speechless but not deaf, silenced by the
respirator tube that is keeping him alive in a hospital where he is
being treated for severe complications of chickenpox. Based on the
author's own experiences, the novel describes the rich inner life
the patient still manages and the imaginary universe in which he
places his nurses. Moran is ``an admirably resourceful writer,''
Michael Upchurch said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Opium: A History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Martin Booth. St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author traces the science and culture surrounding a
substance that is older than mankind and that has proved to be both
a medical solace and a sociological scourge. ``It is a crowded, sad
and dramatic story,'' Jonathan Spence wrote last year. In  &UR; The
American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control &LR;  (Oxford University,
$17.95), David F. Musto looks at the legislative response to
addiction in the United States. Now in a third edition that
continues the chronicle to the present, the book argues that strict
narcotics laws have often been inspired more by racial prejudice
and xenophobia than by sincere attempts to cure a problem. The book
``will probably become mandatory reading for anyone who wants to
understand how we got into our present mess,'' James M. Markham
said in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Rich Man's Table &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Spencer. Berkley, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This novel chronicles the narrator's obsession with the man he
believes to be his father, a famous folk-rock singer and 1960s icon
who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bob Dylan. Last year Gary Krist
described the book as ``another charismatic and heartfelt
performance'' by its author.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the Night Season &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Bausch. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Michaelson, alone with a young son, finds herself suddenly
haunted by more than the accident that made her a widow. Two men
descend on her family, determined to recover the remnants of a
high-tech smuggling operation that, unbeknown to Nora, involved her
husband. This is ``a brutal and relentless thriller,'' A.O. Scott
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Glass: Short Fictions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Karen Joy Fowler. Ballantine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, which take place in locations ranging from
17th-century Japan to modern America, are peopled with characters
who are not necessarily human. The author ``manages to re-create
both life's extraordinary and its ordinary magic,'' Jenny McPhee
said last year.

DISNEY'S BRAVE NEW TOWN: TROUBLE AT THE HAPPIEST SCHOOL ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ The start of the school year here is just a
few days away, so it was no surprise that there was a line of
parents at the Celebration School office the other day. But the
reason for the line was: They were queueing up to withdraw their
children.
</P>
<P>
   When Celebration School first opened three years ago, some of
the same people had lined up to enroll their children in the
ballyhooed educational gem designed by top experts from across the
country. It was to be a world-class institution that would take
children from kindergarten through 12th grade in the highly planned
brave new town created here by Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The school, at the literal and figurative center of the town,
was to use the most advanced educational methods. And the plans
even called for an adjoining teaching academy to share the
innovations with educators nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But as the beginning of the fourth school year approaches on
Aug. 6, administrators, teachers and even executives of Disney's
Celebration Co. are being whipsawed by turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the families most deeply involved in the school have
transferred their children to other schools or even packed up and
left town. Among them are the president of the Parent-Teacher
Association and her immediate predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration has two primary causes. Some people are fed up
with the potpourri of progressive methods; few textbooks are used,
for instance, and, at first, no grades were given. Others are
leaving because they believe the school is pulling back from that
progressive approach and the innovations that drew them to
Celebration in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the sometimes contradictory motives offers a
lesson in what can happen when high-minded educational theory
collides with the expectations of parents and the realities of
public schools in Florida, a state that ranks near the bottom in
most measures of educational quality.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, through its Celebration Co., is developing this town,
about 20 miles southwest of Orlando, as an alternative to the
isolation of suburban sprawl. Since the first residents moved in
three years ago, the town has grown to more than 2,000. Most are
drawn by the small-town feel, which includes tree-lined sidewalks,
ample parks, turn-of-the-century architecture and a convenient town
center.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration School is vital to the cozy atmosphere _ and it's a
big part of the draw _ but there is nothing old-fashioned about the
school. Although it is public and part of the Osceola County school
district, the school was designed largely by education experts
brought in by Disney from leading universities, including Harvard,
Auburn and Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``By bringing in experts from places like Harvard and other
places and blending their theories with real-world practices, we
began to think that there would be a vision of a public school that
would be a lighthouse for new ideas,'' said Don Killoren, the
former general manager of Celebration Co., which is developing and
operating the town for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In brainstorming sessions over two years, long before ground was
broken, the experts came up with the kindergarten-through-12th
grade approach, something rarely seen these days. This, they said,
would provide continuity for students, teachers and families. And
resources could be shared among the grades. For instance, an
excellent high school teacher might be available occasionally to
work with bright children from lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms are as big as 5,000 square feet to accommodate the
multi-age groupings that theorists like Harvard's Howard Gardner
say promote better individual learning. The age range is fairly
narrow in the upper grades, but classrooms of up to 100 students
serve children from kindergarten through fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there were no letter grades. Instead students
and parents were provided with ``authentic assessments,''
individualized evaluations of their children's strengths and
weaknesses. Standardized tests were replaced by interdisciplinary
projects designed by the students themselves, with portfolios, not
report cards, as a record of their work. Computers and other
technology took the place of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom schedules were flexible so students could work at
their own pace. Even the language reflected the progressive
education theory. Teachers are called ``learning leaders'' and
students are ``learners.'' They meet not in classrooms but
``neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these concepts have been tried in one form or another at
progressive schools, but had never been used all at once in a
brand-new school. In one of the early planning sessions, Robert
Peterkin of Harvard had cautioned that it would take years for
everything to work smoothly. ``I would just urge Disney to realize
that there will be ups and downs, that this is a long haul,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He proved prescient. The school opened in the fall of 1996 in
temporary quarters, with about 200 students and a handful of
teachers. The adjustment was difficult for parents and teachers
alike, but there was always the promise of how well it would go the
next year when everyone moved into the new building.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, nearly 800 students started school in the
new building, but many of the problems remained. Parents complained
about the lack of homework and the inability to track progress
without grades and tests. The unstructured classes confused some
parents and students. Teachers struggled with the burdens of
multi-age classrooms and working without a written curriculum, all
under the intense scrutiny of worried parents and the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998, a handful of people had pulled their
children out. They felt their children couldn't afford to wait
until everything worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Others banded together and sought changes, with some success.
Grades were instituted for the high school, largely to help
students get into colleges, where portfolios are seldom part of the
application process. Textbooks were brought in to augment the
technology. More structure was imposed on class schedules.

new building, but many of the problems remained. Parents complained
about the lack of homework and the inability to track progress
without grades and tests. The unstructured classes confused some
parents and students. Teachers struggled with the burdens of
multi-age classrooms and working without a written curriculum, all
under the intense scrutiny of worried parents and the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998, a handful of people had pulled their
children out. They felt their children couldn't afford to wait
until everything worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Others banded together and sought changes, with some success.
Grades were instituted for the high school, largely to help
students get into colleges, where portfolios are seldom part of the
application process. Textbooks were brought in to augment the
technology. More structure was imposed on class schedules.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The compromises brought a dash of real-world practicality to the
ivory tower theories. The simple passage of time helped people
adjust and adapt to the new methods. As the school year ended last
May, the controversy seemed to have simmered down. Certainly some
parents were still dissatisfied and a few decided to leave, but
most appeared to sense progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduation for me last May was just a real high point because
I felt people were finally beginning to feel at home,'' said Dot
Davis, the director of Celebration School.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a bombshell. Officials announced in July that the
kindergarten-through-high school concept would be abandoned, and a
2,000-student regional high school would be built in another part
of town. The reasons were economic, not educational. Faced with
overcrowding and a sparse budget for construction, the Osceola
County school district had struck a deal with Celebration Co.,
which would donate 50 acres for the high school. The plan would
save the district $10 million. And it would save Disney the cost of
building more schools as Celebration grows to its projected
population of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mekdeci, Celebration Co.'s liaison officer with the
school district, said the company will spend about $25 million on
the high school and on expansion of the existing school, which will
serve elementary students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many parents felt betrayed. After three years of fighting
for progress in the innovative community school, they were facing a
return to what they considered the most traditional of education
plans, the huge regional high school.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have tried to mollify parents by promising to
maintain the progressive curriculum through a ``school within a
school'' at the future high school. In its contract with the school
district, Celebration Co. included language specifying that the
district would adhere to the initial philosophy of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The departures do not amount to a stampede, but the school has
not yet compiled figures on the number of students leaving. And
those who are leaving have a myriad of reasons beyond the school.
In many ways, the departures represent a normal shake-out in any
new venture, particularly in a new town where people came with
expectations of a perfect life.

   It used to be easier to spot the telltale signs of a revolution
in the making. There were the Molotov cocktails, the
placard-bearing protesters, the fiery speeches, the subversive
tapes made by shadowy underground leaders with ski hoods and
thrilling stage names. If and when they succeeded, revolutionaries
often tightened their grip on power through the mass media: the
heroic movies, stirring music raining down from communal
loudspeakers, television news cut and tailored to suit the regime.
</P>
<P>
   But now China, home of the very visible Long March and the
agit-prop film, followed by the big-character poster and the
Goddess of Democracy, has been caught off guard by a vast, silent,
virtually invisible movement (if not exactly a revolution) that
came together not on the streets but on the Internet. Its
distinguishing activity is collective deep-breathing. Its ideology,
if it can be called that, includes the notion that Buddhist-style
concentration can cultivate ``supernormal'' powers. Its leader, Li
Hongzhi, is a former office clerk who now lives in New York. Its
tens of millions of members appear to dress like the white-collar
middle class people they are.
</P>
<P>
   The panicked reaction by the Chinese government _ which in
recent weeks banned the movement known as Falun Gong and sent 1,200
state employees who were members to that Asian communist
mind-cleanser, re-education, is perhaps even more startling than
the movement itself. It demonstrates in a flash of instant history
that totalitarians, already flummoxed by the fax machine and the
cellular phone, may be facing the biggest high-tech challenge of
all in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time that the Internet's been used in
China in a way that's been threatening to the government,'' noted
Elizabeth Economy, senior fellow for China at the Council on
Foreign Relations. She said that the China Democracy Party, whose
leaders were arrested last year, was found to have used the
Internet to organize across the country. ``The thing that was so
threatening was certainly not the number of people, but rather that
this was inter-provincial, that in over two-thirds of Chinese
provinces, the China Democracy Party was able to establish
branches. And this was explicitly political in the way that Falun
Gong is not. The China Democracy Party still exists. It's still
there, and it can emerge at any time because of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's power to change behavior, from consumer buying
habits to self-education, self-diagnosis and new directions in
leisure activity, is well understood in the West. Its networking
power has been used extremely effectively by low-budget civic and
political organizations in fields as diverse as environmental
protection and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   But it has often been assumed in industrial countries that
access to computers and the Internet was limited to such small
elite groups in the developing nations that there would be little
public impact in the near future. Experts have focused on just the
opposite trend: that developmental gaps between the people of rich
and poor nations, whatever their political systems, would only
widen catastrophically in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the China Democracy Party and, now, the much
bigger Falun Gong with tens of millions of members; they prove that
all it takes is an elite that can motivate the masses to give the
one-party state a scare. It is worse still for totalitarians when
those citizens with access to computers draw on old traditions and
religions to broaden the appeal of troublesome sects or cults.
</P>
<P>
   In societies accustomed to sharing a still-rare technological
tool, one computer (like one village television receiver or a
communal phone) can serve many people, especially if they are
hungry for the information being provided. And to a totalitarian
state, the Internet is a double fright because it can be
simultaneously intensely private and endlessly public, a terror
because it operates unseen at both levels. Had 10,000 Falun Gong
supporters not suddenly appeared as if by magic in April outside
the private residence compound of the Chinese leadership in
Beijing, where they proceeded to conduct their peaceful meditative
exercises, who would have known the breadth of the movement's
reach?
</P>
<P>
   This is a profoundly disturbing discovery for China or any
country where there are still unsettled and potentially dangerous
political questions about the pace and direction of modernization.
Most governments are aware of the need to liberalize the flow of
information in order to attract international business and to
secure a place in the global economy. International lending
organizations are demanding data once withheld by secretive
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has made the decision that it wants to
continue to advance information technology,'' said Ms. Economy.
``They recognize the challenges that it is going to pose for them,
but they think that it is too important to their economic
modernization to stop. What they are trying to do obviously is to
control it.''

</P>
<P>
   But to counter the threat, the government is still falling back
on old techniques. For the Chinese Communist Party to compete in
the open marketplace of ideas is still anathema. Furthermore, what
if independent trade unions or other groups start to organize
through the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Re-education, a Maoist method of mind control also recently
resurrected widely in Tibet, is now as out of date as the doctored
newsreel or the propagandistic ``documentary'' used by fascists and
communists alike to drum up pride in the state and its ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Few countries can opt out of the technological revolution,
though even the United States sees a need to police it in order to
protect national security. Only a regime like Saddam Hussein's in
Iraq, which really wants only to sell oil, not establish a modern
business environment, can enforce a ban on Internet use under a
pervasive reign of terror. In any case, international sanctions
have reduced Iraq's telephone service to a ludicrous level, cutting
off until very recently those who might have tried to evade
restrictions in their hunger for information from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, clinging to a communist political-control mindset, has
been ambivalent on the issue of technology without borders. India,
a democracy and a software exporter, tried at first to monopolize
Internet connections but gave up under public pressure for better
services.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Singapore, where one party has dominated
politics ruthlessly, but where educated people are recognized as
the nation's most valuable natural resource (and foreign companies
are welcomed), Internet access has been made simple.
</P>
<P>
   When historians look back on the latter part of the 20th
century, they may be tempted in the short term to see it as an era
that rendered Orwell passe, an age when exploding technology ended
the possibility of totalitarian thought control _ at least until
dictators or new mind-closing movements devise new methods of
isolating people. There are already fears that racist hate groups
or new age religious cults with authoritarian or apocalyptic
tendencies are getting ahead of the deprogramming organizations
that try to rescue members trapped in mind-altering sects. But on
balance, many experts would bet on more opening of minds through
interconnectedness.
</P>
<P>
   In the Muslim world, the use of mass communications _ including
the Internet as well as a new generation of smuggled tapes and the
open discussion encouraged by Qatar's pioneering Al-Jazira
satellite television network _ is aiding a significant if still
disparate movement for re-examination of the basic precepts and
writings of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is a collapse of earlier, hierarchical notions of
religious authority based on claims to the mastery of fixed bodies
of religious texts,'' said Dartmouth anthropology professor Dale
Eickelman in June in the 1999 Templeton Lecture on Religion and
World Affairs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia. ``Quite simply, in country after country, government
officials, traditional religious scholars and officially sanctioned
preachers are finding it very hard to monopolize the tools of
literate culture. The days have gone when governments and religious
authorities can control what their people know, and what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is probably worth remembering that the
early totalitarians based a lot of their strategy on mastering what
was then cutting-edge communications technology. Manipulating film
images and broadcasting propaganda were essential to their efforts
to imprison rather than liberate people's imaginations. So their
heirs in China may be right to have a special fear of a new, barely
understood medium like the Internet _ and of any organization
clever enough to master this newest technology.
</P>
<P>
   And for the West, the extraordinary success that the Falun Gong
has had with cyberspace challenges any optimism that the Internet
will promote only rational, enlightened, open-minded patterns of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Accessible communications, Eickelman and others say, foster the
growth of civil society and strengthen dissent in places like Iran
or Egypt. But in Muslim nations, as almost everywhere in the world
at the century's end, there is still a race on between the forces
of liberalizing change and those of reactionary fundamentalism,
between those who would expand tolerance and those who preach hate,
between the agents of mind control and advocates of a free exchange
of political ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that the Internet can serve
government's purposes, too,'' said Ms. Economy. ``It's not always
going to be a force for positive change from our perspective.''

FEARS OF RAPE AND VIOLENCE: WOMEN NEWLY SEEKING ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one denies that their stories are horrific: beatings, rape,
genital mutilation or the threat of it. But foreign women seeking
asylum on these grounds have received a mixed welcome in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the door opened a bit for some women who
claimed that their sex rendered them victims of persecution. In a
landmark decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted asylum
to Fauziya Kassindja, who said her clitoris would be cut off if she
were forced to return home to Togo. The board, the highest
administrative court for asylum cases, agreed that female
circumcision was equivalent to the more widely recognized rights
violations of political and religious persecution. Ms. Kassindja's
case also met other important criteria _ a well-founded fear of
persecution because she belonged to a social group, in her case
women of her tribe who opposed genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kassindja ruling has not, as many women's groups and
human rights lawyers hoped, blazed an unambiguous trail for others
seeking a safe haven from persecution based on sex. In late June,
the board denied asylum to Rodi Alvarado Pena, a Guatemalan woman
who had escaped both a brutal husband and apathetic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 15 members of the appeals board said Ms. Alvarado had
not proved she was persecuted because of her social class or
opinion. Her husband raped and beat her regardless of her beliefs,
the judges ruled, and while Ms. Alvarado may merit protection on
humanitarian grounds, asylum is not meant to be an all-encompassing
remedy for people fleeing oppressive societies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attention to these cases, rights advocates are
challenging the conventional wisdom. Ms. Alvarado's supporters have
petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco to review the decision by the
Board of Immigration Appeals. They also may try a novel tack:
portraying Ms. Alvarado as a victim of torture who should not be
sent back to her torturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision has really garnered the attention of people
across the country on different levels _ from Congress to the
immigration advocates, to women's groups and people in the
administration,'' said Karen Musalo, a professor at Hastings
College of Law at the University of California in San Francisco.
``But for the time being, it is a binding precedent that has
devastating consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for asylum must first prove they cannot return home
because of ``persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on
account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular
social group, or political opinion.'' The law was a product of the
Cold War, written with dissidents from totalitarian regimes in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption was that there is a distinction between
political and economic suffering and between what was political and
personal,'' said Gary Rubin, the director of public policy of the
New York Association for New Americans. ``Now the line between
personal and political is being renegotiated and things that people
thought were personal tended to have political meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, the meaning of ``social group'' has been
extended to include those persecuted on the basis of sexual
orientation, ethnicity and even, in the case of journalists,
profession. Gender as social group seemed the natural next
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 the executive committee of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said women facing abuse because they
transgress the customs of their society are a special ``social
group.'' It took another eight years before the United Nations
recognized violence against women as a human rights violation. The
same year, spurred in part by the reports of a systematic pattern
of rape in Bosnia, Canada adopted pioneering guidelines granting
refugee status to women facing persecution on account of their
gender. Two years later the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service broadened its own guidelines to give greater weight to
women seeking asylum who feared genital mutilation and sexual
violence. In 1996 female circumcision, whether part of a woman's
culture or not, was outlawed in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But inconsistent rulings in recent cases here and in Canada show
that each woman seeking asylum on grounds of gender-based
persecution must fight the battle anew. Last year, the board denied
asylum to Adelaide Abankwah, a Ghanaian who feared she would be
circumcised forcibly if she returned home. The board said she had
not proved that her fear was reasonable. Ms. Abankwah was released
only on July 20, after two years in a New York City detention
center, when a federal appeals court ruled she could not be
expected to provide the kind of proof the board had demanded. ``A
genuine refugee does not flee her native country armed with
affidavits, expert witnesses, and extensive documentation,'' the
court said, and sent the case back to the immigration board.
</P>
<P>
   A different issue, central to Ms. Alvarado's case, is likely to
affect asylum seekers fleeing countries where violence against
women is considered within the rights of husbands and fathers. Ms.
Alvarado's lawyers argued that she belonged to a persecuted social
group they defined as ``Guatemalan women who have been involved
intimately with Guatemalan male companions, who believe that women
are to live under male domination.'' The judges said the group
defined was not cohesive enough to qualify for asylum. They also
said Ms. Alvarado had not shown that her husband beat her because
she was, or he believed her to be, opposed to the patriarchal
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Women's advocates say the only act of opposition that women in
such cultures can take is to flee their country. And a society that
fails to punish batterers or ignores women's basic human rights is
enforcing a political policy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That is the disputed new frontier for women seeking asylum. As
an immigration judge in Virginia ruled in 1994 in the case of a
Jordanian woman who ran away from an abusive husband, a woman can
challenge the system simply by seeking a new life in the United
States. The judge, Paul Nejelski, wrote, ``The respondent has
espoused a belief that she is an individual.''

FEARS OF RAPE AND VIOLENCE: WOMEN NEWLY SEEKING ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   No one denies that their stories are horrific: beatings, rape,
genital mutilation or the threat of it. But foreign women seeking
asylum on these grounds have received a mixed welcome in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the door opened a bit for some women who
claimed that their sex rendered them victims of persecution. In a
landmark decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted asylum
to Fauziya Kassindja, who said her clitoris would be cut off if she
were forced to return home to Togo. The board, the highest
administrative court for asylum cases, agreed that female
circumcision was equivalent to the more widely recognized rights
violations of political and religious persecution. Ms. Kassindja's
case also met other important criteria _ a well-founded fear of
persecution because she belonged to a social group, in her case
women of her tribe who opposed genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kassindja ruling has not, as many women's groups and
human rights lawyers hoped, blazed an unambiguous trail for others
seeking a safe haven from persecution based on sex. In late June,
the board denied asylum to Rodi Alvarado Pena, a Guatemalan woman
who had escaped both a brutal husband and apathetic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 15 members of the appeals board said Ms. Alvarado had
not proved she was persecuted because of her social class or
opinion. Her husband raped and beat her regardless of her beliefs,
the judges ruled, and while Ms. Alvarado may merit protection on
humanitarian grounds, asylum is not meant to be an all-encompassing
remedy for people fleeing oppressive societies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attention to these cases, rights advocates are
challenging the conventional wisdom. Ms. Alvarado's supporters have
petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco to review the decision by the
Board of Immigration Appeals. They also may try a novel tack:

THE END OF WRITING: CONTENT PROVIDED BELOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By JENNY LYN BADER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend the fiction writer is sensitive, so I asked the
dreaded question directly. ``How's the novel coming along?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very well, thanks,'' she answered. ``I'm workshopping it right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, individuals are workshopping short stories,
novellas and plays. Others have screenplays or theater pieces in
development. Still others engage in content creation. They create
content, or provide it, for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Actively productive souls everywhere are developing scripts.
Workshopping books. Providing content.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anyone  &UR; write &LR;  anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Some pesky writing tasks have been eliminated,
with the popularity of projects like the script-free MTV show ``The
Real World,'' which chronicles the daily taped lives of not
entirely compatible roommates. Or the summer horror flick ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' where rather than writing dialogue in
advance, the filmmakers sent the actors into the woods,
intentionally frightened them for days on end, and then filmed
them. What once had to be written can just be lived.
</P>
<P>
   But even when writing occurs, why is it no longer called
writing? I started to wonder this back in the heady days of the Web
entertainment boom, when I was hired to write a Web drama. At that
point, the Microsoft Network was using the ``television model'' to
try to conquer the Web. The ``show'' would ``air'' twice a week on
an MSN ``channel.'' I was the sole writer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I was definitely sole. But the writer part became
increasingly unclear. A few weeks into the assignment, MSN
executives were starting to notice that the Web is like TV about as
much as it's like a sliding door _ they both have a screen. They
wanted to stop calling the episodes ``episodes.'' The producer
asked me what we should call them. ``Stories?'' I asked.
``Chapters?'' ``Chapters!'' said the producer. ``Jenny Lyn, that's
very `print.''' She told me to stop being ``so print.'' She said
the suggestion was ``very old media'' of me.
</P>
<P>
   This was an insult. Old media, once a role model for new media,
had become an evil twin as the new form struggled for its identity.
And the words of old media had gone too. When the producer
introduced me to the programming staff, I expected her to say I was
the writer of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she said: ``This is Jenny Lyn. She's the creative on
this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally I was flattered. I didn't have to worry about being
creative. I was the creative. Creative, an adjective in my youth,
was now a glamorous noun.
</P>
<P>
   But this new job title also betrayed an underlying suspicion by
the producers that writers don't really  &UR; do &LR;  anything; they somehow
simply  &UR; are. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative'' had become a noun in the same alarming way
``workshop'' turned into a verb. Once, writers attended fiction
workshops. Now, writers workshop fiction. The act of sharing the
work with others has become part of its creation, and the sense of
the individual starts to get lost. Once, writers escaped into the
wilderness to cultivate their voices. Now, they gather together
with each other or with development executives to hone their craft,
make contacts, compare their voices, or make their voices sound
more like one another. Meanwhile, the only people going into the
wilderness are the terrified actors in ``The Blair Witch Project''
who aren't cultivating their voices but do scream a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way that sensational events occur in book
publishing is by avoiding cultivating those voices. Instant books
bear the name of one writer but are actually divided up among
different writers, all refraining from writing in their own style.
</P>
<P>
   That's how book-packaging houses _ the writing factories of the
literary industrial revolution _ get them done so quickly. If a
book is, say, about a timely vegetable scandal, one writer will be
assigned the tomatoes, the next the carrots, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such compartmentalization has occurred in the film and
television industry for years, but has gotten more extreme with the
growth of the sheer numbers of people on writing staffs, performing
uncredited rewrites, or doing ``polishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the publishing and film worlds will soon have a joint
writing factory in the form of Tina Brown's media convergence
empire, which will put nonfiction articles into ``development''
before they are even written.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter and author William Goldman has decided to expose
the anguish of the development process in a new way. In July, he
offered studio chiefs a spec screenplay _ yes, a screenplay written
for no pay by one of Hollywood's highest paid writers _ to studios.
But there's a catch. The screenplay, ``The Big A,'' is not
finished. Any studio head who wants to read it must return a
written response with comments. And Goldman plans to publish these
comments, plus critiques from six screenwriters, along with the
incomplete screenplay, in a forthcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, the ultimate expression that film development has
mechanized the writer's creative process is the screenwriting
software that solves story structure problems and suggests plot
twists. If it actually worked, perhaps writers could simply
``program'' or ``input'' instead of having to ``write'' in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken threat of the digital era is that it will chip away
at the individual author's voice and intent, that content will
become more and more automated and mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes of the digital era will be those who restore
individual voices. It seems remarkably fitting that it was Peter
Norton who purchased the love letters of J.D. Salinger, the last
guy to escape into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Norton made his fortune inventing Norton Utilities, featuring
the Norton Disk Doctor, a program that salvages the memories of
crashed computers. With heart-warming functions like ``UnErase,''
it is one of the few software innovations with a sense of justice.
Norton demonstrated that sense of justice and respect for memory
and author's intent when he purchased the letters for $156,500 and
then offered to return them to Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may want them returned,'' Norton said. ``He may want me to
destroy them. He may not care at all.'' He said he would leave it
up to the writer.

MAYBE `RAGES' AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE CRACKED UP TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When securities day trader Mark Barton walked into two Atlanta
brokerage firms Thursday and fatally shot nine people, it seemed
like another gruesome indicator of a trend toward workplace
violence and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, 44, had traded with at least one of the firms and had
apparently experienced significant financial losses in recent
weeks, investigators said. In a note left behind after he took his
own life, Barton said he wanted to kill ``the people that greedily
sought my destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that what has been dubbed ``workplace rage''
is really on the rise, researchers say. And similar doubts have
been raised about other so-called ``rages,'' namely road rage and
air rage. Some experts suggest that the labels reflect only a
national penchant for lumping similar but isolated acts of violence
into categories _ and question whether media coverage is making
them appear to be bonafide trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what's going on is that anecdotes are being
christened as trends,'' said Barry Glassner, a professor of
sociology at the University of Southern California and the author
of ``The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong
Things,'' published in June by Basic Books. ``There is no reason to
believe that we have any new alarming situation in American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said such problems get wide publicity in part because
of television news, which thrives on showing chilling footage of
each new act of public rage, and because politicians and others use
them to advance their own agendas. ``There are lots of people
making money off of these scares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists say these are not spurious trends, but the
natural consequences of more drivers on the road and more
passengers in the air. Some, like Dr. Ervin Staub, a professor of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts, attribute them to
the decline of close communities and accelerating changes in
society that make people more frustrated and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that regardless of how many incidents there
actually are, the labels serve the useful purpose of raising
awareness about a problem and making people more careful about
their safety. After all, drunken driving was common long before
Mothers Against Drunk Driving came into existence, but it wasn't
until after the group's formation that society began to seriously
focus on the problem and take significant steps to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lot of skeptics tend to agree with Dr. Robert Baron, a
professor of management and psychology at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, who says, ``All these social phenomena,
they're just as slippery as eels.''

<P>
   Baron, whose expertise is workplace violence, said: ``A lot of
people are convinced there's a heck of a lot more than there used
to be. But there isn't, from all the statistics that are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallup polls conducted for the last four years on workplace
anger show no increase in percentages of people who report feeling
angry at work, said Batia Wiesenfeld, an assistant professor of
management at New York University, who helped conduct the polls.
Only 2 percent reported feeling extremely angry, while under 10
percent reported feeling ``quite a bit angry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates of anger are not extraordinarily high and they have
not been changing that much over the past few years,'' Wiesenfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   With air rage and road rage, there may be similar gaps between
perception and reality. Two weeks ago, after an airline passenger
severely beat a Continental Airlines gate agent at Newark
International Airport, airline workers organized protests to demand
that airlines do more to protect their employees from what they
said were increasing incidents of passengers punching, kicking and
biting.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been some high-profile cases of alarming
passenger behavior in recent years _ most notoriously the 1995
incident in which a banker from Greenwich, Conn., assaulted a
flight attendant and defecated on a food cart on a flight from
Buenos Aires to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But while airlines report a growing problem, it may be
attributable to significant increases in the number of airline
passengers rather than a higher rate of unruly passenger behavior.
And definitions of unruly behavior vary from airline to airline,
and can run the gamut from verbal abuse to assault. While their
statistics are not exhaustive, federal aviation authorities have
recorded only about 200 incidents in which passengers interfered
with flight crews, about one for every 3 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   With road rage, the numbers seem to vary considerably, depending
on the definition of terms like ``aggressive driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnold Nerenberg, the clinical psychologist who popularized
the term road rage, has a Web site, www.roadrage.com, that makes
some alarming statements, like, ``Twenty-eight thousand Americans
died in 1996 because of aggressive driving,'' and, ``There are
estimated to be close to two billion episodes of road rage per year
in our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28,000 figure comes from 1997 congressional testimony by the
head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who
said that aggressive behavior included tailgating, passing on the
right, flashing headlights to pass a car, weaving through busy
lanes, honking or screaming at other drivers and exchanges of
insults. The testimony indicated that such behavior was a factor in
nearly 28,000 deaths _ not the sole cause.
</P>
<P>
   At that same hearing, Nerenberg testified that a survey he
conducted of 585 drivers had found that 53 percent of drivers had
``road rage disorder,'' which he described as one driver's clearly
expressing anger to another at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said one consequence of inventing a term like road rage
is that it is self-perpetuating; more incidents are reported
because people suddenly have a category to group them in.
</P>
<P>
   Another consequence is that people become more concerned about
their own safety.

MAYBE `RAGES' AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE CRACKED UP TO BE

<P>
   When securities day trader Mark Barton walked into two Atlanta
brokerage firms Thursday and fatally shot nine people, it seemed
like another gruesome indicator of a trend toward workplace
violence and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, 44, had traded with at least one of the firms and had
apparently experienced significant financial losses in recent
weeks, investigators said. In a note left behind after he took his
own life, Barton said he wanted to kill ``the people that greedily
sought my destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that what has been dubbed ``workplace rage''
is really on the rise, researchers say. And similar doubts have
been raised about other so-called ``rages,'' namely road rage and
air rage. Some experts suggest that the labels reflect only a
national penchant for lumping similar but isolated acts of violence
into categories _ and question whether media coverage is making
them appear to be bonafide trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what's going on is that anecdotes are being
christened as trends,'' said Barry Glassner, a professor of
sociology at the University of Southern California and the author
of ``The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong
Things,'' published in June by Basic Books. ``There is no reason to
believe that we have any new alarming situation in American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said such problems get wide publicity in part because
of television news, which thrives on showing chilling footage of
each new act of public rage, and because politicians and others use
them to advance their own agendas. ``There are lots of people
making money off of these scares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists say these are not spurious trends, but the
natural consequences of more drivers on the road and more
passengers in the air. Some, like Dr. Ervin Staub, a professor of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts, attribute them to
the decline of close communities and accelerating changes in
society that make people more frustrated and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that regardless of how many incidents there
actually are, the labels serve the useful purpose of raising
awareness about a problem and making people more careful about
their safety. After all, drunken driving was common long before
Mothers Against Drunk Driving came into existence, but it wasn't
until after the group's formation that society began to seriously
focus on the problem and take significant steps to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lot of skeptics tend to agree with Dr. Robert Baron, a
professor of management and psychology at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, who says, ``All these social phenomena,
they're just as slippery as eels.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron, whose expertise is workplace violence, said: ``A lot of
people are convinced there's a heck of a lot more than there used
to be. But there isn't, from all the statistics that are out

   Dr. Ronald Nathan, a psychologist at Albany Medical College,
sells an audio tape called ``Road Rage Readiness,'' that dispenses
pointers like who is most likely to engage in it (young men in
high-performance cars, he says). He also offers exercises designed
to help drivers control their frustration over, say, being cut off
by an aggressive driver.
</P>
<P>
   His training approach has altered over time to reflect what he
suggests is increasing fear about road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I used to teach people to think that there might be
some really good reason for the person to cut us off _ maybe he had
to get to the hospital,'' Nathan said. But now he teaches people
``to assume the worst _ that the road-rager has a gun on seat next
to them and would use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most distressing consequence of the ``rage'' trends, critics
say, is that they take attention away from dangers that are clearly
much more common: drunken driving fatalities, for example, or
injuries suffered on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are a lot more preventable too,'' Glassner said.
``How do you imagine that you're going to prevent somebody who is
going off the deep end from getting violent in the workplace? What
disturbs me about this attention to these pseudophenomena is that
we lose focus on what is really out there.''

   RABAT, Morocco _ Weren't funerals supposed to be solemn, somber
affairs, where mourners whispered the right words and shop talk was
taboo?
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have known it last week in Rabat, the setting for
the latest mourning ritual in what has become the year of the power
funeral in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, in his
first three-way meeting with President Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. There was Clinton again, bonding anew with
King Abdullah of Jordan, his youthful new ally. And there was Barak
again, in a clinch with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
whose country is still formally at war with Israel. Syrian
President Hafez Assad was nowhere to be seen, but not out of any
lack of respect for the departed, King Hassan II of Morocco. The
Syrian leader knew what the other guests were plotting, and he had
no intention of allowing himself to be cajoled or even bumped into
a first-ever encounter with an Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as the domain of vice presidents and other varieties
of deputies, state funerals are turning out to be a good place for
the bosses themselves to do business. Back in February, even Assad
joined the galaxy of presidents, princes and prime ministers who
turned out to mourn the loss of Jordan's King Hussein. (There, the
organizers had promised to keep the Israelis out of his sight.)
Russian President Boris Yeltsin made that pilgrimage, too, despite
being woozy from ill health, apparently not wanting to be left out
of such an all-star gathering.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bahrain buried its emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman
al-Khalifa, too quickly for many leaders to attend the funeral
itself. Morocco chose a more accommodating course, setting aside
the Muslim tradition that says a body should be buried within 24
hours of death. That made Rabat, for a day, the diplomatic capital
of the world, with a slew of side talks that included a state
dinner for French President Jacques Chirac given by King Mohammed
VI just hours after he had laid his father to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even for regular folks, of course, funerals tend to bring
together people who might otherwise prefer not to be in the same
room. As everyone knows, a shared loss sometimes leads to
reconciliation, with hugs and tears at graveside or a wake. It is
only natural, then, for diplomats to try to translate that funeral
factor into diplomacy _ particularly in the Middle East, where
leaders tend to find reasons not to get together. Any meeting
between an Israeli prime minister and an Arab leader is still
considered news. Even the Arabs have trouble finding common ground;
it has been three years since they last gathered for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   And there is recent precedent for state funerals producing
diplomatic gestures. The death of Israel's Yitzhak Rabin in 1996
brought King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
Jerusalem for their first public visit. A meeting between Assad and
King Abdullah after King Hussein's funeral has left relations
between Syria and Jordan warmer than at any time in decades. And in
Rabat, the guests at King Hassan's funeral included Bouteflika, the
first Algerian leader to visit Morocco in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As everywhere, bigger breakthroughs require more than mourning
gestures. But with pivotal leaders like Assad and Arafat
approaching their 70th years, this year of the power funeral may
also serve as a reminder that their time too, inevitably, is
running out.

LATIN AMERICA'S LEFTISTS SAY ADIOS TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ If looks alone were what mattered, Jose
Mujica could still play a Tupamaro rebel in some new Costa Gavras
film about Uruguay's desperate revolutionaries. Never mind that
this one-time guerrilla is now a member of Congress who monitors
the budget of the same military that once tortured him. True to his
old style, Mujica still chain smokes, rarely shaves and wears
grubby, carelessly fitted blue jeans to the office.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to what the 65-year-old had to say in an interview
not long ago: ``Since the Soviet experiment proved to be a colossal
failure, the left is still searching for answers to today's social
problems _ but through the system and not through some utopian
notion that does not exist in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking _ the acceptance of democratic pluralism and
compromise, mixed with hefty dollops of self-criticism and the
rejection of old doctrines and platitudes _ is helping the left
re-emerge as a winning force not only here, but in much of the rest
of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marxist guerrillas already participate in governing
coalitions in Venezuela and Bolivia, and they field mayors in many
cities and towns in El Salvador. Polls indicate that Tabare
Vasquez, the Uruguayan socialist candidate, could do well in the
presidential election in October, at least in a first round of
voting. More moderate Social Democrats stand a good chance of
taking power in Argentina in a coalition with centrists. And
Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist Party presidential candidate, is running
strongly in Chile, where elections are scheduled in December; if he
were to win, he would become the first Socialist Party president in
Chile since Salvador Allende, who was elected in 1970 and deposed
in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As in Europe, the left in Latin America is doing well with
voters in part because it has shucked old ideological trappings and
moved toward the center. But here the changes are more abrupt; this
is, after all, a region known for its polarized, muscular and often
murderous style of politics. The belligerent style of the old left
is fading in South America's most modern countries, even while
guerrilla forces of varying sizes continue to struggle on in
Colombia, Peru and Mexico, where establishing order has been
complicated by drug trafficking. The idea that politics is an
alternative to violence _ and not that violence is a mere extension
of politics, as Mao and Che Guevara preached _ is growing in
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fidel Castro says the days of armed struggle in Latin
America are over. In his case and perhaps the cases of others, this
may be more a change of tactics than a change of heart. But even if
so, it is a reflection that the world itself has changed. Castro's
Cuba no longer has the wherewithal to support revolutionary
insurgencies. And even before the Cold War was over, the United
States began shifting its favor away from repressive right-wing
military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In most Latin American countries, this has brought about a less
polarized climate in which leftists have far more space to operate
than they had a generation ago. Then, they were being cut down in
the streets or spirited out of their beds by goon squads, never to
be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, centrists and economic conservatives were the first
beneficiaries of the move away from military government in the
1980s. But today most of Latin America is in a recession, with
unemployment rising and the gap between the rich and poor growing,
and many voters are looking for alternatives. Latin voters also
seem to be angrier than ever about corruption in government, an
issue that has hurt traditional ruling parties. When the left draws
closer to the center, it looks more and more like an attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Berlin Wall has fallen and the left has changed,'' said
Jaime Estevez, a Chilean economist and a leading adviser to Lagos.
``The Socialist Party under Allende was like an Eastern European
party, and many Chileans felt threatened by it. Nixon and Kissinger
supported the coup against Allende, but it is very simplistic to
say they were the sole cause of the coup. Now we are a Western
European-style party and only the most politicized on the right
feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, a mild-mannered Chilean Socialist running in a coalition
with the Christian Democratic party, is leading strongly in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new world,'' Lagos laughed as he described his career.
He was on his way to Moscow as Allende's ambassador to the Soviet
Union when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende's elected
government 26 years ago with support from Washington. Now Pinochet
is under house arrest in London awaiting possible extradition to
Spain to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and
Lagos has cordial relations with the U.S. Embassy in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said the Socialist Party had changed not only because the
Cold War had ended, but because few people in the party liked what
they saw when they were in exile in places like East Germany and
the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. Places like Sweden and
Spain, according to Lagos, ``were far more agreeable'' for those in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our work now?'' Lagos asked rhetorically. ``Without
affecting investment, savings and economic growth, we need to
produce a society a little more just with less of a social gap and
more equality of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more just'' is hardly a call to man the ramparts _
but it is the kind of phrasing leftist politicians use these days
to calm voters. The political pitch is different from country to
country, of course, and some on the Latin American left have still
not dropped the old oratory.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Argentine daily Clarin, Jorge
Briceno, the military commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, threatened the United States for increasing
its military involvement against Colombian drug trafficking and, by
extension, against the guerrillas.
</P>

LATIN AMERICA'S LEFTISTS SAY ADIOS TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>

   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ If looks alone were what mattered, Jose
Mujica could still play a Tupamaro rebel in some new Costa Gavras
film about Uruguay's desperate revolutionaries. Never mind that
this one-time guerrilla is now a member of Congress who monitors
the budget of the same military that once tortured him. True to his
old style, Mujica still chain smokes, rarely shaves and wears
grubby, carelessly fitted blue jeans to the office.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to what the 65-year-old had to say in an interview
not long ago: ``Since the Soviet experiment proved to be a colossal
failure, the left is still searching for answers to today's social
problems _ but through the system and not through some utopian
notion that does not exist in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking _ the acceptance of democratic pluralism and
compromise, mixed with hefty dollops of self-criticism and the
rejection of old doctrines and platitudes _ is helping the left
re-emerge as a winning force not only here, but in much of the rest
of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marxist guerrillas already participate in governing
coalitions in Venezuela and Bolivia, and they field mayors in many
cities and towns in El Salvador. Polls indicate that Tabare
Vasquez, the Uruguayan socialist candidate, could do well in the
presidential election in October, at least in a first round of
voting. More moderate Social Democrats stand a good chance of
taking power in Argentina in a coalition with centrists. And
Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist Party presidential candidate, is running
strongly in Chile, where elections are scheduled in December; if he
were to win, he would become the first Socialist Party president in
Chile since Salvador Allende, who was elected in 1970 and deposed
in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As in Europe, the left in Latin America is doing well with
voters in part because it has shucked old ideological trappings and
moved toward the center. But here the changes are more abrupt; this
is, after all, a region known for its polarized, muscular and often
murderous style of politics. The belligerent style of the old left
is fading in South America's most modern countries, even while
guerrilla forces of varying sizes continue to struggle on in
Colombia, Peru and Mexico, where establishing order has been
complicated by drug trafficking. The idea that politics is an
alternative to violence _ and not that violence is a mere extension
of politics, as Mao and Che Guevara preached _ is growing in
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fidel Castro says the days of armed struggle in Latin
America are over. In his case and perhaps the cases of others, this
may be more a change of tactics than a change of heart. But even if
so, it is a reflection that the world itself has changed. Castro's
Cuba no longer has the wherewithal to support revolutionary
insurgencies. And even before the Cold War was over, the United
States began shifting its favor away from repressive right-wing
military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In most Latin American countries, this has brought about a less
polarized climate in which leftists have far more space to operate
than they had a generation ago. Then, they were being cut down in
the streets or spirited out of their beds by goon squads, never to
be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, centrists and economic conservatives were the first
beneficiaries of the move away from military government in the
1980s. But today most of Latin America is in a recession, with
unemployment rising and the gap between the rich and poor growing,
and many voters are looking for alternatives. Latin voters also
seem to be angrier than ever about corruption in government, an
issue that has hurt traditional ruling parties. When the left draws
closer to the center, it looks more and more like an attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Berlin Wall has fallen and the left has changed,'' said
Jaime Estevez, a Chilean economist and a leading adviser to Lagos.
``The Socialist Party under Allende was like an Eastern European
party, and many Chileans felt threatened by it. Nixon and Kissinger
supported the coup against Allende, but it is very simplistic to
say they were the sole cause of the coup. Now we are a Western
European-style party and only the most politicized on the right
feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, a mild-mannered Chilean Socialist running in a coalition
with the Christian Democratic party, is leading strongly in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new world,'' Lagos laughed as he described his career.
He was on his way to Moscow as Allende's ambassador to the Soviet
Union when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende's elected
government 26 years ago with support from Washington. Now Pinochet
is under house arrest in London awaiting possible extradition to
Spain to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and
Lagos has cordial relations with the U.S. Embassy in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said the Socialist Party had changed not only because the
Cold War had ended, but because few people in the party liked what
they saw when they were in exile in places like East Germany and
the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. Places like Sweden and
Spain, according to Lagos, ``were far more agreeable'' for those in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our work now?'' Lagos asked rhetorically. ``Without
affecting investment, savings and economic growth, we need to
produce a society a little more just with less of a social gap and
more equality of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more just'' is hardly a call to man the ramparts _
but it is the kind of phrasing leftist politicians use these days
to calm voters. The political pitch is different from country to
country, of course, and some on the Latin American left have still
not dropped the old oratory.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Argentine daily Clarin, Jorge
Briceno, the military commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, threatened the United States for increasing
its military involvement against Colombian drug trafficking and, by
extension, against the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``If the United States
intervenes it will be another Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in Colombia, the left is reaching for new messages and
symbols. In July, another leader of the FARC held a summit in his
jungle headquarters with none other than Richard Grasso, president
of the New York Stock Exchange. The picture of Comandante Raul
Reyes warmly embracing an icon of American capitalism was surely a
staged gesture to show reasonableness, and it made the front pages
of virtually every newspaper in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso invited Reyes to make a tour of Wall Street. The

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Ibrahim Rugova, where have you been?
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since NATO won the war in Kosovo and the young
fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army proceeded to grab power, the
diffident and puzzling pacifist who was once considered Kosovo's
president made only one flying visit to the province. Instead,
Ibrahim Rugova remained in Italy, leaving his party and his
reputation to wither. Only on Friday, after direct prodding from
Western leaders, did he return to the province to live, or so he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has had reasons to stay away, some of his own making. But
they reflect the extraordinary difficulty that NATO and the United
Nations face, despite their theoretically unlimited powers, in
trying to build any fair, democratic political order in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old literary critic educated at the Sorbonne, Rugova
was the moderate around whom the world's hopes for reconciliation
in Kosovo revolved for nearly 10 years. Back when Yugoslavia first
began to fall apart, Kosovar Albanians elected him as their leader
in secret (and thus not entirely credible) elections, and his
policy of Gandhi-like passive resistance to the Yugoslav government
was widely supported until about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, after Kosovo's extraordinary burst of violence,
Rugova's time looks to be over. He and his party are being pushed
aside by the hard young men of the Kosovo Liberation Army and their
political leader, Hashim Thaci, only 29, who at least tried to
fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and the West also played an important role in the
decline of Rugova and the rise of Thaci, and thus in the
radicalization of Kosovo. Because Thaci has a history of
intolerance for dissent, many Albanians quietly wonder whether real
politics, moderate or otherwise, will be possible in Kosovo by the
time, a year or more away, when the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe organize
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova remains popular among the middle-aged and the educated.
But he is a reluctant politician who dislikes pressing the flesh or
even uttering firm statements, and he has always been an annoying
figure for American diplomats. In February, when talks to reconcile
the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians were foundering at Rambouillet, the
Americans were happy to promote Thaci, rather than Rugova, as the
Albanians' chief negotiator. It was Thaci whom they backed as the
prime minister of a provisional government.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has made many mistakes. He was passive in dealing with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and trusted in Milosevic's
promises. His policy of urging Kosovar Albanians to boycott Serbian
and Yugoslav elections was instrumental in keeping Milosevic in
power from at least 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO began bombing Serbia in March, Rugova criticized the
humanitarian catastrophe that befell Kosovo's Albanians, even as he
met with Milosevic during the war. His willingness to do so,
although he insists it was under duress, is widely believed to have
put his life in danger from supporters of Thaci and the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   And Rugova suffered a great loss with the killing in May of his
thoughtful adviser, Fehmi Agani, a man capable of talking to all
sides. Agani is nearly universally believed to have been killed by
the Serbian police, but the police still insist he was killed by
the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, Rugova returned to Pristina to a welcoming crowd.
But he only stayed a few hours, refused to meet Western
peacekeepers and U.N. administrators and then quickly returned to
Italy, apparently objecting to the number of seats Thaci had
allocated to the KLA's political allies in a new Council for
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, criticized
Rugova for remaining in Italy and not returning to Pristina ``to
play the role his own elections have entitled him to play.'' Even
before Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stopped in Rome to
deliver a similar request _ having visited Kosovo herself _ Rugova
admitted that Dini was right and promised to return.
</P>
<P>
   But his presence cannot erase his main failure, which was his
inability to win independence or even more autonomy from Milosevic,
creating a vacuum of frustration that made the rise of the Kosovo
Liberation Army inevitable. His position was undercut by the
failure of Washington to deal with the problem of Kosovo at the
1995 talks in Dayton that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton shattered the Kosovars' expectations that their policy of
nonviolence would be rewarded, as well as their trust in the West.
The beneficiaries at Dayton were the fighters in Bosnia, not the
pacifists in Kosovo, weakening Rugova's authority considerably. The
Americans argued that there was no time to deal with Kosovo at
Dayton, but then the Clinton administration did little to deal with
it afterward, either. It was the summer of 1998 before the West
really took notice _ after the rise of the KLA had produced a
Serbian counter-terrorist offensive that was so brutal that even
the West could not turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in its intensifying campaign against Milosevic _ and in
its mistaken belief that a few days of bombing would cause him to
yield over Kosovo _ the Clinton administration finally sealed
Rugova's political fate by embracing the KLA and Thaci at
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   Albright devoted much of her attention there to Thaci, and her
close aide and spokesman, James Rubin, has taken on Thaci as a
project, conducting negotiations with him over the KLA's promises
to demilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason that Rugova was not in Pristina on
Thursday when Albright made a triumphal visit there, giving Thaci a
warm hug.
</P>
<P>
   While all that may help explain why Rugova kept away from Kosovo
for so long, it offers little hope that his return will rally the
forces of reconciliation and compromise. After so many deaths,
there is too much Albanian rage, and Rugova is too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Even members of his own party, the Democratic League of Kosovo,
are fed up with him now. His absence ``has caused us great harm,''
said Fadil Hysaj, one of the party's leaders. ``There can be no
more politics based purely on loyalty to one person.'' The future
of a moderate Kosovar politics, Hysaj suggested, was now at stake.

THE ABSTRACT MEETING OF SCIENCE AND ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOWER, Mo. _ Mathematicians may love him, but that doesn't add
up to success in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story, so far at least, for Brent Collins, an
abstract sculptor who lives in Gower, just south of St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is a curious aesthetic hero: a self-taught artist with
no formal mathematics training who has become an international
superstar in art-math circles.
</P>
<P>
   His elegantly symmetrical sculptures, constructed in wood and
sometimes cast in bronze, emulate the structural designs of
elements that can be seen only through microscopes: the atom, the
DNA icon, viruses and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s Collins' sculptures have been shown at such
intellectual institutions as the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in Washington and the Fermi National
Particle Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz got louder this summer when two of Collins' pieces were
conspicuously placed at the entrance to the Science in the
Arts//Art in the Sciences exhibition held in conjunction with the
World Conference on Science in Budapest, Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   And a new Collins sculpture titled ``Atomic Flower 2'' is being
considered by Microsoft. If commissioned, the $25,000 bronze would
be placed on the campus of the computer software giant's
headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Collins left his native Illinois six years ago and moved to
Gower with his wife, Ann, a native of St. Joseph. He recognizes the
incongruity of living in a rural community in Missouri while being
touted by math people around the world as the poster boy for
``intuitively created visual mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters in the science world have hailed him as a genius.
But Collins sees himself as nothing more than a lifelong lover of
popular science with a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel validated,'' Collins said of the attention he
enjoys. Still he craves wider recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant fraction of a life's work,'' Collins said
with a touch of wistfulness, waving his hand at a roomful of more
than 20 of his meticulous creations that have yet to be shared with
the public. ``They're just crying out to be seen by more people
instead of languishing here.''
</P>
<P>
   The geometry of imagination
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a psychedelic poster artist in San Francisco 30 years
ago, would like a major gallery show. But the idea has been met
with indifference by the legitimate art world, which has made
Collins cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually to tell you the truth,'' Collins said, ``my
sensitivity to potential hurt is so acute that I've probably stayed
away from (those) situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Collins says$ordinary people would like his artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is getting through to the individuals who make the
decisions,'' he said. ``They may be very smart, but they may also
be missing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Something perhaps as simple as an appreciation of beauty for
beauty's sake?
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be a prejudice against people liking what they
see,'' Collins said. ``Some contemporary art is meant to challenge.
It's abstruse, it's provocative, sometimes it's in your face, and
sometimes people don't enjoy it. That's OK. You can use those
mxperiences to engage the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's nothing wrong with people coming in to see objects
that have a certain serenity and that people simply love the beauty
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' first attempts at sculpture in the late 1960s were
portrait busts in wax, ranging from Neanderthal man to his
grandmother. He said he moved to abstract forms to keep his
imagination stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already had this almost given level of _ excuse the word, I
don't mean it in an arrogant sense _ mastery that was just
essentially there for naturalistic sculpture,'' Collins said. ``And
I needed a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need to think and think hard and to try to understand
seems to be deeply built into my makeup. And I could never be
content with just simply representing the natural forms that we
see, the human body or whatever. I needed to go somewhere. I needed
to create another world.''
</P>
<P>
   A major fan of that world is collaborator Carlo Sequin,
professor of computer science at the University of California at
Berkeley. Sequin has created three-dimensional computer software
that allows Collins to quickly test the viability of more complex
geometrical ideas without having to build a time-consuming physical
model.
</P>
<P>
   Sequin is fascinated by what he sees as the timeless quality of
Collins' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also probably intercultural,'' Sequin said. ``You show it
to an Eskimo, I am sure they would eppreciate it. You show it in
Africa, I am sure they would relate to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the other things shown in galleries today, they're
very much just this time point, this culture, and maybe only even
understandable as art if the artist is there and gives you a story
about what it all means, and the story's often longer than the
artwork. This geometric art doesn't really need much explanation.
Either you like that shape or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And artist and mathematician John Sims, an international curator
of the art show featuring Collins' sculptures in Budapest this
summer, declares an unshakable affinity for the work.
</P>
<P>
   As coordinator of mathematics at the Ringling School of Art and
Design in Sarasota, Fla., Sims teaches his students that art can be
as analytical as math and that math can be as creative as art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the wider art community hasn't been very
receptive to this kind of work because they've been alienated by
mathematics,'' Sims said. ``Because of that there hasn't been
enough art criticism to properly place this kind of work. It
usually gets dismissed as something that is cute, something that is
toyish, but not taken seriously in terms of being incredible
illustrations of the power of the synergy between the (intuitive)
right brain and the (analytical) left brain. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The new art of the future is going to be highly
technology-based, computer-based and mathematically based because
mathematics as a technology allows the artist to see beyond his
eyes. And Brent Collins is on the forefront of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscopes of time
</P>
<P>
   Despite Collins' uphill climb toward credibility, he does have
his supporters in the traditional art world. One, eminent art
theoretician Rudolf Arnheim, saw Collins' work in Leonardo: The
International Journal of the Arts, Sciences and Technology in 1992.
He responded with a hand-written letter of praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that the musical complexity of these pieces has
helped to revive my hope for the undiminished survival of art in
the present generation,'' Arnheim wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Nahas, an independent art curator and critic in New
York, has shown Collins' sculptures to several Big Apple dealers
and collectors, who are ``very excited about the work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins faces a struggle because his sculptures do not lend
themselves to current appetites for multilayered narrative and
metaphor, Nahas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gyros of time take their time in turning,'' Nahas said.
``And I think Brent's work will find its voice in the larger scheme
of things. The clarity and the power of the work is undeniable. But
I know that it might get pretty lonely out there after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such support, Collins is a realist. Questions of
acceptance aside, he said creating his sculptures takes a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 58,'' Collins said. ``I don't know how much longer I can
continue to do this, both in terms of thinking up the patterns and
composing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designing the sculpture I do just takes every bit of my
nervous system. I'm negotiating the highest level of complexity I'm
capable of. And there are days when my house of cards comes falling
down.''

   TRAVEL-WHALING-KANSAS (Gloucester, Mass.) _ Whale watching has
become a mini-industry in Gloucester, one of New England's
best-known fishing ports as well as a haven for artists. Cape Ann
now bills itself as the ``Whale Watching Capital of the World,''
says Michael Costello, executive director of the Cape Ann Chamber
of Commerce. By ALLEN HOLDER. Separate sidebar slugged
Travel-Cape-Kansas. 1,500 words. Story will move in the ``l''

<P>
   TRAVEL-CAPE-KANSAS (Gloucester, Mass.) _ Detailed information
about whale watching expeditions and accommodations on Cape Ann.
Accompanies story slugged Travel-whaling-Kansas. By ALLEN HOLDER.
700 words. Story will move in the ``l'' category.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRANSON-KANSAS (Branson, Mo.) _ In the beginning were the
waters and the fish.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century _ before Missouri 76 became ``Country
Music Boulevard,'' before the night sky glowed neon, before Branson
boasted 40 shows and go-kart races on every corner _ parents lugged
their children to this Ozarks small town to enjoy a dammed stretch
of the White River known as Lake Taneycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the seemingly endless line of tour buses that edge
through town, it can be easy to forget that there ever was such a
thing as a fishing mecca nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still there. Perhaps the biggest surprise to any who
have watched Branson explode in the last decade is the look of the
lake these days. It's certainly not crowded like it was in the old
days. By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD. 1,250 words. Story will move in the
``l'' category.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONY-KRUEGER-KANSAS (Kansas City, Mo.) _ ``Karl Krueger'' _
the name rang the faintest of bells. So out came the booklet
accompanying the recording of Edward MacDowell tone poems, just
issued on the Bridge label.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the man who founded the Society for the Preservation of
the American Musical Heritage. During the 1960s that was the
imprint for a series of records devoted to largely forgotten
American composers like MacDowell, Arthur Foote and George
Whitefield Chadwick, with Krueger conducting London's Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life _ he died 20 years ago last month _
Krueger donated his master tapes to the Library of Congress. Now,
in an ongoing issue of recordings from the library's archives, the
Bridge label is resurrecting Krueger on CD. By SCOTT CANTRELL.

<P>
   ART-SCIENTIFIC-KANSAS (Gower, Mo.) _ Mathematicians may love
him, but that doesn't add up to success in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story, so far at least, for Brent Collins, an
abstract sculptor who lives in Gower, just south of St. Joseph, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is a curious aesthetic hero: a self-taught artist with
no formal mathematics training who has become an international
superstar in art-math circles.
</P>
<P>
   His elegantly symmetrical sculptures, constructed in wood and
sometimes cast in bronze, emulate the structural designs of
elements that can be seen only through microscopes: the atom, the
DNA icon, viruses and proteins. By BRIAN McTAVISH. 1,200 words.

FANS HAVE TURNED ATTENTION AWAY FROM BRANSON'S PLACID WATERWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON _ In the beginning were the waters and the fish.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century _ before Missouri 76 became ``Country
Music Boulevard,'' before the night sky glowed neon, before Branson
boasted 40 shows and go-kart races on every corner _ parents lugged
their children to this Ozarks small town to enjoy a dammed stretch
of the White River known as Lake Taneycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the late 1950s and 1960s, some of the locals started
wondering whether those families who played all day on the water
would be interested in something to do at night. Area caves were
opened to tourists, Silver Dollar City was born, a couple of
families started putting on hillbilly shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a few entertainers with national reputations _ Roy
Clark, the Foggy River Boys _ joined the music scene. In the early
1990s dozens more singers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Which led to the Branson of today, a town of 4,000 residents and
more than 150 motels. Watching the seemingly endless line of tour
buses that edge through town, it can be easy to forget that there
ever was such a thing as a fishing mecca nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still there. Perhaps the biggest surprise to any who
have watched Branson explode in the last decade is the look of the
lake these days.
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman Dave Blauser of Payson, Ill., has been coming to
Branson since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you wouldn't know this was the same place if the map
didn't say Branson,'' he said. ``When I first came down here, there
were a couple places open on the highway, but it was nothing
compared to now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here, on the lake, not much has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some worry that not as many fishermen come anymore,
scared off by the bustle of local commerce or worried that there
don't seem to be as many big fish these days. The Branson Chamber
of Commerce reports that more than eight of 10 people who visit
Branson say they shop or attend shows. But only about three of 10
say they have much to do with the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wallace owns the Wildbird Resort, which caters to those who
still fish the lake. He remembers when fishing resorts lining the
lake would be crowded, some close to year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still get a few fishermen down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace maintains that those few are an afterthought to the
Branson tourist economy these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake, the place that started it all, has been forgotten
about,'' he said. ``Branson's an entertainment center now. We're
not about fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm young enough. I'll see it change back again.''
</P>
<P>
   It has changed several times before.
</P>
<P>
   The White River was a good bass-fishing river. But in 1913 the
Ozark Beach Dam east of Branson turned a section of the river into
Lake Taneycomo, which made it better for boating and a popular
family destination.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, west of Branson, the White River was dammed again,
forming Table Rock Lake and turning Taneycomo into a cold-water
lake, which meant trout instead of bass, and which discouraged
swimmers and recreational boaters. The lake quickly attracted the
attention of fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s the fishing was so heavy that the state started
stocking rainbow and brown trout. By the mid-1980s it was putting a
million fish a year into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mitchell, assistant manager of the lakeside Shepherd of the
Hills Hatchery where the trout are spawned, says this year the
state will plop about 775,000 trout into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   And enough people still come to fish that most of the trout will
be caught, usually within a month of being released.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who fish, there are changes to the routine.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Toomey makes a 91/2-hour drive from Indiana to Branson each
Memorial Day weekend. He stays by the lake, where he says it's
still quiet and peaceful. Some days he and his family go to shows
or Silver Dollar City.
</P>
<P>
   But when he can get away, he goes fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing is still the same,'' Toomey said. ``There are good
days and bad days, though even bad days spent fishing are pretty
good. Most times you can catch your limit, so when you don't you
don't mind so much.''
</P>
<P>
   From the bluffs that stretch along either shore, Lake Taneycomo
looks to be little more than a slow-moving, bending river, wider
than the Little Blue, narrower than the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen troll the edges or zip their boats down the middle to
favorite spots, leaving wakes that slosh onto both banks. The water
looks green, though that's a reflection of the forests that climb
the surrounding hills. From a boat, the water is clear enough that
fishermen often can watch bait close to 20 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Klein, the owner of the Main Street Marina on Lake
Taneycomo, came to the area in the 1970s to fish for bass, when a
friend suggested trying trout fishing in Taneycomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dumb to the area, and we were trolling salmon eggs, when
I caught my first fish, a 4-pounder,'' he recalled. ``I've been
hooked on the lake ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 he bought a resort. In 1992 he sold it and bought the
marina. He still fishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the bottom line is that if I was buying a business in
Branson today, I'd be betting on the lake,'' he said. ``Because the
lake was here before all the shows, and the lake will be here long
after they've all faded from memory.''
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO LAKE TANEYCOMO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Branson is on Lake Taneycomo, about 220 miles southeast of
Kansas City. Take Interstate 70 to Missouri 13, then south on 13 to
Springfield. From Springfield, take U.S. 65 south to Branson.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   Branson has more than 150 hotels, motels and resorts, including
several that cater to fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   - Crow's Nest, HC1 Box 792, Branson, Mo. 65616; telephone (417)
338-2524. It's as close to the lake as any resort could get.
Depending on the number of people and the type of cottage you're
interested in, prices range from $58 a night to $115. The resort,
which has been open for 35 years, has 15 cottages.
</P>
<P>
   - Wild Bird Resort, 500 North Sycamore, Branson, Mo. 65616;
telephone (417) 334-2029. The Wild Bird opened in 1910 and has 14
cabins sitting on Lake Taneycomo. The resort is is on a peninsula
surrounded by 150-foot trees and water. Prices range from $44 to
$65 a night.
</P>
<P>
   - Artilla Cove Resort, HC1 Box 839 Branson, Mo. 65616; telephone
(417) 338-2346. This resort, which opened 35 years ago, sits right
on Table Rock Lake. The resort has 10 cottages, priced from $39 to
$155, depending on season.
</P>
<P>

A WHALE OF A TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN HOLDER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ ``Oh! This is the first time I ever saw a
real live whale in the real live ocean!''
</P>
<P>
   She's squealing. Uninhibitedly enthusiastic, the sixth-grade
Girl Scout is caught up in the moment and doesn't care who knows
how excited she is at her sighting of a humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   I remain silent. But I know just how she feels.
</P>
<P>
   HHH
</P>
<P>
   We've been on the Miss Cape Ann only about 25 minutes this
Saturday morning in May, nowhere close to our destination, when the
first whale is seen. ``Eleven o'clock,'' naturalist Mason Weinrich
announces over the PA system. Almost immediately the 40 or so of us
aboard spring up and, herdlike, move toward the ship's bow.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras and binoculars affixed to our eyes, we scan the water
just as we've been told, looking ahead and slightly left _ 11
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   The boat slows and then stops. The beast is out there somewhere.
As the seconds pass, more and more of my boatmates find what
they're searching for ``There it is!'' ``Do you see it?'' ``Look!''
</P>
<P>
   I try not to even blink, afraid somehow that I'll end up like
the person in the chewing gum commercial. Searching for a fresh
stick, she missed the opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And then there it is. Several hundred yards from the boat, it
breaches the surface and frolics in the 53-degree Atlantic for
several minutes before making one final dive, waving its V-shaped
black-and-white tail and disappearing. Since humpbacks _ named for
their habit of arching their backs as they dive _ can stay below
the surface 30 minutes at a time, our boat moves on, even if its
passengers haven't had their fill. Not to worry. It's just a
precursor of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing. Sightings are guaranteed on the expeditions led by
Capt. Bill's Whale Watch, as well as by his four competitors in
Gloucester (say Glaw-ster) and elsewhere on Cape Ann, about 35
miles north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, whale watching has become a mini-industry in
Gloucester, one of New England's best-known fishing ports as well
as a haven for artists. Capt. Bill's alone carries 25,000 to 35,000
visitors from April to October each year out to Stellwagen Bank, a
feeding ground about 12 miles out. A four-hour expedition costs $25
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Ann now bills itself as the ``Whale Watching Capital of the
World,'' says Michael Costello, executive director of the Cape Ann
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a really important shot in the arm to the tourist
economy over, it's a good 15 years now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to gauge the spinoff'' on the local economy,
Costello says, but the boats draw 100,000 to 125,000 people a year
to Cape Ann, not to mention competitors from Maine to Cape Cod,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Whales are just a natural magnet. ``For some people whales are
one of those animals that have a mystique to them,'' like
dinosaurs, says Weinrich, executive director of the Cetacean
Research Unit, a private nonprofit organization in Gloucester that
studies whales in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come up here expecting to go whale watching,''
says Weinrich, the leader of our excursion. ``And the trips leave
you with enough of an appreciation that when you talk about what
you did on your vacation, this is the subject that comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whales can be found in the area eight or nine months of the
year, migrating to the Caribbean only during the coldest part of
the year and the mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Our best bet today is to see humpbacks, we're told. They're
inarguably huge, averaging 30 tons and 40 to 50 feet in length.
That's half the length of the 98-foot Miss Cape Ann.
</P>
<P>
   But other whales also are sighted out here, including the even
bigger fin whales, which can reach 70 feet and 50 tons, and minke
whales, which grow only to 23 to 28 feet and weigh 10 tons. (We
didn't see either of these, or any Atlantic white-sided dolphins,
which are described as being the most common toothed cetacean in
these waters. But we did come across a couple of harbor seals,
which drew the appropriate choruses of ``ooh'' and ``He's cute.'')
</P>
<P>
   Spring is traditionally a good time to see humpbacks, but word
around town is that this year has been spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great spring,'' Weinrich confirms. ``But how long
it will last is unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinrich has spent the last 20 years talking to whale-hungry
tourists and doing research from Capt. Bill's vessels. Only Capt.
Bill's has CRU naturalists aboard, but other research groups work
on other whale-watching boats.
</P>
<P>
   HHH
</P>
<P>
   Even as the boat leaves its berth from the Harbor Loop, Weinrich
makes it clear his agenda isn't just to teach and entertain his
passengers. He's out to save the whales.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20,000 humpbacks remain, he says, down from a
population of about 100,000 before so many were killed by whalers.
Today the biggest threat to their survival is pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the future of every single whale you see out here is
an open question,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Weinrich's pitch is an easy sell to the people aboard today. Or
at least it is when the whales begin showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour after the initial sighting we reach our
destination: Stellwagen Bank. We have plenty of company: A few
fishing boats are on the horizon, as well as a couple of other
whale-watching boats. Not too far away, we can see sea gulls, often
an indication of whale activity. And at 10 o'clock on our
directional clocks, a tremendous school of sand eels _ whale bait _
appears just below the water's surface. ``It's a smorgasbord,''
says one woman.
</P>
<P>
   Humpbacks are baleen whales, which means that, instead of teeth,
they have hundreds of thin plates (baleens) that strain food from
the water. They can consume 20 to 40 pounds of sand eels in each
mouthful, Weinrich says, 2,500 to 3,000 pounds of fish every day.
</P>
<P>
   And here they come. Two at 1 o'clock. A few minutes later a
single one at 2 o'clock. And then, almost unbelievably, a threesome
at 10 o'clock. Most often they travel alone or in pairs, Weinrich
says, so this is a real treat.
</P>
<P>
   After a few sightings, we're starting to learn to look for that
shiny black body arcing in the water. And what to listen for.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHOOSH!'' The sound of a whale's ``blow'' as it emerges from
the water becomes unmistakable. ``You can listen as well as
watch,'' Weinrich instructs. ``And if you can hear the blow, the
whale can't be too far off.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sightings become more common, the watchers scurry from
side to side, focusing and clicking their cameras. But sometimes
you just have to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they'd get that close,'' says Tom Wickham, a
retired grocer from Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   But they do. So close that you don't have to wait for a whale to
breach before seeing it. Just a few inches below the surface, its
huge body is evident from end to end. And as it emerges _ WHOOSH! _
you can see the texture of its skin, the hundreds of bumps or stove
bolts _ hair follicles, actually _ along its back, and the markings
on its dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   The markings are distinct enough that even at a distance,
Weinrich can tell who's who out there.
</P>
<P>
   There's Colorado. That one's Eyebrow. Springboard. And Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Vader?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Weinrich says. He calls one whale Vader because of the
natural pattern on its tail. It forms the helmet of Darth Vader
from ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove the point, Andrea Siatkowski, a student intern from
North Carolina State University, whips out a note pad and sketches
out the black and white markings on its tail. Sure enough, Darth
Vader.
</P>
<P>
   The markings are distinct enough that whales aren't difficult to
identify, Weinrich says, although he admits: ``Part of that has
something to do with my having been out here for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The identifications are an important part of the work. ``The
more you can personalize it,'' he says, ``the more of a message it
sends about whales and their precarious positions.'' Between 100
and 125 200 humpbacks have been identified by name so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping, no doubt, that some of Miss Cape Ann's passengers
are getting the message. Such as the Girl Scouts on a weekend trip
from their home in Holliston, Mass., about 25 miles southwest of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of leery about coming out today,'' admits Scout mom
and chaperon Ruta Mickunas, a medical transcriber from Holliston.
But she has to admit: ``This is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-graders she brought along give every indication that
they agree. As the trip winds down, Weinrich starts making noises
about returning and finally announces that it's time to head back
to Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to go back yet,'' moans one.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second time that day, I know exactly how she feels.

<P>
   In print, at the movies
</P>
<P>
   To gain insight into the importance of the fishing industry to
Gloucester, read Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm. It details
the 1991 sinking of the Gloucester-based fishing boat the Andrea
Gail in a nor'easter. Warner Bros. reportedly will begin filming a
movie starring George Clooney based on the book this fall.

GOOD CONDUCT IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Karl Krueger'' _ the name rang the faintest
of bells. So out came the booklet accompanying the recording of
Edward MacDowell tone poems, just issued on the Bridge label.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the man who founded the Society for the Preservation of
the American Musical Heritage. During the 1960s that was the
imprint for a series of records devoted to largely forgotten
American composers like MacDowell, Arthur Foote and George
Whitefield Chadwick, with Krueger conducting London's Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   I remember their plain-faced long-playing record sleeves from my
classical music radio days, back in the 1970s. One of our
programmers was a champion of neglected American music, and Karl
Krueger's handiwork kept resurfacing in the bundles of LPs we daily
lugged to the control room.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life _ he died 20 years ago last month _
Krueger donated his master tapes to the Library of Congress. Now,
in an ongoing issue of recordings from the library's archives, the
Bridge label is resurrecting Krueger on CD.
</P>
<P>
   The MacDowell release reveals a capable, sensitive musician at
work, and the sonics are amazingly vivid and spacious. A second
release, less sonically refined, includes the ``Afro-American''
Symphony of William Grant Still and the ``Gaelic'' Symphony of Amy
Marcy Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Kansas Citians will remember Krueger in another
connection _ as the founding conductor of the Kansas City
Philharmonic (as the city's resident orchestra was known from 1933
until its demise in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City was only one stop for this Johnny Appleseed of
American symphony orchestras: Krueger's credits also include
restarting dormant orchestras in Seattle and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's was nothing if not a life well-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Atchison, Kan., he studied in Vienna, Austria, and
Heidelberg, Germany, and spent an apprenticeship at the Vienna
State Opera during Richard Strauss' tenure as co-director. As a
guest conductor he drew admiring reviews on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Marrying Chicago socialite Emita McCormick Jewett, heiress of
the McCormicks of harvester fame, evidently freed him from
financial concerns. But the couple's life took a tragic turn when,
in 1938, Mrs. Krueger was gunned down by her maid's irate husband.
She lived on another 17 years, but as an invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Forebears, mentors
</P>
<P>
   Between The New Grove Dictionary of American Music and dim
microfilms in The Kansas City Star library one can piece together
Krueger's life. But the evidence sometimes is contradictory _ one
suspects Krueger embroidered the truth here and there _ and gaps
remain to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Grove says Krueger was born in Atchison on Jan. 19, 1894. Some
Star clips have him born in New York, his family moving shortly
thereafter to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger claimed that seven generations of his forebears had been
on the faculty of the University of Leipzig, Germany. His father,
Carl (with a ``C''), was a professor of philology at the University
of Basel in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But having converted from agnosticism to Lutheranism, Carl
Krueger volunteered for educational work of a missionary nature. He
wanted to go to Africa but his health was deemed too fragile.
Somehow he landed in Atchison, teaching at the little Lutheran
school known as Midland College.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur violist, Carl made sure his four sons studied
stringed instruments, young Karl taking up the cello (as well as
organ); the boys performed together as a string quartet. A sister,
Norma, played piano _ and, years later, appeared as a soloist with
the Kansas City Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was the only son to pursue a musical career _ over his
father's misgivings. Having spent 1914-15 studying at the England
Conservatory in Boston with the composer Chadwick and the organist
Wallace Goodrich, he spent four years as organist and choirmaster
of St. Ann's Episcopal Church in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At his father's insistence, Krueger also pursued a more
``practical'' education, receiving a bachelor of arts degree from
Midland College, then a master of arts from the University of
Kansas. In the early 1920s he went on to study _ some sources say
law, some economics _ at the universities of Heidelberg and Vienna.
But in Vienna he also worked with some legendary musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger claimed the great conductors Arthur Nikisch and Felix
Weingartner among his teachers, although neither is cited in the
Grove profile. Weingartner was at any rate a dominant figure at the
time in Vienna, as principal conductor of both the Vienna
Philharmonic and the Volksoper. Nikisch, then dividing himself
between the Leipzig Gewandhaus and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras,
seems something of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But Grove does report that Krueger worked with the organist,
conductor, composer and teacher Robert Fuchs, whom Brahms called
``a splendid musician.'' Other Fuchs students included Mahler,
Zemlinsky, Wolf and Sibelius.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger also studied with the conductor Franz Schalk, a protege
of Bruckner (and a heavy-handed editor of the latter's symphonies).
Schalk succeeded Mahler as co-director, with Strauss, of the Vienna
State Opera, where Krueger got an apprenticeship on the conducting
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sources differ on whether Krueger returned to the United States
in 1922 or 1924; in any case, he married Emita Jewett in 1923. A
Kansas City Star story reports that the obviously well-heeled
couple lived in Vienna, Chicago and Seattle before coming to Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925 in Seattle, Krueger teamed up with local members of the
American Federation of Musicians to reorganize the Seattle Symphony
Orchestra, which had been inactive for a time. Krueger stayed on as
the orchestra's music director until 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter, taskmaster
</P>
<P>
   Krueger next set his sights on Kansas City, where so far no
orchestra had managed to get a lasting foothold. The city now was
in the depths of the Great Depression, but in 1933 the town proved
its pluck with three signal accomplishments: the opening of the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and the University of Kansas City, and
the first concert _ on Nov. 28, in a screened-off section of the
old Convention Hall _ of Karl Krueger's brand-new Kansas City
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians agreed to play for a share of the ticket receipts.
Krueger won everyone's heart by declining a salary for the first
season.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old violinist Mortimer Alpert was the youngest
musician in the ensemble. Now retired after a 63-year career in the
Philharmonic and the succeeding Kansas City Symphony, Alpert
remembers Krueger as ``one of those people who are more or less
grandiose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great extemporaneous speaker, very much at home
speaking, using correct language. He was quite a person as far as
being able to make a talk, off the cuff, without any notes.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Krueger a good musician?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' Alpert says after some hesitation. ``His
knowledge, in depth, of the contents of the score _ I don't think
he had that going for him at the time,'' Alpert says. ``But he was
a good promoter. And he was a taskmaster as far as rehearsing.''
</P>
<P>
   By its third season the Philharmonic had a subscriber base of
some 4,000, said to be one of the largest in the country. In 1936
the orchestra moved to the brand-new Music Hall, and during that
season the soloists included the pianists Josef Hofmann and Artur
Schnabel and the baritone Lawrence Tibbett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandiose'' Krueger may have been, but Kansas Citians were
wowed by his gift of gab _ and his knack for turning on the common
touch when it served his purposes. Writing in 1939, Kansas City
Star columnist Henry Van Brunt was impressed to find the balding,
bushy-browed, stogie-smoking Krueger ``not in the least `arty';
neither was he `sicklied o'er with the pale cast' of an effete
Europe ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we found, was, after all, very much of a man's man, and
a darned good egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during his Kansas City tenure, Krueger and his wife often
lived apart; Mort Alpert remembers the missus spending most of her
time in Chicago. But at least in the summer of 1938 she and the
couple's daughter, Theresa, were living in a smart Spanish-revival
home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to pick up Theresa from a dancing lesson one
afternoon, Mrs. Krueger was mowed down by gunshots. The assailant,
one Charles E. McDonald, accused Mrs. Krueger of turning his wife
(Mrs. Krueger's maid) against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Krueger hovered near death for some days, then lived on for
17 years as an invalid. An infection around one of the
never-removed bullets finally carried her off in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Refinement, sensitivity
</P>
<P>
   Having taken the burgeoning Kansas City Philharmonic as far
afield as Chicago, Krueger wanted to make it a regional orchestra
also serving Wichita and Tulsa, Okla. But the board of trustees
balked at Krueger's grand plans, and _ with a job in Detroit in the
works _ the conductor resigned from the Philharmonic in June 1943.
His replacement was to be the Russian-born Efrem Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, as in Seattle, the local orchestra had suspended
operations. Krueger got it going again, under the name Detroit
Orchestra, but this incarnation lasted only six years. Not until
1951, with the arrival of Paul Paray, did the Detroit Symphony set
down permanent roots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 Krueger founded a radio orchestra in New York, but it
lasted only one season. Otherwise, after leaving Detroit, he worked
as a free-lance guest conductor and ran his American-music
recording organization. Krueger also penned two books: The Way of
the Conductor: His Origins, Purpose and Procedures (1958) and The
Musical Heritage of the United States: The Unknown Portion (1973).
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times wire service report from 1942, covering a
concert by the short-lived New York City Symphony, praised
Krueger's ``interpretations of marked refinement and sensitivity.''
Reviewing a 1954 London concert by the Royal Philharmonic, the
distinguished British critic Scott Goddard called Krueger ``simply
a fine musician (there can be no greater compliment) with a clean,
clear stick technique and a keen sense of proportion and
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Krueger's interpretation of the Beethoven Seventh
Symphony, a London Times critic wrote, ``(Krueger) exposed its
content lucidly, drawing refined and nobly phrased playing from the
Royal Philharmonic orchestra, and maintaining a lively rhythmic
impulse in the scherzo and finale.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger was 85 when he died, in July 1979, in Elgin, Ill. Today
he's largely forgotten, a music-history footnote. But The New Grove
Dictionary of American Music awards him an important distinction,
as ``the first American-born conductor to become music director of
an important American orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   For which Kansas City _ with an American-bred, British-trained
woman, Anne Manson, now poised to take over the Kansas City
Symphony _ can take some pride, too.

<P>
   KRAKOW, Poland _ Visit Krakow, I was told, to experience the
charm and culture of Polish tradition in a city left all but
untouched by the destruction of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's the castle high atop Wawell Hill
overlooking the Vistula River where the early pages of Polish
history were written in the early part of the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there's the Pigly Wigly grocery store that traces
its history back to Bryan, Texas, in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Guess where I spent most of my time.
</P>
<P>
   Piggly Wiggly, spelled with double G's in the U.S., has outlets
throughout the South and Southwest, a tradition in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Maciarz brought the name back to Krakow to honor the
country that gave her and her husband refuge in a time when Poland
was shackled by martial law.
</P>
<P>
   They were visiting the U.S. as tourists in 1981, planning to
stay for a couple of months and then return home.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Poland, under the old Communist regime, enacted
martial law in a crackdown against labor protests in support of
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government allowed Polish visitors to remain as
refugees during this time, and thanks to Polish-American friends,
the couple found work in Bryan, Texas, where they helped with the
upkeep of a 10,000-acre ranch.
</P>
<P>
   And the Piggly Wiggly supermarket was where Mrs. Maciarz did her
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed 3 1/2 years,'' she said. ``Then martial law had
ended in Poland, and we had to decide to remain in the U.S. or come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pregnant and I decided my child was worthy of being
Polish.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a choice she sometimes regretted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thought that after the martial law there would be
changes and things would be better,'' she said. ``But it took 15
years for things to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused to shake her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one life, and we had to wait so long. So much
time was wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 45, Mrs. Maciarz was able to start life anew with
the business that her father had owned before communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had been taken from the people,'' she said.
``Finally we were able to get the grocery store back after the
collapse of communism in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who by then was dead, had called it simply the
Butcher's Shop. Mrs. Maciarz wanted the store to be something more.
She wanted in Poland what people had in America. She wanted her own
``Pigly Wigly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we sell everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Krakow store is small but well stocked with fresh produce,
canned goods, a full array of meat _ indeed, everything a shopper
could want.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so many people, they don't have money,'' she said. ``We
even loan them money so they can buy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are better in Poland now, Mrs. Maciarz said, but much
remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to continue with the reforms in every
part of life. But faster, faster! Everything is taking so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, she and her husband hope to return to the U.S., again
as tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as some journalists write here, that the American
people don't care,'' she said, her voice rising with emotion. ``I
met a lot of terrific people in the United States. Americans have a
lot of courage. We are lucky there are Americans.''

   1. ROBOKITTY SAYS ``MEOW!'' Cute robots resembling our favourite
pets have hit the marketplace. But ``Robokoneko'' - which is
Japanese for Robokitty - may have something they don't : a mind of
its own. In the next year or two, for about $300,000, its creator
expects to turn a piece of 'evolvable hardware' into a brain - via
wireless remote control - for his purring robotic kitten. By
Nicholas Kristof. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length
(2,900 words) + edited article available.

LUCID AFRICA For a long time, African countries had a tendency to
delude themselves. Overwhelmed by calamity - sporadic famines,
regular putsches, blood-stained dictatorships, ethnic massacres -
they would launch into ritual imprecations and charge others with
responsibility for their ills, seeking only rarely to lay the blame
at their own door. And yet - this is new - African countries are
now no longer content to look for scapegoats elsewhere. From Le
Monde. 800 words. (English translation available.)

THE NEW RED SCARE Who's afraid of China? This summer, there is a
new kind of Red scare. But the People's Republic has too many
problems at home to make trouble abroad. By Patrick B. Tyler. From
The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,500 words) + edited

STEVEN WEINBERG : STILL DREAMING OF A FINAL THEORY Steven Weinberg,
a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, has spent much of his
life locked in one of science's most difficult -- but symbolically
most important -- quests : trying to develop a single, unified
``final theory'' to explain how the fundamental forces of nature
work. Though much of his work is arcane and complex, it
fundamentally deals with some of the deepest questions of existence
: Is there a God? Did He have to create this world? Does our
existence have a meaning? Could there be other worlds like ours?
Weinberg, who first explained his work in the book ``Dreams of a
Final Theory,'' concludes that such a theory may depict the
universe as ``cold and impersonal.'' But he considers his quest one
of great beauty. In the end, he says, it may explain things so
simply that scientists will ask, ``Why didn't we think of that
before?'' From Der Spiegel. 1,500 words. (English translation
available.)

   A. Dictator of the Depths Nitrogen is essential for the growth
of phytoplankton - microscopic plants - in the ocean. But the level
of nitrogen in the water is closely coupled to the level of another
element, phosphorus, which is also needed for plants to survive. It
is not immediately obvious which element limits the amount of
growth. The answer to this question may be important because
man-made products, such as fertilisers containing nitrogen and
phosphorus, are seeping into the ocean and changing the
concentrations. Knowing which is the controlling element could
determine the direction of preservation efforts. By Hannah Wunsch.

   B. Mapping Malaria Researchers have known since the late 19th
century that malaria is caused by four different, closely related
parasites. Gaining a better understanding of the inner working of
the most deadly of these (plasmodium falciparum,) could be crucial
for making progress in new drug and vaccine development. A part of
the genome sequence of this parasite has now been found. By Hannah
Wunsch. 500 words.

   TRAVEL-WHALING: _ Whale watching has become a mini-industry in
Gloucester, one of New England's best-known fishing ports as well
as a haven for artists. Cape Ann now bills itself as the ``Whale
Watching Capital of the World,'' says Michael Costello, executive
director of the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce. By Allen Holder.

   For much of this century _ before Missouri 76 became ``Country
Music Boulevard,'' before the night sky glowed neon, before Branson
boasted 40 shows and go-kart races on every corner _ parents lugged
their children to this Ozarks small town to enjoy a dammed stretch
of the White River known as Lake Taneycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the seemingly endless line of tour buses that edge
through town, it can be easy to forget that there ever was such a
thing as a fishing mecca nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still there. Perhaps the biggest surprise to any who
have watched Branson explode in the last decade is the look of the
lake these days. It's certainly not crowded like it was in the old
days. By Matthew Schofield. 1,250 words.

   SYMPHONY-KRUEGER: _ ``Karl Krueger'' _ the name rang the

recording of Edward MacDowell tone poems, just issued on the Bridge
label.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the man who founded the Society for the Preservation of
the American Musical Heritage. During the 1960s that was the
imprint for a series of records devoted to largely forgotten
American composers like MacDowell, Arthur Foote and George
Whitefield Chadwick, with Krueger conducting London's Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life _ he died 20 years ago last month _
Krueger donated his master tapes to the Library of Congress. Now,
in an ongoing issue of recordings from the library's archives, the
Bridge label is resurrecting Krueger on CD. By Scott Cantrell.

<P>
   ART-SCIENTIFIC: _ Mathematicians may love him, but that doesn't
add up to success in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story, so far at least, for Brent Collins, an
abstract sculptor who lives in Gower, just south of St. Joseph, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is a curious aesthetic hero: a self-taught artist with
no formal mathematics training who has become an international
superstar in art-math circles.
</P>
<P>
   His elegantly symmetrical sculptures, constructed in wood and
sometimes cast in bronze, emulate the structural designs of
elements that can be seen only through microscopes: the atom, the
DNA icon, viruses and proteins. By Brian McTavish. 1,200 words.

   ``It used to be that trends lasted a decade, or at least five
years. Now they come and go every three months,'' said Calin
Riffle, a jewelry designer who also owns Anata, a New York apparel
and jewelry showroom.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that trends have a shorter life span than they once
did. The reasons vary, but generally revolve around a culture
bombarded by media _ including the Internet _ by celebrity
influence and by the growth of television shows _ on networks and
on cable _ about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While many teen-agers might love to see trendy new items in the
stores on a weekly basis, this can pose a huge problem for
retailers and manufacturers when the trend dies.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often resort to markdowns or moving the merchandise to
their outlet stores, while manufacturers offer the goods to
retailers at reduced prices, or to outlet stores or off-pricers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people look to the media to tell them what trends to
follow, and teens are quick to try to emulate what young
celebrities are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Gordon, editor of the L Report, published by Lambesis,
cites Cameron Diaz, Lauryn Hill and Jennifer Lopez as some of the
hour's more influential trendsetters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, said Gordon, there is a Japanese pop star and
model who goes by the name of Angie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything she wears in a photograph or on television sells out
the next day (in Japan), both the exact item and any knockoffs,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Greenman, women's buyer for The Junkman's Daughter, a
specialty store in Atlanta, reports the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a popular performing artist on MTV wears something,
everybody wants it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, when the female lead singer of
Genitorturers appeared on the MTV Music Awards wearing Lip Service,
there were numerous requests for her outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a trend dies on the selling floor. Greenman said
the Marc Jacobs-inspired pleated skirt was over before she got her
shipment in. They sold after being marked down.
</P>
<P>
   Even though celebrities may be setting the trends, there are
still many people who insist on individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is broader now because people want some
individuality,'' said Larry Hansel, chief executive officer of
Rampage, a Los Angeles-based junior line.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want to create their own looks by having more trends
to mix and match, so it's not all about just the India or the
hippie trend, he said. In fact, L Report's Gordon calls the look of
the moment ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than any other factor, advanced communication
technologies speed up trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the '90s, people didn't have the same awareness. Now
there are 8 million magazines and the Internet. There's just more
stimulation,'' said Wendy Red, owner of Up Against the Wall, a
15-unit specialty store chain based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to Red, today's teens are used to the fast pace; most
of her customers are looking for items to wear that same night.
</P>
<P>
   Red said she doesn't typically get stuck with dead stock, but
one trend she did bomb with was bleached stretch jeans. She said
she monitors inventory and marks down items immediately if they're
not moving fast enough. Things that just aren't selling are moved
to Up Against the Wall's discount warehouse, where some items sell
for as little as $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Fiene, design director for Los Angeles-based junior line
XOXO, said her customer shops every week. Some trends that bombed
for XOXO were skants and the whole Prada-influenced utility look.
</P>
<P>
   Fiene said they were just too early for her customer and that
both looks are starting to get publicity now.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO sends its dead stock to its three outlet stores: Two are in
Southern California and one is in New Jersey. They also sell to
Marshalls, Ross and TJ Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage sells its dead stock to Marshalls, or holds internal
sample sales in its parking lot, or donates them to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a trend doesn't even last a season. By the time I
get it in, it's over,'' said Greenman, who finds long-lived trends
just as unnerving at her store. She cites, for example, chinos,
which have saturated the market and now bore her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is the key word at a show, when I hear it
everywhere, I get sick of it,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers a steadier pace, rather than some trends lasting two
years while others last two months.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on dead stock, most retailers test merchandise. Up
Against the Wall's Red tried out skants in the spring, but either
too many manufacturers made them, or her customers hadn't seen them
enough in the media. She'll try them again in the fall, but doesn't
think they'll be especially meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Other than testing, Red relies on gut instinct, and on being
totally aware of her market and the media through traveling, and
scouting clubs and trendy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman has her own kind of market research going. She'll carry
something if she can think of three people she knows who would wear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Online catalogs limit dead stock by functioning as test and
reorder businesses. Rather than forecasting, Karen Ngo, creative
and fashion director for Alloy, a junior Web site and online
catalog, is responding to what's selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait and see. We go out on the streets and see what kids
are wearing. The minute a trend stops selling, we drop it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo also reports trends change faster than necessary. How long
the market says a trend should last may not coincide consumer
demand, as is the case with butterfly and dragonfly motifs. For
that reason, Alloy plans on doing more of its own product
development.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers, more trends mean more profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is all about change, which works to our advantage.
Trends are essential to our success,'' said Jerry Friedman,
national sales manager for Dollhouse, a junior contemporary company
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says if a style or group isn't well received, it's
dropped immediately. He adds that the advantage of sourcing
domestically is that he doesn't have to take as many risks, such as
committing to large orders from overseas. He can also react quickly
once he finds out something is a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
   When Dollhouse has dead stock, it offers it to regular accounts
at closeout prices so retailers have a chance for margin-building
profits. They also sell to TJ Maxx and Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's Fiene notes that if you want to keep selling, you must
keep up, or the consumer will think you're stale. Her goal is to be
the first to adapt a trend well once it hits the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover every trend, but in our way. For example, we revamped
the cargo to fit our sexy, feminine image. It's not about knocking
it off exactly,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's Friedman calls his interpretations an ``edgy basic
with attitude.'' Rather than compete with the Gaps of the world,
Dollhouse tweaks basics with the latest styles and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage's Hansel aspires to create the same combination, what he
calls ``the perfect marrying of the basic with the trend,'' the key
to his business. He adds that the more body types a trend suits,
the broader its customer base, which equals higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on top of trends, manufacturers rely on different
resources. Dollhouse employs students from the Fashion Institute of
Technology as scouts, while XOXO's design team travels to Europe
more than five times a year, looks through every magazine and
runway photo, and scours the streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end with discovering a trend, though; manufacturers
must then guess its progression. Good examples are capri pants,
which evolved from 1998s slim version that fell right below the
knee, to this year's wide-leg, seven-eighths cut, and the shrug,
which evolved from the attached version to separates.
</P>
<P>
   According to XOXO's Fiene, newness is what sells. ``We may
approach a trend from a different angle. Like we'll change the
color on a Gucci-inspired Hawaiian print, but our goal is to move
on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trends that manufacturers and retailers have moved on from
are baggy, urban styles inspired by hip-hop; wide-leg raver pants
with 30-40 inch cuffs; butterfly or fairy motifs; woven knits;
shrugs; futuristic/high tech looks; layers, and boot cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few trends continue to do exceptionally well. Both Rampage and
Dollhouse report stretch is still No. 1, with at least 80 percent
to 90 percent of the lines incorporating spandex.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's biggest sellers are dark denim, seven-eighths
trousers and tube tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel reports denim, Hawaiian prints, and anything with shine,
iridescence, metallic embellishment or glitter are Rampage's
strongest sellers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Moving away from solids, XOXO's biggest trends are Hawaiian
prints in stretch twill, embellished denim, paisley cotton prints
and lots of color. For styles, camisoles, halters and seven-eighths
pants sell well.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer item is the backless apron top. Red reports
selling 100 to 200 tops a week from Maryland-based Gear Co. She
also does well with stretch denim; seven-eighths pants; stretch
wire chokers, and hair clips and barettes with rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming trends range from peasant to hippie to circus-inspired,
each fantasy-related and in vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word for fall and spring is `skin.' Once the baggy
look is over, you're going to see a lot more peekaboo tops, bare
shoulders, and open fronts and backs,'' Hansel said. Dresses will
make a big comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best item to show off all the prints for next
spring,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Fiene plans to show lots of Pucci, paisley and
floral prints, plus Mexican and peasant ruffled looks and Indian
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories will feature colored jewels and rhinestones,
feathers, mirrors, beading and crystals. Whether to run with
upcoming trends should depend on one's niche, says L Report's
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can smell out a phony from a mile away,'' she said.
``They know when someone is jumping on the bandwagon.''

the next day (in Japan), both the exact item and any knockoffs,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Greenman, women's buyer for The Junkman's Daughter, a
specialty store in Atlanta, reports the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a popular performing artist on MTV wears something,
everybody wants it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, when the female lead singer of
Genitorturers appeared on the MTV Music Awards wearing Lip Service,
there were numerous requests for her outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a trend dies on the selling floor. Greenman said
the Marc Jacobs-inspired pleated skirt was over before she got her
shipment in. They sold after being marked down.
</P>
<P>
   Even though celebrities may be setting the trends, there are
still many people who insist on individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is broader now because people want some
individuality,'' said Larry Hansel, chief executive officer of
Rampage, a Los Angeles-based junior line.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want to create their own looks by having more trends
to mix and match, so it's not all about just the India or the
hippie trend, he said. In fact, L Report's Gordon calls the look of
the moment ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than any other factor, advanced communication
technologies speed up trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the '90s, people didn't have the same awareness. Now
there are 8 million magazines and the Internet. There's just more
stimulation,'' said Wendy Red, owner of Up Against the Wall, a
15-unit specialty store chain based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to Red, today's teens are used to the fast pace; most
of her customers are looking for items to wear that same night.
</P>
<P>
   Red said she doesn't typically get stuck with dead stock, but
one trend she did bomb with was bleached stretch jeans. She said
she monitors inventory and marks down items immediately if they're
not moving fast enough. Things that just aren't selling are moved
to Up Against the Wall's discount warehouse, where some items sell
for as little as $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Fiene, design director for Los Angeles-based junior line
XOXO, said her customer shops every week. Some trends that bombed
for XOXO were skants and the whole Prada-influenced utility look.
</P>
<P>
   Fiene said they were just too early for her customer and that
both looks are starting to get publicity now.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO sends its dead stock to its three outlet stores: Two are in
Southern California and one is in New Jersey. They also sell to
Marshalls, Ross and TJ Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage sells its dead stock to Marshalls, or holds internal
sample sales in its parking lot, or donates them to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a trend doesn't even last a season. By the time I
get it in, it's over,'' said Greenman, who finds long-lived trends
just as unnerving at her store. She cites, for example, chinos,
which have saturated the market and now bore her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is the key word at a show, when I hear it
everywhere, I get sick of it,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers a steadier pace, rather than some trends lasting two
years while others last two months.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on dead stock, most retailers test merchandise. Up
Against the Wall's Red tried out skants in the spring, but either
too many manufacturers made them, or her customers hadn't seen them
enough in the media. She'll try them again in the fall, but doesn't
think they'll be especially meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Other than testing, Red relies on gut instinct, and on being
totally aware of her market and the media through traveling, and
scouting clubs and trendy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman has her own kind of market research going. She'll carry
something if she can think of three people she knows who would wear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Online catalogs limit dead stock by functioning as test and
reorder businesses. Rather than forecasting, Karen Ngo, creative
and fashion director for Alloy, a junior Web site and online
catalog, is responding to what's selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait and see. We go out on the streets and see what kids
are wearing. The minute a trend stops selling, we drop it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo also reports trends change faster than necessary. How long
the market says a trend should last may not coincide consumer
demand, as is the case with butterfly and dragonfly motifs. For
that reason, Alloy plans on doing more of its own product
development.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers, more trends mean more profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is all about change, which works to our advantage.
Trends are essential to our success,'' said Jerry Friedman,
national sales manager for Dollhouse, a junior contemporary company
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says if a style or group isn't well received, it's
dropped immediately. He adds that the advantage of sourcing
domestically is that he doesn't have to take as many risks, such as
committing to large orders from overseas. He can also react quickly
once he finds out something is a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
   When Dollhouse has dead stock, it offers it to regular accounts
at closeout prices so retailers have a chance for margin-building
profits. They also sell to TJ Maxx and Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's Fiene notes that if you want to keep selling, you must
keep up, or the consumer will think you're stale. Her goal is to be
the first to adapt a trend well once it hits the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover every trend, but in our way. For example, we revamped
the cargo to fit our sexy, feminine image. It's not about knocking
it off exactly,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's Friedman calls his interpretations an ``edgy basic
with attitude.'' Rather than compete with the Gaps of the world,
Dollhouse tweaks basics with the latest styles and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage's Hansel aspires to create the same combination, what he
calls ``the perfect marrying of the basic with the trend,'' the key
to his business. He adds that the more body types a trend suits,
the broader its customer base, which equals higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on top of trends, manufacturers rely on different
resources. Dollhouse employs students from the Fashion Institute of
Technology as scouts, while XOXO's design team travels to Europe
more than five times a year, looks through every magazine and
runway photo, and scours the streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end with discovering a trend, though; manufacturers
must then guess its progression. Good examples are capri pants,
which evolved from 1998s slim version that fell right below the
knee, to this year's wide-leg, seven-eighths cut, and the shrug,
which evolved from the attached version to separates.
</P>
<P>
   According to XOXO's Fiene, newness is what sells. ``We may
approach a trend from a different angle. Like we'll change the
color on a Gucci-inspired Hawaiian print, but our goal is to move
on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trends that manufacturers and retailers have moved on from
are baggy, urban styles inspired by hip-hop; wide-leg raver pants
with 30-40 inch cuffs; butterfly or fairy motifs; woven knits;
shrugs; futuristic/high tech looks; layers, and boot cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few trends continue to do exceptionally well. Both Rampage and
Dollhouse report stretch is still No. 1, with at least 80 percent
to 90 percent of the lines incorporating spandex.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's biggest sellers are dark denim, seven-eighths
trousers and tube tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel reports denim, Hawaiian prints, and anything with shine,
iridescence, metallic embellishment or glitter are Rampage's
strongest sellers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Moving away from solids, XOXO's biggest trends are Hawaiian
prints in stretch twill, embellished denim, paisley cotton prints
and lots of color. For styles, camisoles, halters and seven-eighths
pants sell well.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer item is the backless apron top. Red reports
selling 100 to 200 tops a week from Maryland-based Gear Co. She
also does well with stretch denim; seven-eighths pants; stretch
wire chokers, and hair clips and barettes with rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming trends range from peasant to hippie to circus-inspired,
each fantasy-related and in vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word for fall and spring is `skin.' Once the baggy
look is over, you're going to see a lot more peekaboo tops, bare
shoulders, and open fronts and backs,'' Hansel said. Dresses will
make a big comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best item to show off all the prints for next
spring,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Fiene plans to show lots of Pucci, paisley and
floral prints, plus Mexican and peasant ruffled looks and Indian
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories will feature colored jewels and rhinestones,
feathers, mirrors, beading and crystals. Whether to run with
upcoming trends should depend on one's niche, says L Report's
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can smell out a phony from a mile away,'' she said.
``They know when someone is jumping on the bandwagon.''

   ``It used to be that trends lasted a decade, or at least five
years. Now they come and go every three months,'' said Calin
Riffle, a jewelry designer who also owns Anata, a New York apparel
and jewelry showroom.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that trends have a shorter life span than they once
did. The reasons vary, but generally revolve around a culture
bombarded by media _ including the Internet _ by celebrity
influence and by the growth of television shows _ on networks and
on cable _ about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While many teen-agers might love to see trendy new items in the
stores on a weekly basis, this can pose a huge problem for
retailers and manufacturers when the trend dies.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often resort to markdowns or moving the merchandise to
their outlet stores, while manufacturers offer the goods to
retailers at reduced prices, or to outlet stores or off-pricers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people look to the media to tell them what trends to
follow, and teens are quick to try to emulate what young
celebrities are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Gordon, editor of the L Report, published by Lambesis,
cites Cameron Diaz, Lauryn Hill and Jennifer Lopez as some of the
hour's more influential trendsetters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, said Gordon, there is a Japanese pop star and
model who goes by the name of Angie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything she wears in a photograph or on television sells out
the next day (in Japan), both the exact item and any knockoffs,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Greenman, women's buyer for The Junkman's Daughter, a

ARE THERE NO ZONES OF PRIVACY NOW?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to personal privacy, the elemental presumption
that everyone is entitled, as a matter of basic human dignity, to
certain areas of life that belong to him or her alone?
</P>
<P>
   This simple assumption once applied, so I was taught, to every
citizen _ big or small, rich or poor. What went on in the sanctity
of one's own home or the private quarters of one's own mind was
none of my business, or yours _ or the public's.
</P>
<P>
   There were decent boundaries that common courtesy respected and,
where necessary, courts of law protected. Shall these no longer
apply? Are people condemned to shed all remnants of personal
modesty and live at the intrusive mercy of ever-more-sophisticated
electronic eavesdropping gadgetry?
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party and Public Broadcasting Service stations,
we learn, have been trading donor lists for years. I've regularly
contributed to both, but I never knowingly ceded to either the
right to sell my name.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just Democrats _ Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign
shared lists with New Hampshire Public Television, we discover. Nor
is it any more offensive for a political party to benefit from
someone else's contributor list than for various charities to swap
among themselves names and addresses of generous prospective
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is widespread _ else how did I end up on so many
different fund-raising lists with the same identical mistake in my
address? There's nothing illegal or even faintly sinful about it, I
guess, except that it sort of makes me feel like a sucker.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hearty telephone solicitations. ``Hello,
James! Is this James? How're ya feelin' today, James?'' Each time a
cheerful voice greets me in such familiar terms, I know I'm about
to get an opportunity to give somebody some money. Nobody calls me
``James'' except intimate strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these eager solicitors represent worthwhile causes, and
I shouldn't mind being importuned at my residence, I suppose. But
the average fellow's home is about the only sanctuary he has. Maybe
it'd be nicer to write and give folks a chance to think about our
proposition at their convenience, not ours. In our busy, clamorous
world, everybody should be entitled to certain minimal areas of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of courtesy that sheltered these areas began to fall a
few years back. I don't know exactly when. But it seems to me that
it was sometime in the 1970s when newspapers across the country one
day featured a revealing photograph of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
trustingly taking a sun bath in a bikini on a private beach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't posing for a photograph or even remotely conscious
that one was being taken by telephoto lens from a ship far enough
out to sea that she rightly enough felt invulnerable to prying
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I was angry. Angry for her, whose right to privacy had been so
crudely trampled. Angry at the peeping-Tom photographer. Angry at
the presumably respectable wire service that distributed the
photograph. Angry at the family newspapers all over the country
that, driven to craven sensationalism by competition, opted to
print it.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if anyone else were angry. Surely it wasn't only I.
But what could we do about it? Go take a shower?
</P>
<P>
   That incident may have marked a watershed of sorts. Respectable
publications, driven by competition, began more and more to succumb
to tactics of the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to blame newspapers, and television, and movies. Blame
``Godless'' education and fatherless homes and working mothers.
Everyone has a favorite scapegoat for societal decadence and the
decline in manners and morals. And I'm not even sure that's exactly
what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns me here is the growing assumption that nobody has
any rights to privacy, any personal space, that I may not breach if
I choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes yet another independent counsel, one David Barrett,
still hounding former San Antonio mayor and former HUD Secretary
Henry Cisneros, three years after he left office, about a widely
advertised extramarital dalliance that ended almost a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not claiming sainthood on Henry's part. He knows it was
wrong and has said so publicly. He has gone to great lengths to
make things right with his wife, and he has given up a brilliant
public career to protect her and their children from unnecessary
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have acted in a thoroughly gentlemanly way toward
the former paramour, Linda Medlar Jones. Not really a wealthy man,
he gave her thousands of dollars to facilitate her move to Lubbock,
where she chose to re-establish herself.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barrett wants to prosecute Cisneros for underestimating to
the FBI the total amount he'd given Medlar Jones. The legality of
the payments has never been questioned _ just the amount.
</P>
<P>
   A judge has given Barrett permission to use edited recordings
with many admitted deletions that the woman secretly made of
telephone conversations with Henry. Going Linda Tripp one better!
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, recordings of private conversations, made without
advising the other party, are all right now if they wind up helping
to get the other party in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresenting anything to the FBI is, admittedly, serious
business. But even the best of men will lie to protect their
families. And in such a wholly private misadventure, personally
affecting only two families, what business is it, really, of the
FBI's?
</P>
<P>
   Is anything private any more?

`RUNAWAY BRIDE'': SITCOM FODDER WITH A BIG BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sunny-side-up successor, but not a sequel, to ``Pretty
Woman,'' the new Julia Roberts-Richard Gere romantic comedy,
``Runaway Bride,'' has many of the same charms and flaws of the
first picture.
</P>
<P>
   The stars once again have such chemistry that it's almost _
almost _ possible to forgive the improbable plot, weak
characterizations and comedy that, when it's not broad and obvious,
deteriorates to the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The Gere-Roberts rapport, and their relationships with character
actors like Paul Dooley, Laurie Metcalf and Joan Cusack, are
absolutely necessary to enjoying this story about a woman who
repeatedly leaves grooms literally at the altar. Any lesser screen
presences and you couldn't forgive director Garry Marshall for his
style and sensibilities. He's the sort who thinks it clever to back
an image of Roberts, escaping from an earlier wedding attempt on
horseback, with the song ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking
For.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's bearhug approach to romance and equally large
embrace of jokes, as opposed to wit, make ``Runaway Bride''
resemble nothing so much as a TV sitcom with a very big budget.
</P>
<P>
   As Ike, a newspaper columnist with an inability to meet his
deadlines, Gere finds himself as the movie opens especially late
and lacking an idea. When a sozzled schmo on the next barstool
tells him about Roberts' character, Maggie, and her pre-marital
flights, Gere goes with the story. Not bothering to check the
facts, Ike gets no fewer than 15 of them wrong in print.
</P>
<P>
   His employer, USA Today, dismisses him when his victim, Maggie
(Roberts), writes a spunky letter of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Off goes Ike to Maggie's quaint community, intending to write a
long magazine piece on her imminent fourth attempt at making it all
the way down the church aisle (the editors at GQ, it seems, aren't
bothered by Ike's careless attempt to tell Maggie's story the first
time, nor by the conflict of interest presented by having him write
about the person who ruined his reputation and got him fired).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a small town it is! Hale, Md., features a barbershop
quartet crooning on street corners at all hours of the day.
Businesses have cute names such as Curl Up and Dye (a hair salon)
and people have cute names such as Peggy Fleming (``Like the ice
skater,'' says the wife; the husband's morning radio show is ``Wake
up with Flem''). In case we don't get the point, the mayor and
police chief play in a washboard band, the theme to ``The Andy
Griffith Show'' appears on the soundtrack and Gere, although a
professional writer, can think of no more original a crack than
calling the town ``Mayberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike and Maggie fall in love amidst their bickering, to the
delight of her family (Dooley as her dad, Jean Schertler as
Grandma, who gets huge laughs with her dirty mouth, like Betty
White in ``Lake Placid'') and the dismay of her newest fiance
(Christopher Meloni, funny as Hale's hearty football coach).
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Pretty Woman,'' hardly a second of the film is
believable. But Hollywood's specialty with this sort of romantic
comedy is to sell us fairy tales, and ``Runaway Bride'' lacks the
offensive implications of ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, at least, the stereotypes are more harmless (although the
reputations of journalists won't be any improved by Ike's
behavior). And the leads' scenes together have a loose, lively
freedom that makes the maudlin go down.
</P>
<P>
   Gere is at his least self-involved and smug. With his
crinkle-edged eyes and steely hair, he's a comfortable screen
object, natural and casual and an ideal foil for the whoopsy-daisy
grown-up girlishness of Roberts. They've both aged pleasingly since
``Pretty Woman.'' The maturity becomes them both; it also removes
some of the creepiness of a corporate shark going after a coltish,
innocent prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, though less clear about her character than Gere, gives
Maggie plenty of spirited independence, and the screenplay (by
Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott) attempts to address the issue of
why Maggie is so skittish about playing ring-around-the-finger.
Roberts is a comedian, really, and Marshall knows enough to simply
aim the camera at her and let us enjoy her presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' is neither as funny nor as original as
Roberts' other romantic comedy out this summer. The difference
between it and ``Notting Hill'' are instructive. Here she has to
work against a weak screenplay and Gere's normally remote persona.
</P>
<P>
   The marvelously written ``Notting Hill,'' in comparison, paired
Roberts with the cuddly Hugh Grant for a far more winning, and
plausible, romance. ``Notting Hill'' also was unpredictable and
thus more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' goes exactly where you expect, supplying
enough laughs to keep things interesting along the way.

DEALING WITH A COMMON CURSE: HOME BURGLARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A burglary occurs every 15 seconds in this
country, costing Americans more than $3.3 billion a year. And that
does not include the cost of fixing broken doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the Burglary Prevention Council in
Chicago indicate that three out of four U.S. homes will be
burglarized in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-third of all burglaries committed during 1997 were made
without forced entry,'' said Tony DeMarco, a spokesman for the
council, the national nonprofit organization that educates the
public on crime prevention measures. ``That statistic tells me that
homeowners continue to make burglars' jobs too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco, a retired Chicago police officer, has more than 30
years experience in theft prevention. In addition to managing his
own security consulting firm, DeMarco &AMP; Associates, he teaches
law-enforcement officers at the Chicago Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The council says some 2.5 million burglaries occur nationwide
every year. Among those, 60 percent of the residential burglaries
occur during daylight hours. The greatest number of burglaries are
recorded in July and the fewest in February.
</P>
<P>
   The number of burglaries also fluctuates depending on the region
of the country. In 1997, the South had the highest number of
burglaries, totaling 42 percent of all those committed, according
to statistics the council compiled from police departments,
national on-line services and home security product manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast had the fewest _ 14 percent of the total and the
greatest decrease, a 7 percent drop from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Residential burglars are often male teen-agers who live near
their targets, according to the council. They are opportunists who
look for easy targets. The semiprofessional burglar may scout a
neighborhood for up to a week, while the amateur burglar will spend
only a few hours casing a residence. The typical burglar spends
just a few minutes at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Single-family homes in the middle of the block are more likely
to be hit than corner houses, which are highly visible. Town houses
have common features, such as sliding glass doors and small, fenced
back yards, which make them easier to burglarize.
</P>
<P>
   ``By good crime prevention practices, you can substantially
reduce your chances of being burglarized,'' said Lt. Jamie Mills, a
spokesman at the New York State Police headquarters in Albany.
Mills stressed keeping valuables out of view and taking a close
look at your home inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   Does your lawn look unmowed? That's a clue that you are away.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are working in the back yard, keep your front door
locked and all windows secured or closed. Keep your car locked too,
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars prefer not to target a home with someone inside,
DeMarco said. ``Convince the bad guy to keep moving,'' he said.
``Making your residence look occupied, having doors and windows
locked and marking valuables help you to keep from being a burglary
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the council's common-sense tips is never place keys under
the doormat, flower pot or window ledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burglars study the daily habits and routines of people,''
DeMarco said. ``Experience has taught them to check these places
first when casing a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ As a decoy, install an inexpensive safe in the den or master
bedroom and fill it with costume jewelry and important looking
papers. The burglar might leave without touching anything else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep an inventory and videos or photos of valuables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hide things in an unusual place, not under the mattress, in
flour and sugar canisters or in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinforce sliding glass doors with a vertical bolt lock and a
pole bar in the floor track.
</P>
<P>
   _ Motion-sensitive light detectors protect the vulnerable rear
entrance and other areas that are prime for the picking, such as
doors hidden under carports and step-down recessed cellar doors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change the locks immediately after moving into an apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-floor windows should all be secured with locks and all
balcony, patio and fire exits should be equipped with sturdy doors
and locks.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if you discover you have been burglarized? The steps you
take until the police arrive are crucial. Here are a few
common-sense steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you find that the door or window is ajar, go to a pay
phone, a neighbor's home or use your mobile phone to call the
police. ``You don't want to get yourself into a situation where
anyone can harm you,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never try to detain the suspect, who could be armed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not touch anything or attempt to clean up the mess until
the police arrive. You may ruin important evidence.

SMALLER DOES COUNT IN QUEST TO MAKE BIG ENCHILADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDDIE ZAVALA  
 c.1999 Laredo Morning Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The effort to make a mile-long enchilada failed
by 4,472 feet Saturday, but Laredo still earned a place in the
Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   The city on the banks of the Rio Grande will be included in the
book for making the world's largest enchilada to date _ 808 feet,
or less than one-seventh of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 volunteers converged Saturday at the Laredo
International Fair and Exposition grounds to make the big
enchilada. Cesar Lopez, chief organizer of the event, said he was
pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major attempt. I would feel like a failure if we
lacked one of the ingredients, but we didn't,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of ingredients: 60,000 tortillas, a ton of
white cheese, 100 gallons of oil, 200 pounds of chopped onions and
500 pounds of chili sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half of the ingredients were used.
</P>
<P>
   It took volunteers four hours and 36 minutes to complete the
enchilada.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for the dust and blazing sun, volunteers said
they might have completed their mile-long mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot, but it was worth being here. Despite the heat, we
worked as a team and fulfilled a dream,'' Priscilla Salinas said.
``Although we did not get to the mile, in my eyes we gotta come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez agreed with Salinas, but said it would not happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is challenging any city that would like to
erase Laredo from the record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a major challenge for any others that want to
compete for it. Especially after hearing what we went through, they
would want to back out,'' Lopez said. ``We worked our butts off. It
was a major learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100-plus degree temperatures kept many volunteers away.
Nearly 200 helpers had signed up. Salinas, however, volunteered for
more than 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think we were not going to do it, but we pulled it
off,'' she said. ``The (momentum) picked up after the sun went down
and that's when we got more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, some San Antonio residents attempted to make
a mile-long enchilada, but their attempts failed halfway when the
tortillas collapsed. They were not included in the record book.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a photo for the record book, the volunteers nibbled
on the enchilada _ after health department officials inspected the
food. The leftovers will remain on display.

ACADIANS HEADED FOR LOUISIANA REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ For the next two weeks, tens of thousands of
Acadians from around the world will be celebrating their heritage
in this Cajun city atop the Atchafalaya River Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heavy blanket of south Louisiana humidity and the
spicy afterburn of its hospitality, the Congres Mondial Acadien _
Louisiana 99 will convene here, but it will be played out among the
bayous and rice fields of Acadiana, comprising the 22 parishes in
south Louisiana that honor a strong Acadian culture, language and
tradition that began more than 300 years ago on Canada's Atlantic
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that coast, in the province of Acadia, that French
settlers established permanent colonies in the early 1600s. The
British took control of the land in the 1700s and, when war between
the two countries seemed imminent, it was demanded that the French
Acadians renounce their Roman Catholic faith and swear allegiance
to the Crown. They refused.
</P>
<P>
   In what is now called ``Le Grand Derangement,'' the Acadians
were exiled in 1755. Families were separated, homes destroyed and
crops burned. The Acadians were scattered throughout the world,
many of them eventually settling in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the ``Congres'' is to reunite those people.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural reunion took place in 1994 when more than 250,000
Acadians traveled to southeastern New Brunswick in Canada. That
first ``Congres'' had an estimated economic effect of $17.5
million, organizers said. Given the significantly larger numbers of
people in Louisiana, the reward here is expected to be much
greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we'll have thousands and thousands of people coming to
Louisiana from Canada alone,'' said Valerie Roy, director of
communications for Congres Mondial Acadien. ``We expect 15,000 to
20,000 Acadians from Texas, Mississippi and Alabama _ those regions
where the Acadians settled in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy said she has received requests for information from every
state in the Union and every province in Canada. News organizations
from France have requested credentials, as well as the U.S. TV
networks and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The interest, she said, is as widespread as the Acadian people
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Vincent, founder of a preservation group called Les
Acadiens du Texas, or Cajuns of Texas, said there will be a large
contingent of visitors crossing the Sabine River from Texas into
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group is only about 100 people or so,'' he said from his
home in Beaumont, ``but there are thousands, maybe tens of
thousands, of Cajun people here in Texas who want to go back to the
`Congres.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said the Cajun influence has been strong and long
lasting in Texas. The first group of Acadians migrated to the open
prairies along the Texas coast when the cotton fields and sugar
cane fields were expanded in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the farmers plowed more farmland for cotton and sugar
cane, it cut down on the pasture land for cattle. Those Cajun
families who raised cattle crossed the river and came to Texas back
before it was an independent state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second migration of Cajun people to Texas, he said, came
just before World War I when oil and gas refineries offered jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still an area around Port Neches, between Port Arthur
and Beaumont, that is called `Little Abbeville,''' he said.
``That's where the Cajuns settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbeville is also the name of a Louisiana town where early
Acadians settled.
</P>
<P>
   The primary function of the ``Congres,'' organizers say, is for
families to reunite. There are more than 80 family reunions
scheduled throughout Louisiana in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And although the festival is designed to celebrate the Acadian
history, it is also designed to celebrate the other influences on
the Cajun culture: French, German, Spanish and Creole.
</P>

THE HEATHER ON THE MOUNTAINTOP: AT LAST, HEATHER GRAHAM IS REACHING
STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Heather Graham with Steve Martin in a
scene from ``Bowfinger.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nude scenes can be tough on an actress, but Heather Graham knows
something worse _ say, a simple kiss with Mike Myers as Austin
Powers.
 &HT;    ``Those teeth are revolting!'' says Graham, Myers' co-star in
the current hit ``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
 &HT;    Fortunately, they're fake _ though realistic enough to have
taken in Graham's boyfriend, actor/director Edward Burns, on a set
visit.
 &HT;    ``Later he told me, `You know, Mike really does have bad teeth.
He should get them fixed or something,''' Graham says, laughing.
 &HT;    Graham's laughing a lot these days, actually. Her two summer
films team her with three of Hollywood's top comedians _ Myers and,
in the upcoming ``Bowfinger,'' Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    ``I play an actress who comes from Ohio to Los Angeles. I'm very
ambitious, and I'm willing to do absolutely anything to get a
part,'' Graham says during an interview at Los Angeles' Four
Seasons Hotel. ``I seem really sweet and naive, and then I proceed
to sleep my way to the top.
 &HT;    ``I based her on several girls you could meet any day in this
town!''
 &HT;    At 29, Graham is finally enjoying the success she's pursued for
more than a decade. Slim and lively, she wears dark slacks and a
white shirt, with her long, straight, past-the-shoulders blonde
hair hiding most of her reed-thin frame.
 &HT;    ``I love the fact that I'm getting offered more roles these
days,'' says Graham, whose career has taken off since she played
porn star Roller Girl in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997). ``There was a
time when all I was offered were the scripts that Drew Barrymore
rejected.''
 &HT;    This summer Entertainment Weekly even proclaimed Graham the ``It
Girl,'' whatever ``It'' may be.
 &HT;    ``It's really weird,'' Graham says. ``Last night I was flipping
through another magazine, and it said something about me being hot.
For a second, I felt really scared. I was like, `OK, I'm hot. So
now I can be cold.'
 &HT;    ``Suddenly I started to get really, really worried.''
 &HT;    ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has only boosted her appeal _ and
those ultra-tiny miniskirts didn't hurt, either.
 &HT;    ``My best day on the set was when someone asked me, `Heather, do
you want to keep your wardrobe?''' she recalls, laughing. ``I was
like, `Are you kidding? I would get arrested.'''
 &HT;    Graham was Myers' first choice to fill those hot pants, but she
insists she never thought she'd get the role.
 &HT;    ``I left the reading going, `Ohhh, I don't think they like me.
Ohhhh, I don't think it went well,''' the actress says.
 &HT;    For ``Bowfinger,'' which will open Aug. 13, she had a similar
experience with writer/star Steve Martin.
 &HT;    ``Again, I thought, `Great, you totally blew it. He doesn't like
you one bit,''' she recalls. ``I guess I need to get over this
insecurity. Or maybe it's working for me.''
 &HT;    If she's actually insecure, you wouldn't know it from her sexy,
self-assured performances in her two current films.
 &HT;    ``To be honest, it's fun to be in movies where you can be
sexually aggressive,'' she says, ``which is something women aren't
always allowed to be in real life.''
 &HT;    Graham knows what she's talking about, having grown up in
middle-class, mostly Republican Agoura, Calif., as the daughter of
strict Irish-Catholic parents. Emphasis on ``strict'' _ her mother
is a schoolteacher and her father an FBI agent.
 &HT;    ``I was raised as a real goody-two-shoes,'' Graham says. ``I was
made to feel guilty for even thinking about a boy. But when I saw
Harrison Ford kissing Karen Allen in `Raiders of the Lost Ark,' I
fell in love with the movies and the opposite sex.''
 &HT;    From an early age, she says, she felt drawn to perform.
 &HT;    ``I was annoyingly obnoxious and dramatic,'' she says. ``I would
go around saying, `I vant to be an actress.' My mom would just roll
her eyes and say, `That's nice, Heather. Set the table, honey.'''
 &HT;    Her father didn't approve, the actress adds.
 &HT;    ``I don't think acting was his first choice for me,'' Graham
says. ``He thought it was too wild of a profession.''
 &HT;    In high school, she almost changed her mind about seeking the
spotlight.
 &HT;    ``I was so gangly and awkward as a teen,'' Graham says. ``People
didn't think I was cute. I couldn't get a date. I wish I would have
brought you some pictures.
 &HT;    ``I had a very bad hairdo, and I went to a John Hughes high
school where you had to be perfect,'' she adds. ``I also had braces
and neckgear that went behind my head and around my face. I had to
wear it to school.'''
 &HT;    At age 16, the braces were off and puberty had worked its
wonders. Graham blossomed, landing commercial work, which led to a
small part on television's ``Growing Pains.''
 &HT;    ``There was an episode where Kirk Cameron has three dates and he
can't decide whom to go out with,'' she recalls. ``There's a
blonde, a brunette and a redhead. I was the blonde.''
 &HT;    Her movie break came was the teen flick ``License to Drive''
(1988), which produced remarkable results at school.
 &HT;    ``It was hilarious,'' Graham says. ``When the movie came out,
the high-school guys were like, `Wait a second _ you really are
sort of cute.'
 &HT;    ``Of course I ignored them,'' she adds. ``They missed their
chance.'''
 &HT;    Still, it took ``Boogie Nights'' to get Hollywood to sit up and
take notice.
 &HT;    ``That movie was a risk,'' she says. ``The subject matter was
dark, but it put me on the map.
 &HT;    ``What concerns me about becoming more popular is that I might
never take that kind of risk again,'' she adds, ``because I would
be afraid of what people and fans might think. I just hope I can
listen to my heart and do what I want to do.''
 &HT;    Next up is a drama, ``Committed,'' co-starring Casey Affleck and
Luke Wilson, to be followed by ``Alien Love Triangle'' with Kenneth
Branagh and Courteney Cox. That last one, incidentally, comes with
a far different look than she had in ``Austin Powers.''
 &HT;    ``I have a green, bald head and pointy ears,'' Graham says
gleefully. ``I have black contact lenses and long fingers.
Courteney Cox plays my alien husband, who comes to earth to marry a
male earthling. But I follow because I want her/him back.''
 &HT;    Sounds confusing even by Hollywood's standards for tangled
relationships. Graham knows a bit about that: Formerly the
companion of actor James Woods, she now shares a Hollywood Hills
mansion with Burns, who was rumored to have been seeing actress
Lauren Holly before she reconciled with her husband, actor Jim
Carrey, and ...
 &HT;    Well, none of it really matters, Graham says.
 &HT;    ``What Eddie and I have is unlike anything I've experienced in
the past,'' she says. ``He's very romantic. I also love that he's
shy _ I find that so sexy in a man.''
 &HT;    Burns' nephews, used to having a movie star in the family,
weren't that impressed when he brought her home for a family
dinner. But that all changed in June.
 &HT;    ``The boys are 9 and 7,'' Graham says. ``Since I'm in `Austin
Powers 2,' I'm suddenly really cool to them. They even carry the
Austin newspaper ad to school and go, `You know, that's my uncle's
girlfriend.'''

`AFFAIR' OF THE HEART: RENE RUSSO IN `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR'

 (Includes a color slide of Rene Russo with Pierce Brosnan in a
scene from ``The Thomas Crown Affair.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a perfectly reasonable question, but Rene Russo can't stop
laughing.
 &HT;    For the record, the question was: Could lovemaking in real life
possibly ever be as hot, as sweaty and as downright sexy as Russo
and Pierce Brosnan make it seem in ``The Thomas Crown Affair?''
 &HT;    ``Oh God,'' Russo says finally, ``I suppose we could have our
moments, but ... ''
 &HT;    And then she's off again, shaking with laughter.
 &HT;    ``Let me tell you, I hate love scenes,'' she says eventually.
``They are uncomfortable, and I'm scared to death of them. The
night before I have to do one, I don't sleep. It looks so
comfortable in the end, but the things that happen to make a sex
scene work are funny. You end up laughing at the absurdity of it.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky with most of my love scenes,'' she adds,
``because they've been played for humor. In `Thomas Crown,' it's
steamy, but Pierce and I end up falling off a table.
 &HT;    ``That takes the edge off doing it.''
 &HT;    Lusty sex is merely one aspect of John McTiernan's remake of the
1968 Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway thriller, which will open Aug. 13.
Brosnan stars as a suave billionaire businessman who dabbles in art
theft for kicks, with Russo as Catherine Banning, an insurance
investigator whose suspicion of Crown is matched by her attraction
to him.
 &HT;    ``In a way I understood Catherine, but I personally don't lead
with my sexuality,'' the former model says by telephone from Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. ``It's not who I am.
 &HT;    ``But I do cover my vulnerability like she does,'' she adds. ``I
deflect my vulnerability all the time with humor or by looking away
or by fidgeting. Catherine hides.
 &HT;    ``I think the tougher she was on the outside and the more in
control she was, the less interesting she was for me to play,'' the
actress says. ``When we really get to see that she's off her game,
that she's in murky waters emotionally because of her feelings for
Crown, then she became interesting and real for me.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't afraid to show her vulnerability, so the hardest part
for me was leading with her sexuality and not deflecting that part
of myself,'' Russo concludes. ``Stripping down emotionally was much
harder than taking my clothes off.''
 &HT;    Sure, sure. But all people who have seen the film talk about is
Russo's gorgeous, glistening, gravity-defying 45-year-old body.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood is so conventional,'' she says. ``It's amazing to
me. There's a certain beauty to having a freedom with your body and
not being so self-conscious about it.
 &HT;    ``European men and women have a different idea about nudity,''
she adds. ``When I was young and modeling, I lived with these girls
from Europe. They'd be sitting around talking, and they'd be nude
and not even know it, while I'd come in dressed from head to toe in
my pajamas, robe and slippers.
 &HT;    ``We tend to cover up,'' Russo says. ``We're more insecure. One
of our idols in America is youth, and God forbid you get past 30 or
35 or whatever age it's supposedly inappropriate to show anything
because you're not a certain weight or of a certain appearance or
style.
 &HT;    ``It's a shame, because there are so many different kinds of
beauty.''
 &HT;    Though she proved with ``Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992), ``In the Line
of Fire'' (1993), ``Get Shorty'' (1995), ``Ransom'' (1996) and
``Tin Cup'' (1996) that she had more to offer than her looks, Russo
was still pleasantly surprised when she landed her ``Crown'' role.
 &HT;    ``I am 45,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I'm thankful to Pierce
and John McTiernan. You hear a lot of men-bashing in terms of
`Unfair-unfair-unfair,' and there definitely is a double standard.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' she says, ``Pierce and John really fought
for me. I would not have gotten the role had they not fought for
me.''
 &HT;    Every onscreen pairing is an experiment, Russo believes, with no
way of telling which will sizzle and which fizzle.
 &HT;    ``You just have to take the risk,'' says Russo, who offscreen
has been married for seven years to Dan Gilroy, with whom she has a
5-year-old daughter, Rose. ``I really try to tune into whomever I'm
with and find a good energy, then work with that.
 &HT;    ``I almost never work alone,'' she adds, ``but, boy, actors are
completely different. There's no one with more energy than Mel
Gibson, but Clint Eastwood is as still as can be. They have the
same energy, but use it differently.
 &HT;    ``As the actress working with them, I have to use that energy in
different ways and make it work.''
 &HT;    As for Brosnan, she says, their chemistry comes from their very
different personas.
 &HT;    ``He's solid, unwavering, knows exactly where he wants to go and
is intense, incredibly intense,'' she explains. ``I kind of go into
things flustered, not as sure, and I have to find my way a little
bit. That can take a take or two. I like to try a lot of different
things, and I don't have an exact direction to go in.
 &HT;    ``Being so different can be a challenge, but it was also a lot
of fun.''
 &HT;    Highly professional actress though she is today, Russo admits
that initially she turned to acting only for the money.
 &HT;    ``I didn't genuinely want to do it,'' she says. ``I really
didn't want to be in front of any camera anymore _ but I didn't
have a job and I didn't know what to do.
 &HT;    ``I waited a long time,'' she says. ``I didn't start acting
until I was 33, and that was because I ran out of money.
 &HT;    ``I tried it and didn't hate it,'' she recalls. ``I figured I'd
do it movie by movie, and quit if I ever came to hate it. I don't
have a great passion for it, though I envy actors who want to act
forever.''
 &HT;    Russo pauses.
 &HT;    ``But the truth is there's not great stuff to do,'' says the
actress, who will next be seen in ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' with
Robert De Niro and Jason Alexander. ``I'm not challenged enough
because, frankly, there are not enough good roles. So I've done OK
parts, but I want more than that.''
 &HT;    It isn't simply a matter of making it onto Hollywood's A-list,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``Being on the A-list doesn't assure you of amazing material,''
she says. ``That's why so many actresses are developing their own
projects.
 &HT;    ``You have to be really fortunate to keep doing great film after
great film and have a good time doing them,'' she concludes.
``Honestly, I don't know what I want to do, but I get bored.''
 &HT;    Even if Russo gets her chance to make a few great films, age _
or ageism _ could still catch up with her soon. The irony's not
lost on Russo, but she loses more sleep over those pesky sex scenes
than worrying about her fate in Tinseltown.
 &HT;    ``If I led my life thinking that society or any person in or out
of this business was in total control, I'd be afraid,'' she says.
``But I don't believe that.
 &HT;    ``When the doors close to me, I'll have been meant to move on,
and that will be OK,'' Russo says. ``I could have worried about
that at 35. I could have worried about that at 40.
 &HT;    ``I am not going to start worrying about it now.''

TOUCHED BY A DIFFERENT KIND OF ANGEL: DAVID BOREANAZ IS OUT ON HIS
OWN 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of David Boreanaz in a scene from
``Angel.'') 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever David Boreanaz gets to feeling a bit full of himself _
when the adoring Web pages, drool-stained fan mail and hordes of
screaming teen-age admirers get him thinking he's all that and then
some _ he has two words which bring him down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   They're the two words which his buddies use to cut him down to
size, the phrase first uttered on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' when
Boreanaz debuted as Angel, the brooding, smoldering vampire. Eying
Sunnydale's newest hunk, Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) appraised
him with two immortal words: ``Salty goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's stuck with him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, a very good friend of mine and I were reminiscing,
and he said, `You did a great job and I'm real proud of you,'''
Boreanaz recalls. ``So I reminded him of that line, because he's
always giving me a hard time about that: `Salty goodness' _ we just
got a good laugh out of that. My friends keep me very grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to come in handy this fall, when Angel gets his own
spinoff series on the WB network. The show will take the character,
who has split with soulmate Buffy, to Los Angeles, where, with
vampy Cordelia in tow, he'll try to right wrongs much as Buffy does
back in Sunnydale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show's in the same ballpark, but it'll be just a different
city,'' Boreanaz says. ``There'll be a bit more of a touch on the
human level, as far as why people do what they do, what motivates
them to do bad things and get away with it. Angel's purpose is to
figure that out, to help people _ and along the way he'll save some
lives and some redemption for his own soul, which he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll run the same kind of territory,'' he continues, ``but in
a different level, maybe a bit more adult-oriented. The dark side
of the human condition is not always the best thing to deal with
from an adolescent point of view, but I think it's going to work
out great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, viewers shouldn't be too surprised if Sarah Michelle
Gellar turns up on the series from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We parted ways in a very `Casablanca' kind of a way,''
Boreanaz says, ``but I think there's another story to be told about
the two of us. But for now, separation between the two characters
is great. There'll be crossovers that occur _ she'll come and visit
me, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Boreanaz has none of Angel's dark, tormented vibe. He
shows up dressed casually in a gray T-shirt, chinos and sports
slippers for an interview held, at his suggestion, at a Beverly
Hills eatery just off Rodeo Drive. But it's not one of the sleek,
hipster restaurants common in the neighborhood _ just a little dive
that serves up big, messy Philly-cheesesteak sandwiches, one of
which Boreanaz devours with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that the persona of Angel is remote from his own,
though he clearly loves the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got the job,'' he recalls, ``I was telling
everybody, `I'm playing a 244-year-old vampire with a conscience,'
and my friends would be, like, `Cool, man.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came out sounding so wild, saying it in a nonchalant
fashion,'' he says. ``It's funny when you think about it. It's not
like, `Oh, I'm playing a doctor' or `I'm playing a police
officer.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Gellar speaks well of her former
co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the most amazing working relationship I've ever had,''
she says. ``I've been very blessed with the guys that I've worked
opposite, but David and I had a very, very special relationship. In
three years of working together, we never had so much as a
disagreement, and that's just unbelievable, considering the hours
we spent together.''
</P>
<P>
   His departure is a blow to her program, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is very, very daunting,'' Gellar admits. ``You have
this concern _ part of the reason `Buffy' worked was because of
Angel, and what if I can't do it on my own? But it's an exciting
time for him, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series will play down the 240 years of ``pain and
torture'' which made Angel such a grim _ if romantic _ presence on
``Buffy,'' Boreanaz predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he'll be the befuddled action guy,'' the actor
says. ``He's really cool, and then he does something that makes him
look like the biggest dork ... The humor will be through his
seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Boreanaz grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., a long way from the glamour
of Hollywood. When he first arrived in Los Angeles, intent on
forging a career as an actor, he admits that there was hardly a
clamor for his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of odd jobs _ I parked cars, I worked at sporting
clubs, passed out towels, I did anything to stay alive,'' he says.
``They were hard times. And it's a blessing when you get good
things in increments, not everything at once.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have his own series, but Boreanaz admits that he still
has a lot to learn as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that when I feel like I'm not hitting it, it
usually comes out fine,'' he says. ``And then when you feel like
you are, it comes off not so good. It's a weird thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and industry observers alike have already tagged
``Angel'' as a surefire hit, trusting Boreanaz's legions of adoring
fans to give it ``Buffy''-like numbers. That's a lot to have riding
on the shoulders of a 28-year-old, but the actor says he doesn't
feel any undue burden of expectations. Actually, he says, his
primary feeling is one of eagerness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a year I've been waiting for this,'' he explains. ``I had
to shoot a whole season knowing that I'm getting my own show. The
table has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any pressure, because I'm not out there to
satisfy anybody,'' Boreanaz adds. ``I'm not out there to prove
anything, I'm not out there to live up to anybody's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only do my work and let it go. I can't try to determine
what the outcome is going to be. Otherwise, I'll end up killing
myself.''

MANY GHASTLY RETURNS: ALFRED HITCHCOCK TURNS 100

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of director Alfred Hitchcock.) 
 By TOM SOTER  
 c.1999 Diversion magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year I was talking with my 17-year-old niece about the
then-current horror movie ``Halloween: H20,'' which starred Jamie
Lee Curtis and featured a cameo by her mother, Janet Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you remember Janet Leigh from `Psycho,''' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't _ she had never seen ``Psycho'' (1960), because she
didn't watch ``old black-and-white movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, that's as shocking as anything Alfred Hitchcock
ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   But even if today's film audiences rarely see the work of the
master of suspense _ whose 100th birthday occurs, appropriately
enough, on Friday, Aug. 13 _ they're anything but unfamiliar with
his style. His signature stylistic touches, such as jump-cutting,
overlapping sound and unorthodox camera angles, are the hallmarks
of many of today's hottest young directors.
</P>
<P>
   For one now so influential, Hitchcock had humble beginnings: He
was born in London, the son of a greengrocer. Sent to a Jesuit
school as a boy, he later studied to be an engineer before drifting
to silent movies as a title-card designer. Entranced by filmmaking,
he worked at every job he could, learning about lighting, editing,
set design and script construction.
</P>
<P>
   His first movie was shot in Germany in 1925, and his third _
``The Lodger'' (1926) _ made his reputation. Already employing his
favorite theme _ an innocent man suspected of a heinous crime _
this silent film showcased the young director's dazzling technique.
</P>
<P>
   When the killer strikes, all the viewer sees are five images cut
together in rapid succession: a girl screaming, a woman on the
street looking up from her stoop, a cat jumping off a garbage can,
a policeman running and a masked figure walking into the fog. It is
stunning in its simplicity _ and as jarring as anything in
``Halloween'' (1978) or ``Friday the 13th'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Technique became Hitchcock's hallmark, from his constantly
roving camera in ``Rope'' (1948) to his 36 edits in 45 seconds for
``Psycho's'' famous shower scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a film means, first of all, to tell a story,'' he told
fellow director and Hitchcock devotee Francois Truffaut in the book
``Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967). ``The next factor is the technique
of filmmaking, and in this connection I am against virtuosity for
its own sake. Technique should enrich the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't set the camera at a certain angle just because the
cameraman happens to be enthusiastic about that spot,'' the
director said. ``The only thing that matters is whether the
installation of the camera at a given angle is going to give the
scene its maximum impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was notoriously contemptuous of actors _ ``Actors
should be treated like cattle,'' he supposedly said _ but many
apparently enjoyed working with him: Cary Grant and James Stewart
each made four films with Hitchcock, Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly
three each and Leo G. Carroll six.
</P>
<P>
   The director rarely gave advice on performance, however, leaving
details of interpretation to his actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an actor comes to me and wants to discuss his character,
I say, `It's in the script,''' he once said. ``If he says, `But
what's my motivation?' I say, `Your salary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's sense of humor was a dry one, including his penchant
for sometimes-cruel practical jokes. Robert Donat and Madeline
Carroll spent much of ``The 39 Steps'' (1935) handcuffed together,
and one day the director pretended to have lost the key, forcing
the two to stay chained together for the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of humor also infiltrated his movies _ however grim
his subject matter, Hitchcock was never above a bit of black humor.
And it worked: The comic touches, dark or otherwise, help make the
serious, even grisly elements palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Romance, too, was a part of the equation: Most of his great
suspense films are also about lovers working out relationship
conflicts. In ``Rear Window'' (1954), for example, the hero fears
marriage to his girlfriend almost as much as he fears the killer
next door _ it takes imminent threats to both their lives to
finally bring them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the world of a Hitchcock film,'' William Rothman writes
in ``Hitchcock: The Murderous Gaze'' (Harvard University Press,
1984), ``the nature and relationships of love, murder, sexuality,
marriage ... are at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock developed these themes in his 1930s British films, and
applied them most fully during the 1940s and 1950s in America.
There his movies became even richer and more complex, dealing with
issues of love and trust in ``Notorious'' (1946), homosexual
longing in ``Strangers on a Train'' (1951), transference of guilt
in ``The Wrong Man'' (1957) and obsessive, destructive passion in
``Vertigo'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   By cloaking such themes in the thriller genre, Hitchcock helped
change the way critics looked at suspense movies. A thriller such
as the multiple-Oscar-winning ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991)
could never have been treated seriously if Hitchcock hadn't led the
way. Indeed, Hitchcock made entertainment into art and vice versa,
drawing viewers into a dreamily plausible world that quickly became
a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put in my films ... what Poe put in his stories,''
Hitchcock once said, ``a perfectly unbelievable story recounted to
readers with such a hallucinatory logic that one has the impression
that this same story can happen to you tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock rarely stepped too far out of character, disguising
his artistic aspirations behind a mask of popular entertainment. He
became even more of a showman when his television series, ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents,'' allowed him to come in front of the camera
from 1955 to 1962, offering sardonically tongue-in-cheek
introductions to the show's macabre stories.
</P>
<P>
   He himself had little to do with the series, directing only 20
of its 266 episodes, but it made him Hollywood's most famous _
because most visible _ director, and also influenced the making of
``Psycho,'' which was shot on a low budget by his television crew.
</P>
<P>
   But his very image as ``the master of suspense'' came to prey on
Hitchcock, who felt intense pressure to live up to his own past
films. He once quipped that the things that scared him the most
were little children, policemen, high places ... and the idea that
``my next picture won't be as good as the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s and 1970s were troubled years for the director, with
occasional fine efforts _ most notably ``Frenzy'' (1972) _ mixed
with failures and, increasingly, the inability to get films made.
</P>
<P>
   But the greengrocer's son, once derided as a master of a hack's
genre, had the last laugh. By the time of his death in 1980, he had
been knighted, and Sir Alfred was widely hailed as a cinematic
genius by younger filmmakers, critical institutions and the public
at large. The word ``Hitchcockian'' entered the popular lexicon as
both an adjective and an ambition for directors as diverse as Brian
De Palma, Quentin Tarantino, Jonathan Demme and Andrew Davis.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, his films have become exemplars of what
moviemaking is all about: passion, audience involvement, visual
beauty and technical virtuosity. In a phrase, pure cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitchcock,'' critic David Thomson once wrote, ``became a way
of defining film.'' &QL;

THE HEATHER ON THE MOUNTAINTOP: AT LAST, HEATHER GRAHAM IS REACHING
STARDOM

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Graham with Steve Martin in a
scene from ``Bowfinger.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nude scenes can be tough on an actress, but Heather Graham knows
something worse _ say, a simple kiss with Mike Myers as Austin
Powers.
 &HT;    ``Those teeth are revolting!'' says Graham, Myers' co-star in
the current hit ``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
 &HT;    Fortunately, they're fake _ though realistic enough to have
taken in Graham's boyfriend, actor/director Edward Burns, on a set
visit.
 &HT;    ``Later he told me, `You know, Mike really does have bad teeth.
He should get them fixed or something,''' Graham says, laughing.
 &HT;    Graham's laughing a lot these days, actually. Her two summer
films team her with three of Hollywood's top comedians _ Myers and,
in the upcoming ``Bowfinger,'' Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    ``I play an actress who comes from Ohio to Los Angeles. I'm very
ambitious, and I'm willing to do absolutely anything to get a
part,'' Graham says during an interview at Los Angeles' Four
Seasons Hotel. ``I seem really sweet and naive, and then I proceed
to sleep my way to the top.
 &HT;    ``I based her on several girls you could meet any day in this
town!''
 &HT;    At 29, Graham is finally enjoying the success she's pursued for
more than a decade. Slim and lively, she wears dark slacks and a
white shirt, with her long, straight, past-the-shoulders blonde
hair hiding most of her reed-thin frame.
 &HT;    ``I love the fact that I'm getting offered more roles these
days,'' says Graham, whose career has taken off since she played
porn star Roller Girl in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997). ``There was a
time when all I was offered were the scripts that Drew Barrymore
rejected.''
 &HT;    This summer Entertainment Weekly even proclaimed Graham the ``It
Girl,'' whatever ``It'' may be.
 &HT;    ``It's really weird,'' Graham says. ``Last night I was flipping
through another magazine, and it said something about me being hot.
For a second, I felt really scared. I was like, `OK, I'm hot. So
now I can be cold.'
 &HT;    ``Suddenly I started to get really, really worried.''
 &HT;    ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has only boosted her appeal _ and
those ultra-tiny miniskirts didn't hurt, either.
 &HT;    ``My best day on the set was when someone asked me, `Heather, do
you want to keep your wardrobe?''' she recalls, laughing. ``I was
like, `Are you kidding? I would get arrested.'''
 &HT;    Graham was Myers' first choice to fill those hot pants, but she
insists she never thought she'd get the role.
 &HT;    ``I left the reading going, `Ohhh, I don't think they like me.
Ohhhh, I don't think it went well,''' the actress says.
 &HT;    For ``Bowfinger,'' which will open Aug. 13, she had a similar
experience with writer/star Steve Martin.
 &HT;    ``Again, I thought, `Great, you totally blew it. He doesn't like
you one bit,''' she recalls. ``I guess I need to get over this
insecurity. Or maybe it's working for me.''
 &HT;    If she's actually insecure, you wouldn't know it from her sexy,
self-assured performances in her two current films.
 &HT;    ``To be honest, it's fun to be in movies where you can be
sexually aggressive,'' she says, ``which is something women aren't
always allowed to be in real life.''
 &HT;    Graham knows what she's talking about, having grown up in
middle-class, mostly Republican Agoura, Calif., as the daughter of
strict Irish-Catholic parents. Emphasis on ``strict'' _ her mother
is a schoolteacher and her father an FBI agent.
 &HT;    ``I was raised as a real goody-two-shoes,'' Graham says. ``I was
made to feel guilty for even thinking about a boy. But when I saw
Harrison Ford kissing Karen Allen in `Raiders of the Lost Ark,' I
fell in love with the movies and the opposite sex.''
 &HT;    From an early age, she says, she felt drawn to perform.
 &HT;    ``I was annoyingly obnoxious and dramatic,'' she says. ``I would
go around saying, `I vant to be an actress.' My mom would just roll
her eyes and say, `That's nice, Heather. Set the table, honey.'''
 &HT;    Her father didn't approve, the actress adds.
 &HT;    ``I don't think acting was his first choice for me,'' Graham
says. ``He thought it was too wild of a profession.''
 &HT;    In high school, she almost changed her mind about seeking the
spotlight.
 &HT;    ``I was so gangly and awkward as a teen,'' Graham says. ``People
didn't think I was cute. I couldn't get a date. I wish I would have
brought you some pictures.
 &HT;    ``I had a very bad hairdo, and I went to a John Hughes high
school where you had to be perfect,'' she adds. ``I also had braces
and neckgear that went behind my head and around my face. I had to
wear it to school.'''
 &HT;    At age 16, the braces were off and puberty had worked its
wonders. Graham blossomed, landing commercial work, which led to a
small part on television's ``Growing Pains.''
 &HT;    ``There was an episode where Kirk Cameron has three dates and he
can't decide whom to go out with,'' she recalls. ``There's a
blonde, a brunette and a redhead. I was the blonde.''
 &HT;    Her movie break came was the teen flick ``License to Drive''
(1988), which produced remarkable results at school.
 &HT;    ``It was hilarious,'' Graham says. ``When the movie came out,
the high-school guys were like, `Wait a second _ you really are
sort of cute.'
 &HT;    ``Of course I ignored them,'' she adds. ``They missed their
chance.'''
 &HT;    Still, it took ``Boogie Nights'' to get Hollywood to sit up and
take notice.
 &HT;    ``That movie was a risk,'' she says. ``The subject matter was
dark, but it put me on the map.
 &HT;    ``What concerns me about becoming more popular is that I might
never take that kind of risk again,'' she adds, ``because I would
be afraid of what people and fans might think. I just hope I can
listen to my heart and do what I want to do.''
 &HT;    Next up is a drama, ``Committed,'' co-starring Casey Affleck and
Luke Wilson, to be followed by ``Alien Love Triangle'' with Kenneth
Branagh and Courteney Cox. That last one, incidentally, comes with
a far different look than she had in ``Austin Powers.''
 &HT;    ``I have a green, bald head and pointy ears,'' Graham says
gleefully. ``I have black contact lenses and long fingers.
Courteney Cox plays my alien husband, who comes to earth to marry a
male earthling. But I follow because I want her/him back.''
 &HT;    Sounds confusing even by Hollywood's standards for tangled
relationships. Graham knows a bit about that: Formerly the
companion of actor James Woods, she now shares a Hollywood Hills
mansion with Burns, who was rumored to have been seeing actress
Lauren Holly before she reconciled with her husband, actor Jim
Carrey, and ...
 &HT;    Well, none of it really matters, Graham says.
 &HT;    ``What Eddie and I have is unlike anything I've experienced in
the past,'' she says. ``He's very romantic. I also love that he's
shy _ I find that so sexy in a man.''
 &HT;    Burns' nephews, used to having a movie star in the family,
weren't that impressed when he brought her home for a family
dinner. But that all changed in June.
 &HT;    ``The boys are 9 and 7,'' Graham says. ``Since I'm in `Austin
Powers 2,' I'm suddenly really cool to them. They even carry the
Austin newspaper ad to school and go, `You know, that's my uncle's
girlfriend.'''

`AFFAIR' OF THE HEART: RENE RUSSO IN `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Rene Russo with Pierce Brosnan in a
scene from ``The Thomas Crown Affair.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a perfectly reasonable question, but Rene Russo can't stop
laughing.
 &HT;    For the record, the question was: Could lovemaking in real life
possibly ever be as hot, as sweaty and as downright sexy as Russo
and Pierce Brosnan make it seem in ``The Thomas Crown Affair?''
 &HT;    ``Oh God,'' Russo says finally, ``I suppose we could have our
moments, but ... ''
 &HT;    And then she's off again, shaking with laughter.
 &HT;    ``Let me tell you, I hate love scenes,'' she says eventually.
``They are uncomfortable, and I'm scared to death of them. The
night before I have to do one, I don't sleep. It looks so
comfortable in the end, but the things that happen to make a sex
scene work are funny. You end up laughing at the absurdity of it.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky with most of my love scenes,'' she adds,
``because they've been played for humor. In `Thomas Crown,' it's
steamy, but Pierce and I end up falling off a table.
 &HT;    ``That takes the edge off doing it.''
 &HT;    Lusty sex is merely one aspect of John McTiernan's remake of the
1968 Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway thriller, which will open Aug. 13.
Brosnan stars as a suave billionaire businessman who dabbles in art
theft for kicks, with Russo as Catherine Banning, an insurance
investigator whose suspicion of Crown is matched by her attraction
to him.
 &HT;    ``In a way I understood Catherine, but I personally don't lead
with my sexuality,'' the former model says by telephone from Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. ``It's not who I am.
 &HT;    ``But I do cover my vulnerability like she does,'' she adds. ``I
deflect my vulnerability all the time with humor or by looking away
or by fidgeting. Catherine hides.
 &HT;    ``I think the tougher she was on the outside and the more in
control she was, the less interesting she was for me to play,'' the
actress says. ``When we really get to see that she's off her game,
that she's in murky waters emotionally because of her feelings for
Crown, then she became interesting and real for me.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't afraid to show her vulnerability, so the hardest part
for me was leading with her sexuality and not deflecting that part
of myself,'' Russo concludes. ``Stripping down emotionally was much
harder than taking my clothes off.''
 &HT;    Sure, sure. But all people who have seen the film talk about is
Russo's gorgeous, glistening, gravity-defying 45-year-old body.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood is so conventional,'' she says. ``It's amazing to
me. There's a certain beauty to having a freedom with your body and
not being so self-conscious about it.
 &HT;    ``European men and women have a different idea about nudity,''
she adds. ``When I was young and modeling, I lived with these girls
from Europe. They'd be sitting around talking, and they'd be nude
and not even know it, while I'd come in dressed from head to toe in
my pajamas, robe and slippers.
 &HT;    ``We tend to cover up,'' Russo says. ``We're more insecure. One
of our idols in America is youth, and God forbid you get past 30 or
35 or whatever age it's supposedly inappropriate to show anything
because you're not a certain weight or of a certain appearance or
style.
 &HT;    ``It's a shame, because there are so many different kinds of
beauty.''
 &HT;    Though she proved with ``Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992), ``In the Line
of Fire'' (1993), ``Get Shorty'' (1995), ``Ransom'' (1996) and
``Tin Cup'' (1996) that she had more to offer than her looks, Russo
was still pleasantly surprised when she landed her ``Crown'' role.
 &HT;    ``I am 45,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I'm thankful to Pierce
and John McTiernan. You hear a lot of men-bashing in terms of
`Unfair-unfair-unfair,' and there definitely is a double standard.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' she says, ``Pierce and John really fought
for me. I would not have gotten the role had they not fought for
me.''
 &HT;    Every onscreen pairing is an experiment, Russo believes, with no
way of telling which will sizzle and which fizzle.
 &HT;    ``You just have to take the risk,'' says Russo, who offscreen
has been married for seven years to Dan Gilroy, with whom she has a
5-year-old daughter, Rose. ``I really try to tune into whomever I'm
with and find a good energy, then work with that.
 &HT;    ``I almost never work alone,'' she adds, ``but, boy, actors are
completely different. There's no one with more energy than Mel
Gibson, but Clint Eastwood is as still as can be. They have the
same energy, but use it differently.
 &HT;    ``As the actress working with them, I have to use that energy in
different ways and make it work.''
 &HT;    As for Brosnan, she says, their chemistry comes from their very
different personas.
 &HT;    ``He's solid, unwavering, knows exactly where he wants to go and
is intense, incredibly intense,'' she explains. ``I kind of go into
things flustered, not as sure, and I have to find my way a little
bit. That can take a take or two. I like to try a lot of different
things, and I don't have an exact direction to go in.
 &HT;    ``Being so different can be a challenge, but it was also a lot
of fun.''
 &HT;    Highly professional actress though she is today, Russo admits
that initially she turned to acting only for the money.
 &HT;    ``I didn't genuinely want to do it,'' she says. ``I really
didn't want to be in front of any camera anymore _ but I didn't
have a job and I didn't know what to do.
 &HT;    ``I waited a long time,'' she says. ``I didn't start acting
until I was 33, and that was because I ran out of money.
 &HT;    ``I tried it and didn't hate it,'' she recalls. ``I figured I'd
do it movie by movie, and quit if I ever came to hate it. I don't
have a great passion for it, though I envy actors who want to act
forever.''
 &HT;    Russo pauses.
 &HT;    ``But the truth is there's not great stuff to do,'' says the
actress, who will next be seen in ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' with
Robert De Niro and Jason Alexander. ``I'm not challenged enough
because, frankly, there are not enough good roles. So I've done OK
parts, but I want more than that.''
 &HT;    It isn't simply a matter of making it onto Hollywood's A-list,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``Being on the A-list doesn't assure you of amazing material,''
she says. ``That's why so many actresses are developing their own
projects.
 &HT;    ``You have to be really fortunate to keep doing great film after
great film and have a good time doing them,'' she concludes.
``Honestly, I don't know what I want to do, but I get bored.''
 &HT;    Even if Russo gets her chance to make a few great films, age _
or ageism _ could still catch up with her soon. The irony's not
lost on Russo, but she loses more sleep over those pesky sex scenes
than worrying about her fate in Tinseltown.
 &HT;    ``If I led my life thinking that society or any person in or out
of this business was in total control, I'd be afraid,'' she says.
``But I don't believe that.
 &HT;    ``When the doors close to me, I'll have been meant to move on,
and that will be OK,'' Russo says. ``I could have worried about
that at 35. I could have worried about that at 40.
 &HT;    ``I am not going to start worrying about it now.''

   Whenever David Boreanaz gets to feeling a bit full of himself _
when the adoring Web pages, drool-stained fan mail and hordes of
screaming teen-age admirers get him thinking he's all that and then
some _ he has two words which bring him down to earth.

   They're the two words which his buddies use to cut him down to

Boreanaz debuted as Angel, the brooding, smoldering vampire. Eying
Sunnydale's newest hunk, Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) appraised
him with two immortal words: ``Salty goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's stuck with him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, a very good friend of mine and I were reminiscing,
and he said, `You did a great job and I'm real proud of you,'''
Boreanaz recalls. ``So I reminded him of that line, because he's
always giving me a hard time about that: `Salty goodness' _ we just
got a good laugh out of that. My friends keep me very grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to come in handy this fall, when Angel gets his own
spinoff series on the WB network. The show will take the character,
who has split with soulmate Buffy, to Los Angeles, where, with
vampy Cordelia in tow, he'll try to right wrongs much as Buffy does
back in Sunnydale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show's in the same ballpark, but it'll be just a different
city,'' Boreanaz says. ``There'll be a bit more of a touch on the
human level, as far as why people do what they do, what motivates
them to do bad things and get away with it. Angel's purpose is to
figure that out, to help people _ and along the way he'll save some
lives and some redemption for his own soul, which he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll run the same kind of territory,'' he continues, ``but in
a different level, maybe a bit more adult-oriented. The dark side
of the human condition is not always the best thing to deal with
from an adolescent point of view, but I think it's going to work
out great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, viewers shouldn't be too surprised if Sarah Michelle
Gellar turns up on the series from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We parted ways in a very `Casablanca' kind of a way,''
Boreanaz says, ``but I think there's another story to be told about
the two of us. But for now, separation between the two characters
is great. There'll be crossovers that occur _ she'll come and visit
me, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Boreanaz has none of Angel's dark, tormented vibe. He
shows up dressed casually in a gray T-shirt, chinos and sports
slippers for an interview held, at his suggestion, at a Beverly
Hills eatery just off Rodeo Drive. But it's not one of the sleek,
hipster restaurants common in the neighborhood _ just a little dive
that serves up big, messy Philly-cheesesteak sandwiches, one of
which Boreanaz devours with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that the persona of Angel is remote from his own,
though he clearly loves the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got the job,'' he recalls, ``I was telling
everybody, `I'm playing a 244-year-old vampire with a conscience,'
and my friends would be, like, `Cool, man.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came out sounding so wild, saying it in a nonchalant
fashion,'' he says. ``It's funny when you think about it. It's not
like, `Oh, I'm playing a doctor' or `I'm playing a police
officer.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Gellar speaks well of her former
co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the most amazing working relationship I've ever had,''
she says. ``I've been very blessed with the guys that I've worked
opposite, but David and I had a very, very special relationship. In
three years of working together, we never had so much as a
disagreement, and that's just unbelievable, considering the hours
we spent together.''
</P>
<P>
   His departure is a blow to her program, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is very, very daunting,'' Gellar admits. ``You have
this concern _ part of the reason `Buffy' worked was because of
Angel, and what if I can't do it on my own? But it's an exciting
time for him, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series will play down the 240 years of ``pain and
torture'' which made Angel such a grim _ if romantic _ presence on
``Buffy,'' Boreanaz predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he'll be the befuddled action guy,'' the actor
says. ``He's really cool, and then he does something that makes him
look like the biggest dork ... The humor will be through his
seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Boreanaz grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., a long way from the glamour
of Hollywood. When he first arrived in Los Angeles, intent on
forging a career as an actor, he admits that there was hardly a
clamor for his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of odd jobs _ I parked cars, I worked at sporting
clubs, passed out towels, I did anything to stay alive,'' he says.
``They were hard times. And it's a blessing when you get good
things in increments, not everything at once.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have his own series, but Boreanaz admits that he still
has a lot to learn as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that when I feel like I'm not hitting it, it
usually comes out fine,'' he says. ``And then when you feel like
you are, it comes off not so good. It's a weird thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and industry observers alike have already tagged
``Angel'' as a surefire hit, trusting Boreanaz's legions of adoring
fans to give it ``Buffy''-like numbers. That's a lot to have riding
on the shoulders of a 28-year-old, but the actor says he doesn't
feel any undue burden of expectations. Actually, he says, his
primary feeling is one of eagerness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a year I've been waiting for this,'' he explains. ``I had
to shoot a whole season knowing that I'm getting my own show. The
table has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any pressure, because I'm not out there to
satisfy anybody,'' Boreanaz adds. ``I'm not out there to prove
anything, I'm not out there to live up to anybody's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only do my work and let it go. I can't try to determine
what the outcome is going to be. Otherwise, I'll end up killing
myself.''

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of director Alfred Hitchcock.) 
 By TOM SOTER  
 c.1999 Diversion magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year I was talking with my 17-year-old niece about the
then-current horror movie ``Halloween: H20,'' which starred Jamie
Lee Curtis and featured a cameo by her mother, Janet Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you remember Janet Leigh from `Psycho,''' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't _ she had never seen ``Psycho'' (1960), because she
didn't watch ``old black-and-white movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, that's as shocking as anything Alfred Hitchcock
ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   But even if today's film audiences rarely see the work of the
master of suspense _ whose 100th birthday occurs, appropriately
enough, on Friday, Aug. 13 _ they're anything but unfamiliar with
his style. His signature stylistic touches, such as jump-cutting,
overlapping sound and unorthodox camera angles, are the hallmarks
of many of today's hottest young directors.
</P>
<P>
   For one now so influential, Hitchcock had humble beginnings: He
was born in London, the son of a greengrocer. Sent to a Jesuit
school as a boy, he later studied to be an engineer before drifting
to silent movies as a title-card designer. Entranced by filmmaking,
he worked at every job he could, learning about lighting, editing,
set design and script construction.
</P>
<P>
   His first movie was shot in Germany in 1925, and his third _
``The Lodger'' (1926) _ made his reputation. Already employing his
favorite theme _ an innocent man suspected of a heinous crime _
this silent film showcased the young director's dazzling technique.
</P>
<P>
   When the killer strikes, all the viewer sees are five images cut
together in rapid succession: a girl screaming, a woman on the
street looking up from her stoop, a cat jumping off a garbage can,
a policeman running and a masked figure walking into the fog. It is
stunning in its simplicity _ and as jarring as anything in
``Halloween'' (1978) or ``Friday the 13th'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Technique became Hitchcock's hallmark, from his constantly
roving camera in ``Rope'' (1948) to his 36 edits in 45 seconds for
``Psycho's'' famous shower scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a film means, first of all, to tell a story,'' he told
fellow director and Hitchcock devotee Francois Truffaut in the book
``Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967). ``The next factor is the technique
of filmmaking, and in this connection I am against virtuosity for
its own sake. Technique should enrich the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't set the camera at a certain angle just because the
cameraman happens to be enthusiastic about that spot,'' the
director said. ``The only thing that matters is whether the
installation of the camera at a given angle is going to give the
scene its maximum impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was notoriously contemptuous of actors _ ``Actors
should be treated like cattle,'' he supposedly said _ but many
apparently enjoyed working with him: Cary Grant and James Stewart
each made four films with Hitchcock, Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly
three each and Leo G. Carroll six.
</P>
<P>
   The director rarely gave advice on performance, however, leaving
details of interpretation to his actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an actor comes to me and wants to discuss his character,
I say, `It's in the script,''' he once said. ``If he says, `But
what's my motivation?' I say, `Your salary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's sense of humor was a dry one, including his penchant
for sometimes-cruel practical jokes. Robert Donat and Madeline
Carroll spent much of ``The 39 Steps'' (1935) handcuffed together,
and one day the director pretended to have lost the key, forcing
the two to stay chained together for the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of humor also infiltrated his movies _ however grim
his subject matter, Hitchcock was never above a bit of black humor.
And it worked: The comic touches, dark or otherwise, help make the
serious, even grisly elements palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Romance, too, was a part of the equation: Most of his great
suspense films are also about lovers working out relationship
conflicts. In ``Rear Window'' (1954), for example, the hero fears
marriage to his girlfriend almost as much as he fears the killer
next door _ it takes imminent threats to both their lives to
finally bring them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the world of a Hitchcock film,'' William Rothman writes
in ``Hitchcock: The Murderous Gaze'' (Harvard University Press,
1984), ``the nature and relationships of love, murder, sexuality,
marriage ... are at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock developed these themes in his 1930s British films, and
applied them most fully during the 1940s and 1950s in America.
There his movies became even richer and more complex, dealing with
issues of love and trust in ``Notorious'' (1946), homosexual
longing in ``Strangers on a Train'' (1951), transference of guilt
in ``The Wrong Man'' (1957) and obsessive, destructive passion in
``Vertigo'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   By cloaking such themes in the thriller genre, Hitchcock helped
change the way critics looked at suspense movies. A thriller such
as the multiple-Oscar-winning ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991)
could never have been treated seriously if Hitchcock hadn't led the
way. Indeed, Hitchcock made entertainment into art and vice versa,
drawing viewers into a dreamily plausible world that quickly became
a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put in my films ... what Poe put in his stories,''
Hitchcock once said, ``a perfectly unbelievable story recounted to
readers with such a hallucinatory logic that one has the impression
that this same story can happen to you tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock rarely stepped too far out of character, disguising
his artistic aspirations behind a mask of popular entertainment. He
became even more of a showman when his television series, ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents,'' allowed him to come in front of the camera
from 1955 to 1962, offering sardonically tongue-in-cheek
introductions to the show's macabre stories.
</P>
<P>
   He himself had little to do with the series, directing only 20
of its 266 episodes, but it made him Hollywood's most famous _
because most visible _ director, and also influenced the making of
``Psycho,'' which was shot on a low budget by his television crew.
</P>
<P>
   But his very image as ``the master of suspense'' came to prey on
Hitchcock, who felt intense pressure to live up to his own past
films. He once quipped that the things that scared him the most
were little children, policemen, high places ... and the idea that
``my next picture won't be as good as the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s and 1970s were troubled years for the director, with
occasional fine efforts _ most notably ``Frenzy'' (1972) _ mixed
with failures and, increasingly, the inability to get films made.
</P>
<P>
   But the greengrocer's son, once derided as a master of a hack's
genre, had the last laugh. By the time of his death in 1980, he had
been knighted, and Sir Alfred was widely hailed as a cinematic
genius by younger filmmakers, critical institutions and the public
at large. The word ``Hitchcockian'' entered the popular lexicon as
both an adjective and an ambition for directors as diverse as Brian
De Palma, Quentin Tarantino, Jonathan Demme and Andrew Davis.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, his films have become exemplars of what
moviemaking is all about: passion, audience involvement, visual
beauty and technical virtuosity. In a phrase, pure cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitchcock,'' critic David Thomson once wrote, ``became a way
of defining film.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: A HITCH IN THE PROCEEDINGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock was noted for his walk-on roles in his own
films. Here are a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   + ``The 39 Steps'' (1935) _ dropping litter as Robert Donat and
Lucie Mannheim run from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   + ``Lifeboat'' (1944) _ ingeniously appearing in a briefly
glimpsed newspaper advertisement for Reduco Obesity Slayer.
</P>
<P>
   + ``Spellbound'' (1945) _ coming out of a hotel elevator,
carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   + ``Strangers on a Train'' (1951) _ boarding a train with a bull
fiddle as Farley Granger gets off.
</P>
<P>
   + ``Dial M for Murder'' (1954) _ at far left in Ray Milland's
class-reunion photo.
</P>
<P>
   + ``North By Northwest'' (1959) _ in the opening credits,
running for a bus and missing it.
</P>
<P>
   + ``Psycho'' (1960) _ incongruously wearing a cowboy hat,
glimpsed through Janet Leigh's office window.
</P>
<P>
   + ``The Birds'' (1963) _ leaving the pet shop with two white
terriers.

FOR DAY TRADERS, TRAUMA SEEN MOUNTING WITH LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Skiersch never even came close to killing anyone, as Mark
O. Barton did Thursday when he walked into two Atlanta day-trading
brokerages and coldly shot 22 people, nine of them fatally. But he
dreamed about it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barton, Skiersch was a day trader who lost a lot of money.
He had dropped a career running a nightclub show in the spring of
1997 to spend his days huddled before a computer screen at a
Chicago day-trading boutique, buying and selling blocks of stock
hundreds of times a day.
</P>
<P>
   He believed the firm's high-octane sales pitch, that even though
he had no experience in the stock market he could make six figures
a year by betting on tiny movements in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Where else are you going to make hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year without going to medical school?' '' he
said this week from his Chicago apartment. ``They said, `Your
wildest dreams are going to come true.' And they conveyed this
sense of urgency, like you've got to get in on this now before the
whole world discovers how easy it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't get rich. A year later, he had lost nearly
$200,000. His life savings, a small inheritance, and his townhouse
_ which he mortgaged to keep trading _ were gone. It began to dawn
on him that he had quite possibly ruined his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been sitting there day after day thinking you've found
the secret when in fact your life is dribbling away trade by
trade,'' he said. ``In the end you realize you've been had, that it
was all a con.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who said they were going to kill themselves and
that they were going to kill someone else on their way out. That's
anger and desperation talking. Most people aren't ever going to do
anything like that. I obviously didn't. But I'll tell you I dreamed
about it. I dreamed about it almost every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, industry observers, regulators, and psychologists
studying the emotional impact of sudden financial loss say amateur
day trading is a potential minefield of psychological trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real easy to get crazy,'' said Robert Koppel, a former
pit trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who has authored six
books on the psychology of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading at virtually any level taps into the most fundamental
elements in your personality and amplifies them. . . . For many
people, the thrill of winning and the devastation of losing become
linked with their sense of self-worth. I've seen strong, stable
personalities come completely undone.''
</P>
<P>
   While authorities in Atlanta are still sifting through Barton's
troubled life for reasons behind his rampage, his eight-week career
in the adrenaline-charged world of day trading appeared to play a
part.
</P>
<P>
   After activating an $87,500 account June 9 at the Atlanta office
of Momentum Securities Inc., the 44-year-old former chemist was
last Tuesday trying frantically to dig himself out of heavy losses.
His account had fallen so low that the Atlanta office manager told
Barton he had to pony up cash to keep trading.
</P>
<P>
   That day, police say, Barton killed his wife and stuffed her in
a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote a check for $50,000 to keep trading. But on
Wednesday, the office manager told him the bank refused to honor
it, the Washington Post reported. That day, Barton killed his two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Barton returned to the office Thursday afternoon, promising to
transfer $200,000 to Momentum from an account at Charles Schwab.
Instead, a few minutes later, he wandered into Momentum's trading
room and calmly greeted other day traders before opening fire with
two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Glock 9mm. All told, Barton had lost
as much as $105,000 at Momentum.
</P>
<P>
   After killing four people, Barton went across the street and
killed five people at All-Tech Investment Group, another firm where
he'd done day trading. All-Tech officials have not released
Barton's financial records.
</P>
<P>
   In a suicide note found in the living room of Barton's family's
suburban apartment _ where police found his wife and two children _
there was an ominous warning seemingly aimed at the brokerage
houses where he'd traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer,'' he wrote, ``just long
enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is the most recent craze in the high-stakes frontier
of electronic finance. According to industry estimates, 4,000 to
7,000 members of a new breed of thrill-seeking amateur traders are
now pursuing their fortunes in some 100 boutiques around the
country that regulators have likened to gambling parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike professional traders working in commercial brokerages,
day traders aren't actually employed by the boutiques where they
conduct their trades. Rather, they labor voluntarily, keeping
whatever profits they can make while paying commissions of about
$20 for every transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated day traders work eight hours a day, five days a week,
staring at banks of computer screens that provide direct electronic
links to the markets. Often, they perform hundreds of transactions
a day. They buy blocks of shares, holding them sometimes for only
seconds, hoping the price will briefly rise so they can dump the
shares for a profit. Instead of relying on stock-market knowledge,
they live by lightning reactions to minuscule price movements.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry touts success stories of traders who have
parlayed small accounts into multimillion-dollar fortunes,
regulators say as few as two in 10 day traders make money. And only
a small fraction of those make large returns.
</P>
<P>
   And some have found it so addicting, regulators say they are
unable to relinquish the thrill of striking it rich, even while
losses pile up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many ways I can say this, but day trading is
not investing and it's not for everybody,'' said Massachusetts
Secretary of State William F. Galvin, whose office has led a
national crackdown on abuses at day-trading firms. ``It's not for
most people. If there's one thing this whole thing points out, it's
that there is a dire need for regulators to clearly identify this
as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin and others have called for more strict guidelines on the
financial suitability of day-trading clients. ``The reality is that
these brokerage firms make their money from the commissions whether
or not the traders make money,'' said Koppel, the author and former
trader. ``They're willing to invite people who have no business at
all being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiersch, meanwhile, hopes regulators and day traders will take
notice of the Atlanta killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not big investors out there losing a part of their
portfolio,'' he said. ``These are people who have been sold on the
idea that day trading is going to be their new career. They quit
everything. They give up jobs. You have no idea the power of it.
I've seen people completely lose it. It grinds you. It can make you
completely insane.''

KERRY PUNCTURES TAX-CUT FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kerry hadn't even been elected lieutenant governor of
Massachusetts yet the last time the government down here went off
its rocker.
</P>
<P>
   So you should forgive his rational exuberance last week in
assaulting the idea that tax cuts that leave a hole in the
country's balance sheet are anything but absurd and obscene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must be in the air in Washington,'' he said last
week, in between performances of his high-profile role in the
opposition. ``We're talking about a deliberate recipe for permanent
fiscal crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry may have missed the original fight 18 years ago. But he
brought to last week's political Senate battle the experience of
having bested Bill Weld three years ago, when the then-Guv may have
been the only Republican running (Bob Dole included) who vigorously
backed the GOP presidential nominee's silly proposal to cut income
tax rates across the board by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry whipped Weld by arguing then, as he argues now, that deep
tax-cutting is a stalking horse for deep government-cutting that
folks on the right either can't or won't propose in detail and thus
want to force throught the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was a major chunk of the crusade to slash taxes
back in 1981, when Kerry had yet to fight his way onto Mike
Dukakis's comeback gubernatorial ticket, just two years before he
succeeded Paul Tsongas as senator.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Ronald Reagan talked tax cuts as analogous to the
cutting of a child's allowance. Today, his less restrained
descendants scream ``starve the beast'' on the floor of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, Reagan could also talk about reviving an economy
headed toward the worst recession since the Depression and
wrestling with ruinous inflation and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in near-perfect economic conditions, a large tax cut
makes no economic sense, and so it exists only to suit an
ideological goal. Tax Cut '81 and Tax Cut '99 share one important
feature, however. Both are premised on the demonstrable fiction
that they are fiscally responsible and won't run up deficits that
can smother the economy's ability to generate higher living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan never proposed and Congress never enacted a budget that
would have balanced _ hence the preposterous explosion of debt by
some $4 trillion. And the current Republican Congress _ pressing
mindlessly ahead with its veto bait, $792 billion red-ink recipe _
blithely assumes the appearance over the next decade of a nearly $1
trillion surplus outside the Social Security trust funds; and this
nonexistent sum must be ``returned to the people'' to prevent the
alleged catastrophe of its being ``spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kerry's function last week as one of Democratic leader
Tom Daschle's high command, was to demolish the ``surplus''
fiction; the other was to be one of several Democrats offering
symbolic amendments to illustrate the warping of national
priorities that radical tax-slashing can cause. In performing each
task effectively, Kerry was acting more in the tradition of what
used to be known as a moderate Republican than in the role of
traditional Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   On economics, Kerry has always had a touch of ``neo'' about him.
He is conservative fiscally, concerned about the cost of investment
capital, not averse to lower capital gains taxation, and a booster
of the new technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax debate's best pie chart, Kerry showed that more
than half the alleged surplus outside Social Security (nearly $600
billion) consists of an assumption that for 10 years the
nonentitlement program budget _ military and domestic _ will never
be adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, he noted, that Congress is already well outside
that box and will go even further. And the additional truth is that
Congress should permit some increases and some decreases in basic
governmental functions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kerry's chart showed that the ``surplus''
assumption has no room for real emergencies and no provision for
unavoidably higher Social Security administration costs. And since
realistic budgeting means a more gradual lowering of debt interest
costs, the bottom line is at the very most a 10-year operating
surplus of a bit more than $100 billion. And that figure stands
without a dime invested, as will inevitably occur, in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And it was on one aspect of Medicare that Kerry's clever
amendment focused. It would have reduced the tax cut's size by just
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those $20 billion or so would have cushioned the program
from the well-documented damage that deep cutbacks affecting
nursing homes, home health care, and teaching hospitals have
caused. Those cutbacks are running at double the rate planned when
Medicare providers were targeted as part of the balanced budget
agreement two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry came close on the floor, losing 51-49. Three New England
Republicans backed him (retiring Senator John Chafee of Rhode
Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine). He was
stiffed by Jim Jeffords of Vermont and by New Hampshire's men of
the right, Judd Gregg and Bob Smith. But those three plus Jeffords
are also proponents of a presposterous $500 billion,
cupboard-emptying tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   It was thus 18 years ago. Only one current GOP senator who was
here (Jeffords, then in the House) opposed the 1981 disaster. Only
one, Bill Cohen of Maine (now defense secretary), opposed the Newt
Gingrich budget in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On economics, today's moderate Republicans in New England are in
fact represented by John Kerry from Massachusetts and Joe Lieberman
from Connecticut.

MAILING LISTS PROVING A BOOMING BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before a political scandal erupted last month over WGBH-TV
sharing its membership list with Democratic Party fund-raisers,
anyone with a mailbox had learned the hard way that a mailing list
is a very marketable _ and widely marketed _ commodity.
</P>
<P>
   These days businesses, nonprofit groups, and charities face an
increasingly difficult time getting Americans to read, or even just
open, ``junk mail'' solicitations. So booming demand has developed
for up-to-date, narrowly focused lists to get the best possible
response from the roughly $25 billion spent in the United States
each year on direct mail advertising to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Through brokers, entities that own lists _ such as environmental
groups, magazine publishers, and mail-order catalogs _ can get $60
to $125 or more for every 1,000 names they rent out for a single
mailing to a solicitor or business, industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical transaction, one of dozens of national
list-brokering companies would approach a group whose mailing list
it considers valuable, because most people on it are wealthy or
proven charitable donors or because their link to a group or a
magazine strongly suggests what they like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   For the negotiated fee, the broker would rent the list for
one-time use by a client doing a direct-mail campaign or pay more
to take permanent ownership of the names. A standard practice is
for the broker to stud the list it gives its client with phony
names at addresses the brokerage controls as a way of monitoring
whether the renter misuses or reuses the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society, for example, gets ``more and
more contacts every month, very often now from commercial,
for-profit entities'' that want to rent its list of 67,000 members,
society membership director John Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon could make perhaps $70,000 annually renting its
membership list just once a month to companies selling recreation-
or environment-oriented products. But Bradley said Audubon
officials have decided only to exchange lists _ rarely _ with other
nonprofit, environmental and conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with Greater Boston nonprofit and cultural groups and
list brokers indicate that WGBH is one of the few _ if not the only
one _ that has sold its membership list to commercial list brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials said they have swapped lists primarily with
other cultural or charitable groups to get new names that usually
account for 20 percent of new members each year and $3 million in
membership revenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``There are times when we have leased out portions of
the list when it was just a financial transaction,'' said Jeanne
Hopkins, WGBH's vice president for communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said she could not determine how often WGBH has rented
its list, which now has 210,000 names, to commercial list brokers.
``That's not a significant source of income for us.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials have blamed the 1994 and 1996 list swapping with
the Democratic National Committee on low-level development office
employees who, they said, did not know about a station policy
banning list swaps with political parties. The station has also
fired the outside list broker, whom it has refused to name, who
made the names available to the DNC. WGBH says the broker should
have known about the ban.
</P>
<P>
   It has since emerged that more than two dozen US public
television stations have sold lists to both political parties and
used party lists to seek new station members and donors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which will
distribute $197 million in federal grants to 1,000 public radio and
television stations next fall, announced a new policy under which
stations cannot get money unless they guarantee their membership
lists will not be swapped with or rented to political fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides drawing the ire of Capitol Hill Republicans convinced
the DNC list swap proves longstanding allegations of a left-wing
tilt in public TV, some industry officials said WGBH violated a
cardinal rule for nonprofits: Do not expose your supporters to
annoying junk mail they can trace back to your group.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Lyons of Fieldstone Creative Communications in Waltham,
Mass., who works with about a dozen clients around the United
States including the New England Aquarium, said, ``None of the
nonprofits I work with sell their names. They don't like giving
them up, and we don't want to annoy members or donors because the
chance of them joining again or donating is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Berman, of the Boston Harbor advocacy group Save the
Harbor/Save the Bay, said: ``We don't want our list floating
around. We have a responsibility to our donors not to pester them,
and we would never engage in partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   John Papalia, vice president of Statlistics, a national list
brokerage and management firm based in Danbury, Conn., said some
national groups such as the Easter Seals, Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, and disabled veterans' groups ``make a lot of money
renting their lists, although they keep a very tight check on who
they rent them to.'' But, in general, he said he has found local
and regional nonprofits much more leery.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the Direct Marketing Association in New
York, US businesses, charities, and other organizations spent $24.3
billion on direct-mail advertising to consumers and another $15
billion on business-to-business appeals. The group projects total
direct-mail spending will grow 6 percent annually through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pressure to break through mailbox clutter, membership
and subscription lists that suggest what causes and products people
like are one of the most prized sources for brokers who compile and
sell mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``mailing lists,'' the Boston Yellow Pages
includes more than 40 companies that offer access to up to 11,000
different lists covering 100 million US consumers and millions of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk Company, based in suburban Chicago, offers fund-raisers
and businesses a ``lifestyle selector'' product with 800 different
lists based on shopping and civic interests reported by more than
30 million people on questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   With direct mail costing 30 cents to $1 per piece, spending
money to solicit only the most likely prospects can be a very good
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Statlistics' Papalia said brokers are especially interested in
nonprofit member rosters because ``if you can find people who are
donors, they are always very good prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Science,
and the Children's Museum, which refuse to sell their lists but do
exchange them among themselves, are also attractive because ``the
presence of children in a household is a big factor'' in appealing
to some marketers, Papalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Most nonprofit groups allow members to specify that their name
will not be sold or exchanged. People can register with their local
post office or the Direct Marketing Association in New York to
refuse unsolicited mail, requests that reputable list brokers
promise to heed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, list brokers have an abundance of sources for mailing
information, and increasingly powerful computer programs to
cross-reference and mesh different lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 federal telecommunications act, White Page
listings are no longer considered telephone company property and
must be shared with other list publishers.
</P>
<P>
   List brokers can then fold in data from magazine subscription
lists, city and town real estate records, Census Bureau
neighborhood income and ethnicity data, certain credit bureau
records, many states' motor vehicle and boat registrations,
self-reported household income and interest data on product
warranty cards, and thousands of other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some states market their motor vehicle and driver's license
records, a treasure trove for list brokers, but a Massachusetts
``driver privacy protection'' law enacted in 1997 sharply limits
access to personal data.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``We couldn't give you a name of everybody who has
a Cadillac or a Volvo'' for purposes of soliciting wealthy people,
said J. Abra Degbor of the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But policies like those are little barrier to list brokers
determined to create detailed records on where you live, how much
money you presumably make, what you like to buy, and what causes
you support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everything is available these days,'' said Lyons,
the Waltham direct-mail consultant.

A `SAFE' TOUR NEAR CHECHEN DANGER ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAVROPOL, Russia _ Brandishing a submachine gun, the man in
dark combat fatigues escorted his visitors to a van sitting in the
shadows of the abandoned airport road.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, getting into an unmarked vehicle with heavily armed
strangers is not the safest move one can make. This is especially
true in the southern Russian regions surrounding separatist,
lawless Chechnya, where kidnapping for ransom has become a
lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police say that more than 1,100 people have been held
for ransom by gangs who have been operating around the breakaway
province since 1996, when Russian troops were driven out by
separatist guerrillas and Chechnya won de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the hostages' ordeal starts with something like the
scene that was unfolding in front of two reporters who had just
flown in from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But this unmarked van represented safety. The ``gunman'' was
Captain Igor Pogosov of the Stavropol police. He was here to escort
us around hostage country _ officially known here as the Complex
Operative Situation Zone _ while we reported on an outbreak of
violence in the region. As we headed toward the Chechen frontier,
Pogosov offered a bit of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised if people stare at you kind of funny,'' he
deadpanned. ``It's just that you could provide for them and their
family for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kidnapping victims eventually go free, like Arizona native
Herman Gregg, 51, a missionary released June 30 after seven months
of captivity and torture in Chechnya. Others are not so lucky, such
as the three Britons and a New Zealander killed by their captors in
Chechnya last December. Police say about 500 captives _ including a
Russian general, dozens of servicemen, priests, farmers, even
children _ are still being held. While Russian police say they have
freed 240 hostages this year, 270 more have been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone goes free, it seems that day or the next
day, someone else is taken hostage again,'' a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow authorities attribute the kidnappings to armed gangs
headed by renegade Chechen ``field commanders,'' guerrillas who no
longer obey Chechnya's popularly elected president, Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize the lawlessness, Russia's interior minister,
Vladimir Rushailo, showed reporters a film last week that he said
had been compiled from videotapes sent by Chechen captors to
victims' relatives to press ransom demands. The gruesome footage
shows torture, maiming, and even one apparent murder. In one
unnerving scene, a masked man is seen severing part of Gregg's
right index finger. Police say Gregg, whose captives had demanded
$1 million, was released without a ransom. But they admit money
often changes hands in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes on, kidnapping will become the main source of
income in the Chechen budget,'' the film's narrator said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping is not just a Chechnya problem. Many gangs operate on
the Russian side of the border, a reality brought home to us as our
van sped south through the Complex Operative Situation Zone.
Pogosov never let go of his machine pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a car approaches us at night, we have the right to open
fire,'' he remarked. As hard as we had tried to conceal details of
our trip, word had leaked, Pogosov said. Not even other police and
military units could be entirely trusted. He suggested we never
leave his side. (We didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of traitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This might help explain why so many Russian servicemen have been
snatched by kidnappers from bases outside Chechen territory and
whisked in past police and military checkpoints. Then again, the
border between Chechnya and Russia is so poorly marked in some
places that it is easy to slip in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sergeant Alexander Nenashev, whose unit patrols the
border, remembers accidentally wandering into Chechnya on his first
day on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily some civilians found me and pointed the way back,''
Nenashev said. ``I could have been there a long time.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 LENOX, Mass.: ... ``Peter Grimes.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The BSO ``Elektra'' and ``Pique-Dame'' were released on CDs, and
Ozawa has conducted recorded performances with other orchestras of
``Salome'' and ``Carmen'' with Jessye Norman and Offenbach's ``Les
Contes d'Hoffmann.'' Some of these works have also been seen at the
Saito Kinen Festival, where Ozawa led Poulenc's ``Les Dialogues des
Carmelites'' and a famous televised production of Stravinsky's
``Oedipus Rex'' that was designed by Julie Taymor.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Ozawa has also conducted other works not associated
with him in Europe or America, in an annual series of operas with
the New Japan Philharmonic sponsored by Hennessey cognac _ there he
has led such works as ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``Manon Lescaut,''
``The Magic Flute,'' and ``Der fliegende Hollaender.''
</P>
<P>
   What has eluded Ozawa are some of the major works of Mozart,
Verdi, and Wagner; conductors these days are often typecast _ no
one would think of asking Ozawa to conduct ``Peter Grimes,'' a work
he led more convincingly than some of the British conductors who
specialize in Britten. None of the Vienna repertory has been set
for Ozawa yet, but there are definitely things he wants to do. ``I
have never conducted Berg's `Wozzeck' in the theater, but we did it
in Boston, and Hildegard Behrens, who sang Marie, says it was the
best `Wozzeck' she was ever in. I have learned Berg's `Lulu' and
never conducted it, and I once spent five months learning
Schoenberg's `Moses und Aron' for a production that was canceled.
My car was broken into then, and the only thing that was taken was
my score to `Moses und Aron'! I was once offered Wagner's `Ring'
Cycle, but I couldn't make that commitment of time over a period of
three years, but now I want very much to do it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the subject of his departure from Boston in 2002,
Ozawa says, ``I didn't want to go down; everything in Boston must
always be going up. Until my very last day I want to be the music
director here, and I must be very strong; the first thing I am
asking of myself and of the orchestra is that these next three
years must be the very best of our time together. We are also
behind in commissioning new works, so I must give that a kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa says the decision to leave was ``difficult and sad. Both
for my family and for me Boston and Tanglewood have been a major
part of our lives. I know my feelings about this orchestra will
never change. I used to say that the relationship between a music
director and an orchestra was like a marriage, and forever, but now
I think the relationship is more like that of a family, which is
permanent and important in a different way. I think the orchestra
and I understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa bridles at the suggestion by some out-of-town critics that
the orchestra is currently in a state of disarray. ``We have some
wonderful new players now, a new first viola, a new first horn, a
new first flute, and they have changed the whole situation. There
are so many young strong players in the orchestra now, and I think
the orchestra is wonderful. I do not conduct so many orchestras
now, but I do conduct the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna
Philharmonic, and I think the Boston standard holds up _ this
orchestra has character, the way those do, and the character of the
Boston Symphony is something that I love. Boston has its own color,
and it never pushes; the musicians never become rough _ they hear
well and they blend well. Of course, like every orchestra we are
sometimes up, sometimes down, but it never comes down below Boston
Symphony standard. Only the greatest orchestras can do what the
Boston Symphony does at its best, as it did in our big tour
performances of Mahler's Third and Sixth symphonies. We can't do
that every day, but that's impossible. If people do not agree,
that's OK, but I don't understand what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also surprised by the amount of covert and even overt
anti-Asian condescension that surfaced in some of the commentary
greeting the announcement of his departure. ``In the beginning,
yes, I was very aware of this problem, but it is something I have
not felt for many years, especially when I conduct in Berlin or
Vienna. But I know it will not stop until I die; I know I am a test
case. Everyone wonders how much I can learn, how much I can
understand. But the problems I have had have always ended in a
positive way. I have always enjoyed learning, and I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changes at Tanglewood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has few regrets about the major controversy that has
dominated the last few years, the changes he has implemented at the
Tanglewood Music Center. ``It was my responsibility to do this.
There was some hot stuff to take, but I'm glad I did it, and now I
still have time, three years more, to drive the Music Center along
toward new levels. The school has started a whole new era, and
needs all the energy I can give to it. I hope I can continue a
relationship with the school, but I cannot invite myself, and I
don't want to be a Tanglewood ghost. If the music director invites
me, I will happy to do anything he asks me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of gratitude to his own mentors, Ozawa has become profoundly
committed to teaching. ``Conducting is not so easy, you know. You
have to be a good musician to begin with, and then you need the
tools to become a conductor _ and that's not something you can
learn in a room by yourself. When I was studying with Hideo Saito,
I was his only student, and I conducted every single week from the
time I was 16 or 17, starting with a string quartet playing
symphonies by Haydn and Mozart and later pieces like the
Tchaikovsky `Serenade for Strings.' I was so lucky. These days
there is not much chance for a young conductor to have the kind of
training I did, anywhere in the world. To be fair to the next
generation, I want to create this kind of chance for young people.
Today they all find the CD and listen to it, but to be a conductor
you have to understand things inside of you; you have to find the
next level within yourself. Music is this really big thing, and you
have to come up to it.''

RIDING THE RAILS 
Teenagers on the Move During the Great Depression 
By Errol Lincoln Uys 
TV Books, 303 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, ours was a nation which, in the
words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was ``dying by inches.''
Economic calamity plunged the country into a decade of devastation
and despair, leaving millions with little or no means to support
themselves and their families. From these times emerged 250,000
young people who would come to be known as ``boxcar boys and
girls,'' teenagers who shed their youth for a life on the rails,
hopping trains in search of work and something _ anything _ better
than what they'd left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding the Rails'' is their remarkable story, a riveting
document of hope and hardship during one of this nation's bleakest
eras. For all that has been written about the Depression, the
travails of those under the age of 18 have been sorely
underrepresented. As gripping as it is well-researched, this book
by Errol Lincoln Uys is a companion piece to the award-winning 1997
documentary of the same name, written and produced by Uys's son and
daughter-in-law, Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell. With more than 500
interviews and stunning archival photographs by Walker Evans,
Gordon Parks, and Dorothea Lange, Uys so thoroughly re-creates the
wretched conditions the boxcar boys and girls endured that the
reader can all but hear the cadence of the trains on the tracks,
and the lonesome wail at every whistle stop.

   Even before the Depression, the hobo life held a certain allure
for many youths. A swaggering life on the road without boundaries
or rules was romanticized by Jack London, best known for his novel
``The Call of the Wild,'' who spent part of his teenage years on a
``push,'' a gang of youthful freight riders. But with ``Black
Tuesday,'' the day of the 1929 stock-market crash, the spirit of
adventure gave way to desperation. Tens of thousands of businesses
failed. Schools shortened their terms or locked their doors
altogether. And in many families, children were suddenly seen as
just another hungry mouth to feed, leading many teenagers, some as
young as 13, to take to a life on the rails. They were among 4
million people to taste the bitterness of hobo life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy or girl's decision to leave home was intensely personal,
often spurred by naivete and hope,'' Uys writes. ``Many held grand
visions of finding work and sending money home. Like their parents,
many sought jobs that simply did not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   What often began for the teens as a euphoric experience of
freedom and wanderlust quickly turned to hunger, despondence, and
fear. They suffered from malnutrition, lived in squalid conditions.
They were often beaten bloody _ or worse _ by the brutal railroad
cops they called ``bulls.'' Young travelers, unaccustomed to the
rules of the rails, were sometimes injured or killed while
attempting to hop trains. The problem was so acute, Warner Bros.
produced the 1933 ``social conscience'' film ``Wild Boys of the
Road,'' which was meant to discourage train-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   There were other palpable terrors. Teenage boys were routinely
preyed upon by ``wolves'' and ``jockers,'' older men looking for
sex. ``The boy who was away from home without money and who did not
have the courage to beg,'' Uys writes, ``was the easiest to win
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, life on the rails was far more difficult for
black youths. In 1931, nine African-Americans, ranging in age from
12 to 20, got into a fracas with a group of whites, including two
women. When the blacks were discovered by authorities on they
train, they were arrested for trespassing; later, the women falsely
accused them of rape. The nine young men, found guilty and
sentenced to death by an all-white jury, would come to be known as
the ``Scottsboro Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just as grueling for girls and young women, who often
traveled disguised as men. Ten percent of the boxcar kids were
female, some of whom resorted to bartering their bodies for money
or food. One man recalls a pair of girls who ``received 30 or 40
men and boys in a boxcar, some men doubling back on the line.
Promptly at six o'clock, the girls quit, demanded their supper,
divided 70 cents in nickels and dimes, and caught a night freight
for the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is most surprising about ``Riding the Rails'' is how
many people look back on their experiences with a certain
nostalgia. Certainly they recall the horror of being ``hungry,
cold, and miserable, with nobody to help you,'' as one man says.
But for others, their recollections brighten with the flush of lost
youth, and still-vibrant dreams of an unencumbered life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in run-down, dirty cities was worse than being on the
road,'' says Clydia Williams, who began hopping trains at age 7.
``I was never unhappy or lonely when I was riding the rails. I was
free.''

NEWPORT'S FOLK FEST WELCOMES RENEGADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days of a ``purist'' Newport Folk Festival are long, long
gone. ``It can't be purist if it includes us,'' says Jeff Tweedy of
Wilco, which makes its Newport debut next weekend. ``And,
hopefully, we're not the only renegades coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, there are more.
</P>
<P>
   Now called the Ben &AMP; Jerry's Newport Folk Festival, the event
still draws the best and brightest of the acoustic scene, but also
some of the edgiest _ specifically, Wilco with its skewed roots
music; and another first-time festival performer, Steve Earle,
whose folk/country/rock hybrid is laced with socio-politico
overtones; and yet another first-timer, the alluring Beth Orton
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newport is a big deal for someone like me, because I started
out in coffeehouses,'' says Earle, whose protest-filled music is
reflected in his steadfast lobbying efforts to abolish the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of outspoken politics, Earle has few rivals in the
music business, though right up there with him are the Indigo Girls
(Emily Saliers and Amy Ray), who perform at Newport's Fort Adams
State Park on Sunday, the same day as Earle. (Wilco plays on
Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy Ray is one of my best friends,'' says Earle. ``She's
probably the only person in the music business who is as radical as
me.'' (Ray has taken strong stands for Native American Indian
rights and ecological causes.)
</P>
<P>
   The Indigos, as most Newport fans know, have become the virtual
``house band'' of the festival. They've headlined the Sunday end of
the festival for four of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed it last year, but we always enjoy coming when we
can,'' says Indigo Girl Saliers from her Atlanta home. ``We feel
like we're going there as fans, but then we get to play, too. And I
love the physical setting with the boats out on the water. It's
like a summer camp event that we really look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also meet so many wonderful musicians,'' adds Saliers.
``And if you're going to have a sponsor, it's better to be
sponsored by a good company like Ben and Jerry's. That, plus the
fact that you can't beat the physical setting of the boats on the
water in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's folk festival starts Friday at Newport's Hotel
Viking with Cry Cry Cry (featuring Dar Williams, Richard Shindell
and Lucy Kaplansky) and the Nields. The outdoor Saturday show has
Wilco, Joan Armatrading, Mary Black, Beth Orton, Robert Earl Keen,
Catie Curtis, Cliff Eberhardt, and Martin Sexton on the main stage.
Also, Melissa Ferrick, Northern Lights, Tico Da Costa, Respond
(with Merrie Amsterburg, Lori McKenna and Pamela Means), Dana and
Karen Kletter, and others play the adjacent harbor stage, which
began last year and was ``much more successful than we thought it
was going to be,'' says festival agent Bob Jones of George Wein
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night ``Keeper of the Flame'' program (a new event
that may become annual) has Bill Morrissey, Alvin Youngblood Hart,
and Paul Geremia at the Viking Hotel. And the Sunday show at Fort
Adams has the Indigo Girls, Earle, Suzanne Vegas, Ladysmith Black
Mambazo, Susan Tedeschi, Ellis Paul, and Patty Griffin. On the
harbor stage that day: Jennifer Kimball, Stacey Earle (Steve's
sister), David Olney, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and others. (Tickets
remain for all shows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thoroughly enjoy Newport,'' says Armatrading, who returns
after playing the event a few years ago. Most recently, she's been
part of the Vienna Peace Summit with other global figures in the
arts and sciences who are trying to devise peace strategies that
they plan to send to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably don't realize the significance of the Newport
festivals the way I should, but I'm learning about it,'' says
Armatrading.
</P>
<P>
   A quick refresher course: Newport was where Bob Dylan went
electric in 1965, ticking off the purists, but paving the way for
the Wilcos and Earles of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newport means the same kind of thing that Woodstock means,
really,'' says Tweedy, whose group just finished a European tour
with R.E.M. and will start an American tour with R.E.M. soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newport is part of the mythology of music and is a point where
the two paths of folk and rock merged,'' adds Tweedy, who, because
of the legendary scope of Newport's reputation, doesn't yet know
how his group will choose its song list for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always seem to confuse things,'' says Tweedy with a laugh.
``We might do a rock act for Newport, then all Woody Guthie songs
when we're out with REM. We never seem to know where we are. But,
really, maybe we'll do some Woody Guthrie songs at Newport. We're
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acts, like the Indigos, could write a book on Newport at
this point. The Indigos have had many highlights there, including
being joined by Ferron and Joan Baez in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are so supportive at Newport,'' says Saliers, who
feels confident enough to predict that the Indigos will play ``50
percent new material'' this year. That comes from an album that
won't be released until the fall. That's unheard of for most
festival appearances, where fans expect to hear the hits, or at
least songs that they recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The Indigos' new album is tentatively titled ``Social'' or
``Come On Now Social'', says Saliers. ``It's more
contemporary-sounding and has more use of rhythmic loops,'' she
adds, noting that it was produced by John Reynolds, who has worked
with Sinead O'Connor (and fathered O'Connor's first child).
</P>
<P>
   The festival will also see Earle's local debut with bluegrasser
Tim O'Brien. Earle will draw from an album, ``The Mountain,'' which
he made with bluegrass ace Del McCoury. The two were supposed to
play Newport together (and the Somerville Theater this Thursday
when Earle headlines there), but parted ways. Earle says it was
because they couldn't always coincide their schedules, though
McCoury has told the press that Earle was ``a little bit too wild''
for his taste.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport fest also has more of a world music slant this year.
An example is South African a cappella group Ladysmith Black
Mambazo, another first-time Newport entry. ``They don't usually
tour in the summer, but suddenly they were there and we took them
immediately,'' says Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Another world musician playing Newport for the first time is
Tito Da Costa, a Brazilian folksinger suggested by folk patriarch
Pete Seeger. ``Pete popped on the phone and started singing Tico's
songs,'' says Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The old, the new. The political, the apolitical. They're all
headed to Newport this weekend.

DEVELOPING SAVINGS PLAN FOR RECENT GRADUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I just graduated from college and have started my first
full-time job, earning $30,000 per year. I have $6,000 in a savings
account, $1,000 in Fidelity Dividend Growth fund, and $1,000 in
Fidelity Europe. I have normal bills, such as rent, food,
utilities, etc., as well as student loan payments amounting to $200
per month. I would like to start saving a certain amount per month,
but am unsure where to begin. What do you suggest for a strategy?
</P>
<P>
   L.W., Somerville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The first step is to work out a rough but realistic budget,
calculating your certain expenses, leaving some sponge for
uncertainties and luxuries, etc., and ending with a saveable
surplus. You will then want to establish various savings goals.
These might be emergency savings, a short-term goal, such as
purchasing an auto within a year or two, an intermediate-term goal,
such as buying a house or condo in a five-to-eight year time frame,
and the very long-term goal of retirement savings. Then apportion
the amount of your surplus among the various goals.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical that you focus on the word realistic in the
previous paragraph. If you're too optimistic in calculating how
much you can comfortably save, you'll soon find yourself skipping a
payment here and there, and that can become an awfully difficult
habit to break. Better to determine to save a little less and to
stick to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   First in importance is the emergency savings. You have a nice
start there with your $6,000 in the bank. But many people consider
a figure representing six to nine months living expenses as an
appropriate amount for emergency savings, so you will probably want
to beef that account up a bit over time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's the most distant, I think retirement savings
comes next in importance.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, you'll have enough surplus cash coming in to
fully fund an IRA, which means saving $166.66 a month to get to the
$2,000 maximum. If you can afford to forego the tax deduction that
comes with the traditional IRA, the Roth IRA is a wonderful
investment for a person your age since you will eventually be able
to withdraw all of the accumulated savings tax free.
</P>
<P>
   If your company offers a 401(k) program or a similar
tax-deferred savings program, you will probably want to participate
there as well. A 401(k) program is similar to the Roth IRA in many
ways, but it differs in two major factors. One is that the money
going into the plan is deducted from your taxable income, thus
reducing your tax liability. But Uncle Sam will catch up by taxing
it when it is withdrawn in retirement. (He will also tax you and
add a substantial penalty if you withdraw it before age 59 1/2,
except under a few circumstances.) You may also decide to earmark
some of your taxable savings, perhaps one or both of those Fidelity
accounts, as retirement savings as well. I know that retirement
probably seems an eon away at this point, but once you get there
you will have the greatest flexibility in arranging your affairs if
your savings is spread among taxable accounts, tax-deferred
accounts such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA account, and tax-free
accounts such as the Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've dealt with emergency and retirement savings, you can
turn to whatever additional goals you have _ and if you can't think
of any particular goals at this point, you can just create a
general savings category, guessing that you will probably want to
call on this money in the short to intermediate term.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the question of what represents appropriate
investments.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to suggest some funds within the Fidelity family,
since you're already doing business with them. But almost all major
mutual fund families provide similar offerings. I'd begin by
looking at the interest rates paid on your savings account. In all
likelihood, it's a good deal lower than the current 4.8 percent
being paid by Fidelity Cash Reserves. You can open such an account
with check-writing privileges, which will provide you with the
liquidity you'll want in case of emergencies. I suggest you use
similar vehicles for any savings that are likely to be drawn upon
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an intermediate-term goal such as a home purchase,
which you might estimate will come in about eight years, you'll
want to be a bit more aggressive. I'd suggest a fund such as
Fidelity Mortgage Securities to begin such a program. But remember,
when you get within three years of the goal, you'll want to switch
back to the money markets.
</P>
<P>
   (Some people who are more aggressive than me would use a
balanced fund, of which Fidelity Puritan is an excellent example,
for intermediate-term savings. I'm generally against it, and I am
particularly against it in the current market.) For the long-term
goals, think stocks. I'd suggest you begin with the IRA in Fidelity
Spartan Market Index, which simply seeks to track the results of
the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. Don't worry about the current
state of the market. What you will be doing is beginning a long
dollar-cost-averaging program. When the market is high, so much the
better; when it falls, that means your monthly $166 payment will
buy you more shares. The critical thing with a
dollar-cost-averaging program is to stick to it religiously; never
let a sour market spook you, for in the long run, that will be when
you make your best purchases.
</P>
<P>
   I would stick with Market Index fund for four or five years,
building what investors call a core holding. At that point you'll
want to diversify, and probably by that point if you have been
following your savings program closely, you'll know how. But
there's not space here to go into that now.
</P>

BIRTHPLACE OF GOLF MUST DECIDE ON PLANS FOR EXPLOITATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for all needing)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ In the 15th century, there were so many
golf balls flying around the open, windswept fields here that King
James II briefly banned the game on Sundays because his archers
couldn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, it would have been heresy to suggest, as
the king did in 1457, that there were too many golf courses and too
many golfers in the town that is the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what some of the 14,500 residents here believe,
and they have mounted what may be a quixotic attempt to prevent
their quaint, medieval university town from being turned into what
they see as a tacky golf theme park with perpetual gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Monday (Aug. 2), the town's community council will decide
whether to launch a legal challenge to block the construction of a
hotel, two courses, and a conference center on what used to be
Kingask farm, a 500-acre tract that runs along St. Andrews Bay with
breathtaking views of the town and the Firth of Tay.
</P>
<P>
   There are already six golf courses in St. Andrews, including the
proudly public Old Course, arguably the world's most famous, and
the snooty private Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club, headquarters of the
game's governing body. About 300,000 visitors come here every year,
many of them to enter the daily lottery for the privilege of
playing the Old Course. About one in five gets picked.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of golf continues to soar internationally,
there is no shortage of developers who believe that the demand to
play here will only increase. Besides the Kingask development,
there are two other proposals in the pipeline that would add three
more courses near the town.
</P>
<P>
   For Frank Riddell, the mild-mannered chemistry professor who has
emerged as the unlikely leader of those trying to stop the Kingask
project, the implications are stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't stop this one, we can't stop any,'' he said. ``The
town as we know it will cease to exist. The goose that lays the
golden golf egg will be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iain MacKinnon, the local representative of St. Andrews Bay
Development Co., the American-based company that is behind the $80
million Kingask project, the 300 jobs and what he called ``a
first-class facility'' far outweigh claims about the streets and
the Old Course being clogged with more golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell and MacKinnon live four doors away from each other. They
are not on speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this is just a variation on the NIMBY argument,
altered slightly to NOMBN, Not On My Back Nine. But on closer
inspection, this is not just a battle over a few new golf courses
but a war over who owns St. Andrews, and it is a war of epic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   It has split families, made neighbors enemies, and reignited the
smoldering class warfare epitomized by the schism between
university types and townies. It has, says Craig Nisbet, who runs
the weekly newspaper, the St. Andrews Citizen, ``divided this town
like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a small, friendly place, where everybody knows everybody
else's business, or thinks they do. There are two levels of
conversation: public and private. Private ones reveal the extent of
the split here. People's English accents are commented on, as is
the length of time they have lived here. Class distinctions are
held up as either an indictment or validation of character.
</P>
<P>
   Those most opposed to or most in favor of the Kingask
development say they do not want to cast aspersions on the motives
of others, but they invariably do.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the development are derided as hypocritical
snobs who are biting that hand that has long fed St. Andrews. They
are accused of wearing rose-colored glasses, of extolling the
town's university and medieval architecture while ignoring the
empty shops and shabby apartments where students are crammed in to
maximize profits for university-connected landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the Kingask project are dismissed as shallow,
money-hungry Judases, willing to sell the town's character for a
few pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stereotypes, however, are strongly held beliefs on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his modest university office, somewhere between a
driver and a three-wood from the Old Course, Riddell talks
passionately about preserving the character of the town, one that
is as much if not more rooted in its medieval heritage as in its
place in golf history. As chairman of the community council, he has
molded a grass-roots movement that looks at something other than
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews was once the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, and
its university was founded in 1410, the first in Scotland and the
third in Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge. Like Oxford and
Cambridge, the St. Andrews campus dominates the town, its buildings
extending everywhere. Those buildings and other examples of
medieval architecture are already crumbling under the weight of
tourist traffic, Riddell says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fife Council, which represents the region, overrode local
opposition to the Kingask project, pointing to the 300 jobs that
will be created. But Riddell and others accuse the council of
ignoring its own standards on controlling development in the rush
to create jobs. They point bitterly to the fact that none of the
Fife Council members who approved the plan come from St. Andrews.
And they say that because there are only about 650 people in the
St. Andrews area unemployed, the jobs aren't needed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put it in another part of Fife that really needs
the jobs,'' said Riddell.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell bristles at suggestions the opponents are snobs. If
anything, he says, they are looking out for the little guy. He says
the new hotel and conference center will attract mainly rich
Americans whose presence will make it even harder for locals to get
on the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotland is a very egalitarian country,'' he said. ``They're
going to come in here and push locals aside. It's going to create
resentment. The only reason the people behind Kingask are coming
here is to cash in on St. Andrews' name. All this is about is
money. There are things more important than money, such as quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his Jeep wagon, dragging on a Camel and looking out
over the 18th fairway of the Old Course, MacKinnon is candid in
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the accusation is we're trying to make money, we stand
guilty as charged,'' he said. ``What's wrong with that? This town
exists on tourism and inward investment. There is nothing for the
young people here except the hospitality industry. I know because
my two daughters have had to move away to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is not a little enclave, sheltered from the rest of
the world. It has to deal with the real world, real economics. It
has marketed itself as the home of golf, and it has been
successful. This is a project of the highest quality. There's no
public funding. It can only be good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shops and restaurants here cater to golfers, and it
is hard to find people in them who oppose the Kingask project, or
think St. Andrews is on the verge of turning into a tacky golf
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Myles, 38, sells sweaters and other clothing at the
Johnstons Woolen Mills, just around the corner from the Old Course.
Most of her customers are golfers. She thinks the opposition is
small but loud, limited to those who can afford to live with the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 300 more people will hurt the town, but I think
they will help the town,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Taylor, 18, who works at Aikman's Bistro, says he does not
oppose the project in principle, but thinks the process has been
flawed. He sees a generational gap in the dispute, with older
people opposed and his generation ``generally supportive or
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't think the public has been informed
about the process as it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That process is the last hope of the opponents. If they can show
the approval was legally flawed, they could put the Kingask project
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late, however, to stop the development, or repair
the rifts in familial relations. When Ted Brocklebank used the
local paper's letters page to vent his opposition to the project,
his cousin, Dave Seeley, used the same forum to denounce him as a
hypocrite. At the time, Brocklebank was a candidate for the
Scottish Parliament. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``His own cousin attacking him didn't help,'' said Nisbet.
``They haven't spoken to each other for months.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nisbet sees it, ``The arguments will go on for years, even
after the place is up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all golf war stories, this one has legs.

RISING RUSSIAN STAR MUST FIRST REBUILD HIS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Ryzhkov, the political whiz kid of Russia's
parliament, stared bleakly out at his charges, a group of senior
legislators sweltering in the heat of a cramped conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Andreyev?'' snapped Ryzhkov, a boyish-looking 32. The
room fell silent. Men and women old enough to be his parents
lowered their heads like timid schoolchildren. ``Why is it that
whenever we need Andreyev, he's always somewhere else?'' he asked,
frustrated that he couldn't find his foreign affairs expert.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when Ryzhkov, with his clean image and his
thoughtful ideas on how to make Russia work, looks like the kind of
young leader the country needs to deliver it from a wasteland of
corruption, ineffective governance, and public apathy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other days when Ryzhkov appears hard-pressed to
save his own party from self-destruction, let alone solve the
problems of this vast nation. This recent day was shaping up to be
one of those bad days for Ryzhkov and his centrist political bloc,
which was trying to fend off a parliamentary rebuke to its leader
for his role as a Yugoslav peace mediator. If Ryzhkov's party is
going to stand half a chance in December elections, it had to block
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   This is a long way from Ryzhkov's beginnings as a budding
historian in the Siberian city of Barnaul, where he passed time
between classes he taught at Altai State University by fly-fishing
or hunting prairie dogs and Altai tarantulas.
</P>
<P>
   Ryzhkov was thrust into politics in 1991, after he led
opposition in Barnaul to the attempt by Moscow hard-liners to oust
then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Appointed the region's
deputy governor at age 25, he won a seat in the Duma in 1995. And
in 1997, he rose to national prominence when he was elected first
deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ryzhkov is an acknowledged star in Russian politics,
recognized as a talented organizer and eloquent speaker who has
earned the respect of both his ideological enemies and his elder
party allies in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Is Ryzhkov destined to be the Russian statesman of the future,
``the politician of the next wave,'' as one leading analyst calls
him?
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does not make it, Ryzhkov is worth watching. His
views, which combine patriotism and liberal values, exemplify the
way young Russian democrats have evolved from the anti-Soviet,
pro-Western ideological fervor that propelled the democracy
movement to power a decade ago. Then, they supported the radical
market reforms prescribed by President Boris N. Yeltsin's
government and its Western backers as the quickest way to freedom
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ryzhkov is writing a history of the Yeltsin era that
describes a dysfunctional, derelict state run by an erratic and
isolated president, a weak government, and a few entrenched,
cynical cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Kremlin; there is no government; there is no clear
political policy,'' Ryzhkov has said. ``There is only a constant
battle among different groups to control finances. I've turned my
back on all of them and turned to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   He has produced a copy of the campaign platform for the Our Home
party that spells out his vision: The government must help create
open markets, foster effective small businesses and a workable
banking system, create and protect civil society and rule of law _
and then get out of way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the government must be representative, chosen from
among leading political parties in parliament, rather than formed
and run at the president's whim, as in the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Ryzhkov foresees grass-roots parties replacing bureaucracies and
state institutions as the main actors in the political arena.
Naturally, he imagines his party as one of the winners in such a
system. But there is a problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   Created when Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was prime minister in 1995,
Our Home actually is the antithesis of a grass-roots party. Backed
by Gazprom, Russia's powerful gas monopoly and Chernomyrdin's
former fiefdom from his days as Soviet gas minister, Our Home
presented itself as the establishment, a ``Party of Power'' made up
of leading celebrities, business magnates, regional leaders, and
Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
   That approach won it 10 percent of the vote and 60 of the Duma's
450 seats in December 1995, enough to make Our Home the lower
house's third-largest bloc behind the Communists and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
   But since Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin in April 1998, Our Home's
fortunes have dwindled. Many of the party's most powerful backers
have quit. Many Russians blame Chernomyrdin for the country's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often saw in us . . . the party of bosses, cut off from
the people and following their own corporate interests,'' Ryzhkov
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Bending his lanky frame over his office desk, Ryzhkov flipped
though a notebook stuffed with samples just back from the printers
of bumper stickers, baseball caps, pins, pennants, posters, and
other campaign paraphernelia, all decked out with a snazzy logo on
a stately blue background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the color of a party of the people, our people, our
country,'' he told a recent visitor as he showed off the samples.
``Look at that. This is a Russian, conservative blue.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be on to something: The concept that a political party
must stand for something, even if the message is something as
simple as ``conservative.'' In contrast, Russian parties, save one
major exception _ the Communists _ have tended to be built not on
ideas but around the personalities and political ambitions of their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative,'' in Ryzhkov's interpretation, seems to include
a revised view of the Soviet past. He condemns the intolerance,
repression, and crimes of the Soviet regime. But he refuses to see
recent Russian history as an entirely black period, and not just
because his mother was a leading official in Altai's Communist
Party during the Soviet era. There is a pride in Soviet cultural,
scientific, and even political achievements.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Not for anything would I change my fatherland or change the
history God has given us,' '' Ryzhkov quotes from a volume of
Alexander Pushkin, Russia's most celebrated poet.
</P>
<P>
   Russian conservatism also seems to mix Western, neoliberal ideas
and values with other influences. On Ryzhkov's recent reading list
with Pushkin are ``Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents,''
Harvard scholar Richard E. Neustadt's study of American government,
a collection of works by ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-Tse, and a
history of czarist Russia's own brief experiment with parliamentary
democracy at the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   His party's approach is a pretty abstract way of building a
political base, and Ryzhkov knows it. He also knows that, at least
for now, election campaigns in Russia are won not by ideas but by
those who control television stations. Yeltsin's Kremlin has
television stations. So does Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov. But Ryzhkov
has balked at joining election alliances of these power centers.
</P>
<P>
   That stance is unusual in a system where personal enrichment is
seen as a politician's birthright. Ryzhkov has failed to take
advantage of even the legal loot _ a private Moscow apartment,
personal cars, country houses _ afforded members of the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   He has a two-room apartment 45 minutes west of the Kremlin where
he lives with his wife, a law student, and 5-year-old daughter. He
has the use of a car and driver, which he must give up if he leaves
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just not very practical,'' Ryzhkov has said. But
he doesn't like to talk about this subject. ``I do not want people
to think I am a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the new-style politico Ryzhkov and the
old-style apparatchik are evident. Ryzhkov will not say it, but he
knows Chernomyrdin has no inclination for bumper stickers and party
politics. While Ryzhkov was writing Our Home's antibureaucratic
platform, Chernomyrdin was working his way back into Gazprom's
management.
</P>
<P>
   It was late on a recent sultry Friday evening when Ryzhkov
finally put aside the trials of his day job. The Duma was all but
empty; the lawmakers and power brokers had fled steamy Moscow for
country homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ryzhkov looked back on his week. He had found Andreyev and had
fixed that messy Yugoslavia problem. He had seen his new bumper
stickers. He had dictated a few chapters in his new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``wasn't such a bad week.''

JOHN MCCAIN, MEDIA DARLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't news that John McCain is a media darling. Nobody in
national politics gets the kind of adoring coverage in recent years
that Arizona's senior senator gets. ``Good press'' doesn't begin to
capture the gushing quality of it all. ``John McCain Walks on
Water'' was the headline on Esquire's May 1998 profile, and the
editors weren't being sarcastic.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt, no fan of Republicans, calls
McCain ``the most courageous and one of the most admirable men I've
ever known in American politics.'' Mike Wallace says that if the
GOP nominated McCain for president, he'd consider quitting ``60
Minutes'' to become his press secretary. ``The McCain swoon is now
so conspicuous,'' Andrew Ferguson wrote in The Weekly Standard,
``that NBC News, The Washington Post, and other news outlets have
assigned reporters to do favorable stories explaining why the
stories about John McCain are so favorable.'' That was more than a
year ago, and they're swooning still.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this can be chalked up to McCain's Vietnam war record.
He was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and spent 5 1/2 years as a
prisoner of war. For saying no when the Communists offered to
release him early _ it would have violated the Navy Code of Conduct
_ McCain was badly beaten and tortured. He paid a huge price for
his integrity and it is impossible not to respect him for it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between respecting a politician and
falling in love with him. Other senators have paid a high price in
service to their country _ Max Cleland of Georgia left two legs and
an arm in Vietnam _ and nobody writes that they walk on water.
What's more, McCain's life story has its seamy side. The
philandering that wrecked his first marriage, the ugly temper, the
Keating Five scandal _ unlovely episodes that would not be ignored
if his name were Forbes or Bush or Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the press is in the grip of the McCain Swoon.
Some left-wing journalists have pointed to McCain's conservative
voting record and wondered whether their fellow media liberals have
lost their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic's David Grann noted in May that McCain is more
conservative than the man he replaced in the Senate: Barry
Goldwater. He supported the Contract with America and voted to
convict Bill Clinton. He was against the Martin Luther King
holiday, against raising the minimum wage, against legal abortions,
against gun control, against gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is no idol to the right. There is nothing in the
conservative press liked the McCain love-fest in the liberal
mainstream media. His hard-right voting record hasn't dazzled
conservatives, and for a good reason: McCain doesn't want to be
thought of as one of them. He wants to be thought of as a maverick,
bucking his party so he can fight Big Tobacco and reform campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
   On McCain's Web site, you can read about his prolife views. Ask
him about taxes and he'll tell you they should be cut. But if you
don't bring up those issues, he won't, either. He wants to talk
about punishing cigarette makers and _ especially _ campaign
finance corruption. Those are his marquee issues, and they happen
to be extremely popular with the national media. To most
conservatives, they are anathema.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent session with reporters and editors, McCain was asked
where he would like to see less government action. Any conservative
worth his salt has a ready list of wrongheaded federal programs
that Americans would be better off without, from arts subsidies to
racial preferences to the Legal Services Corporation. This,
slightly edited, was McCain's answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the Department of Education, I'd like to see
most of the money go to the states. But I do think there is a
purpose to the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy I think we could examine very
carefully. It was a product of the energy crisis in the 1970s. You
could easily give some of its responsibilities to other departments
of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could more carefully tailor a lot of programs that fall
under the Department of Commerce. I applaud the vice president for
trying to do this `reinventing' of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my conservative friends think we have to spend a lot
more money on defense. I think we have to spend some more money on
some programs, but we're wasting literally tens of billions of
dollars on programs that are only geared to the Cold War. We could,
by restructuring the military, do a whole lot of good things that
would not require us to spend a whole lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would look at corporate welfare. Giving McDonald's millions
of dollars to sell burgers overseas _ the list goes on and on. I
would reduce and eliminate many of those programs. Ethanol
subsidies are around $700 million a year, and most of it goes to
Archer-Daniels-Midland. All the studies show it helps neither the
consumer nor the environment. But that doesn't make me as mad as
the sugar subsidies do. Because the sugar subsidies increase the
cost of a pound of sugar to the consumer by about a third.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that a conservative talking? There is almost nothing in
McCain's reply that Ted Kennedy would object to. (Kennedy's
spokesman agrees.) He may be Goldwater's successor in the Senate,
but McCain isn't running for president as another Goldwater. He is
running as a conservative who has seen the light. That won't fly in
Republican primaries. But the media certainly eat it up.

POLLS ARE FOR POLLSTERS, NOT FOREVER, GORE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the latest polls are to believed, Vice President Al Gore has
a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   While most polls give Gore a substantial lead over former US
Sen. Bill Bradley, his only Democratic rival for the nomination,
the same polls show him headed for a crushing general election
defeat in November 2000 by George W. Bush, the presumed GOP
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one-third of Democratic voters, most of whom voted
for President Bill Clinton, are considering voting for Bush, polls
grimly predict.
</P>
<P>
   But if history is any guide, the problem is not with Gore's
campaign. The problem is with the media's quest for premature
speculation on who will win, and the political pollsters who are
all to happy to accomodate them.
</P>
<P>
   These current polls are simply snapshots of the moment. As past
early polls in previous elections reveal, there is often little
resemblance between what they show and the results on election day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in December 1975, one year after former President
Jimmy Carter tossed his hat into the 1976 presidential race, public
opinion polls had him winning a mere three percent of the vote.
Democratic stalwart Sen. Eugene McCarthy was quoted as saying that
year that Carter was not going far in his quest for the nomination.
Meanwhile, state chairmen and national committeemen predicted that
Sen. Hubert Humphrey would be the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But after winning the Iowa caucus, and suprising ex-Gov. George
Wallace in the Florida primary, Carter's campaign took off.
Humphrey was not in serious contention, nor were a number of other
prominent Democrats by the time of the Democratic nomination.
Carter, of course, went on to win the Presidency over the early GOP
favorite, President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush was seen as
severly wounded by his third place showing (behind Bob Dole and Pat
Robertson) in the Iowa caucuses. Yet only a few days later he
bounced back to best Dole in New Hampshire. From there he went on
to win the New Hampshire primary, the nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the previous presidential campaing most similar to the
current Gore-Bradley battle is the 1984 Democratic primary between
Walter Mondale and Gary Hart. Two weeks before the New Hamphsire
primary that year, polls showed that Mondale had a commanding lead
over John Glenn, then running second, and Gary Hart, who was in
third place. Few predicted that Hart would upset Glenn and Mondale
to win the New Hampshire primary. The pollsters no doubt were as
surprised as Mondale and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   (Hart's later downfall was also unpredictable. It came as he was
discovered keeping company with a young woman, Donna Rice, who was
not his wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore might take little solace in the fact that Carter won the
1976 nomination despite being the early underdog. After all, today
it is Bradley who is the clear underdog in the two-candidate race
for next year's Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Bradley wins a few primaries, some analysts suggest
the nomination is clearly Gore's. One key reason is that the
process for electing convention delegates is largely influenced by
the Democratic Party's national leadership, who are behind Gore. It
was, they say, a more open process during Carter's days.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has a lot of political strength among organized labor
and African-Americans. And he has one of the best fund-raisers in
history, President Clinton, working on his belalf.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that George W. Bush has raised a large amount
of money, and has high-ratings poll ratings, there is one important
element still missing: most voters still don't know Bush, or what
he stands for on many key issues.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush should take little solace from the fact that his
father, far behind Dukakis after the nomination conventions in
1988, was a come-from-behind winner. The moral of the story is that
early leads have a way of evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anything can happen in the course of an election.
Sen. Edmund Muskie lost his chance for the nomination on the day
that he allegedly let a tear fall from his eye as he criticized a
news story about his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Although most polls may be accurate in terms of voters' feelings
at the time they are taken, they rarely rise to the level of
self-fulfilling prophecies. As more information is provided to
voters about the candidates, and as the electorate begins to focus
on the race, opinions change.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of time between now and November 2000 for Bush to
lose his lead over Gore. The voters, in turn, will have all the
time they need to decide between Gore and Bush. And no poll can
absolutely guarantee what a voter will decide behind the closed
curtains of a voting booth.

ILLEGAL BUSINESS VISA USE SEEN AS EXTENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For Alexandr U. Yegmenov, unlike many immigrants,
ethnic affinity had nothing to do with his decision to live in New
York's capital city when he arrived seeking asylum from the former
Soviet Union in the early 1990s. What drew Yegmenov here was a
wholesale scheme to circumvent US immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years before he was caught in 1995, Yegmenov
established an astonishing 4,000 dummy corporations at the New York
Secretary of State's office and used them to help bring an
estimated 750 to 1,000 residents of the fomer Soviet Union
illegally into the country on business visas, many of them
transplanted mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Yegmenov, whose exploits have never been made public, may be
unique. But according to US officials and documents, he is but one
entrepreneur in a thriving underworld that operates on two
continents to produce fraudulent documents that have allowed
thousands from the former Soviet Union to enter the United States
illicitly on work visas. US officials estimate that up to 70
percent of applications for business visas from the former Soviet
Union are fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, federal officials point to three
conspicuous cases that have alarmed law enforcement:
</P>
<P>
   --Three alleged hit men from Chechnya were destined for the
United States in 1994 with work visas arranged by a Falmouth
company, Quartz Sales &AMP; Marketing Inc., which had business
interests in the former Soviet Union. The FBI quashed the visas,
however, after Lech Z. Morawiez, president of the company, received
word that the three men, whom he presumed were engineers who would
help him win contracts in their homeland, were actually thugs sent
to harm Morawiez and his associates because a prior business deal
had gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   --One of four Boston-area men reputed in congressional testimony
to be members of the ``Russian mafia,'' sought a visa in 1993 for a
Moscow man, contending that the visitor was going to work for his
firm, American-Russian Enterprises, in Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Sorkin of Brookline indicated in his application that
Alimzhan Tokhtahounov would be helping him in his import-export
business. However, federal authorities found that Tokhtahounov was
a member of Moscow's criminal underground and associated with
Vyacheslav Ivankov, a Russian mobster who was convicted of fraud in
New York in 1995. The visa application was denied.
</P>
<P>
   --Zhalgas Amanbayev, a businessman from Kazakhstan, was arrested
by the FBI in late December in Boston after paying an undercover
agent $30,000 to purchase two green cards that would have allowed
him and his brother to stay, and work, in the country indefinitely.
After purchasing the cards, Amanbayev said he was interested in
engaging in other criminal enterprises with the undercover agent.
Before he was arrested, he showed he had the ability to launder $10
million in alleged drug proceeds through bank accounts in
Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia, and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The visa fraud problem became severe enough that four years ago,
the State Department established an antifraud force at the American
Embassy in Moscow and assigned State Department and FBI
investigators across the country the responsibility of tracking
down illegal visa schemes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, the investigators reported they had
stopped more than 40 members of organized crime gangs from Russia
and other former Soviet republics from moving to the United States,
Europe, and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is
responsible for reviewing applications by more than 2,000 Russians
and other former Soviet citizens annually for business visas that
will grant them extended stays in the United States. To qualify,
applicants must show that they are being sponsored by an American
company that is affiliated with the firm for which they work in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   One State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
estimated that about 70 percent of the applications filed annually
for the visas contain a significant amount of fraud. In most cases,
the official said, the applicants have no affiliation with the
companies they contend are sponsoring them or the firms, like the
paper companies created by Yegmenov, simply do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The latter proved to be the case last December when State
Department investigators checked out a work visa application for
several Russians who said they were employed by the Moscow
affiliate of Star Freight Services in East Boston. The office
address, 2 Neptune Road, turned out to be only a mail drop.
</P>
<P>
   Those applying from the former Soviet Union are not alone in
engaging in wide-scale fraud in business visas. In May, a US House
committee heard testimony about significant fraud in visa
applications from China, India, and Brazil, as well as Russia.
However, the officials said the schemes devised by people from
Russia and the other former Soviet republics are generally more
sophisticated and the falsified documents more difficult to detect
than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the efforts of Alexandr Yegmenov in Albany to secure
fraudulent visas for those from the former Soviet Union appear
unrivaled. Born in Leningrad in 1957, Yegmenov sought political
asylum in 1990, asserting that he had been persecuted for his work
as an economist for a dissident organization, and even placed in a
psychiatric hospital for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian documents Yegmenov used to back up his claims turned
out to be phony, drawn up by Yegmenov himself, according to the
criminal case filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the least of Yegmenov's crimes: Taking full
advantage of American bureaucracy, Yegmenov created thousands of
fictitious corporations in Albany, and hundreds of others in more
than a dozen other states, including Massachusetts, in an elaborate
scheme to bring Russians and others from the former Soviet Union to
the United States, according to US and New York state investigators
who worked on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing Yegmenov's activities, investigators learned
he was charging Russian emigres as much as $5,000 each for drawing
up the necessary documentation that facilitated their illegal entry
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, investigators found ample evidence that millions of
dollars worth of rubles were also smuggled from Russia to the
United States through Yegmenov's corporations. Tracing the paths of
those who got visas through Yegmenov, investigators found that they
often deposited large amounts of money, in many cases hundreds of
thousands of dollars each, in US banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were either bringing in enough money to establish a life
here in the United States for themselves or moving money here for
someone else,'' said Thomas D. O'Connell, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's lead investigator on the Yegmenov case.
``Whether it was money laundering or capital flight, this money had
no business coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Aleksander Erokhov, had come with sizable financial
means. With the application he filed in mid-1995, Erokhov, a native
of St. Petersburg, submitted bank statements that showed he was
transferring $316,900 to the United States. Before he was caught
and deported, federal investigators said, Erokhov became associated
with the largest Russian organized crime network in the United
States, which operates out of the Brighton Beach neighborhood of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yegmenov, too, has been deported, investigators said
they fear that many of the firms he incorporated are still being
used to funnel workers into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way of knowing how many firms he actually
incorporated, and which ones they are,'' said New York State Police
Captain David L. McNulty of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations
in Albany. ``So even though Yegmenov's been dealt with, we still
don't know everyone who may have gotten here because of his fraud,
or if they're still coming in.''

RUSSIAN REFUGEES SKIRT REGULATIONS TO FLOOD US

   WASHINGTON _ Since 1989, the United States has granted coveted
refugee status to numerous emigres from the former Soviet Union on
the basis of fraudulent documents or unverified assertions that
they were Jewish or evangelical Christians, according to US
officials who have administered the program.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 275,000 Jewish immigrants and 100,000 evangelical
Christians have arrived in the United States despite the State
Department's urging in 1996 that the program be scrubbed because it
was vulnerable to fraud and had outlived its usefulness. Even so,
the Clinton administration, expressing fears of a new wave of
anti-Semitism in Russia, is now poised to ask Congress to extend it
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, amid evidence that many non-Jews, some allegedly with
Russian mafia connections, have manipulated the program to enter
the United States illegally, about 6,000 other Jews from the former
Soviet Union await refugee designation.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its future, the program's past is troubled: It has
cleared for emigration an unknown, but apparently substantial,
number of applicants on the basis of faked documents and little or
no evidence that they faced persecution, according to several
officials who worked in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly was a mindset among our superiors that unless
there was a clear case of fraud or forgery, we were to approve what
was in front of us,'' said Rebecca Fong, a former review officer
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the US Embassy in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 INS internal document, obtained by the Globe, provided no
precise estimate of the number of people who had entered the United
States under false pretenses, but it characterized fraud in the
program as ``astronomical.'' Still, INS officials, in recent
interviews, played down the number of applicants who have arrived
in the United States illicitly. While they acknowledged that many
applicants submitted faked documents, they said most of those were
weeded out during Washington processing before the interview stage
at the Moscow Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 1989 rules relaxation, sponsored by Senator Frank
R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, have focused on the lower
standard for refugee status that was created for Jews and
evangelical Christians from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   While officials privately focus their criticism on the level of
fraud by Jewish applicants over the last decade, in the last year
or so they say they have found an increasing level of fraud among
evangelical Christians. In 1998 for the first time, more
evangelicals were admitted as refugees than Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In other troubled parts of the world, would-be refugees must
show they are being persecuted or have a ``well-founded fear'' of
persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a social class, or political affiliation. But
applicants from the former Soviet Union need only show a ``credible
basis'' for concern that they might face persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Such vague standards left INS employees uncertain what
assertions were acceptable to win refugee status. But they said
they soon learned from their superiors that a claim of a minor act
of discrimination, such as being denied a promotion or raise, was
acceptable, without any need for verification.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the 275,000 who emigrated here through the
program were men, women, and children of Jewish heritage who had
close family members living in the United States and were able to
show they had experienced some discrimination, if not persecution,
in the former Soviet Union, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and Boston have
become major resettlement destinations for the emigres. About
50,000 of the refugees from the former Soviet Union have settled in
Massachusetts since 1983, according to the state Office of Refugee
Resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not on fraud but on how this program has taken
people out of a country that has had a history of anti-Semitic
persecution,'' said Leonard Glickman, executive vice president of
the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which has helped most of the
refugees resettle in the United States. Glickman sidestepped
questions about the extent of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an investigation by the State Department's Inspector
General's office reported in 1996 that fraudulent documentation had
become an increasing problem for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since fraudulent documents can be obtained and category
membership only has to be stated, not proved, it is difficult for
INS to verify family claims,'' stated the Inspector General's
report. ``The increased fraud and the low standards imposed
resulted in people not eligible for resettlement gaining access to
the US.''
</P>
<P>
   While the program initially facilitated the emigration of many
Jews who had been persecuted under the Soviet system, INS officials
in Moscow came to believe that the program should have ended by
1993 because of the potential for fraud, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with White House plans to extend the program through next
year's election, one of the highest INS priorities is how to
prevent fraud, the same issue that arose in 1993 and 1996 when
State Department-led efforts to end the program were beaten back by
Jewish lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to end the program now could prove costly to
Democratic candidates, especially to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
has taken steps to court Jewish voters in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials confirmed there has long been disagreement between
INS agents who process applicants at the Moscow Embassy and their
superiors in Washington about the proof needed to qualify. One
superior, who asked not to be identified, acknowledged: ``I'll
admit the program is more generous than elsewhere, but that's what
Congress mandated.''
</P>
<P>
   Several reviewers complained that their entreaties that the
Embassy take a tougher stand against fraud and baseless claims of
persecution were ignored. For much of the last decade, their
requests that criminal background checks be done and equipment be
bought that could detect forged documents were rebuffed. They said
superiors also repeatedly questioned reviewers' judgment when they
rejected applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even applicants considered extremely suspect by INS reviewers
were ultimately approved, officials said. In many cases, they said,
applicants would claim to have lost their internal Soviet passports
that would identify them as Jewish. Instead, they were allowed to
present other papers, even those that appeared to have been
produced by the thriving fake document industry in the former
Soviet Union, to attest that they had Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program has been documented to be so loosely administered
that it has served as a conduit for the settlement of a strong
refugee mafia to take root in the United States,'' Dan Stein
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, which wants the program eliminated, told a House
subcommittee last year.
</P>
<P>
   Added one INS interviewer, who asked for anonymity: ``The
prevailing attitude was that Congress had passed the . . .
amendment'' loosening the restrictions for Jews to enter as
refugees ``and we weren't to stand in the way of putting up the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   And impressive numbers were reached. At the end of the first
year of the program's operation in 1990, nearly 40,000 applicants
of Jewish heritage were accepted as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard News Service reported in 1995 on the
criticism inside the INS on the program's level of fraud, but
Congress approved an extension of the Lautenberg Amendment the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   While no one would estimate how many residents of the former
Soviet Union took advantage of the program to enter the United
States illegally, US statistics show that few of the applicants
interviewed were rejected. Between 1989 and 1998, more than 97
percent of the Russian Jews interviewed became emigres. About 90
percent of the evangelical Christians seeking admission were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, only about 75 percent of refugee applicants from
elsewhere who reach the interview stage win approval, mostly
because they face the higher theshhold of proving that they face
persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee status is an immigrant's dream: Refugees are entitled to
several benefits, including welfare for eight months, health
insurance, employment services, and instruction in English as a
second language for 18 months, that are not available to foreign
visitors on work visas. And it allows them to petition for US
citizenship after five years.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the rules were relaxed, no one can say for
sure how extensive the fraud is.
</P>
<P>
   One INS executive, who asked not to be identified but is
familiar with the refugee program, said the agency's top tier of
officials are aware that loose standards and lax controls allowed
some who did not deserve it to gain refugee status. Asked how many
came in without proper credentials, he said: ``It's anybody's
guess.''

   SANFORD, Maine _ When travelers stop by Lucas Country Store here
on Route 109 to fill their tanks or their stomachs, they soon
discover that this little store has a lot more to offer than chips
and soda.
</P>
<P>
   First, they notice the life-size mannequin donning an army
fatigue suit, standing just inside the doorway. On the left are
bows and arrows, to the right is Bubba, an inflatable turkey decoy.
And mounted on the wall behind the cash register is a glass case
containing an array of hunting shotguns and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners are shocked at the display, owner David Lucas
said, many unaccustomed to being able to purchase a shotgun and a
sandwich at the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who come in here from all over on
their way to vacations, and they stop in to get gas and can't
believe their eyes,'' he said. ``If they came up here to hunt, they
can get everything: their suit, their gun, and their food all in
the same spot.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Lucas, a licensed hunting instructor, has slowly
integrated his passion for hunting into his jam-packed store, which
is nestled in the town's main industrial park just off the Maine
Turnpike. Hanging over the ice cream freezer are photos of Lucas
with his prey in hand and dozens of certificates from hunting
associations. In the back, near the crackers, more than 450 hunting
videos are shelved on three 6-foot-tall carousels.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the wall of sodas and beer is a large case of rifles and
ammo, along with binoculars and other gadgets for the avid hunter.
Though some visitors may be taken aback, Lucas said the response to
his store has been generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people, especially those who hunt, are not too
bothered by it. Many people from out of town stop in and buy rifles
and shotguns because we sell them cheaper and they get more
attention than at a bigger place,'' he said. ``When they were
putting in the pipeline last year, I sold 30 to 40 guns to the
pipeline guys. They couldn't believe how great a deal they got.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyson Morgan of Boston said that she could not believe her eyes
when she recently stopped at the store with some friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking around and getting drinks and I looked up
and went, `Oh, my God. Are those real?' And then I saw all the
pictures of people with their guns and holding their dead turkeys
and I started scanning the walls for a permit because I just
couldn't believe it,'' she said. ``I've been to Maine, New
Hampshire, all over New England, and I have never seen a random
convenience store sell guns. All I could think of was that it was
just inviting someone to break the case and rob the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he has never had any problems with gun sales in his
store. Like other licensed gun dealers, he is regulated by the FBI,
he said. He also said he has not run into problems with underage or
criminal buyers because most of his customers are experienced
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had anyone try to buy a gun who was turned down by
the FBI after the background check,'' he said. ``We don't sell
handguns, so the bad guy is not going to come here to buy a gun.
He's going to get them out of the magazines or on the street like
bad guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Stanley, president of the Sanford-Springfield Chamber of
Commerce, said the store fits into the culture of this town of
23,000 people in the state recently designated by the Children's
Rights Council as the best place to raise children. He said many
residents grew up hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from here, so the store doesn't really shock me. It's got
that country, got-everything-in-it feel. It's the kind of store you
would expect to find in the boonies,'' Stanley said. ``You might
not see a store like it in downtown Boston, but in a town where
residents grew up with recreational hunting, it's really not that
odd.''
</P>
<P>
   The store will expand in November, Lucas said, because his
U-HAUL rental service, pizza delivery, and gas station are
outgrowing the current space. He said he also will gear up for the
fall hunting season by stocking extra hunting equipment and
teaching hunting safety classes. He said he feels comfortable
selling the guns in his store, more comfortable than he would be in
a larger city where crime is more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have those problems here because we don't have the
crime, and people here are used to guns,'' Lucas said. ``Everybody
here owns a gun and the crooks know it, so we don't have any
problems.''

STUDY ADDS TO DOUBTS ON D.A.R.E. PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, when D.A.R.E.'s new approach to drug education
was just beginning to capture the imagination of Americans, the
city of Lexington, Ky., ran out of funding after installing
D.A.R.E. officers in 23 schools, leaving eight schools to manage on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years later, the children who didn't have the Drug Abuse
Resistance Education curriculum were just as likely to abuse drugs
as the kids who went through D.A.R.E., according to a study by
psychologists at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the latest voice in a chorus of criticism from
social scientists who say D.A.R.E. _ the country's most widely used
drug education program _ has never demonstrated its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But in Massachusetts, at least, the rising stack of academic
criticism has done little to diminish D.A.R.E.'s popularity among
parents or the police officers who administrate it. Although five
Massachusetts cities or towns have abandoned D.A.R.E. in recent
years, and Burlington, Vt., followed suit in May, 93 percent of
Massachusetts municipalities remain firmly within ``the D.A.R.E.
fold,'' according to Sheila Foley, the program's state coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   From the researchers' point of view, that continued enthusiasm
shows Americans' stubborn resistance to apply science to drug
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to people, they say, `My kid doesn't use drugs,
and he's gone through D.A.R.E..' They're not being good
scientists,'' said Donald Lynam, lead author of the study,
published in the current issue of the American Psychological
Association's Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I keep thinking of is if D.A.R.E. were a drug, I wonder
if it could have FDA approval based on its efficacy? I don't think
it could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky results fall in line with an earlier study showing
that D.A.R.E.'s effects were measurable but short-lived. Last year,
a six-year follow-up by University of Illinois criminologist Dennis
Rosenbaum showed D.A.R.E. had a substantial failure rate,
especially in the suburbs. Studies from the University of Colorado
and North Carolina's Research Triangle Institute have drawn the
same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study, from Ohio State University, gave D.A.R.E.
credit for producing students 50 percent less likely to become
high-risk drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decisions about D.A.R.E. are made on the local level. To
the program's defenders, such as Wakefield (Mass.) D.A.R.E. officer
Bob Ramocki, the studies are more than canceled out by classroom
experience. And all the studies have a built-in problem, he said:
How do you measure prevention?
</P>
<P>
   About 12 years ago, the first Massachusetts towns began adopting
D.A.R.E.'s idea of shifting the burden for drug education from
health teachers to uniformed police officers. Using funds from the
state tobacco tax, most towns involved in the program have a
full-time D.A.R.E. officer _ Ramocki even has an office in the
middle school. One positive byproduct, say local D.A.R.E. officers,
is that schoolchildren are on a comfortable footing with the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that when a police cruiser pulled up in front of
a high school, people would think there was trouble,'' said
Sergeant Vin Macchia, a D.A.R.E. officer in Lynnfield, Mass. ``Now,
because of D.A.R.E., they think it's ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ramocki traced the criticism of D.A.R.E. in part to people
who ``don't believe that police officers should be in the school
teaching their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the point, said Joel H. Brown, who heads the Center
for Educational Research and Development at University of
California at Berkeley, and whose 1995 study for the California
State Department of Education took the first serious shot at
D.A.R.E.-type programs. Brown's criticism is not confined to
D.A.R.E., but applies broadly to the zero-tolerance approach.
Educators typically present drugs _ including alcohol and
cigarettes _ as a monolith, overlooking differences that teenagers
realize themselves through direct experience, leading to a
traumatic moment of ``cognitive dissonance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If adults were more nuanced in their presentation, students
would find it easier to rely on their advice, he said. A better
presentation of marijuana, for instance, would mention both good
and bad effects while not condoning its use, he said. ``There's a
big distance between `just say no' and `just say yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And officials in some regions are coming to the same conclusion.
When Burlington Police Chief Elana Ellis announced that she would
discontinue the program in May, the Vermont city joined Omaha,
Houston, and Seattle in the quest for a new approach. In
Massachusetts, Lexington, Bedford, Lawrence, Lunenburg, and Harvard
have also dropped the program _ a trend that concerns Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does worry me, because I'm not sure what the alternative
programs are,'' said Foley.

IN BROOKLYN, A POTENTIAL CLINTON ANNOINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's most crucial ally in her
race for the Senate might end up being a liquor-store owner in
Brooklyn named Mike Long.
</P>
<P>
   Helping Clinton is hardly his intent. Long is New York State
chairman of the Conservative Party. His task is quashing liberal
Democrats, not abetting their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the dynamics of New York politics are pushing Long into
backing a candidate who could draw enough votes from Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani, the likely Republican nominee, to put Clinton over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   That third candidate is Rick Lazio, a Long Island congressman
who, just as everyone was settling in for the Battle of the Titans,
announced he would run for the seat in a Republican primary. Lazio
is being encouraged by the Republican governor, George Pataki,
whose loathing for Giuliani runs so deep that many suspect he would
do anything to derail the mayor's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Lazio loses the primary, he could still be on the
November ballot as the Conservative Party's nominee. He is more to
the party's liking on social issues, and he has been courting Long
assiduously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazio calls me once a week, gives me a little update,'' Long
said, sitting in his party's headquarters above a corner grocery
two blocks from the liquor store that he and his brother own in the
working-class Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Long admires much of what Giuliani has done as mayor. But
Giuliani hasn't called on Long. And the mayor has close ties to Ray
Harding, chairman of the Liberal Party. If Harding puts Giuliani on
the Liberal ballot line, as he did in both of his mayoral
victories, no way would Long put him on the Conservative ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't closed the door to any candidate yet,'' Long said.
``But if we had a convention tomorrow, Lazio would probably get the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma is that Giuliani is widely regarded as more likely
than Lazio to defeat Clinton. A Rudy-Hillary race is widely
predicted to be tight. If a third party grabbed even a few
percentage points from Giuliani, it could toss the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Long has no desire to be a spoiler. ``If Hillary Clinton is the
candidate,'' he said, ``my game plan is to beat her.'' But, he
added, ``The bottom line is we are a party of values. We draw a
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, 59, is a tall, craggy-faced, burr-cropped ex-Marine who
was roused into Conservative politics by Barry Goldwater's 1964
presidential campaign. ``Goldwater was a passion for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party grew out of Goldwater's crusade and the
refusal of the state's liberal Republican leaders, Governor Nelson
A. Rockefeller and Senator Jacob Javits, to join in it.
</P>
<P>
   Long was born in Brooklyn. He never went to college, opened an
ice-cream parlor in the borough's Cypress Hills section, then, in
1982, when the neighborhood went bad, bought a liquor store in Bay
Ridge and moved there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked for anybody in my whole life,'' he said with
a defiant smile.
</P>
<P>
   When he became party chairman in 1988, he moved headquarters to
Bay Ridge. ``I did it because it was much more convenient for me
than going to Manhattan every day,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   New York's small parties have more power than others because
state law lets them endorse big-party candidates. As a result,
though their numbers are small, they can tilt an election. Few
Republicans have won statewide contests without the Conservative
Party's endorsement. Few Democrats have won without the Liberal
Party's. Few Republicans have been elected mayor in New York City
without Liberal backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These small parties, they're feudal baronies,'' said a
pollster, John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has come under pressure from many Republicans to end his
squabble with Giuliani and tell Lazio to get out of the race. Some
think he ultimately will. If he does, some think Long would put up
an unknown candidate rather than endorse a serious spoiler. In the
1997 mayoral election, while Long didn't endorse Giuliani, he left
his party's ballot-line blank to avoid splitting the conservative
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Long says he will not do that in a Senate race. Key to
his plans is the thought that Lazio just might beat Giuliani, and
Clinton, too. ``Any intelligent person will say Rudy's the
strongest candidate,'' he allowed. ``But I always preface that by
saying `today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Long remembers endorsing Alfonse M. D'Amato against Javits in
the 1980 Republican Senate primary. ``People laughed at us,'' he
said, with a little laugh himself. ``Jake Javits was an icon, a
sitting senator. And here was D'Amato, this town supervisor from
Hempstead, Long Island, with no money _ and, by the way,'' he
added, ``Lazio's raised $3 million.'' D'Amato won and went on to
serve three terms.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last week by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute
puts Clinton and Giuliani as dead-even. And it shows her leading
Lazio by 18 points, 50 to 32, even though Lazio has not begun to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant, said, ``If Lazio beat
Giuliani in a primary, he could beat Hillary. He'd have momentum.
Coming from beating one giant, he could go on to beat another
giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Long put it, explaining his refusal to get out of
Giuliani's way just yet, ``It's 15 months till the primary. In
politics, that's a lifetime.''

HOW LONG DOES RADIATION INFECT THE GROUND? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If atomic waste can make land uninhabitable, how is it that
the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were able to continue to
live in those cities, apparently with no ill effects?
</P>
<P>
   A.N., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. During the terrible moments nuclear weapons exploded 1,500
feet above Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and Nagasaki on August 9,
those cities were indeed deadly places to be. But within weeks,
decimated as they were, radioactivity was no longer strong enough
to make them uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radiation is like a light in a room,'' explains MIT Physics
Professor Emeritus Philip Morrison, a key contributor to the
development of the first atomic weapons. ``Turn off the light, and
the radiation doesn't persist.''
</P>
<P>
   Radiation is energy produced when tiny pieces of unstable atoms
go flying off. Those high-speed particles and energy rays can
damage tissue, destroy bone marrow, or damage DNA. They can cause
cell death in the short term or mutations that lead to cancer. The
Hiroshima bomb killed an estimated 60,000 and injured 100,000
others. Most died from the heat and force of the blast but many
were killed by the brief but severe radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
   But think of X-ray radiation for a moment. If you could somehow
set an X-ray machine in a hospital to a high enough power, the
radiation it emits would damage any living tissue it hit. But that
damage would stop as soon as the X-ray beam went off. And the room
in which the X-ray machine had been operating, wouldn't be left
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Just a few weeks after the
Hiroshima explosion, Morrison went there with a team of scientists
to measure radioactivity. He says it was not much higher than
normal background levels caused by radioactive elements in the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic bombs did leave some of their radioactivity behind,
even after the chain-reaction/explosion was over. Fallout,
left-over radioactive particles of elements like barium and iodine,
krypton and cesium from the bomb itself, fell miles away, over a
wide area of forest miles downwind because the blast took place in
the atmosphere. (The bombs were detonated at 1,500 feet to maximize
the power of the explosion, not to minimize the fallout, according
to Morrison.) In fact, the smallest particles of radioactive
fallout spread over the entire earth, slowly precipitating out of
clouds that carried the fallout around the world twice.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was what's called neutron-induced radioactivity. In a
fission explosion, the nuclei of the atoms of fuel break apart.
When they fly off into the nuclei of other atoms, it sometimes
causes them to break apart in turn, making them unstable and
radioactive. Some of the atomic elements in the people, the
buildings, even the dirt in Hiroshima and Nagasaki became
radioactive when their nuclei were hit by radioactive particles
from the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those now-unstable elements, including the fallout
particles, quickly sent their electrons or alpha particles flying
off and decayed into stable, non-radioactive matter within moments
or days. Three weeks after the Hiroshima detonation, Morrison says
the neutron-induced and fallout radioactivity there was very low.
He says the few remaining radioactive particles that take decades
or longer to decay, like cesium or iodine, are fortunately rare,
adding little to naturally occurring background levels of
radiation. And the longer they take to break down, the less energy
they emit as they decay, and the less potentially harmful they are.

PEREGRINE FALCONS RESURGENT AT ACADIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACADIA NATIONAL PARK _ Waiting at the base of Precipice Cliff
for a sign of the endangered peregrine falcon, Richard Reilly
finally spots a speck in the sky out of the corner of his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a falcon moving across the bottom of the cliff face,''
said Reilly, a falcon watcher by day and chef by night, as he
swiftly raises his binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen other people immediately join him in looking
skyward, through their own binoculars or through the scopes set up
by National Park employees Betty Hayes and Jonathan Gormley. They
are all here, at the parking area at the base of Precipice Cliff,
to watch the return of the falcon.
</P>
<P>
   Peregrines, well known for their hunting ability, became extinct
in the eastern United States in the 1960s, largely due to the use
of the chemical pesticide DDT. Despite being able to swoop down on
prey at more than 100 miles per hour, the falcons were powerless
against the effects of DDT on their ability to reproduce, making
the shells of their eggs so thin they cracked before chicks were
ready to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   But with nationwide environmental efforts beginning in the 1970s
and a peregrine reintroduction program at Acadia in the 1980s,
about three dozen chicks have been bred here, either at Precipice
Cliff, Jordan Cliffs, or the Beech and Canada cliffs area. This
breeding season, two pairs of falcons have produced five offspring:
one chick at Precipice Cliff and four at Jordan Cliffs. The chicks
took their first flight in late June.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the falcon in Acadia and the rest of the nation
has, in fact, been so successful that the bird is expected to be
taken off the endangered species list later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting,'' said National Park employee Hayes of
the prospect of the falcon being delisted. While this is Hayes'
first year at Acadia as an intern and volunteer, she spent a part
of her career helping to reintroduce falcons for the nonprofit,
Idaho-based Peregrine Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chicks that have been bred and banded at Acadia have
matured and migrated to breed in New Hampshire, New York, and even
Boston _ atop a 25-story-high window ledge of the Christian Science
Church's administration building. And the male peregrine that is
now at Acadia's Precipice Cliff has successfully bred there every
year since 1991, siring more than two dozen chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous environmental success story,'' said park
ranger Bryant Woods, who is the keeper of the peregrine falcon
slides taken over the years at Acadia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Eastern Peregrine Falcon Reintroduction Program has
been so successful it has exceeded its goal of restoring the
population to half of the 350 pairs estimated to have been present
in the eastern United States in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental issues are not a lost cause. We can achieve
great successes. That's what peregrines in particular mean to me,''
said Woods in a telephone interview. ``It's not just blue-sky
stuff. It'll work if we put our minds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The peregrine falcon stirs similarly strong emotions for the
dozen or so faithful gathered at the Precipice Cliff parking lot
one sunny day in late May. The steep hiking trail up the cliff is
closed until late summer, as is the one along Jordan Cliffs, to
protect the falcons, but the falcon watchers do not mind.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a chef at Cafe Bluefish in Bar Harbor, said he comes as
often as he can, ever since he saw Hayes set up her scope here for
public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we saw a peregrine attack a bald eagle that got too
close,'' Reilly said. Other days, while peering up at Precipice
Cliff, he's seen a goshawk, a sharp-shinned hawk, and a Cooper's
hawk. ``All sorts of birds of prey appear right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Reilly on the grassy knoll on the edge of the parking
lot were Jonathan and Nina Gormley, who brought their
super-magnifying scope to watch for the falcon. Jonathan is
coordinator of volunteers for Acadia, and Nina is director of the
Wendell Gilley Museum, named after a noted bird carver, in nearby
Southwest Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Gormleys are so passionate about bird watching that for
their 20th wedding anniversary last year, they decided ``no
diamonds, no Rolexes. We're buying this thing,'' said Nina Gormley,
pointing to the scope they've just set up. ``It's been great. We
come by on days off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hayes has worked with falcons long before she came
to Acadia, she is as enthusiastic about the crow-sized raptor as
ever. Every work day at about 6 a.m., she begins by setting up her
scope to watch from as far as a quarter-mile away, and taking field
notes.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first human to spot a chick on Jordan Cliffs this
season. ``He was four to five days old,'' she recalled. ``He was
white and fuzzy, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular early morning in late May, she spotted a
mid-air exchange of prey by a pair of falcons, and the feeding of a
chick.
</P>
<P>
   Then between 9 a.m. and noon, Hayes sets up her scope at the
Precipice Cliff parking area, inviting park visitors to look
skyward, and share in her enthusiasm about the return of the
falcon.

GORE SCORES BIG WITH MASSACHUSETTS DONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has tapped the Democratic
establishment in Massachusetts for an impressive haul of money and
supporters, but Bill Bradley's strength in the national race for
resources is reflected in the state as well, according to federal
election reports.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has locked up most of the state's formidable
collection of big Democratic donors, Bradley's insurgent campaign
is drawing money from a wide array of old friends and admirers _
new contributors and Democrats who think the party needs a change
in leadership after recent years of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on his position, Gore leads Bradley by almost
2-to-1 margins in the number of contributors and the amount of
money raised in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has raised $550,000 from 706 contributors in Massachusetts,
according to a computer analysis of Federal Election Commission
records performed for the Globe by the Center for Responsive
Politics, a Washington-based good-government group. Bradley has
collected $301,000 in the state from 374 contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have been active in the Democratic Party and active
in campaigns in Massachusetts for the last decade have a lot of
support for what the Clinton-Gore administration has
accomplished,'' said Charles A. Baker, an attorney and political
consultant active in the Gore campaign. ``The vice president has
been the beneficiary of that support.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deep-pocketed donors and fund-raisers from
Massachusetts are in Gore's camp. Included on this list are the
former party chairman and current Massachusetts Envelope Co.
executive, Steven Grossman; John P. Manning of Boston Capital
Corp.; the venture capitalist Thomas H. Lee; Gerald and Elaine
Schuster, both party stalwarts; Fred Siegel of Energy Capital
Partners; nursing home operator and former DNC finance chair Alan
Solomont; and Viacom's Sumner Redstone.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters, in part by necessity, take pride in the
fact that, as former congressman James Shannon puts it, ``Bradley
money is not Democratic establishment money. These are not the
usual fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people supporting Bradley are people new to
politics _ a lot from the financial sector _ people who feel they
can play more of a role in an insurgent campaign,'' said Shannon, a
leading Bradley supporter in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A former legislator, Michael Harrington, said that Bradley's
Massachusetts backers are an ``eclectic'' group, attracted to the
former New Jersey senator for a variety of reasons. Some donors are
longtime friends and admirers, like MIT's Lester Thurow. Others see
an opportunity to make a bigger splash in an underdog campaign.
Some contributors, former Celtics great John Havlicek, Celtics
coach Rick Pitino, and New England Patriots executive J. A. Kraft,
for example, have roots, like Bradley, in the world of sports.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Bradley's backers, looking at polls that show Gore
running behind Texas Republican Governor George W. Bush, think
Democrats need to move beyond the scandal-plagued image of the
Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mild degree of disenchantment with the existing
order, with the Clinton-Gore administration, though with some
acknowledgment that Gore isn't culpable, just there on the scene,''
said Harrington, a Bradley supporter. ``People are looking for a
fresh face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anybody is specifically against Gore; there
is no sense of animus. But there is definite scandal weariness out
there,'' said Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leads Bradley in the national fund-raising competition,
collecting $19.5 million to Bradley's $11.7 million. But Bradley's
supporters find solace in the Gore campaign's spending habits.
Bradley has been far more frugal, having spent $4.3 million,
compared with $8.2 million spent by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't help themselves. It's the trappings of incumbency.
Fritz Mondale suffered the same thing with Gary Hart,'' said
Harrington of the vice president's campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Among the prominent figures who have contributed to Gore are
former Governor Michael Dukakis, former Lieutenant Governor Thomas
P. O'Neill III, former Dukakis administration officials John De
Villars, Philip Johnston and Nicholas Mitropoulos, and former
Clinton administration figures Stuart Altman, Robert Reich, Thomas
Glynn and Deval Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers with close ties to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Paul
Kirk and Nick Littlefield, gave the $1,000 maximum contribution to
Gore, as did US Representative John Olver, Democrat of Amherst;
Cathleen Douglas Stone; Swanee Hunt; The New Republic publisher
Martin Peretz and and his wife Anne; state Senator Linda Melconian;
and a collection of lawyers, lobbyists, and Beacon Hill veterans
that include Baker, Charles Campion, and Michael Whouley of the
Dewey Square Group; George Bachrach; Cassidy &AMP; Associates
vice-chairman John Brennan; Chris Gabrieli; Thomas Joyce; Patricia
McGovern; and James Rowan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bradley camp, the best known donors and fund-raisers are
lawyers James Segel and Dennis Kanin; developer Ronald Druker; and
Kevin Phelan of Meredith &AMP; Grew, Inc. Democratic national
committeewoman Virginia Allan; Delphi Management's Scott Black;
computer executives Charles Cuneo; John Moriarty and Michael
Daitzman and Fleet Bank President John Hamill. Harvard Professors
Philip Heymann and Cornel West and Staples executive Thomas
Stemberg are also on the list.

WEB TICKETS CONVENIENT, BUT COSTLIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying tickets has never been easier, as consumers in growing
numbers abandon the hassle of wristbands and long lines and opt for
the convenience of purchasing on line.
</P>
<P>
   ConsumerBeat Companies have been selling tickets on the Internet
for years, but the market has exploded in recent months. An
estimated 40 percent of the 100,000 tickets for Bruce Springsteen's
five shows at the Fleet Center in August were sold on line.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, the dominant ticket retailer nationally, had been
expected to sell 20 percent of its tickets on line within three
years, but it now looks like that goal could be reached by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 2.6 million tickets on line at
www.ticketmaster.com in May and June, about 13.5 percent of the
total. That is a 62 percent increase from the 1.6 million tickets
sold on line during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But even as consumers are rushing to embrace the speed and
convenience of the new technology, they are voicing concerns about
the charges and fees associated with this convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Mindy Carmody are a perfect example. Big Springsteen
fans, they pursued tickets for the Boss's August concerts with
military precision.
</P>
<P>
   To get a wristband, Mindy left for the Ticketmaster outlet in
Belmont about 1 1/2 hours before tickets went on sale in June. She
received her two tickets at about 11 a.m. Total time: about three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chris went on line the day of the sale and within 25 minutes had
placed two orders for a total of six tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Carmody acknowledges the convenience of his purchase in terms of
time, effort and reduced stress, but he nevertheless questions the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   For on-line purchasers of Springsteen tickets, Ticketmaster
assessed a convenience charge of $7.50 per $67.50 ticket, a $1.30
handling fee per order, and the cost of the customer's delivery
option.
</P>
<P>
   With his two orders, Carmody ended up paying $45 in convenience
charges and $2.60 in handling fees.
</P>
<P>
   Since he placed two orders, Ticketmaster assessed Carmody two
$10 UPS delivery charges, even though all six tickets were
delivered together. Carmody said he sent an e-mail complaint to
Ticketmaster about the double delivery charges and tried to reach
the firm by phone with no success. The company agreed to drop the
second delivery charge after we called.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the delivery issues, Carmody is puzzled why costs are
so high for those who buy on line. He noted that on line retailers
generally charge less than their brick-and-mortar counterparts, who
face higher overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the computer would be a cheaper option for
them,'' said Carmody, a software designer for Parametric Technology
Corp. in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the Springsteen concert, the $7.50 on-line convenience
charge was identical to the charge for orders taken by phone
operators. The convenience charge at Ticketmaster outlets was $2.05
less, according to company officials, and there was no convenience
charge at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience charges vary by concert and venue. For example, a
$40.50 ticket to see the Allman Brothers Aug. 20 at the Tweeter
Center in Mansfield, Mass. carries a $7.10 on-line convenience
charge and a $3-per-order handling fee.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., the Pasadena, Calif.,
company that handles on-line ticket sales for Ticketmaster, said
its average convenience and handling charge was $6.68 per ticket in
the second quarter. That represents revenues of about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers do not understand where the money goes. The
convenience charges are determined by contract between Ticketmaster
and the venue hosting the event. Part of the fee is paid to the
venue and part to the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Conn, chief executive officer of Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch, said there are enormous costs associated with
on-line sales, including a customer service operation. ``There's
just a whole lot more costs than anybody realizes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmody remains unconvinced. He says there is no way he should
pay more to buy on line than he pays at an outlet. He thinks the
charges have more to do with Ticketmaster's monopoly position in
the marketplace than the company's actual costs. ``They own the
market. You can't get around them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conn and Carmody are probably both right. Ticketmaster's
dominance of the market allows it to charge what it does, but right
now it has a product _ on-line ticket sales _ that consumers are
willing to pay a premium for.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Less Charmin to squeeze
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Whipple is back from retirement to promote a newer and
better Charmin bathroom tissue, but consumer activist Edgar Dworsky
tells us there is now less to squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   A single roll of old Charmin had 280 sheets; the same-size roll
of new Charmin has just 200. That is a nearly 30 percent reduction
even though the price charged by supermarkets like Stop &AMP; Shop and
Shaw's has not changed a cent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the largest percentage-size reductions I can
remember,'' said Dworsky, who has caught manufacturers disguising a
price increase by reducing the size of the product they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. confirm the new Charmin has
fewer sheets per roll but say it is stronger and more absorbent.
``If it's stronger and more absorbent and it performs better, you
would be likely to use less,'' said Terry Loftus, a company
spokesman. Loftus said company research shows consumers needed
fewer sheets of the new Charmin, but he could not pinpoint the
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus also said Procter &AMP; Gamble is charging retailers 6.5
percent less for new Charmin than old Charmin, an indication that
retailers may be using the product switch to pocket a little extra
change.

   I could say you read it here first, but I shouldn't. On second
thought, why not?
</P>
<P>
   Here is my something-less-than-startling prediction, in a column
written in May 1996, as Martha was poised to wrest control of her
media empire from Time Warner Inc: ``I am consolidating my assets
in preparation for the inevitable day when Martha goes public. With
money from both piggy banks, plus whatever I can scrounge from
behind the sofa cushions and the car floor, I should be able to buy
one share, maybe two _ enough anyway to feel I have a stake in
Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it has come to pass. The New York Times reported Friday that
``the doyenne of domestic details'' plans to sell $100 million in
stock in her company Martha Stewart Omnimedia, Inc. The story notes
that the company will issue class A shares, which will have one
vote each, and that Martha will own all the class B shares, which
will have ten votes each.
</P>
<P>
   That's one for you, and ten for Martha. Is it any wonder she's
such a phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   Martha is going public. But how much more public can she get?
The name of her company says it all. Martha Stewart Omnimedia, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Omni-, a Latin prefix meaning ``all.''
</P>
<P>
   As in omnipresent. Martha is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As in omnipotent. Martha is all-powerful.
</P>
<P>
   As in omniscient. Martha knows what we want before we know we
want it. It's the secret of her success.
</P>
<P>
   Until I laid hands on the July/August issue of Martha Stewart
Living magazine, I had no idea that I wanted a set of miniature
butterfly cookie cutters. Now I realize that my life is incomplete
without this ``trio of diminutive butterflies. . . handcrafted. . .
nestled in a tin.'' Only $24. And I must have the coordinated
sanding-sugar set, ``cookies sparkle with our hard-to-find colors.
. .in a keepsake tin,'' just $38. And, of course, the cookie
decorating kit, ``Decorate cookies just as Martha does. . .'' for
$48.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know that I will never decorate cookies just as Martha
does, but, like millions of other suckers, I am not immune to the
allure of gracious living the Martha Stewart way. No wonder she's
coining money. According to the Times story, her company had a net
profit of $23.8 million in 1998, up from $9.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in the history of the civilized world have made more
out of less than Martha. Yet in spite of all her success, she
remains a figure of fun, ``the doyenne of domestic details,'' to
repeat that loaded phrase in the Times story. It must drive her
mad. The IPO is giving us yet another occasion, as if we need one,
to twit her.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial page of Saturday's Globe featured a Danziger
cartoon from the Los Angeles Times, depicting Martha printing up
her own stock certificates and saying, ``Now, we're using a special
all natural ink I've made up from some berries I grew this summer
on some paper I made from a tree that blew down last winter. . .''
</P>
<P>
   We mock Martha at our peril. With her master plan to rule to
world proceeding well ahead of schedule, it's only a matter of time
before we're all working for her, or no longer working for her, as
the case may be. But is it our fault she's such an irresistible
target?
</P>
<P>
   After the big news broke Friday, I spent a feverish few minutes
emptying those piggy banks. The price of one share of Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. has yet to be revealed, but I fear I
can't afford the miniature butterfly cookie cutters, etc. and a
piece of Martha too. Something's got to give. It won't be Martha.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ While the city of Boston was joining its symphony
orchestra in celebrating Seiji Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director
last fall, Ozawa himself was holding quiet conversations with his
wife, Vera, about when the right time to leave would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with my wife about how I wanted to teach,''
Ozawa said in an interview in his home near Tanglewood a week ago.
``I want to help the Saito Kinen Orchestra and Festival grow in
Japan, and I want to guest-conduct instead of attending all the
meetings a music director has to go to. Every year in Boston, my
contract is renewed for another three years; I thought maybe this
September, or a year from this September, would be a good time to
say I would plan to leave in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's decision to accept the music directorship of the Vienna
State Opera came as a surprise to everyone in Symphony Hall, and it
came as a surprise to him _ Ozawa was not looking for another
full-time job. ``I went to Vienna to conduct Tchaikovsky's
`Pique-Dame' right after the Boston Symphony Orchestra tour last
spring. I went on to China, but the orchestra didn't, because the
end of the tour was canceled because of the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. While I was in Vienna, I was approached about
the job, and my first reaction was to say no. But then they changed
many things in order to suit me. As I said, I would never think of
going to another orchestra after the Boston OZAWA, Page N13 &QL; 
Symphony. But before I die, I want to taste more opera, so this
seemed like a not so bad idea after all. It all happened within two
or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's unpretentious home in the Berkshires was the scene of
many family-oriented activities during his tenure as music
director; his children grew up alongside the Boston Symphony, and
Tanglewood was one of the family's favorite parts of the job. Son
Yukyoshi, 24, was born after Ozawa became music director; he is now
a popular actor in Japan, where he's busy promoting his first
movie, which has just been released.
</P>
<P>
   Yukyoshi's basketball court at the end of the driveway here was
looking a little folorn, but the nearby gardens were flourishing.
Ozawa's daughter Seira, 26, did pop downstairs for a moment;
working toward a career as a stage director in opera, she is also a
writer and journalist whose current assignment is to write a story
for a leading Japanese magazine _ the subject is Tanglewood. Ozawa
settled down on a corner of the white living room couch and poured
tea, avoiding the fresh lemon-rind cookies until his interviewer
had seriously diminished the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was thoroughly well trained in music before he left Japan
for the first time to participate in the Besancon conducting
competition in France in 1959 _ the event that brought him into the
orbit of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, because one of the judges
was BSO music director Charles Munch, who invited him to enter the
conducting program at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, however, represented a whole new world to Ozawa when he
arrived in Europe. ``Opera is something we did not have in Japan.
The first opera I ever saw was in Vienna in 1959, `The Marriage of
Figaro,' conducted by Maestro von Karajan. I remember he also
played the recitatives at the keyboard. I was the guest of a very
distinguisehd Japanese lady who had been a friend of my teacher,
Hideo Saito, and she also took me to the Opera Ball. I had to rent
everything I wore, including the white gloves, which I hated. I
didn't even have shoes _ I was riding around Europe on my
motorscooter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first opera Ozawa conducted was Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' in a
concert performance by the Toronto Symphony, during the early years
of his first music directorship (1965-69); he remembers that Reri
Grist and George Shirley were in the cast. His first staged opera
was Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte'' at the Salzburg Festival a little
later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Sleepy Seiji'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because Herbert von Karajan asked me to, but I was
crazy to try it. The previous summer I had been his assistant on a
production of `Don Giovanni' in Salzburg _ Mirella Freni and
Nicolai Ghiaurov were both in it, and that was when they met; later
they got married. I played the piano for the singers and even
conducted in rehearsals because Maestro von Karajan was staging the
opera and couldn't stop directing and working on the lighting. I
did not know how the opera house worked at all. I couldn't see
anything at all because I would spend the morning playing tennis in
the sun and then go into the production, which was so dark. One day
I must have drunk some beer at lunchtime, and everyone was talking
in German and it was dark and cool, so I just feel asleep and
missed a cue. My nickname that summer became `Sleepy Seiji' _
Mirella still remembers that and teases me about it. Maestro von
Karajan was furious with me, but he did ask me to conduct `Cosi fan
tutte' the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa remembers that the cast included Walter Berry and that
Teresa Stratas sang Despina; Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directed. ``This
was the beginning of my life in the opera, and at the first
performance I made a terrible mistake _ I forgot to give the
orchestra a bow, and the orchestra committee came and paid a formal
call on me to complain. I am surprised that they did not fire me.
Some of the players from that time are still in the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ozawa made another important debut, at La Scala,
conducting his first ``Tosca.'' Karajan, who had encouraged him
with ``Cosi,'' knew the pitfalls of Puccini's opera, and thought
Ozawa was crazy _ he even called Ozawa's manager and said, ``What
are you thinking of?'' The manager replied, ``Where do you want him
to learn Italian opera _ in Germany?'' ``I did this,'' Ozawa
recalls, ``because Luciano Pavarotti said to me, `Seiji, you do.'
But Maestro von Karajan said, `Seiji, you are going to be cooked.'
Raina Kabaivanska, who was a very prima donna then, was supposed to
be Tosca, and she was going to wear Maria Callas's costume at the
opening performance, which was on television. But she got sick
during rehearsals, so Eva Marton sang. Kabaivanska showed up for
the telecast, saying `This performance is mine,' only nobody told
me _ I found out when I heard a new voice singing `Mario, Mario'
offstage. Everything in the performance was different from what I
had rehearsed with the other soprano. At the end, I was booed for
the first time in my life. My mother, who had come to cook for me,
thought it was another Italian way of saying `Bravo.' But the
orchestra played fantastic for me, and by the third performance we
had a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has conducted opera since then in Paris, Vienna, and in
Japan, and in 1980 he inaugurated a regular series of semistaged
opera productions at Tanglewood and in Symphony Hall _ among the
works he has conducted with the Boston Symphony are Gluck's
``Orfeo,'' Beethoven's ``Fidelio,'' Puccini's ``Tosca'' and
``Madama Butterfly,'' Mozart's ``Idomeneo,'' Berg's ``Wozzeck,''
Strauss's ``Salome'' and ``Elektra,'' Stravinsky's ``The Rake's
Progress,'' Tchaikovsky's ``Eugen Onegin'' and ``Pique-Dame,''
Honegger's ``Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher,'' and Verdi's ``Falstaff.'' At
the Tanglewood Music Center he conducted Poulenc's ``Les Mamelles
de Tiresias'' and great performances of Britten's ``Peter Grimes.''

WUMB-FM: ITS ACOUSTIC RADIO IS UNIQUE ON THE DIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTER HARBOR, N.H. _ Down toward the bottom of Boston's FM
dial, where listeners graze on British accents and Mahler, WUMB
thrives as America's only full-time folk station.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it claims. More accurately, it is the only outfit that
plays folk music all day long. At night, it offers ``Roots Radio,''
a gumbo of blues, gospel, reggae, zydeco, and world music. Peppered
throughout the week is live-in-the-studio music, with visiting
artists and programs focusing on everything from Celtic music to
bluegrass. For those prone to acid flashbacks, there is the
indispensable ``Grateful Dead Hour'' every Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, there is nothing else remotely like WUMB (91.9
FM) among 24-hour stations in these parts, and, says Shay Quillen,
who followed radio for Rounder Records &UR;  &LR; in Cambridge, Mass.,
``there is no other station like it in the US.'' It is, quite
simply, the keeper of the flame, the link with the golden age of
American folk music of more than three decades ago, when Club 47 in
Harvard Square was full of cigarette smoke and wet wool on winter
nights and the late Tim Hardin played on and on.
</P>
<P>
   That WUMB is the keeper of the flame is both the good and the
bad news. This distinction certifies that Boston is still the
motherlode of folk music in this country. The station plays a major
role in the booming area folk scene. At a recent open-mike night at
Club Passim, the successor to Club 47, 66 people signed up to
perform. Some were appalling, a few quite good, and the rest
destined to play only in their living rooms. But the point is, as
one observer noted, ``It's a guitar farm here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that WUMB is the only full-time folk station in
America. Nationally, folk is a tiny niche market. Folkies, who are
pathological about the genre, remain mystified as to why. ``Is our
taste so esoteric that it doesn't go beyond a small group of
people?'' asks Marilyn Rea Beyer, WUMB's music director. In a word,
the answer seems to be: yes.
</P>
<P>
   Adds WUMB general manager Pat Monteith, ``Folk is still a
four-letter word for some people because it reminds them of the
'60s, a time they don't want to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, that is precisely the time they don't want to
forget. The core of WUMB listeners is a hoary bunch. According to
Monteith, their average age is late 40s: the oldest audience of the
city's three public radio stations, with significant crossover with
WCRB-FM (102.5), the classical music outlet. These aging boomers
are well educated, professionally secure, and, in the words of
veteran folk DJ Dick Pleasants, ``looking for something to feed
their souls.'' They're also desperate to find a musical alternative
to news that doesn't reek of bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nancy Harrowitz, a 40-ish professor of Italian literature
at Boston University and mother of two who discovered WUMB by
accident eight years ago. ``I haven't listened to anything else
since,'' she says. Ditto for Eric Behr, a 52-year-old accountant
from Acton with a wife and three kids who has been listening for a
decade. Both were here on Lake Winnipesaukee last week for an orgy
of folk music called Summer Acoustic Music Week, sponsored by WUMB.
</P>
<P>
   After rediscovering folk, Harrowitz rediscovered her Gibson
guitar, which had been fossilizing in her basement. Last week, for
the third year in a row, she left her family in Brookline behind to
improve her guitar technique at ``music camp'' here. Over 50 other
folk addicts also showed up from as far away as the Virgin Islands
and California to sharpen their skills on the guitar, dobro,
dulcimer, mandolin, and fiddle in sessions with professionals who
teach over a six-day period. (Another 100 will show up for a second
such week, scheduled Aug. 8-14.) Behr has gone whole-hog middle-age
crazy and is putting out his own CD this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While the graying boomers are a charming bunch, they are a
troubling listening base because they will be the next demographic
group to be sporting hearing aids in nursing homes. ``It's not a
real positive,'' Monteith concedes.
</P>
<P>
   It is critical, then, that WUMB increase the size of its
secondary audience _ those in their 20s, who had not yet arrived on
this planet when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969. ``They
really don't understand the '60s at all,'' says Pleasants, the
on-air folkmeister every weekday morning at WUMB and on Saturday
afternoons at WGBH. ``They have no relationship with Eric Anderson
or Patrick Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasants and his on-air colleagues Dave Palmater and Beyer must
program creatively to please both groups. This means playing Phil
Ochs and Sandy Denny for the dinosaurs and Alastair Moock, Lori
McKenna, Ellis Paul and Dar Williams for dinosaur offspring. It
means airing live interviews with visiting artists like Jimmy
LeFave, in from Texas to play Johnny D's. It means placating the
fanatics of each idiom _ say, Celtic music _ who want to hear
nothing but their tunes. It means stretching the limits of the
genre to attract new audiences without alienating its core.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small, loyal audience
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. The station has earned a small, loyal audience
of about 60,000 since it was hatched at 100 watts in 1983, the last
FM station in Boston to hit the air. ``'UMB has perfected the role
of mixing the contemporary with the traditional,'' says Betsy
Siggins, executive director of Club Passim in Harvard Square, whose
roots stretch back to Club 47. ``They have smart DJs and a sense of
history. They know how to program. Their sense of tradition keeps
the younger singer-songwriters coming out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   If no other station plays the volume of folk each day that WUMB
does, there are FM outlets around the country that swim in the same
waters. Chris Smither, the blues guitarist and singer who has been
based in the Boston area since the '60s, identifies a group of
stations known for their creative programming and superior blends
of folk and and high-end rock. He includes in this group the likes
of KPIG in Santa Cruz, KGSR in Austin, WXPN in Philadelphia, WFUL
in New York City, and WNCW at Isothermal College in Spindale, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Many fall under the umbrella of ``AAA music,'' the
adult-album-alternative moniker invented early this decade. Others
are predominantly ``Americana,'' known to many as alternative
country music. Kent Zimmerman, a senior editor at Gavin, the weekly
trade magazine for the radio and music industries, calls this
``country music played by guys without hats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other stations doing very similar stuff,'' maintains
Smither. What's more, he adds, no one knows what constitutes folk
anymore anyway. ``It is a meaningless word at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Beyer. She argues that none of the AAA stations
would touch hard-edged stuff like the ``No Apologies'' cut from
Joni Mitchell's new album, about the failure of the US Marines to
apologize after the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa in 1995.
``I can't imagine an AAA station playing that,'' says Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pleasants and Palmater find a lot less politics marbled
into today's folk menu. ``Politics ceased to exist in the 1980s,''
says Pleasants. ``Ronald Reagan turned a lot of us into economic
people. There should have been a lot more anti-Reagan material, and
there wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inoffensive offerings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Smither believes the music on WUMB has become harder-edged
over the past year or so, others still find it white bread. ``Folk
radio has bitten off far more than it can chew,'' says Peter
Johnson, a local folk singer who performed in the '60s and '70s.
``It's a big bland soup now, whereas the old stuff was very
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmater agrees, up to a point. ``I think that's a valid shot,''
he says. ``Some of the music today is thin gruel. But then you
don't have a president trying to get them killed by drafting
(them). And we aren't actively fighting in a civil rights struggle
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   WUMB survives on a shoestring annual budget of about $1 million
of which $350,000 comes from listener memberships and donations.
The other funding comes from the Corp. for Public Broadcasting
($130,000), grants and corporate sponsorships ($75,000), and the
rest from UMass (including overhead).
</P>
<P>
   The station broadcasts from cramped facilities in the bowels of
the Healey Library on the Univeristy of Massaschusetts-Boston
campus in Dorchester. To survive, it must expand its audience. But
it has been locked at 1,000 watts since 1985 because there is no
more space on the airwaves. Still puny against the 40,000 watts at
WBUR-FM (90.9) and 100,000 watts at WGBH-FM (89.7), it has had to
enlarge its listening base piecemeal by adding repeater stations.
Thus far, it has forged links with WBPR-FM near Worcester, WFPB-FM,
Falmouth (both at 91.9), and WFPB-AM (1170), a tiny outlet in
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   One hope is the Internet. WUMB may decide to use its Web page to
air its music to anyone with a computer. At the moment, the audio
web quality is not great _ roughly equivalent to AM radio. ``But
there is every indication that within a year, we can be pretty
close to stereo quality,'' says Monteith. Her listeners appear
amenable. Last year, the station asked via its Web page if its
audience would listen to it on the Web if available. Most of the
500 people who responded within 48 hours said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a lot of aging boomers dismayed with FM radio these
days head for it like Pavlov's dogs. Be it ever so humble, there is
no place like home.

NOT EVEN SHAKESPEARE CAN SAVE THIS `DREAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES ON DVD AND VHS: ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' _ Not
even Shakespeare can save this. It's a purely superficial rendition
of the master's comedy. If you're really interested, check out Max
Reinhardt's 1935 version, with James Cagney as Bottom and Mickey
Rooney as Puck. Sure it's cut, and it's over the top _ but unlike
the '99 version, it isn't dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Professionals'' _ Writer-director Richard Brooks's ode to
the last days of cowboy macho features great performances by Lee
Marvin and the most underrated movie star of all time, Robert Ryan.
The vistas are spectacular in the wide-screen DVD format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' (1963) _ Forget the high-tech, low-imagination
version in theaters now. Be an old fogy and rent Robert Wise's
brilliant adaptation of Shirley Jackson's story, ``The Haunting of
Hill House.'' Julie Harris and Claire Bloom are magnificent in one
of the most chilling ghost stories ever filmed. It also has a
quality that eludes most contemporary films _ a subtext.
</P>
<P>
   WHO FRAMED HIM? While there won't be any additional major
features included, Buena Vista Home Video is releasing the vastly
underrated Los Angeles satire ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' on DVD on
Sept. 28. The 1988 comedy is a marvelous blend of live action and
animation and features some wonderful inside jokes about other
movies _ including ``Chinatown'' and ``The House of Wax.''. . .
``Yellow Submarine,'' the Beatles' bright and peppy animated film,
is being reissued on VHS and coming to DVD for the first time on
Sept. 14. Terrific songs and a behind-the-scenes featurette are
included on the DVD.

   ! 1/2 ``Deep Blue Sea'' Dumb ``Jaws'' wannabe, with better

brains, thanks to careless scientific experimentation, regard a
floating lab full of scientists as sushi-to-be and start chomping.
(R) &QL;

!!! ``Hands on a Hardbody'' Surprisingly affecting documentary
beneath the carnival exterior of a 1995 endurance contest staged by
an East Texas Nissan dealer, who promises to give away a truck to
the contestant who can keep at least one hand on it the longest.
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Runaway Bride'' With her fleeing skills intact, Julia Roberts
segues from ``Notting Hill'' without missing a step. That was an
engaging and skillfully made factory object, and so is this one.
Roberts plays the altar-shy one with disarming comic goofiness.
Richard Gere brings finesse to his role of hotshot newspaperman who
can't help falling for her. Predictable, but it's a warm, appealing
throwback to old screwball newspaper comedies _ and a lot easier to
take than their ``Pretty Woman'' matchup. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``A Stranger in the Kingdom'' It's actually three strangers,
two African-Americans and a Canadian, who descend upon Vermont's
Kingdom County in 1952. Their arrival is met with fights, gunshots,
attempted rape, and ultimately murder. Under Jay Craven's
direction, the actors give their characters strong, believable
personalities that make you stay with the story (adapted from a
Howard Frank Mosher novel) even when it lags. (R) (Vanessa E.

NEW MAGAZINE TALK BEGINS UPSTREAM SWIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Here's my baby,'' announces Tina Brown as she
thumbs through the freshly minted Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cooing or gushing over the 255-page arrival adorned
with a relaxed Hillary Clinton, affable George W. Bush, and
smoldering Gwyneth Paltrow on its cover. That does not fit the cool
and crisply British style of the world's preeminent celebrity
editor. But make no mistake. The Talk magazine that will appear on
major newsstands starting Tuesday is something the literati and
glitterati have been breathlessly anticipating ever since Brown
walked away from The New Yorker last summer to join the Disney
media empire.
</P>
<P>
   The hype has been extreme. The (London) Independent has called
Talk ``the media event of the year, if not the decade.'' Every
aspect of the enterprise _ from the decor of the offices to whether
Brown used a car service to ferry manuscripts to a Long Island
consultant _ has been fodder for feverish speculation. Amplifying
all this is Brown's grudgingly admired reputation as the ``Queen of
Buzz'' who commands more attention than her magazine's subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it were not thus,'' she says, somewhat unconvincingly.
But ``I've come to recognize that you have to have an identifiable
name attached to the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is much more than buzz at stake here. Since few new
general-interest magazines have been successful since People's
debut in 1974, Don Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers
of America, compares Talk to ``the launch of a new broadcast
network on television.'' And with Americans too ``time starved'' to
read seriously, he warns, Talk is ``swimming against the stream and
going against the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bucking every trend,'' acknowledges Brown. ``You know
something? We bucked the trend at Vanity Fair. Then we carved out
this audience simply by being as entertaining as we could be.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Brown plans to confound conventional wisdom with what
she calls ``a kind of postmodern Life magazine and Look magazine
with a hint of Europe and a dash of the glossy'' for readers
``similar to an audience that will go to `Shakespeare in Love' or
`Pulp Fiction.' '' In this era of corporate ``branding,'' it's no
surprise that those two movies _ the former of which won Paltrow
her Oscar _ are products of Talk owner Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Talk has the expected lush graphic quality, but a
suprising mix of celebrity and the serious, of eye-candy and gray
matter. The first issue segues from Paltrow's sexpot poses to an
account of the slaughter of tourists in Uganda. It takes readers
from a star-studded Vegas bout to a last-chance Virginia trailer
park. And Brown says Hillary Clinton's confessional will reinforce
conflicting truths that ``this woman has been through a tremendous
amount'' but still has ``a deep and lasting bond'' with her
straying husband. (The First Lady's remarks on her marriage managed
to get the Talk piece into news stories Sunday.) In this magazine,
the bad and the beautiful, the ugly and elite are mixed and stirred
together.
</P>
<P>
   With an initial target circulation of 500,000, Talk has already
signed up 100,000 subscribers and sold nearly 450 ad pages for the
first four issues. But when the first wave of hype fades, will Talk
be too eclectic, too ambitious, too wrong for the times? Or will
Brown's magic strike again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never not been commercial. I've always had sales
success,'' says a confident Brown, before quickly adding a
disclaimer. ``There is always a first time when I could not.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown's reputation for turning the Zeitgeist into circulation
was built at Vanity Fair, where she put a nude and pregnant Demi
Moore on the cover and tripled readership during her 1984-92 tenure
as editor. At The New Yorker, she gained readers and enraged
traditionalists by doting on popular culture. Circulation grew from
500,000 to 800,000, but the red ink kept flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brown seems revitalized by a new start. ``I think I've been
happier in the last year than I have been since I launched the
Tatler 20 years ago,'' she says. ``I wanted to do a magazine that
was much more visual. . . . What we're trying to do is vary the
reporting and longer pieces with splashes of visual excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter means an unabashed celebration of beautiful people. A
photo essay of a model partying at a title fight is, in Brown's
words, ``a real high-low romp'' celebrating the irony of ringsiders
in their fanciest duds ``seeing people getting half killed.''
Photos of actor Rupert Everett playing out his fantasy role as
``The Bisexual 007'' are bound to raise eyebrows. And Paltrow _
posing as Jane Fonda's ``Barbarella'' or in Charlotte Rampling's
role in ``The Night Porter'' _ transforms her image from PG-13 to
NC-17. ``Obviously, you've not seen Gwyneth Paltrow like that,''
says an approving Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``the whole magazine has the feel of getting up
close and intimate with people,'' Brown promises that the Lucinda
Franks story on Hillary and Tucker Carlson's look at George W. will
portray both subjects in a candid, fresh light. And yes, there are
some hastily procured childhood photos of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine's fate may hinge on the territory between
bigfoot profiles and celebrity flesh. In the first issue, there are
off-the-beaten path pieces on the murders of young women in the
border town of Juarez, Mexico; life in the trailer park; the diary
of an emergency room doctor; and the African safari slaughter. The
widely expected celebrity writers include author and editor Michael
Korda on country living and playright Tom Stoppard on discovering
his Jewish roots.
</P>
<P>
   The record is mixed on the articles available for prepublication
review. The emergency room diary is a journalistic shot of
adrenaline. But the pieces on Juarez and the trailer park are too
glancingly observational with more attitude than intimacy _ a
potential problem for a magazine that promises to make you ``the
fly on the wall'' in contemporary culture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brill, who unveiled his Brill's Content magazine last
year, says Brown should expect bad early reviews. ``So many
journalists are jealous of Tina,'' he says. ``She's gonna take a
lot of hits _ and if she's smart, she'll ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows the long knives are out, telling her staff to
consider the launch ``pretty much a Hell's Angels initiation
ceremony.'' Functioning under the type of budgetary restraints that
did not fetter her at Vanity Fair or The New Yorker, she has filled
many of the top posts on her staff with emigres from places like
the Jewish weekly the Forward, the New York Press, and Legal Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started from scratch,'' says Talk president Ron Galotti.
``But there is something wonderful we've done. There were no
phones, pencils, or people, just Tina Brown and Ron Galotti.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. There are Talk's muscular media partners _
Miramax and Hearst _ and the opportunities for serious corporate
synergy. That will kick in as early as Wednesday when Brown shows
up on corporate cousin ABC's ``20/20'' program to be interviewed by
Diane Sawyer. And film fans who pick up Miramax releases at the
local video store can now watch a Talk promo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no synergy without the magazine,'' insists
Galotti.``First and foremost we had to create a magazine.'' Until
now the Brown-Galotti creation has been under wraps, but even
admirers voice some broad skepticism about the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Tina is a brilliant and accomplished editor with a
great sense of popular taste,'' says Norman Pearlstine, the Time
Inc. editor in chief. But he believes it may be tough ``trying to
go to a niche between Vanity Fair and The New Yorker . . . given
the sort of so-so financial performances of both over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill adds, ``In theory, launching a new general-interest
magazine does not sound like a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown seems unfazed by these concerns. But she does bristle when
asked whether our star-gazing '90s culture really needs another
publication celebrating the rich and famous. Talk covers the
``times we live in. It covers places, politics, and people,'' she
counters, a tad testily. `It's not about celebrity, really.'' But
if Talk is to talk the talk and walk the walk, much depends on the
celebrity at the top of the masthead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina is going to make that (magazine) do something,'' ventures
Steve Douglas, a partner in the Douglas Jones magazine consulting
company. ``The question is: `Is the world going to come to her one
more time?' ''

FRANK RENZULLI: FROM `EASTIE' TO `THE SOPRANOS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Frank Renzulli is sitting in Lenny's on Meridian
Street in East Boston. Al Sacramone, Lenny's owner, is plying him
with a cold drink and a steak and cheese sub while Renzulli is
basking in his newfound celebrity as the Emmy-nominated
co-executive producer and writer for ``The Sopranos.'' One of his
scripts, ``Nobody Knows Anything,'' earned one of an unprecedented
16 Emmy nominations for the hit HBO series.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ciota, director of ``North End,'' whose brother, Joe, has
written a script about an Italian guy from Harvard who moves to
Italy to coach a small-town football team, is across the formica
table from Renzulli. And they're talking shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's a nutty business,'' says Renzulli. ``Of
course, it's crazy. We're in it. It has to be nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli, a former actor (you might recognize him as one of the
brothers who tries to kill Woody Allen in ``Broadway Danny Rose''),
is riding high. There's no hotter show than ``The Sopranos,'' and
Renzulli is taking full advantage of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he says. ``A golden opportunity. The
magic dust sprinkles down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns his attention to the menu. ``Doesn't anyone here
know how to spell?'' he asks, pointing to some ``breekfast''
specials and ``Lenny's'' spelled ``Lennie's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it is. You know how to say it,'' Sacramone
banters back, sounding very much like one of Renzulli's characters.
``You know how to eat for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   When Renzulli was growing up in East Boston's Maverick Housing
Project, he had no idea what an Emmy was. He was just trying to
stay out of trouble. Actually, that's not quite true. Trouble
wasn't the problem. Getting caught was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have to steal this stuff,'' says Renzulli, referring
to the juicy sub, recalling his days on the streets. ``I was bad.
Unless you've grown up in the projects, you don't have any idea how
it is. It's like growing up in a communist society. You can't do
anything without the Man. No individuality. All the apartments are
the same. You can't do anything without permission. You're always
afraid you're going to get thrown out. It's terrible. And my father
was never there. My mother did it herself. And she was tough.
Twenty-three years in a housing project. No idiosyncrasy in the
projects. And everyone got picked on _ too fat, too skinny,
Italians, Irish, black, white. It didn't make no difference. But we
were all together under the skin because it was the projects.
Anyone who grew up in the projects knows I'm telling the truth. It
never changes.''
</P>
<P>
   And school wasn't any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took four years of shop at East Boston High School and was
lucky to escape with my fingers,'' says the 1975 graduate, putting
the finishing touches on the sub. ``I was attracted to drama and
comedy, and I thought about being a singer. I'm friends with Lou
Christie, you know, `Lightnin' Strikes.' So, I went to see the
guidance counselor, Mr. McNiernan, and told him what I wanted to
do. Honest to God. The first thing he says to me is, `Frankie, do
you know how much a welder makes?' When I tell him that I'm not
that interested, he says to me, `Did you ever think about tile
work? Italians and Irish are very good with tile.' So I joined an
acting workshop and they gave me all this `Now is the winter of our
discontent' and all I wanted to be was like the Jackson Five.
Anyway, I'm on my last bottle of Pierre Cardin and my blow-dryer's
out of whack. I decided to move to New York. I moved to New York
and lived for 2 1/2-3 years in the YMCA. A place where I never once
witnessed a Christian act.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli took some acting classes and worked odd jobs, and he
started to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor I had plenty of opportunities to play Mafia
characters in Mafia shows,'' he says. ``The image of
Italian-Americans in most shows is horribly insulting. I was sick
of that. Every role I was ever offered was `Johnny, get the car.' I
really couldn't stand all that goombah stuff. I knew it could be
better. That's one of the reasons I started writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wrote stuff down that happened to me,'' he says. ``And
people seemed to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli, who played Kenny Tripp, the Boston pimp, on David E.
Kelley's ``The Practice,'' also wrote a pilot for Kelley's
production company called ``Deer Island,'' set in the prison, that
didn't get picked up.
</P>
<P>
   After writing for ``The Wonder Years'' and developing a show
called ``Maverick Square,'' which also didn't get picked up,
Renzulli got the call that changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, his agent sent him a script for ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I wasn't interested in any of it,'' he says. ``It
was the same old crap. That's what I thought. But I was wrong.
Slowly, it started grabbing me because it was so different. It had
a foundation to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli met with ``Sopranos'' creator David Chase after being
recommended by Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked. And talked. And talked. And drank wine. And talked.
Actually, I talked,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After the conversation, Chase called Kelley and asked one
question about Renzulli _ ``Can I spend hour after hour after hour
in a room with this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He might regret it,'' Renzulli laughs. ``But I don't think so.
But it is hard for me to be in a room and not talk. Hey, I'm
Italian. That writers' room on `The Sopranos' is just like it used
to be on `Dick Van Dyke,' with Morey Amsterdam and all them sitting
around acting crazy. It's a room full of psychotics. David, me,
Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess. They should fly in a team from
Vienna.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached on the set of ``The Sopranos,'' Green concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank's incredibly gifted,'' said Green, who formerly worked
on ``Party of Five'' and graduated from Brown University. She grew
up in Providence and recalled discussing her early years with
Renzulli. ``Frank was very impressed that I knew Raymond Jr.,'' she
said, referring to the last of the legendary Patriarca family, long
associated with the New England mob. ``I remember our first meeting
with Frank. He just talked and talked. I wondered whether he would
ever shut up,'' she said. ``But it's great because he writes the
way he talks except that he's able to put it into a form. And Frank
had the greatest gift of all . . . poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli won't divulge anything about the upcoming season of
``The Sopranos,'' which is currently shooting in New Jersey. But he
is looking toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great show and they're great people,'' he says. ``But I
won't be happy until I have my own show on the air and we shoot it
in Boston. About the people I know. On the streets where I lived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you done with that sandwich?'' intones Sacramone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You in a hurry? You going someplace?'' asks Renzulli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who you talking to like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You better watch yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Renzulli turns to Ciota.
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard is this?'' he said. ``It's like a Scorsese movie.
It's great being home.''

NIXON KNOCKOFFS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It didn't start with Watergate,'' proclaimed a mid-'70s bumper
sticker much favored by supporters of Richard Nixon. Nor did the
love affair (if that is the term) between Hollywood and the 37th
president of the United States start with the comedy ``Dick''
(opening Wednesday), in which Dan Hedaya plays a certain well-known
unindicted coconspirator having to deal with a pair of White
House-wandering teens in the impeachment summer of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship even predates Oliver Stone's 1995 biopic.
Nixons and Nixon knockoffs have been skulking their way across the
screen for almost four decades now.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the wonders of news footage, Nixon himself has enjoyed
the occasional movie cameo. Tom Hanks informs him of the delights
of the Watergate Hotel in ``Forrest Gump'' (1994). ``Shampoo''
(1975) takes place on Election Day 1968, which means Nixon's
televised image presides as an unlikely master of the Hollywood
Hills revels. And his dank, dark presence suffuses ``The Ice
Storm'' (1997), set five years later, a few weeks after the
Saturday Night Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robertson was the first actor to play a recognizably
Nixonian politician, as Joe Cantwell, an at-any-cost presidential
candidate who's running against Henry Fonda's Adlai Stevenson
look-alike in ``The Best Man'' (1963). The role came only a year
after Robertson played John F. Kennedy in ``PT 109.'' Did anyone
consider a one-man show about the 1960 presidential debates?
</P>
<P>
   Almost as disconcerting a role reversal was the casting of Jason
Robards as one ``Richard Monckton'' in the 1977 ABC miniseries
``Washington: Behind Closed Doors.'' Whenever Robards is on-screen,
the association with his Oscar-winning turn as Ben Bradlee in ``All
the President's Men'' (1976) is as unshakable as it is unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   If for Robertson and Robards the primary difficulty in playing
Nixon is the memory of roles past, for everyone else it's the role
itself. Imitate Nixon too closely and the performance becomes
mimicry; conversely, fail to imitate him enough and the portrayal
lacks verisimilitude. And if overfamiliarity weren't enough of a
problem, there's incongruity, too. It's the theatrical version of
the basic contradiction that underlay Nixon's career: how to play a
star so utterly lacking in star power.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon intuitively understood _ and took solace in? _ his
inherent unplayability. John Ehrlichman, his chief domestic
adviser, noted once how reluctant his boss was to have his portrait
done. Nixon would invariably joke ``about the hard job an artist
had in making him look good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that the greatest portrayal of Nixon is
primarily vocal: James Maddalena's magnificent rendering of the
title role in John Adams's opera ``Nixon in China.'' Or that what
is arguably the best film portrayal should come from a woman,
Glenda Jackson in ``Nasty Habits'' (1977). She, at least, doesn't
have to worry about whether her five o'clock shadow is thick
enough. Based on Muriel Spark's Watergate allegory, ``The Abbess of
Crewe,'' the film is also unique for showing Nixon as he liked to
see himself: decisive, commanding, unflappable. It's at the
opposite extreme from how Hollywood usually presents him, as
malevolent buffoon or hopeless loser.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in ``Dick'' Hedaya has the advantage of playing him as
explicitly farcical. The great danger for an actor with Nixon is
forcing the laughs. The enduring fascination of the man springs in
large measure from the way someone so unrelentingly grim always
threatened to collapse into ludicrousness. Giving Nixon a shove in
that direction, however irresistible the urge, is invariably
disastrous _ witness Beau Bridges in the 1995 TNT movie ``Kissinger
and Nixon,'' or Bob Gunton in Showtime's ``Elvis Meets Nixon''
(1997).
</P>
<P>
   Spending all his time offering cocktails or talking in football
jargon, Bridges behaves with a manic oafishness that makes Ron
Silver's Kissinger look like Cary Grant by comparison. Gunton is,
if anything, worse. The one advantage afforded by Nixon's
familiarity is that, all else failing, an actor can always fall
back on caricature. But Gunton neither looks, sounds, nor even
moves like Nixon. Contrast this with Rip Torn in CBS's ``Blind
Ambition'' (1979), who nicely captures the silent scream that was
Nixon's body language. It's a surprisingly subdued performance from
one of Hollywood's great scenery chewers.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for some semblance of success at bringing off
Nixon lies in underplaying. That's the route Peter Riegert follows
in ``Concealed Enemies,'' a 1984 ``American Playhouse''
dramatization of the Alger Hiss case. The only thing detectably
Nixonian about Riegert's performance, aside from a darkening of his
eyebrows, is a tightness in the shoulders and his mechanical hand
gestures while speaking in public (chopping the air, punching his
right fist into his left palm).
</P>
<P>
   Even though underplaying is not the route Philip Baker Hall
follows in Robert Altman's ``Secret Honor'' (1984), there are
moments when his Nixon comes alive. If Torn captures Nixon's
tortured body language, Hall inhabits it. In our first glimpse of
him, on a television monitor, the resemblance is eerie. Not even
Nixon himself, perhaps, has more memorably displayed the sense of
cramp that afflicted his every motion, as if each appendage were
only a spasm away from starting to move of its own free will.
</P>
<P>
   The great drawback to Hall's performance is his voice. Its
gargly timbre sounds far more like George C. Scott than like
Richard M. Nixon. Voice, or rather accent, is only one of the
problems that dog the portrayal by the most famous screen Nixon,
Anthony Hopkins. The plumminess of his vowels keeps floating away
from San Clemente and heading toward some vaguely Welsh
destination. True, Hopkins has the gestures down cold _ the hunched
shoulders, the cemented-in elbows, the spastic motions _ but that
only emphasizes how much his performance is ultimately a
caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that would have surprised Nixon. He had no illusions
about what he _ or even his most famous rival _ might expect at the
hands of the director behind Hopkins's performance. When an aide
mentioned that she'd gone to see ``JFK,'' Nixon was dumbfounded.
``Why would you give Oliver Stone $7 of your money?'' he asked.

THE NEAR-PERFECT END OF KUBRICK'S ODYSSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the trees that have been sacrificed on ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' very little has been written about how this movie fits into
Stanley Kubrick's career. With a few exceptions it has been treated
by those who both love and loathe it as if it was Kubrick's sex
movie before he could get back to what presumbably would have been
his final masterwork, ``A.I.,'' the science fiction movie about
artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why so many people find the film frustrating
viewed on its own _ its deliberate pace, for one thing, is so out
of step with contemporary filmmaking. (Of course, some of us view
that as a positive.) But seen in the context of Kubrick's other
films, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a near-perfect coda to a most
brilliant career in filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   While there are trademark audiovisual elements in every great
director's movies, there are so many allusions in this movie that
it almost seems as if Kubrick knew it would be his ``Fanny and
Alexander'' swan song. There's the similarity to the eyes-wide-open
sexual obsessiveness of James Mason in ``Lolita'' _ watch Nicole
Kidman's eyes light up when she sees Tom Cruise with a pair of
models early in the film as if she's now free to explore her own
fantasies. The corpse lying in the bed with fleur-de-lis wallpaper
in the room recalls the soon-to-be-reborn star child of ``2001: A
Space Odyssey''; the gang of young toughs who challenge Cruise are
today's ``Clockwork Orange'' droogs; the sexual languor in ``Barry
Lyndon'' is similar to that of the masque in which the observers,
digitally imposed or not, recall the apes watching their leaders
duel in ``2001''; and the many ballroom scenes, visually and
musically, evoke the scenes that Jack Nicholson steps into in ``The
Shining.'' Kubrick seems to have forsaken his fish-eye lens, but
the wide shots of walking down corridors and his method of cutting
carry the same eerie weight as does his superb use of silences.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of eeriness, Kubrick continued his championing of
contemporary composer Gyorgy Ligeti from ``2001'' and ``The
Shining,'' despite the lawsuit Ligeti brought against him for
tampering with his music in the former. He was always on the
lookout for undiscovered composers, and in this movie he found the
extraordinarily spooky Jocelyn Pook. And the framing Shostakovich
waltz makes a nice pairing with Strauss's ``Blue Danube'' from
``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   This would all be the stuff of ``Star Trek''-like conventions or
pop academicism if it weren't for the fact that ``Eyes Wide Shut''
fits so nicely into the thematic concerns of these and all the
other Kubrick films. A variation of the headline on Janet Maslin's
perceptive review in The New York Times, ``Sexual Odyssey,'' could
be pegged to any of Kubrick's films. Each of his protagonists is on
an odyssey of some sort, from the bland ``heroes'' of ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (Peter Sellers's Mandrake), ``2001,'' and ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' to the colorful ``villains'' of ``The Killing,'' ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' and ``The Shining.'' But unlike traditional
mythological quests, these are odysseys that the central characters
had no intention of engaging in, particularly in the later movies.
From ``Strangelove'' on, they're all pawns in a game seemingly run
by political or cosmological forces out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   In this and other regards, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is almost a sequel
to ``The Shining.'' Cruise, like Nicholson, enters a ballroom (or
two) that promises to transport him into a promiscuous promised
land far from the world of conventional morality. That one is a
failed writer married to an Olive Oyl of a wife and the other is a
grandly successful doctor with a To Die For wife speaks to the
similarities rather than the differences.
</P>
<P>
   The same is particularly true of Kubrick's military protagonists
because nowhere is conventional morality thrown to the winds more
than in 20th-century warfare. But all his central characters are
shaken out of their daily torpor by some realization that normalcy
has been turned on its head _ a proscribed lust in ``Lolita,'' the
end of the world in ``Strangelove,'' the exploration of new worlds
in ``Space Odyssey,'' the realization that the enemy is a young
girl in ``Full Metal Jacket.'' As eager as Cruise is to explore his
new universe, he is no more prepared for what he's going to find
than Keir Dullea's astronaut in ``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   As different as Malcolm McDowell's odyssey in ``A Clockwork
Orange'' is from Cruise's, Kubrick's is essentially the same _ how
does one find meaning in a spiritually listless, post-Christian
world? Has Christmas ever seemed emptier than in ``Eyes Wide
Shut''? Has the myth of materialist happiness ever delivered so
little?
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kubrick has ever been a prude about these matters, as
his battles with America's idiot ratings bureaucrats prove. But the
idea that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' would be sexier than ``Red Shoe
Diaries'' was more foolish a preconception than that ``The
Shining'' would be scarier than a Stephen King novel. In both
cases, Kubrick is after bigger fish.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise has attained the good life by following the straight and
narrow, as evidenced by his dumbfoundedness at why Nick Nightingale
could drop out of medical school. He has the perfect trophy wife
and daughter, who live their lives in a certain roboticized
glamour. The only flight of fancy he allows himself, we assume, is
the occasional harmless flirtation. When Kidman confesses, however,
that she not only has sexual fantasies but would have left him for
a one-night stand, he walks out into a New York that is as alien to
him as ``Jupiter and beyond'' was to the ``Space Odyssey''
astronaut. Sex is available at every turn, each offer kinkier than
the last.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Kubrick has come under his greatest criticism on
the grounds that the kinkiness is dated and not much of a turn-on;
it doesn't feel real; that we don't care much about Cruise or
Kidman; or that Cruise is allowed to live out his fantasies, albeit
with constant interruptus, while Kidman can merely dream about it.
</P>
<P>
   This is all rather strange criticism of a filmmaker whose
movies, certainly since ``Space Odyssey,'' have all walked the
border between realism and surrealism or reality and
dream/nightmare. The garish interior colors and the Manhattan
exteriors are telling us that this is a New York fantasyland and
the dream that Cruise enters is no more real than Kidman's. In
fact, the steamiest sequences are Cruise's imaginings of Kidman and
her dream lover.
</P>
<P>
   But while all of Kubrick's movies are dreams, they are not the
escapes from reality of Hollywood film. It's the Hollywood film, as
much as Madison Avenue and Hugh Hefner propaganda, that is being
criticized here. The fantasy is of supermodels, government
conspiracies, and a life that would be just perfect if you only had
the money or the right partner. The reality is drugs, AIDS, and
dirty old men.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I was with Cruise every step of the way in what has
to be his best piece of acting. (Kidman continues to be an
impressive actress.) However many takes it took, the simultaneous
expressivity and ambiguity on his and Kidman's faces are worth it.
At any rate, Kubrick is hardly putting down sexual fantasy; the
movie is as much an endorsement of Freudian liberation as Arthur
Schnitzler's novel and a warning of what happens when one denies
the importance of letting one's dreams go to town.
</P>
<P>
   Like all movies that are essentially dreams, the success of
``Eyes Wide Shut'' is in the eye of the beholder, i.e., whether the
viewer is swept into the dream or sits outside it. Kubrick's genius
has been to sweep us into his unique dreamscapes and then deposit
us back in a world that, because of him, has more weight and less
weightiness. We both understand and enjoy our lives a little more.
In this regard we're in exactly the same boat as Cruise and Kidman,
trying to find a path through a spiritual morass and connect our
dreams back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fact that critics have been all over the map, the
same has been true of all Kubrick's movies. It's only in retrospect
that they become masterpieces. And one word of warning to the
uninitiated: I've seen the movie twice, once with digital sound and
a big screen in the Lowell megaplex, and once in the nondigital
dump in Harvard Square. Local critics saw the movie in the
similarly antiquated Nickelodeon Theatre. Don't make the same
mistake. The superior sound and screens in Randolph, Waltham,
Lowell, and some of the other digitally equipped movie theaters are
no guarantees you'll like it, but you might as well give yourself a
chance to dream in style.
</P>
<P>
   As Cruise's dream begins to unravel, he picks up a New York Post
with a screaming headline: ``LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.'' Kubrick knew all
too well about the precariousness of human existence _ it's another
recurring theme _ and though our lives are the worse for no more of
his extraordinary films, perhaps we should just consider ourselves
lucky to have had our eyes open for his final, most personal
odyssey.

SOME SCHOOLS FIND SUCCESS WITH IMMIGRANT STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Throughout California, there is a wide and
disturbing achievement gap between English speakers and English
learners.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of recent statewide test results for grades 2, 6
and 10 found a handful of districts closing the gap, using
strategies that could work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The districts have common traits, according to the analysis by
the San Francisco Examiner: They push educators to earn credentials
to teach immigrants, teach classes only in English and set high
standards for their immigrant students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not buy into this notion that some kids can get to the
national average, and some can't,'' said Dennis Chaconas,
superintendent of the Alameda City Unified School District, where
20 percent of his students are English learners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people say, `Of course scores of limited-English kids
are low. They don't understand the test,''' Chaconas said. ``That's
a cop-out. My kids are going to have to pass a test in English to
get a high school diploma and go to college. My kids have to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Alameda City schools, 69 percent of students who are
fluent in English reached or surpassed the national average on this
year's statewide achievement test, followed closely by 55 percent
of students still learning English.
</P>
<P>
   The success of districts such as Alameda defies the trend
statewide, where a large gap exists between the scores of students
learning English and those who are fluent.
</P>
<P>
   Results released last month of the reading portion of the
statewide exam show that 56 percent of English speakers in second
grade scored at or above the national average, compared with 19
percent of English learners, a 37-percentage-point achievement gap.
The gap in sixth-grade reading scores was even wider _ 45
percentage points. By 10th grade, the gap narrowed slightly, to 35
in reading and 29 in math.
</P>
<P>
   Parity in education for students from immigrant families remains
one of the greatest challenges facing California. Nearly 25 percent
of the 5.6 million children in public schools in California are not
fluent in English. Indeed, California, which educates 12.5 percent
of American public school children, has 43 percent of the nation's
students with limited English.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators argue that students who speak limited English
should not have to take the state test because they do not speak
the language and cannot be expected to do well.
</P>
<P>
   Chaconas disagrees: ``If your youngster is Spanish-speaking and
has low test scores, you wouldn't say the test failed him. You'd
say the system did. And you'd be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Another district closing the gap is Evergreen Elementary in
South San Jose in Santa Clara County. Nearly 30 percent of the
13,000 students are English learners, and 36 percent are
low-income.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 57 percent of the district's second-graders who speak
limited English scored at or above the national average this year,
compared with 72 percent of second-graders fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 years ago, we saw such an increase in our
limited-English student population that we said every single
classroom teacher must learn the strategies to teach these kids,''
Assistant Superintendent Phyllis Lindstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, embedded in every single staff-development meeting,
whether it's about math or anything else, are strategies for
helping limited-English-proficient kids,'' Lindstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   No other district in the San Francisco Bay area comes close to
the success of the second-grade English learners in the Castro
Valley Unified School District, where 81 percent of students
reached the national average in math, scoring 5 points higher than
their classmates who are fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fitzpatrick, the associate superintendent in the Castro
Valley district, credits improved teacher training and English-only
instruction for the solid scores.
</P>
<P>
   English is taught from kindergarten on, and the district pays
educators to earn a credential called CLAD _ Cross Cultural
Language Acquisition Development _ designed for teachers who work
with immigrant students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``We have a luxury that most districts don't
have. In our district, less than 5 percent of our 7,700 kids are
limited English. So they don't get lost.''
</P>
<P>

   Delaine Eastin, the state education chief, said districts that
had narrowed the gap had a clear strategy for teaching English
learners. ``They are really very organized in how they go about it.
They put teachers through the CLAD program, provide extra help for
these kids after school, and they have high expectations for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kenji Hakuta, a professor of education at Stanford
University, advised against inferring too much from statistics
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nuances,'' he said, ``such as how many (English
learners) are tested and what the family income and education level
is. What the gaps do is present a really good signal that people
ought to pay attention to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Novato Unified School District, where fewer than 10
percent of the 8,000 K-12 students are still learning English, wide
achievement gaps exist in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   Although the district has traditionally taught in English only,
superintendent John Bernard said he was concerned the district had
not been providing ``all we want to for limited-English-proficient
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking his job in January, Bernard has required new
teachers to have a CLAD credential ``or sign a contract saying
they'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But teacher and student attitudes may be as important as the
training, he said. Some critics have said Novato Unified didn't put
as much effort into the educational needs of immigrant students.
This year, he said, the district is also taking a close look at its
overall treatment of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Mateo County district of La Honda-Pescadero Unified,
considerably smaller than Novato but with a similar achievement
gap, English learners were taught in bilingual classes until this
year, when students were switched to English immersion program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd taught them in Spanish for the last three years, and
before that there was really no program,'' said Superintendent
Bonnie McClung, noting that 35 percent of the district's students
were English learners. ``Teachers did the best they could. I think
this method of instruction is better, and our results will
improve.''

</P>
<P>
   TURIN-SHROUD (St. Louis) _ An analysis of pollen on the Shroud
of Turin indicates that it dates to the eighth century or earlier,
an Israeli plant expert reports. This conflicts with carbon dating
done in 1988 that showed the shroud to be from the 13th century. By
William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   (Story offered for page one consideration.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   PESTICIDE-FOOD (Washington) _ The EPA announces new rules for
pesticide levels in foods. The agency is expected to ban most uses
of methyl parathion and a related chemical, used on fruits. And
it's conducting a major review of the effects of certain chemicals
on children, in light of some studies showing damage to the nervous
system. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   (Story offered for page one consideration.)
</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The House takes another crack at

   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-GUNS (Denver) _ Recently enacted state background checks
for gun buyers have already stopped eight people with restraining
orders from purchasing weapons. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   CAYMAN-BANKS (Newark, N.J.) _ After John Mathewson was caught
laundering money in an FBI sting to shut down a major player in the
multi-billion dollar illegal trade in cable black boxes, he offered
the government investigative gold in return for leniency. He was
willing to turn over the computer records of his Grand Caymans
Island bank, which held itself out as a one-stop money launderer
for its U.S. clients. The government of the Cayman Islands, eager
to protect its banking privacy treaties, tried to block use of the
computer records in federal court, but failed. So today, as
Mathewson is sentenced, five federal jurisdictions around the
country will be on hand in to plead for leniency, saying that his
cooperation has led to ``multiple investigations into widespread
tax evasion schemes'' that could dwarf the original cable scam. By
Ronald Smothers. (1400 words)

<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-THEME-PARKS (Jiading, China) _ On paper, China still looks
like a field of opportunity for the theme park business. There is a
fast-growing economy, an awakening middle class with leisure time
and disposable income, and a cultural disposition toward pampering
children, accentuated by a one-child policy. But for a reality
check, consider the American Dream Park in Jiading. Most of the
rides are closed. One recent day, the day's take at the gate was 12
people _ pretty paltry for a park that cost $50 million to build.
Like countless other virtually empty theme parks in China, the
American Dream symbolizes the disastrous miscalculations made by
investors. Projects have been swamped by excessive competition,
poor market projections, high costs and relentless interference
from local officials. By Seth Faison.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANT-SYMBIOSIS (Undated) _ Leaf-cutting ants and their fungus
farms are a marvel of nature and perhaps the best known example of
symbiosis, the mutual dependence of two species. But the textbook
accounts, it turns out, don't tell even half the story. From
research over the past five years the ants' symbiosis has emerged
as far more intricate than it appears, involving not two but at
least four different species, their lives knotted together in a
ruthless yet highly successful struggle for survival. By Nicholas
Wade. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphics.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MACHINE-INTELLIGENCE (Undated) _ Cog, a legless,
human-shaped robot that looks like an ungainly ancestor of R2D2 and
was created at MIT, may be a truly intelligent machine. Its maker,
the head of the world's largest artificial intelligence laboratory,
believes the key to such a machine is life experience. But that
flies in the face of common thinking on the matter. By Bruce
Schechter. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOZART-EFFECT (Undated) _ True or false: Brain research
shows that playing classical music for 2-year-olds makes them
smarter. Given the publicity blitz that has attended the so-called
Mozart effect, most people could be forgiven if they answered,
``True!'' But the truth is that the studies behind the Mozart
effect were conducted on college students, not young children. The
``effect'' _ an increase in performance on a specific task of
spatial imagery _ lasted for only a few minutes. The studies
involved no brain research, only tests of behavior. Attempts to
reproduce the results have failed. In a book coming out next month,
``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' (Free Press), Dr. John Bruer
argues that the hype and the overstatement and at times distortion
of what neuroscientists know about the developing brain has
unnecessarily sent anxious parents and educators scurrying to
insure that children receive exactly the right type of ``enriched''
stimulation before the age of 3. By Erica Goode. (1850 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLUTO (Undated) _ Two telescopes in Hawaii have seen beyond
previous limits of visibility to make intriguing discoveries about
the surface composition of the planet Pluto and Saturn's largest
satellite, Titan. One telescope revealed the existence of the
hydrocarbon ethane on Pluto's surface, potentially significant
because it may be a remnant component of the original interstellar
gas cloud that collapsed to form the solar system. Another
telescope detected what may be liquid or frozen seas of
hydrocarbons on Titan, which could be the only ones known in the
solar system other than those on Earth. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RABINOWITZ-ADVENTURE (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Alan
Rabinowitz. If Indiana Jones, the daredevil hero of Steven
Spielberg's adventure-film trilogy, had been invented as a
zoologist rather than an archeologist, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz would
have made an ideal model. In 16 years with the Wildlife
Conservation Society, Rabinowitz has tracked and captured jaguars
in Belize, tigers in Thailand and clouded leopards in Borneo and
Taiwan. He has lived with Mayan Indians in Central America and
jungle tribes in Southeast Asia. Most recently he trekked on foot
for a month to reach one of the world's most isolated areas, in
northern Myanmar, crossing mountain torrents on hastily built
bamboo bridges that would have given the unflappable Jones pause.

   SCI-CHILD-FORMULA (Undated) _ The phytoestrogens found in
babies' soy formula may in fact benefit children, a researcher
contends, instead of causing harm, which some parents fear based on
earlier studies. By John O'Neil. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Timing is
crucial in toilet training for children. By Jane E. Brody. (1200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-ACTIVITY (Undated) _ Child therapists and sports
doctors have been pondering the question: when do constructive
activities for children become too much. For the most part, the
experts say that children who participate in a variety of
after-school activities are lucky: they're socializing, learning
and having fun. But these experts are also seeing children who are
overscheduled to the point that they're suffering, physically and
emotionally. At the very least, many of the busiest children are
sleep-deprived. By Susan Gilbert. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-FITNESS (Undated) _ Some school districts are buying
into a new physical education program that teaches basic sports
skills and lifetime activities, keeps students moving all during
class and makes the program fun. By Mary Duffy. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Parents have a large range of
choice when it comes to over-the-counter medicines for children,
and some parents and doctors agree that's not necessarily a good
thing. And some critics fear the line between medicine and candy
may be blurred with medicated chewable tablets. By Eric Nagourney.
(750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-ANTIBIOTICS (Undated) _ Q&AMP;A on antibiotics and
children: With more and more antibiotics being prescribed to
children under 6, some experts fear this could lead to much greater
resistance to the drugs. By Alisha Berger. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 2-year-old boy developed pubic hair, facial acne and an
enlarged penis as a result of exposure to his father's testosterone
bodybuilding cream. (400 words)

   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

<P>
   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

 &HT;    Bush's absence riles Hispanic organization
 &HT;    By Susan E. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who promotes a GOP
version of the Democrat's racially inclusive ``Big Tent,'' has been
tripping over the tent ropes lately.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a frontrunner in the presidential race, recently declined
to attend three conferences of high-profile national Hispanic
organizations _ the League of United Latin American Citizens, the
National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and
the National Council of La Raza. Many participants at the La Raza
conference in Houston last week wore lapel stickers reading,
``Where's George?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush declined to speak to a gathering of minority
journalists known as Unity earlier this month in Seattle, Wash.
After realizing the blunder, Bush, who was campaigning in the area,
made an impromptu stop at the convention. But his appearance,
perceived as a photo opportunity, riled many of the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush certainly can't be expected to attend every event. But as
the self-annointed ``compassionate conservative,'' who makes a
practice of lacing his speeches with Spanish and distancing himself
from his party's opposition to bilingual education, Bush has set
himself up for the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In an election season, the decisions seem clueless or arrogant
for a governor who received a much talked about 49 percent of the
Hispanic vote in Texas last year and is reaching out to African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you think you have the vote locked up, you don't act
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics may be getting the treatment many African Americans
have experienced with the Democratic Party: The party courts your
vote, but it doesn't deliver on the issues. By missing the
conventions, Bush appears to be skipping part of the courting
phase.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has shown his concern for Hispanic voters, said
campaign press secretary Mindy Tucker, reciting a list of campaign
stops in Hispanic communities from San Diego, Calif., to Detroit,
Mich. But that illustrates the problem with Bush's campaign
strategy, which often can be described as photo-op politics.
</P>
<P>
   Not speaking to La Raza and other groups may mean little to many
Hispanic voters who are not affiliated with them, says Lisa
Montoya, a government professor at the University of Texas at
Austin. And some of the organizations have small memberships that
may be out of step with many Hispanics on issues including
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   But by avoiding minority gatherings, such as the La Raza
convention, Bush escapes having to answer tough questions about his
positions on issues, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has ridden the wave of symbolic politics with Hispanics.
And he speaks 20 words in Spanish and everybody hails him. But on
substantive issues, I don't think he can win. At the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials he can't get
away with what he gets away with at a rally. But rallies are
controlled environments.''
</P>
<P>
   His brief appearance at the Unity convention was another example
of photo-op politics. ``He went to the Unity conference and used
minority journalists as background, as black and brown faces. ...
For the entire campaign they can use the pictures. What type of
message does that send?'' Montoya asks.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also are coming up short on the issues, says Raul
Yzaguirre, president of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interesting time for us. We're being recognized for
our voting power, purchasing power and cultural contributions. But
on the other hand, it's very hard to get policy makers to focus on
our issues. I recently met with the president and the attorney
general. ... The Department of Justice was conducting a study on
attitudes towards police abuse. But it didn't include Hispanics.
They ignored the largest minority in this country. It was
egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   No group should be perceived as ``sewn up'' by any political
organization or candidate. In that sense, African Americans, 80
percent of whom vote for Democrats, may be worse off politically
than Hispanics, who do not vote for either party in such great
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The political parties and their candidates should earn minority
votes based on the issues, not just claim to pitch a ``Big Tent''
under which we too can stand.

WAKE-UP CALL: CBS NEEDS `EARLY' RATINGS SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Bryant Gumbel's Nov. 1 return to the morning
television wars in what CBS is calling ``The Early Show'' is
haunted by a number of question marks. Does a compatible co-host
exist? Will Gumbel turn off more viewers than he turns on? Is this
a shotgun wedding? And the most pressing: Will the spanking-new
indoor/outdoor studio be ready in time?
</P>
<P>
   The last item was brought up after footage of the New York City
studio construction was shown to television critics at the annual
summer show-and-tell meeting sponsored by the TV industry. The set
looked like a dilapidated city corner. This prompted producer Steve
Friedman to promise that if the state-of-the art studio isn't up
and running by its due date, which falls at the beginning of
November sweeps, ``people will die.''
</P>
<P>
   That Friedman said this with no hint of sarcasm leads one to
believe that there is enormous pressure on Gumbel and crew to
finally give CBS a morning show we can laugh with and not at.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Today'' remains such a formidable front-runner that
several times during a panel session with Gumbel, Friedman and CBS
News President Andrew Heyward, the names David and Goliath kept
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Heyward is downplaying the urgency, describing the race
as a marathon, not a sprint. I'd characterize this as public
posturing; CBS has been hammered so hard for so long, patience is
no longer part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the presumption that where viewers start the day is
where they end it. Morning shows are like tour guides, gently
nudging viewers into midmorning shows on the same channel and then
afternoon programming and eventually prime time.
</P>
<P>
   So the prestige of early morning programming is far more
important than the networks let on, considering that they can be
such profitable operations in the short and long runs, particularly
to their affiliate stations, which need to be kept happy.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, CBS needs ``The Early Show'' to hit the ground
running, like, now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not to worry about `Today' and `Good Morning
America,''' Friedman explained. ``We have plenty to worry about
ourselves. Our job is to get on the field with a good show, a
credible show. It's almost like `Field of Dreams.' Build it, and
hopefully they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   What CBS is building, aside from an entirely different on-camera
team, is one of those studios complete with peek-a-boo glass walls
designed to be the kind of fan-friendly tourist attraction that
resulted in ``Today's'' ratings climb. Friedman knows this works,
because this is the monster he created in 1994 while producing
``Today.'' How ironic that his mission now is to build a better
version for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ironic is that the no-frills Gumbel never seemed
comfortable with the carnival atmosphere, even while on ``Today.''
He rarely ventured outside and purposely kept his back turned to
the tourists, media junkies and celebrity-hunters who waved wildly
any time they saw the red light of a camera pointed in their
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says one difference from the ``Today'' design will be
an ability to close off a portion of the studio for one-on-one
interviews, preventing fans from making goo-goo eyes at interview
subjects such as Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The second horse in this three-horse race for morning TV
supremacy is building a peekaboo window of its own, located in
Times Square. ``Good Morning America'' Executive producer Shelley
Ross was tight-lipped on a lot of specifics the other day, saying
only that the show will move into the new digs Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson, plugged in as ``temporary''
hosts after the ``GMA'' massacre claimed the job of former Fort
Worth resident Lisa McRee, now look like they're being held hostage
at gunpoint. Since ratings have improved slightly, ABC has asked
the pair to hang around longer _ I mean, what are they going to
say, no? Now they're under contract until May of next year, and who
knows how long they'll remain?
</P>
<P>
   Having two veterans in jobs they don't necessarily want is the
least of ``GMA's'' problems. (In separate interviews with Gibson
and Sawyer, it was obvious that their hearts are not in this.)
</P>
<P>
   There had to be conversations about host instability causing
more audience alienation, concern that the longer Sawyer and Gibson
remain, the harder it will be to replace them without some kind of
viewer bailout. And ``GMA'' has had five executive producers since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about how long Sawyer and Gibson will be on board,
David Westin, president of ABC News, said that he never considered
them ``temporary'' in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main curse Charlie and Diane and the whole team have is
success,'' Westin said during a panel session as Gibson and Sawyer
looked on. What are they: prisoners of their own talent?
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in and they did a wonderful job with the program,
and our viewers reacted. And when something's working that well,
one hesitates, at least, before one changes it.'' (Still, says
Weston, finding the right hosts is an ongoing effort. My advice is
to wrest Jodi Applegate away from NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, getting the right people to surround Gumbel will be
the harder task. The leading gossip was that Oprah Winfrey was
being courted as co-host, but the suits quickly squashed that
rumor, and no other names have surfaced. Heyward seems to be having
fun with the search, calling it ``Operation Glass Slipper,'' saying
they are looking for a commoner, so to speak: someone who isn't a
``name.'' (In that case, they'll be better off with one of those
open-call auditions at a mall.)
</P>
<P>
   That isn't so silly; journalistic experience doesn't seem to be
a necessary qualification in breakfast television any longer.
Remember, former congresswoman Susan Molinari was co-anchoring a
CBS Saturday morning show. Now actress Florence Henderson will
co-host NBC's new ``Later Today,'' a midday infotainment show
following ``Today.'' Her co-host is the experienced Applegate.
</P>
<P>
   Hosting these shows is tricky _ you have to be friendly and
folksy, able to improvise and summarize. The glass walls are
gimmicks that merely let you see the genre's superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is something as simple and basic as
likability. Do you want to share your morning with this person?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the most successful host in breakfast TV is, well,
Katie Couric.

WEB TICKETS CONVENIENT, BUT COSTLIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying tickets has never been easier, as consumers in growing
numbers abandon the hassle of wristbands and long lines and opt for
the convenience of purchasing on line.
</P>
<P>
   ConsumerBeat Companies have been selling tickets on the Internet
for years, but the market has exploded in recent months. An
estimated 40 percent of the 100,000 tickets for Bruce Springsteen's
five shows at the Fleet Center in August were sold on line.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, the dominant ticket retailer nationally, had been
expected to sell 20 percent of its tickets on line within three
years, but it now looks like that goal could be reached by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 2.6 million tickets on line at
www.ticketmaster.com in May and June, about 13.5 percent of the
total. That is a 62 percent increase from the 1.6 million tickets
sold on line during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But even as consumers are rushing to embrace the speed and
convenience of the new technology, they are voicing concerns about
the charges and fees associated with this convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Mindy Carmody are a perfect example. Big Springsteen
fans, they pursued tickets for the Boss's August concerts with
military precision.
</P>
<P>
   To get a wristband, Mindy left for the Ticketmaster outlet in
Belmont about 1 1/2 hours before tickets went on sale in June. She
received her two tickets at about 11 a.m. Total time: about three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chris went on line the day of the sale and within 25 minutes had
placed two orders for a total of six tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Carmody acknowledges the convenience of his purchase in terms of
time, effort and reduced stress, but he nevertheless questions the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   For on-line purchasers of Springsteen tickets, Ticketmaster
assessed a convenience charge of $7.50 per $67.50 ticket, a $1.30
handling fee per order, and the cost of the customer's delivery
option.
</P>
<P>
   With his two orders, Carmody ended up paying $45 in convenience
charges and $2.60 in handling fees.
</P>
<P>
   Since he placed two orders, Ticketmaster assessed Carmody two
$10 UPS delivery charges, even though all six tickets were
delivered together. Carmody said he sent an e-mail complaint to
Ticketmaster about the double delivery charges and tried to reach
the firm by phone with no success. The company agreed to drop the
second delivery charge after we called.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the delivery issues, Carmody is puzzled why costs are
so high for those who buy on line. He noted that on line retailers
generally charge less than their brick-and-mortar counterparts, who
face higher overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the computer would be a cheaper option for
them,'' said Carmody, a software designer for Parametric Technology
Corp. in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the Springsteen concert, the $7.50 on-line convenience
charge was identical to the charge for orders taken by phone
operators. The convenience charge at Ticketmaster outlets was $2.05
less, according to company officials, and there was no convenience
charge at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience charges vary by concert and venue. For example, a
$40.50 ticket to see the Allman Brothers Aug. 20 at the Tweeter
Center in Mansfield, Mass. carries a $7.10 on-line convenience
charge and a $3-per-order handling fee.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., the Pasadena, Calif.,
company that handles on-line ticket sales for Ticketmaster, said
its average convenience and handling charge was $6.68 per ticket in
the second quarter. That represents revenues of about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers do not understand where the money goes. The
convenience charges are determined by contract between Ticketmaster
and the venue hosting the event. Part of the fee is paid to the
venue and part to the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Conn, chief executive officer of Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch, said there are enormous costs associated with
on-line sales, including a customer service operation. ``There's
just a whole lot more costs than anybody realizes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmody remains unconvinced. He says there is no way he should
pay more to buy on line than he pays at an outlet. He thinks the
charges have more to do with Ticketmaster's monopoly position in
the marketplace than the company's actual costs. ``They own the
market. You can't get around them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conn and Carmody are probably both right. Ticketmaster's
dominance of the market allows it to charge what it does, but right
now it has a product _ on-line ticket sales _ that consumers are
willing to pay a premium for.

<P>
   Less Charmin to squeeze
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Whipple is back from retirement to promote a newer and
better Charmin bathroom tissue, but consumer activist Edgar Dworsky
tells us there is now less to squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   A single roll of old Charmin had 280 sheets; the same-size roll
of new Charmin has just 200. That is a nearly 30 percent reduction
even though the price charged by supermarkets like Stop &AMP; Shop and
Shaw's has not changed a cent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the largest percentage-size reductions I can
remember,'' said Dworsky, who has caught manufacturers disguising a
price increase by reducing the size of the product they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. confirm the new Charmin has
fewer sheets per roll but say it is stronger and more absorbent.
``If it's stronger and more absorbent and it performs better, you
would be likely to use less,'' said Terry Loftus, a company
spokesman. Loftus said company research shows consumers needed
fewer sheets of the new Charmin, but he could not pinpoint the
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus also said Procter &AMP; Gamble is charging retailers 6.5
percent less for new Charmin than old Charmin, an indication that
retailers may be using the product switch to pocket a little extra
change.

RUSSIAN REFUGEES SKIRT REGULATIONS TO FLOOD US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since 1989, the United States has granted coveted
refugee status to numerous emigres from the former Soviet Union on
the basis of fraudulent documents or unverified assertions that
they were Jewish or evangelical Christians, according to US
officials who have administered the program.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 275,000 Jewish immigrants and 100,000 evangelical
Christians have arrived in the United States despite the State
Department's urging in 1996 that the program be scrubbed because it
was vulnerable to fraud and had outlived its usefulness. Even so,
the Clinton administration, expressing fears of a new wave of
anti-Semitism in Russia, is now poised to ask Congress to extend it
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, amid evidence that many non-Jews, some allegedly with
Russian mafia connections, have manipulated the program to enter
the United States illegally, about 6,000 other Jews from the former
Soviet Union await refugee designation.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its future, the program's past is troubled: It has
cleared for emigration an unknown, but apparently substantial,
number of applicants on the basis of faked documents and little or
no evidence that they faced persecution, according to several
officials who worked in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly was a mindset among our superiors that unless
there was a clear case of fraud or forgery, we were to approve what
was in front of us,'' said Rebecca Fong, a former review officer
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the US Embassy in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 INS internal document, obtained by the Globe, provided no
precise estimate of the number of people who had entered the United
States under false pretenses, but it characterized fraud in the
program as ``astronomical.'' Still, INS officials, in recent
interviews, played down the number of applicants who have arrived
in the United States illicitly. While they acknowledged that many
applicants submitted faked documents, they said most of those were
weeded out during Washington processing before the interview stage
at the Moscow Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 1989 rules relaxation, sponsored by Senator Frank
R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, have focused on the lower
standard for refugee status that was created for Jews and
evangelical Christians from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   While officials privately focus their criticism on the level of
fraud by Jewish applicants over the last decade, in the last year
or so they say they have found an increasing level of fraud among
evangelical Christians. In 1998 for the first time, more
evangelicals were admitted as refugees than Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In other troubled parts of the world, would-be refugees must
show they are being persecuted or have a ``well-founded fear'' of
persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a social class, or political affiliation. But
applicants from the former Soviet Union need only show a ``credible
basis'' for concern that they might face persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Such vague standards left INS employees uncertain what
assertions were acceptable to win refugee status. But they said
they soon learned from their superiors that a claim of a minor act
of discrimination, such as being denied a promotion or raise, was
acceptable, without any need for verification.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the 275,000 who emigrated here through the
program were men, women, and children of Jewish heritage who had
close family members living in the United States and were able to
show they had experienced some discrimination, if not persecution,
in the former Soviet Union, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and Boston have
become major resettlement destinations for the emigres. About
50,000 of the refugees from the former Soviet Union have settled in
Massachusetts since 1983, according to the state Office of Refugee
Resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not on fraud but on how this program has taken
people out of a country that has had a history of anti-Semitic
persecution,'' said Leonard Glickman, executive vice president of
the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which has helped most of the
refugees resettle in the United States. Glickman sidestepped
questions about the extent of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an investigation by the State Department's Inspector
General's office reported in 1996 that fraudulent documentation had
become an increasing problem for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since fraudulent documents can be obtained and category
membership only has to be stated, not proved, it is difficult for
INS to verify family claims,'' stated the Inspector General's
report. ``The increased fraud and the low standards imposed
resulted in people not eligible for resettlement gaining access to
the US.''
</P>
<P>
   While the program initially facilitated the emigration of many
Jews who had been persecuted under the Soviet system, INS officials
in Moscow came to believe that the program should have ended by
1993 because of the potential for fraud, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with White House plans to extend the program through next
year's election, one of the highest INS priorities is how to
prevent fraud, the same issue that arose in 1993 and 1996 when
State Department-led efforts to end the program were beaten back by
Jewish lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to end the program now could prove costly to
Democratic candidates, especially to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
has taken steps to court Jewish voters in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials confirmed there has long been disagreement between
INS agents who process applicants at the Moscow Embassy and their
superiors in Washington about the proof needed to qualify. One
superior, who asked not to be identified, acknowledged: ``I'll
admit the program is more generous than elsewhere, but that's what
Congress mandated.''
</P>
<P>
   Several reviewers complained that their entreaties that the
Embassy take a tougher stand against fraud and baseless claims of
persecution were ignored. For much of the last decade, their
requests that criminal background checks be done and equipment be
bought that could detect forged documents were rebuffed. They said
superiors also repeatedly questioned reviewers' judgment when they
rejected applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even applicants considered extremely suspect by INS reviewers
were ultimately approved, officials said. In many cases, they said,
applicants would claim to have lost their internal Soviet passports
that would identify them as Jewish. Instead, they were allowed to
present other papers, even those that appeared to have been
produced by the thriving fake document industry in the former
Soviet Union, to attest that they had Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program has been documented to be so loosely administered
that it has served as a conduit for the settlement of a strong
refugee mafia to take root in the United States,'' Dan Stein
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, which wants the program eliminated, told a House
subcommittee last year.
</P>
<P>
   Added one INS interviewer, who asked for anonymity: ``The
prevailing attitude was that Congress had passed the . . .
amendment'' loosening the restrictions for Jews to enter as
refugees ``and we weren't to stand in the way of putting up the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   And impressive numbers were reached. At the end of the first
year of the program's operation in 1990, nearly 40,000 applicants
of Jewish heritage were accepted as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard News Service reported in 1995 on the
criticism inside the INS on the program's level of fraud, but
Congress approved an extension of the Lautenberg Amendment the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   While no one would estimate how many residents of the former
Soviet Union took advantage of the program to enter the United
States illegally, US statistics show that few of the applicants
interviewed were rejected. Between 1989 and 1998, more than 97
percent of the Russian Jews interviewed became emigres. About 90
percent of the evangelical Christians seeking admission were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, only about 75 percent of refugee applicants from
elsewhere who reach the interview stage win approval, mostly
because they face the higher theshhold of proving that they face
persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee status is an immigrant's dream: Refugees are entitled to
several benefits, including welfare for eight months, health
insurance, employment services, and instruction in English as a
second language for 18 months, that are not available to foreign
visitors on work visas. And it allows them to petition for US
citizenship after five years.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the rules were relaxed, no one can say for
sure how extensive the fraud is.
</P>
<P>
   One INS executive, who asked not to be identified but is
familiar with the refugee program, said the agency's top tier of
officials are aware that loose standards and lax controls allowed
some who did not deserve it to gain refugee status. Asked how many
came in without proper credentials, he said: ``It's anybody's
guess.''

ILLEGAL BUSINESS VISA USE SEEN AS EXTENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For Alexandr U. Yegmenov, unlike many immigrants,
ethnic affinity had nothing to do with his decision to live in New
York's capital city when he arrived seeking asylum from the former
Soviet Union in the early 1990s. What drew Yegmenov here was a
wholesale scheme to circumvent US immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years before he was caught in 1995, Yegmenov
established an astonishing 4,000 dummy corporations at the New York
Secretary of State's office and used them to help bring an
estimated 750 to 1,000 residents of the fomer Soviet Union
illegally into the country on business visas, many of them
transplanted mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Yegmenov, whose exploits have never been made public, may be
unique. But according to US officials and documents, he is but one
entrepreneur in a thriving underworld that operates on two
continents to produce fraudulent documents that have allowed
thousands from the former Soviet Union to enter the United States
illicitly on work visas. US officials estimate that up to 70
percent of applications for business visas from the former Soviet
Union are fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, federal officials point to three
conspicuous cases that have alarmed law enforcement:
</P>
<P>
   --Three alleged hit men from Chechnya were destined for the
United States in 1994 with work visas arranged by a Falmouth
company, Quartz Sales &AMP; Marketing Inc., which had business
interests in the former Soviet Union. The FBI quashed the visas,
however, after Lech Z. Morawiez, president of the company, received
word that the three men, whom he presumed were engineers who would
help him win contracts in their homeland, were actually thugs sent
to harm Morawiez and his associates because a prior business deal
had gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   --One of four Boston-area men reputed in congressional testimony
to be members of the ``Russian mafia,'' sought a visa in 1993 for a
Moscow man, contending that the visitor was going to work for his
firm, American-Russian Enterprises, in Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Sorkin of Brookline indicated in his application that
Alimzhan Tokhtahounov would be helping him in his import-export
business. However, federal authorities found that Tokhtahounov was
a member of Moscow's criminal underground and associated with
Vyacheslav Ivankov, a Russian mobster who was convicted of fraud in
New York in 1995. The visa application was denied.
</P>
<P>
   --Zhalgas Amanbayev, a businessman from Kazakhstan, was arrested
by the FBI in late December in Boston after paying an undercover
agent $30,000 to purchase two green cards that would have allowed
him and his brother to stay, and work, in the country indefinitely.
After purchasing the cards, Amanbayev said he was interested in
engaging in other criminal enterprises with the undercover agent.
Before he was arrested, he showed he had the ability to launder $10
million in alleged drug proceeds through bank accounts in
Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia, and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The visa fraud problem became severe enough that four years ago,
the State Department established an antifraud force at the American
Embassy in Moscow and assigned State Department and FBI
investigators across the country the responsibility of tracking
down illegal visa schemes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, the investigators reported they had
stopped more than 40 members of organized crime gangs from Russia
and other former Soviet republics from moving to the United States,
Europe, and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is
responsible for reviewing applications by more than 2,000 Russians
and other former Soviet citizens annually for business visas that
will grant them extended stays in the United States. To qualify,
applicants must show that they are being sponsored by an American
company that is affiliated with the firm for which they work in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   One State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
estimated that about 70 percent of the applications filed annually
for the visas contain a significant amount of fraud. In most cases,
the official said, the applicants have no affiliation with the
companies they contend are sponsoring them or the firms, like the
paper companies created by Yegmenov, simply do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The latter proved to be the case last December when State
Department investigators checked out a work visa application for
several Russians who said they were employed by the Moscow
affiliate of Star Freight Services in East Boston. The office
address, 2 Neptune Road, turned out to be only a mail drop.
</P>
<P>
   Those applying from the former Soviet Union are not alone in
engaging in wide-scale fraud in business visas. In May, a US House
committee heard testimony about significant fraud in visa
applications from China, India, and Brazil, as well as Russia.
However, the officials said the schemes devised by people from
Russia and the other former Soviet republics are generally more
sophisticated and the falsified documents more difficult to detect
than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the efforts of Alexandr Yegmenov in Albany to secure
fraudulent visas for those from the former Soviet Union appear
unrivaled. Born in Leningrad in 1957, Yegmenov sought political
asylum in 1990, asserting that he had been persecuted for his work
as an economist for a dissident organization, and even placed in a
psychiatric hospital for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian documents Yegmenov used to back up his claims turned
out to be phony, drawn up by Yegmenov himself, according to the
criminal case filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the least of Yegmenov's crimes: Taking full
advantage of American bureaucracy, Yegmenov created thousands of
fictitious corporations in Albany, and hundreds of others in more
than a dozen other states, including Massachusetts, in an elaborate
scheme to bring Russians and others from the former Soviet Union to
the United States, according to US and New York state investigators
who worked on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing Yegmenov's activities, investigators learned
he was charging Russian emigres as much as $5,000 each for drawing
up the necessary documentation that facilitated their illegal entry
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, investigators found ample evidence that millions of
dollars worth of rubles were also smuggled from Russia to the
United States through Yegmenov's corporations. Tracing the paths of
those who got visas through Yegmenov, investigators found that they
often deposited large amounts of money, in many cases hundreds of
thousands of dollars each, in US banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were either bringing in enough money to establish a life
here in the United States for themselves or moving money here for
someone else,'' said Thomas D. O'Connell, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's lead investigator on the Yegmenov case.
``Whether it was money laundering or capital flight, this money had
no business coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Aleksander Erokhov, had come with sizable financial
means. With the application he filed in mid-1995, Erokhov, a native
of St. Petersburg, submitted bank statements that showed he was
transferring $316,900 to the United States. Before he was caught
and deported, federal investigators said, Erokhov became associated
with the largest Russian organized crime network in the United
States, which operates out of the Brighton Beach neighborhood of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yegmenov, too, has been deported, investigators said
they fear that many of the firms he incorporated are still being
used to funnel workers into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way of knowing how many firms he actually
incorporated, and which ones they are,'' said New York State Police
Captain David L. McNulty of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations
in Albany. ``So even though Yegmenov's been dealt with, we still
don't know everyone who may have gotten here because of his fraud,
or if they're still coming in.''

MAILING LISTS PROVING A BOOMING BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before a political scandal erupted last month over WGBH-TV
sharing its membership list with Democratic Party fund-raisers,
anyone with a mailbox had learned the hard way that a mailing list
is a very marketable _ and widely marketed _ commodity.
</P>
<P>
   These days businesses, nonprofit groups, and charities face an
increasingly difficult time getting Americans to read, or even just
open, ``junk mail'' solicitations. So booming demand has developed
for up-to-date, narrowly focused lists to get the best possible
response from the roughly $25 billion spent in the United States
each year on direct mail advertising to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Through brokers, entities that own lists _ such as environmental
groups, magazine publishers, and mail-order catalogs _ can get $60
to $125 or more for every 1,000 names they rent out for a single
mailing to a solicitor or business, industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical transaction, one of dozens of national
list-brokering companies would approach a group whose mailing list
it considers valuable, because most people on it are wealthy or
proven charitable donors or because their link to a group or a
magazine strongly suggests what they like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   For the negotiated fee, the broker would rent the list for
one-time use by a client doing a direct-mail campaign or pay more
to take permanent ownership of the names. A standard practice is
for the broker to stud the list it gives its client with phony
names at addresses the brokerage controls as a way of monitoring
whether the renter misuses or reuses the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society, for example, gets ``more and
more contacts every month, very often now from commercial,
for-profit entities'' that want to rent its list of 67,000 members,
society membership director John Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon could make perhaps $70,000 annually renting its
membership list just once a month to companies selling recreation-
or environment-oriented products. But Bradley said Audubon
officials have decided only to exchange lists _ rarely _ with other
nonprofit, environmental and conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with Greater Boston nonprofit and cultural groups and
list brokers indicate that WGBH is one of the few _ if not the only
one _ that has sold its membership list to commercial list brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials said they have swapped lists primarily with
other cultural or charitable groups to get new names that usually
account for 20 percent of new members each year and $3 million in
membership revenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``There are times when we have leased out portions of
the list when it was just a financial transaction,'' said Jeanne
Hopkins, WGBH's vice president for communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said she could not determine how often WGBH has rented
its list, which now has 210,000 names, to commercial list brokers.
``That's not a significant source of income for us.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials have blamed the 1994 and 1996 list swapping with
the Democratic National Committee on low-level development office
employees who, they said, did not know about a station policy
banning list swaps with political parties. The station has also
fired the outside list broker, whom it has refused to name, who
made the names available to the DNC. WGBH says the broker should
have known about the ban.
</P>
<P>
   It has since emerged that more than two dozen US public
television stations have sold lists to both political parties and
used party lists to seek new station members and donors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which will
distribute $197 million in federal grants to 1,000 public radio and
television stations next fall, announced a new policy under which
stations cannot get money unless they guarantee their membership
lists will not be swapped with or rented to political fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides drawing the ire of Capitol Hill Republicans convinced
the DNC list swap proves longstanding allegations of a left-wing
tilt in public TV, some industry officials said WGBH violated a
cardinal rule for nonprofits: Do not expose your supporters to
annoying junk mail they can trace back to your group.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Lyons of Fieldstone Creative Communications in Waltham,
Mass., who works with about a dozen clients around the United
States including the New England Aquarium, said, ``None of the
nonprofits I work with sell their names. They don't like giving
them up, and we don't want to annoy members or donors because the
chance of them joining again or donating is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Berman, of the Boston Harbor advocacy group Save the
Harbor/Save the Bay, said: ``We don't want our list floating
around. We have a responsibility to our donors not to pester them,
and we would never engage in partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   John Papalia, vice president of Statlistics, a national list
brokerage and management firm based in Danbury, Conn., said some
national groups such as the Easter Seals, Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, and disabled veterans' groups ``make a lot of money
renting their lists, although they keep a very tight check on who
they rent them to.'' But, in general, he said he has found local
and regional nonprofits much more leery.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the Direct Marketing Association in New
York, US businesses, charities, and other organizations spent $24.3
billion on direct-mail advertising to consumers and another $15
billion on business-to-business appeals. The group projects total
direct-mail spending will grow 6 percent annually through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pressure to break through mailbox clutter, membership
and subscription lists that suggest what causes and products people
like are one of the most prized sources for brokers who compile and
sell mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``mailing lists,'' the Boston Yellow Pages
includes more than 40 companies that offer access to up to 11,000
different lists covering 100 million US consumers and millions of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk Company, based in suburban Chicago, offers fund-raisers
and businesses a ``lifestyle selector'' product with 800 different
lists based on shopping and civic interests reported by more than
30 million people on questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   With direct mail costing 30 cents to $1 per piece, spending
money to solicit only the most likely prospects can be a very good
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Statlistics' Papalia said brokers are especially interested in
nonprofit member rosters because ``if you can find people who are
donors, they are always very good prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Science,
and the Children's Museum, which refuse to sell their lists but do
exchange them among themselves, are also attractive because ``the
presence of children in a household is a big factor'' in appealing
to some marketers, Papalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Most nonprofit groups allow members to specify that their name
will not be sold or exchanged. People can register with their local
post office or the Direct Marketing Association in New York to
refuse unsolicited mail, requests that reputable list brokers
promise to heed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, list brokers have an abundance of sources for mailing
information, and increasingly powerful computer programs to
cross-reference and mesh different lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 federal telecommunications act, White Page
listings are no longer considered telephone company property and
must be shared with other list publishers.
</P>
<P>
   List brokers can then fold in data from magazine subscription
lists, city and town real estate records, Census Bureau
neighborhood income and ethnicity data, certain credit bureau
records, many states' motor vehicle and boat registrations,
self-reported household income and interest data on product
warranty cards, and thousands of other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some states market their motor vehicle and driver's license
records, a treasure trove for list brokers, but a Massachusetts
``driver privacy protection'' law enacted in 1997 sharply limits
access to personal data.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``We couldn't give you a name of everybody who has
a Cadillac or a Volvo'' for purposes of soliciting wealthy people,
said J. Abra Degbor of the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But policies like those are little barrier to list brokers
determined to create detailed records on where you live, how much
money you presumably make, what you like to buy, and what causes
you support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everything is available these days,'' said Lyons,
the Waltham direct-mail consultant.

PARENTS OPT FOR RISKY TRANSPLANT TO HELP AILING BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERNE, N.Y. _ Even before he was born, Allen Wright had two
broken legs. His first night in the hospital, a nurse accidentally
broke his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Allen has had more than 30 major fractures, and
those are just the ones his parents, Penny and Kenny Wright, have
been able to count.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 2 1/2, suffers from a rare genetic bone defect called
osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because his bones are so weak, even a gentle hug could break his
back and ribs. Because there is no cure, doctors don't expect him
to survive his teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to get old enough to know that's he's
different,'' said his mother, Penny Wright, 27, in the living room
of the family's rural home in upstate New York. ``Things are
starting to bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's parents have stopped waiting for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, almost nine months ago, they gambled on a
controversial, experimental bone marrow treatment at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., that they hope will
reduce the number of fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment has been criticized by the Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Foundation, a research and advocacy group in Maryland, as being too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Penny and Kenny Wright believed they had no better option, even
though it meant putting their son through a grueling, and
potentially fatal, regimen of drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Other current treatments include stabilizing the bones with
rods, a surgical procedure that is available only to children with
milder forms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't walk, he doesn't crawl, he doesn't even lay on his
stomach. If we didn't try it, there's no hope, that's the way he's
going to be,'' Penny Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 Americans are believed to suffer
from osteogenesis imperfecta, an illness which can vary in
severity. Some people with the disease are just more apt to break
bones. Others die at birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a family history but there
is,'' said Heller An Shapiro, executive director of the foundation.
``It could be the clumsy uncle who is always breaking something.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many genetic disorders, the disease can be inherited from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is caused by the gene that normally produces
collagen, the connective tissue that lays the foundation for the
body's bones. In someone with osteogenesis imperfecta, that gene is
defective, either causing the body to produce too little or
weakened collagen.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a parent may carry the defective gene but not
have the disease. As in the case with Allen, it's a mutation and
neither parent carries the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wright learned her son had the disease during a routine
ultrasound during her eighth month of pregnancy. Doctors knew
something was wrong when they couldn't see the baby's legs. Further
analysis showed that his legs were broken and folded up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything I was supposed to during pregnancy,'' said
Penny Wright, who has two healthy daughters from a previous
marriage. ``I drank lots of water, I ate lots of fruits and
vegetables. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest time for the family was the first year after Allen's
birth. Besides trying to learn about a very rare disease, they also
struggled to cope with a baby who cried almost constantly from
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wright couldn't breast-feed him for fear of breaking
something. Like many parents of children with osteogenesis
imperfecta, she and Kenny, 32, were so nervous about picking him up
that they carried him around on a pillow. Even changing a diaper
made them fearful of breaking his legs or back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the blue,'' said Kenny Wright, a mechanic and
supervisor at Loretex Corp. in Guilderland, a company that makes
plastic products. ``We didn't know anything, just to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're more comfortable but no less careful. Because of
his brittle bones, the Wrights don't dare bounce their son on their
knees or cuddle him in their arms.

<P>
   Penny Wright said she's at least grateful her son has a good
personality to break up the long hours they spend alone together.
Because of his condition, even family members are reluctant to
babysit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to have lunch one day and not hear `Mom,''' said
Penny Wright, who openly admits she misses not being able to take
her son to play with children his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see other kids running around and playing, it gets
depressing,'' she said.

<P>
   The Wrights don't know for certain whether the experimental bone
marrow transplant has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Allen fell over and broke his left arm again.
During the seven months he was at St. Jude's recovering from the
transplant, he also suffered several setbacks, including two broken
legs and an arm.
</P>
<P>
   His parents still believe it's an improvement. ``The older he
gets, the more breaks he's going to get. If he gets 10 breaks in a
year, it's probably better than he would have done anyway,'' Penny
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jude paid the family's expenses to the hospital and the
living costs incurred during Penny and Allen's seven-month stay.
They're returning again this month for one of a series of
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind donor bone marrow in treating osteogenesis
imperfecta is to infuse the body with healthy cells needed to make
stronger bones. Though donor marrow isn't expected to cure the
genetic defect, it's hoped the procedure will help decrease the
number of fractures by building bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several leading medical specialists are critical of St.
Jude's lead researcher, Dr. Edwin Horwitz, who published the
results from an initial study, which showed improvements in three
transplant children, in the March issue of Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up letter to the journal, Dr. Joan C. Marini, a top
official at the National Institutes of Health, urged caution. The
panel of physicians on the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation's
Medical Advisory Council also issued a statement saying more
research is needed before any conclusions are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone marrow transplantation is one of several therapies that
is on the leading edge of OI research, but until we have more long
term results, we felt it necessary to urge caution,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny and Kenny Wright try not to think abut the future or pin
their hopes on possible cure. It's too painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' Penny Wright said. ``What's going to
happen is going to happen.''

GORE, QUAYLE LEAD PACK AS FODDER FOR LATE-NIGHT HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Did you hear the one about Al Gore? If not, you
probably haven't been watching late-night television.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have invented the Internet, but the vice president
can at least claim the distinction of being the top target for Jay
Leno, David Letterman and other late-night comedians looking for
laughs in Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been the butt of the joke at least 85 times so far this
year, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which
monitors the nightly gab fests. His closest competitor is former
Vice President Dan Quayle, with 72 hits, followed by apparent
Republican front-runner George W. Bush, with 23.
</P>
<P>
   Other White House hopefuls are in the single digits or do not
even register on the laugh meter. The nonpartisan media watchdog
group tracks jokes on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,'' the
``Late Show with David Letterman,'' ``Politically Incorrect with
Bill Maher'' and ``Late Night'' with Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late-night humor has always been a part of politics. You have
to have a sense of humor about these things,'' Roger Salazar,
Gore's campaign spokesman, said of the vice president's claim to
comedy fame. ``We tend not to focus on it over here because we have
a good candidate with good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts believe that there is a serious side to the
comedy circuit. Whether accurate or not, the one-dimensional image
fostered by late-night comedians can linger long after the laughter
stops. A 1996 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 26 percent
of adult Americans get at least some of their campaign news from
late-night TV. Those figures include Nightline as well as the less
serious shows.
</P>
<P>
   On average, more than 13 million viewers tune in to the four
top-rated shows every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comedian wants to tell a joke that nobody can remember.
They want a one-liner that people can repeat to their friends the
next day. They become sort of indelible,'' said Dan Amundson,
research director at the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``If
you've got some trait that's quirky or identifiable, it sticks with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it ever. Take Gore, for example _ please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley and Al Gore are running closer and closer
together in the polls,'' Leno recently told his audience. ``At this
point, the race could come down to who's first to make a facial
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno again: ``Al Gore, looking pretty tan lately. Actually, it's
not a real tan, it's that Murphy's Oil Soap. You know that stuff?
You rub it into wood to give it that gold finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore makes jokes about his stiff demeanor. When the
macarena was the rage, the vice president demonstrated his version
of the dance by standing as stiff as a statue.
</P>
<P>
   It could be worse. When you're running for president, it's far
better to be cast as wooden than dumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kind of embarrassing moment happened today,'' Leno said on
the 30th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing. ``When Dan Quayle
heard it was the anniversary of the moonwalk, he sent Michael
Jackson a telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Letterman offered his list of Quayle's top 10
complaints about Clinton. It included:
</P>
<P>
   No. 9: ``When I see him on the news and I wave to him, he
doesn't wave back.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 6: ``Passed over many qualified dumb guys to pick Al Gore as
vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his status as the GOP front-runner, Bush lags far behind
Gore and Quayle on the laugh track _ a fact that Quayle would like
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to have more jokes. He's got to get more Leno time,''
the former vice president told the comedian during a recent
``Tonight Show'' appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he hasn't said a whole lot,'' Leno explained.
``There's not much you can do. The jokes are about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them. Early last month, Letterman presented the top
10 ``skeletons in George W. Bush's closet.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 8: ``The `W' stands for `Winky.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No. 5: ``On April 9, 1968, actually had an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Leno mentioned the still-unfounded rumor that Bush was
once photographed dancing nude on a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear what his excuse was? He said it was casual
Friday,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cruelest joke of all is to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Mae West said it's better to be looked over than
overlooked,'' said Kate Clinton, a New York comedian who uses a lot
of political humor. ``At least people are talking about you.''

FORT CAUGHT IN CROSS FIRE OVER DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT BAKER, Calif. _ This elegant old place in the shadow of the
Golden Gate Bridge is too pretty for battle.
</P>
<P>
   The soft shoulders of Wolfback Ridge wrap around the parade
grounds and the classic white Army clapboard buildings on Murray
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The views from Horseshoe Bay are mesmerizing. Tread lightly near
the silver leaf lupine. It's the habitat of the endangered mission
blue butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Not a shot was fired here in a military history that began
before the Civil War. That could change as Fort Baker is developed
into a retreat in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, the National Park Service will release the
final environmental impact statement for the proposed development
of the fort, a 335-acre property being acquired from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Then begins the process of identifying prospective developers,
narrowing the list to a select few and inviting them to submit
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The single developer chosen must commit about $65 million to
restore the 28 historic buildings and operate them as a retreat,
and, along with ideally turning a profit, make Fort Baker
financially self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   There's no organized opposition to such development _ the Park
Service prefers ``retreat and learning center'' to ``conference
center'' _ for development is the salvation of the buildings. All
agree that the fort, listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, and its buildings are worthy of rehabilitation. The fight
is over the size of the project.
</P>
<P>
   For planning purposes, the Park Service evaluated a retreat in
three different sizes, with 275, 300 and 350 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in neighboring Sausalito and members of its citizens
task force on Fort Baker worry that a maximum build-out of 350
rooms (the government's ``worst-case scenario'') will bring
overwhelming traffic to the one-lane-in, one-lane-out fort at the
edge of the Bay. They fear it will complicate lives in Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Neill, the superintendent of the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area who is managing the transition, makes this pledge:
``The Park Service is committed to the smallest size conference or
retreat center that is economically viable.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, citing Park Service policy, will not grant two requests
Sausalito officials have repeatedly made: place an elected official
from the town on a review panel whose members will select the
developer, and release an economic analysis that describes the
upper-limit 350-room scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The review panel will be comprised of federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said he could not invite a vested interest to the table
where decisions are made, nor can he release a report that might
contain information that would give one competitor an advantage
over another. ``That is not a discourtesy to the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is skepticism in Sausalito, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the planning of a lot of projects for a very long
time, and whatever the maximum number is, that's what the applicant
goes for,'' said Robin Sweeny, a former four-term mayor of
Sausalito. ``Rarely do they come in and say, `If 350 rooms are
allowed, I'll take 200.' It doesn't happen that way, especially
when there is a dollar at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeny added, ``Traffic being what it is here, I think that
350-room number would just have to be lowered not only because of
the traffic, but because that is a relatively fragile place.''
</P>
<P>
   A 350-room retreat would be the largest hotel in Marin County by
far, noted Sausalito Mayor Amy Belser, who believes that 150 rooms
may be reasonable. Sausalito now has fewer than 200 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things most distressing to me is the (Park
Service's) unresponsiveness to peoples' wishes,'' Belser said.
``War is going to break out. It's only a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said that the Park Service is a preservation agency and
that it is the agency's job ``to protect and enhance the natural
and cultural resources and do it at level that does not impact
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the balance is delicate:
``The more you squeeze the number of rooms, the more the cost of
rooms goes up, and the more it becomes exactly what we don't want
to become _ an upscale corporate conference center.''
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service already controls all but 71 acres at the fort.
It is expected to take over the remainder, home of the 91st
Division, U.S. Army Reserve,. no later than Sept. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Park Service plan, the new Fort Baker, in addition to
the retreat, will continue to house the Bay Area Discovery Museum,
the highly praised hands-on learning emporium for children that
handles 186,000 annual visits. Even without a retreat, the museum
plans to grow from 37,000 square feet to 52,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Coast Guard Station Golden Gate, which has 22
full-time employees and 10 volunteers, will stay at Fort Baker. The
plan also calls for restoring the beach at Horseshoe Bay where
there is now a seawall, expanding the habitat for the mission blue
butterfly and extending the San Francisco Bay Trail through the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual developer, along with the Discovery Museum staff
and Park Service, will also be responsible for developing
exhibition materials that interpret the fort's military history and
the Park Service's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Fort Baker into a self-sustaining national
park, like the Presidio of San Francisco across the Bay, comes at a
parsimonious time for the Park Service. The government estimates it
would cost $3.54 billion to fix maintenance problems at national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Baker has deplorable electrical and sewer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Generators supplied power to the Army, the Bay Area Discovery
Museum and the Coast Guard station for 30 days this year when the
fort's electrical system failed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill has estimated that Fort Baker needs at least $12.5
million in infrastructure repairs.

BROSNAN, RUSSO RETURN TO `THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The question ``why?'' looms over the remake of
``The Thomas Crown Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the 1968 original was a hit, and goodness knows the studio
that owns the rights to it, MGM/UA, could use anything that looks
like an audience-proven concept these days. But the ultra-slick
caper romance's success was also due, in large part, to its
casting: Steve McQueen, at his movie star apogee, as the bored rich
guy turned super-crafty bank robber; and Faye Dunaway, fresh off
her phenomenal breakthrough in ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' as the
relentless insurance investigator who falls in love with her
thrill-seeking prey.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Norman Jewison, the '60s production was a
hodgepodge of then-hip cinematic effects that look almost laughable
now. The first ``Crown Affair'' is remembered, if at all, these
days for its abuse of split-screen technique and ``The Windmills of
Your Mind,'' Michel Legrand and Alan and Marilyn Bergman's vaguely
hallucinogenic, irritatingly catchy theme song.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Crown'' seems peculiarly wedded to the era in
which it was made. Yet something about the concept clearly clicks
with contemporary audiences, as the similarly plotted
``Entrapment'' proved earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Pierce Brosnan, the Irish actor who has revitalized the
James Bond franchise and made himself MGM/UA's most bankable star
in the process, saw other reasons for updating ``Crown'' to the
'90s. With producing partner Beau St. Clair, he's been developing
the remake for years. Brosnan ultimately convinced the
well-regarded actress Rene Russo (``Get Shorty,'' the last two
``Lethal Weapons'') and action director John McTiernan (the first
and third ``Die Hards,'' ``The Hunt for Red October'') of the
project's merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen the film when I was about 15 years of age, and it was
sort of the start of my education in and love of movies,'' Brosnan,
46, says of the first ``Crown.'' ``We watched it again, and I
thought that I had room to move within a retelling. ``I felt more
of an embellishment could be made on the love story, that this was
a man who has everything except love.''
</P>
<P>
   McTiernan stresses they weren't trying to do a remake. ``That's
usually a thing about `they did it wrong and we're going to do it
right.' We didn't have that sense because we all loved the original
movie. What I was aiming for was a movie that respected the first
one but was sort of a companion piece or a bookend. This is a
psychological character study, and that one was a prototype caper
film.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper character interaction between the new film's rich guy
art thief Crown and insurance investigator Catherine Banning was
the main attraction for Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets me about this Thomas Crown is the fact that he's
willing to try something different, to actually open himself in a
place that is really scary for him,'' Russo observes of Brosnan's
take on the wealthy playboy, who talks out his commitment-phobia
with a shrink (played, amusingly, by Dunaway) rather than
sublimates it as the McQueen incarnation did. ``That's real courage
to me, y'know? It's much harder to do that than it is to do any
daredevil sport, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Though based on Alan Trustman's 1960s script, the new film's
screenplay was purposely reworked by both a man, Kurt Wimmer
(``Sphere''), and a woman, Leslie Dixon (``Outrageous Fortune''),
to try to capture the full measure of two mature, very accomplished
but extremely self-guarded individuals reluctantly falling in love
with one another _ while their futures depend on totally opposite
outcomes to the art theft investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Looked good on paper. But actually bringing those tough emotions
to the screen was not easy, especially for Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times and the worst of times for me,''
admits the actress, a former supermodel who's won wide acclaim for
her action and comedy roles but hasn't really had a shot at serious
romantic drama. ``I was so fortunate to get a role like this
because, to be honest, I didn't think that would happen in my
career. But, emotionally, it was a little bit difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rene's stock-in-trade, as a star, was that she was this
gorgeous girl who acted like one of the guys,'' McTiernan explains.
``The tricky thing for her here was to put her gender back in the
equation, when what came with it was all sorts of deferential
behavior. I had to stop her from lowering her eyes or acting like
she was afraid a man she was confronting might blow up on her ...
So many tiny little portions of behavior that you have to go really
deep to find, and then reset that clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan's performance did not require so harrowing a process.
But it did pose a tricky challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved into a realm of stardom and personality acting that
I'm still coming to terms with,'' says Brosnan, who's success as a
suave hero in the Bond films and on TV's ``Remington Steele'' has
been counterbalanced by poor receptions of more dramatically
demanding work in such films as ``Mister Johnson,'' ``The
Deceivers'' and the McTiernan-directed ``Nomads.'' ``How do I fit
in there, and where do I fit in? I mean, I'll be known as James
Bond for the rest of my life. But you've just got to accentuate the
positive; that has opened up doors for me. I've never had the
luxury of working on a text like this `Thomas Crown.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierce hasn't changed,'' says McTiernan, who last worked with
Brosnan 13 years ago. ``He's about as gutsy as he was then, except
then he had nothing to lose, and now he's got all sorts of stuff to
lose. In this project, he was willing to make a shift from the
things that he's known for. People don't know how good of an actor
he is, and the technical task for an actor doing this is that it's
very hard to make James Bond and Thomas Crown different persons.
There are many things about them that seem to be similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pierce played a drooling hunchback or something, then you'd
know he was good and versatile,'' McTiernan continues. ``But it's a
small distance here. Yet he found ways to make Crown his own
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gutsy move on the producer's part _ at least in light of
current Hollywood convention _ was to cast the 45-year-old Russo as
Crown's sexy love interest. Older leading men romancing much
younger women has been a controversial movie staple in recent
years; the age variance between ``Entrapment'' stars Sean Connery
and Catherine Zeta-Jones, for example, was close to three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But not only do Brosnan and Russo make a sizzling,
age-appropriate couple in ``Crown Affair,'' she looks great in a
number of revealing scenes. Which isn't to say that performing
topless on a Caribbean beach was a tropical vacation for the
onetime cover girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``John showed me how he was going to shoot it, how the camera
was going to come around to get a side view and it would all be
very tastefully done,'' Russo says, laughing and blushing at the
same time. ``I'm like, ooh-kay. I'm sitting there holding in my
stomach, and when the camera came around, I was so stiff, I
couldn't do the scene. I froze! I could not be nude and act at the
same time, I needed to get more comfortable. I was OK with it by
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue isn't nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if the things that you do in movies will be
effective'' in terms of breaking ageist or gender barriers, Russo
notes. ``To tell you the truth, I don't think there are that many
movies you have to take your clothes off for. What I hope would
happen through this film, little by little, is that women over 40
would be thought of more often to play opposite men their own age.
Or younger!''
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan couldn't even imagine making ``Crown Affair'' with an
actress in her 20s. ``I wanted to do a mature story,'' he says,
``about a man and a woman who have seen the world, have loved the
world, have been hurt by the world. It would have been foolish to
go with someone younger who you don't believe has lived life.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only thing that makes the new ``Thomas Crown
Affair'' not only up to the minute but potentially forward-looking.
After all, in this age when Hollywood is being criticized
mercilessly for gratuitous brutality, how refreshing is it to see a
crime thriller with barely a hint of violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets shot,'' the man who's unleashed the Predator and
the pumped-up Bruce Willis on innocent audiences says, rather
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can build suspense and action with two things: How
does it affect the people in the story _ and if you get the
audience hooked with the people, whatever goes on will affect them
_ and how is it portrayed physically? Can you give it the nuance of
intensity that will involve people just as much as if you were
blowing things up?'' McTiernan says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, why hire a director known for big logistical
extravaganzas for what was, underneath its caper dressings, an
intimate love story?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew McT was a romantic,'' Brosnan says with a Cheshire
smile. ``For all his bravado, his posturing, his high-stepping
maleness, I knew in there was a heart of gold. This film was about
energy and a sensibility of intrigue, which I knew John could
deliver. But he also had a heart that could lend itself to the rest
of it.'' &QL;

NO COMPUTERS, NO PROBLEM: SMALL-TOWN TEXANS DON'T SWEAT Y2K
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAN JARVIS 
and JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the tiny town of Cool, where Linda O'Bannon runs the grocery
store, gas station and soon-to-open barbecue joint, preparing for
Y2K computer glitches is the last thing on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have a computer in this whole town,'' said
O'Bannon, who puts the population at 238.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, big cities are spending millions to make sure
that the drinking water does not become contaminated with sewage,
neighborhoods aren't plunged into darkness, and the world does not
come to a screeching halt Jan. 1, taking major computer systems
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But from Venus to Earth and back to Paradise, there are plenty
of Texans who have never heard of the notorious Y2K problem _ a
software limitation that could cause older computers to misread
2000 as 1900 and cause shutdowns _ and plenty who don't even care.
</P>
<P>
   In these small towns, residents rely more on a sharp pencil than
a slick PC, and the only thing they're doing in preparation for
2000 is buying a new calendar.
</P>
<P>
   O'Bannon, who acknowledges that she is not big on technology,
can click off all the possible troubles that she is confident will
never hit Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Automated teller machines, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm it,'' she said between heating tamales and ringing up
customer purchases at her little roadside convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody out here has septic tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Street lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thankful our gas pumps didn't go to computers; they're
old-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got telephone service, but no caller ID, so you have to
answer the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the government agencies, utility companies and businesses
spend zillions to guard against massive power failures, stock
market crashes or bedlam in the streets; in Cool, they're not
spending a dime on Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cool might easily bypass any Y2K worries, 4 miles down
the road in Millsap, population 485, the computer age has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the city bought its first and only personal computer,
said Mary Dickson, Millsap city secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready to run with the big dogs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dickson still does the books by hand and keeps the
City Council records in a notebook. So, in Millsap, Y2K is no big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine, because we do things the old way,'' she said. ``We
haven't had a computer long enough to become dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of other cities have. More than halfway through the
year, most of the nation's largest cities have not finished efforts
to make their computers ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Among America's 21 biggest cities, only Dallas and Boston are
prepared for the year 2000 computer challenge, according to a
recent U.S. General Accounting Office report. In Fort Worth, where
the city is spending $2.3 million on compliance, ``mission critical
systems'' are 99 percent ready.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the problem in some cases requires a financial investment
large enough to buy the entire contents of small Texas towns such
as Cool. Protecting the state's computers, for example, is expected
to cost $280 million, according to a report released by Comptroller
Carole Keeton Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   When everything from replacing PCs to overtime is calculated,
the cost of making Arlington, Texas, Y2K compliant could range from
$2 million to $4 million, said City Auditor Umesh Dalal. He is
confident that Arlington is prepared for Y2K but is in the process
of an audit that will address the issue. Denton County is budgeting
$523,000 for Y2K computer repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Big cities depend on computers to operate traffic lights,
dispatch police and firefighters, open security doors and operate
sewer systems. Computers also run payrolls, track taxes and manage
fleets of city vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But little towns all over the country are truly clueless about
Y2K, said Cathy Moyer, co-founder of the Cassandra Project, a
community preparedness and contingency planning organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, people in a small community have a higher degree
of self- reliance and are well-positioned psychologically to deal
with whatever happens with Y2K,'' she said. ``But by the same
token, small communities don't have the expertise, awareness or
understanding of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Fruitvale, an East Texas town of 349 where cows
outnumber computers, things are done the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have services,'' said Mayor Bea Whisenhunt, who does
transfer a few city records to diskette on her personal computer.
``When I'm not here, I'll just pass that disk along.''
</P>
<P>
   Automated traffic control systems can cause major concerns in
large cities, but in places such as the West Texas town of Roby,
population 616, there's no need to worry, said City Manager Claude
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have one street light here in town, and it's not on a
date-sensitive system,'' he said. ``The water pumps are on a manual
system. We pump it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venus, a one-light town of 650, City Secretary Glenda Laseman
does not exactly embrace the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   But before the year is through, the city will probably invest
several thousand in updating its two old computers, said Laseman,
who's retiring this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise will also go unscathed by the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one light, and it's the state's,'' said Teresa Moody,
city secretary. ``And we're on a well system with a flat rate. Our
water bills are done by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Garner, the water clerk/secretary in the Panhandle town
of Earth, said the Y2K glitch is ``kind of spooky,'' but she's sure
the city of 1,227 will not have any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small town, and we have one light _ it's a blinking
red light,'' she said. ``If you can't read that or stop signs,
you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellman boasts its own computer, but the sole municipal employee
in the West Texas town is a little dubious about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until about two months ago, I was using a 1987 TI
computer,'' but it conked out, said City Secretary Vickie
Whitfield. ``So the gin loaned us another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know if it's Y2K compliant,'' she said, adding that
she uses the computer to reconcile city bank statements. ``I don't
think it is. It ``is'' old.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' she said. ``I been trying to get 'em to get
me another one.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not, however, entirely out of touch technologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have us a mayor that's got him a Harley,'' Whitfield
said.

<P>
   ``We got one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thankful our gas pumps didn't go to computers; they're
old-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got telephone service, but no caller ID, so you have to
answer the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the government agencies, utility companies and businesses
spend zillions to guard against massive power failures, stock
market crashes or bedlam in the streets; in Cool, they're not
spending a dime on Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cool might easily bypass any Y2K worries, 4 miles down
the road in Millsap, population 485, the computer age has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the city bought its first and only personal computer,
said Mary Dickson, Millsap city secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready to run with the big dogs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dickson still does the books by hand and keeps the
City Council records in a notebook. So, in Millsap, Y2K is no big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine, because we do things the old way,'' she said. ``We
haven't had a computer long enough to become dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of other cities have. More than halfway through the
year, most of the nation's largest cities have not finished efforts
to make their computers ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Among America's 21 biggest cities, only Dallas and Boston are
prepared for the year 2000 computer challenge, according to a
recent U.S. General Accounting Office report. In Fort Worth, where
the city is spending $2.3 million on compliance, ``mission critical
systems'' are 99 percent ready.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the problem in some cases requires a financial investment
large enough to buy the entire contents of small Texas towns such
as Cool. Protecting the state's computers, for example, is expected
to cost $280 million, according to a report released by Comptroller
Carole Keeton Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   When everything from replacing PCs to overtime is calculated,
the cost of making Arlington, Texas, Y2K compliant could range from
$2 million to $4 million, said City Auditor Umesh Dalal. He is
confident that Arlington is prepared for Y2K but is in the process
of an audit that will address the issue. Denton County is budgeting
$523,000 for Y2K computer repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Big cities depend on computers to operate traffic lights,
dispatch police and firefighters, open security doors and operate
sewer systems. Computers also run payrolls, track taxes and manage
fleets of city vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But little towns all over the country are truly clueless about
Y2K, said Cathy Moyer, co-founder of the Cassandra Project, a
community preparedness and contingency planning organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, people in a small community have a higher degree
of self- reliance and are well-positioned psychologically to deal
with whatever happens with Y2K,'' she said. ``But by the same
token, small communities don't have the expertise, awareness or
understanding of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Fruitvale, an East Texas town of 349 where cows
outnumber computers, things are done the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have services,'' said Mayor Bea Whisenhunt, who does
transfer a few city records to diskette on her personal computer.
``When I'm not here, I'll just pass that disk along.''
</P>
<P>
   Automated traffic control systems can cause major concerns in
large cities, but in places such as the West Texas town of Roby,
population 616, there's no need to worry, said City Manager Claude
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have one street light here in town, and it's not on a
date-sensitive system,'' he said. ``The water pumps are on a manual
system. We pump it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venus, a one-light town of 650, City Secretary Glenda Laseman
does not exactly embrace the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   But before the year is through, the city will probably invest
several thousand in updating its two old computers, said Laseman,
who's retiring this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise will also go unscathed by the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one light, and it's the state's,'' said Teresa Moody,
city secretary. ``And we're on a well system with a flat rate. Our
water bills are done by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Garner, the water clerk/secretary in the Panhandle town
of Earth, said the Y2K glitch is ``kind of spooky,'' but she's sure
the city of 1,227 will not have any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small town, and we have one light _ it's a blinking
red light,'' she said. ``If you can't read that or stop signs,
you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellman boasts its own computer, but the sole municipal employee
in the West Texas town is a little dubious about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until about two months ago, I was using a 1987 TI
computer,'' but it conked out, said City Secretary Vickie
Whitfield. ``So the gin loaned us another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know if it's Y2K compliant,'' she said, adding that
she uses the computer to reconcile city bank statements. ``I don't
think it is. It ``is'' old.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' she said. ``I been trying to get 'em to get
me another one.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not, however, entirely out of touch technologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have us a mayor that's got him a Harley,'' Whitfield
said.

KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON SAID TO BE MULLING EVENTUAL RUN FOR
GOVERNORSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She has been called ambitious, thoughtful,
tenacious, glamorous, and even a survivor. But will she be called
governor?
</P>
<P>
   The talk in political circles in Washington and Austin is that
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is pondering a run for the
governorship should Gov. George W. Bush take up residence in the
White House in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz is that she is interested, and usually there is some
reason for the buzz,'' said Austin political consultant Bill
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hutchison wants nothing to do with the speculation
on her political future. Through a spokeswoman, she said that her
only focus is on winning re-election to the Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican insiders can't seem to stop considering the many
ways in which a Bush presidency would alter the political landscape
in Texas. As the governor's lead in the polls grows, so does the
list of names being tossed around for nearly every elected position
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the political game that typifies the start of
every campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more popular Bush becomes nationally, the more ambitions
seem to be stirring down here for all sorts of offices,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime topic of interest is the governor's job, and observers
say that Hutchison, despite her immense popularity in Texas, would
be in for a battle for the post with GOP Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Some other names are also being thrown into the hat for the
governor's race, including those of Republican state Comptroller
Carol Rylander and Land Commissioner David Dewhurst. For the
Democrats, former Land Commissioner Garry Mauro may take another
shot, and former Comptroller John Sharp is considered a candidate.
Also mentioned is Houston businessman Paul Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   If Hutchison, who just turned 56, ends up as governor, the rumor
mill also has several Texas House members interested in her job,
including Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth. And whoever asks for the
appointment could be facing such high-profile competition as former
Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and retired Texas Rangers
pitcher Nolan Ryan, just inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a possible political scenario: Should Bush win the White
House in November 2000, the popular Perry would ascend to the top
state job in 2001 and sit in the governor's chair until the next
gubernatorial election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Hutchison would have the daunting task of
beating out a sitting governor from her own party. Even attempting
such a move would be almost sure to rile GOP leaders in Texas and
give national Republican leaders reason to worry about the security
of a major Senate seat they had considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing that would be a nightmare for the
Republican Party,'' said Earl Black, professor of political science
at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in the party in Texas would prefer that
major officeholders not run against each other, particularly if
Bush is successful and Perry becomes governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Black added that Hutchison's popularity is substantial
statewide and that the GOP owes her a debt of gratitude for
toughing it out at times politically and proving to conservative
women in Texas that they can survive even the harshest political
battles and come out winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP has really benefited from having Kay Bailey Hutchison
emerge as a symbol of a successful female candidate,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has been in the Senate since 1993, when she ran
against appointed incumbent Bob Krueger, a former House member. She
won with 67 percent of the vote, the biggest whipping a challenger
has laid on an incumbent in Texas political history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has made a name for herself by raising her voice
on national security issues and pushing through several
high-profile initiatives, such as an anti-stalking bill and a tax
break for homemakers. She also made a prominent speech at the GOP
presidential convention, and her name was mentioned as a possible
running mate for nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   David Hill, a GOP pollster from The Woodlands, said that
Hutchison, despite Perry's leg up, would be a viable candidate for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, save for Governor Bush, she is probably the most
popular elected official in Texas,'' Hill said. He added that
Hutchison's penchant for working hard on issues that affect Texas
communities, such as defense weapons or base closings, gives her
high marks with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the one Republican, besides Bush, who has crossover
appeal to Democrats. She has an `everyman's' touch on policy
issues. She comes across less `wonkish' than some of the men do.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, a primary against Perry would be a battle. Fellow
Republicans in Austin have praised Perry for his first Legislative
session after following Democrat Bob Bullock as presiding officer
of the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mastered this job. You kept the Senate together at a lot
of times when it could have fallen apart,'' he was told by Sen.
Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant on the final night of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has said little about his ambitions for the Governor's
Mansion. Most observers in Austin believe that he wants the job. A
few say he has not made up his mind and doesn't know if he would
want to take on Hutchison in wake of what is likely to be a
landslide victory in her 2000 Senate campaign. One insider said
Perry might prefer to let Hutchison run for governor in 2002 in
exchange for her appointing him to her vacant Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, if she became governor, would further her political
resume for a step onto the national stage once Bush leaves office.
Many believe that she aspires to the presidency. In 1998, she
acknowledged to Ladies' Home Journal that she may run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a scenario in the year 2004, where there could
be a fair shot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Austin consultant, said the prospects of a bloody
fight with Perry would not be enough to deter Hutchison if she
thought the governor's job would help her win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way she gets there is by running over Rick Perry, and
that is going to take a pretty big vehicle,'' he said. ``But I
don't underestimate her. If she sets her sights on a goal, she is
pretty successful in achieving it. If she thought she could do it,
I think she would run.''

LOW-BUDGET `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' SCARES UP BIG PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FILMS-HORROR) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The line is filled with hip pre-twentysomethings _ a
sea of soul patches, piercings, tattoos and adolescent attitude.
But above the oppressive heat and humidity so thick it makes your
legs sweat, a sense of frothing anticipation lingers over the crowd
winding down the sidewalk and around the corner outside Landmark's
Inwood Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   There's a frantic rush for seats once the doors are opened.
Lively chatter and sporadic cell-phone conversations echo off the
walls while the coming attractions unspool. But once the title
credits for ``The Blair Witch Project'' come up, the
too-cool-for-school set falls into an unusually heavy silence as a
new horror legend is born.
</P>
<P>
   So why, in a summer laden with expensive, effects-filled flicks
about mutant sharks, killer crocodiles and haunted houses, is a
grainy, no-budget, badly filmed mock documentary scaring the pants
off so many moviegoers? Because the film has borrowed an even
bigger concept from the masters of the genre, namely that horror
needn't cost an arm and a leg to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason studios have consistently returned to horror
pictures to refill their coffers. It's why every studio worth its
salt hopped on the horror bandwagon three years ago once Wes Craven
proved with ``Scream'' that a clever, teen-tailored slasher film
could make a mint. And it's why most struggling filmmakers cut
their teeth in horror for their first effort, to avoid losing their
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I'd never felt much attraction to making horror
films,'' said director Sam Raimi, whose ``Evil Dead'' pictures have
become genre staples. ``I like those nutty Jerry Lewis comedies. I
just thought horror films were the safest ways to break even or
come out ahead. It seems that no matter how bad they are, they make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't expect to find ``Phantom Menace''-ing lines
outside a $20,000 indie made by five University of Central Florida
graduates, but ever since ``Blair Witch'' blipped on the pop
culture radar after wowing crowds and critics at this year's
Sundance Film Festival, a healthy diet of Internet hype (the
official Web site has received more than 32 million hits), creative
trailering and nonstop TV spots has infected millions with
``Witch'' fever.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly due to the film's limited availability. Since
``Blair Witch'' opened July 16, it's been playing on only 27
screens nationwide, earning an average of $55,000-$65,000 per
screen (by comparison, ``Eye's Wide Shut'' earned an average of
$9,000 per screen its opening weekend).
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected it to be big, but I don't know if we expected it
to be this big,'' said the Inwood's manager, Tearlach Hutcheson.
``It's breaking records left, right and center. It's the biggest
film we've ever had and probably the most hectic film for us.''
Tickets for weekend screenings at Dallas' Inwood Theatre were sold
out days early _ even on a Monday afternoon, two evening screenings
were sold out before noon. The film's first week, Friday through
Thursday, pulled in more than $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the movie has opened wide, the fever is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Originality is a large piece of the puzzle. Most of this year's
lineup of horror yarns tread on all-too-familiar ground. ``Lake
Placid'' and ``Deep Blue Sea'' are a resurfacing of ``Jaws.''
Upcoming pictures like ``Lost Souls'' and ``Stigmata'' possess
similar story lines to ``The Exorcist.'' ``The Sixth Sense'' and
``A Stir of Echoes'' channel ``The Dead Zone.'' And ``The
Haunting,'' ``Sleepy Hollow'' and ``The House on Haunted Hill'' all
resurrect horror classics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Witch,'' a piece of fictional folklore about three
young documentary filmmakers who disappear in the Maryland woods
while researching a local legend, isn't without its predecessors.
(For proof, search out a copy of ``The Legend of Boggy Creek'' or
Larry Buchanan's 1960 feature debut ``The Naked Witch.'') There are
no new stories, after all, just new ways of rehashing them, and
``Blair Witch's'' clever stunt of presenting the picture as footage
spliced together from film canisters and video cassettes retrieved
from the woods after the teens' disappearances is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're such a video generation and we're used to seeing stuff
like `America's Funniest Home Videos,' so there's something about
the use of video that gives a verisimilitude to that,'' said John
Wooley, author of the books ``Hot Schlock Horror'' and the new
``Forever Lounge.'' His film ``Cafe Purgatory,'' which he co-wrote
and produced, makes its world premiere at the Fort Worth Film
Festival in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the subjective camera has a lot to do with it.
Everybody's been behind the lens of a video camera and seen how
it's both real and unreal looking through that lens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, dark fiction's biggest movie successes are the films
made for practically nothing that subsequently reaped millions and
spawned a healthy franchise worth of sequels. In Raimi's case, his
splatterfest ``Evil Dead'' zombie trilogy earned him enough
box-office clout to move into more mainstream fare, including his
most recent movie, the Oscar-nominated ``A Simple Plan,'' with Bill
Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   And the financial success of this unexpected gold mine almost
guarantees that we haven't seen the last of ``Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In two years, it won't seem original at all because everybody
will knock it off, including Hollywood,'' Wooley said. ``Every good
low-budget idea has been co-opted by Hollywood. And they'll do
this, too _ you could just see Jennifer Love Hewitt running through
the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows are the unmistakable pitfalls of big box-office
indies: studio interference, bigger attention to the bottom line
and more cooks to muck up the broth than you can shake a spoon at.
</P>
<P>
   Raimi learned it the hard way while shooting his first studio
picture, 1990's ``Darkman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest difference between working on an
independent release and collaborating with a studio,'' Raimi said.
``I think you lose a lot of the director's personal signature, and
you wind up with a generic product instead of an individual one.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's hardly surprising that the genre's most
successful and influential pictures are ones in which directors
made their personal signatures stand out. John Carpenter's
``Halloween,'' George Romero's ``Night of the Living Dead'' and Wes
Craven's ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' were all made on the cheap,
all followed by successful sequels and are all still considered to
be their director's greatest achievements.
</P>
<P>
   So why are lavishly budgeted pictures like ``The Haunting'' and
``Lake Placid'' with garish sets, animatronic creatures, big-name
Hollywood talent and full access to the latest computer-generated
wizardry almost as lifeless as their phantom creations? The lack of
resources not only fuels creativity, but, according to Wooley, is
also an essential ingredient in horror films.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horror picture by its very nature is not supposed to be a
big-budget picture,'' Wooley said. ``It's supposed to be a little
subversive picture that does things that the big pictures won't do.
Horror is supposed to be disreputable for it to work. It works when
it's a bunch of no-name people running around in something that is
obviously low-budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But the world of low-budget filmmaking also forces filmmakers to
make something with nothing, which inevitably leads them back to an
oft-neglected golden rule: Less is more.
</P>
<P>
   ``About once a generation, people discover that (producer Val
Lewton) was really right: The stuff that you don't see is scarier
than the stuff that you see. It always is,'' Wooley said, referring
to Lewton classics like 1942's ``Cat People,'' and 1943's ``The
Leopard Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so thrilled to see this because I'd about given up on
horror movies,'' Wooley said of ``Blair Witch's'' success. ``And
I'm so pleased to see a cheap, subversive, little picture come out
and just scare the hell out of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the theater, the lights fade up and the teen-age bravado
returns in force. Playful dismissals and complaints about
cheesiness ensue, but as the crowd files out into the muggy,
evening air, it's apparent that at least some folks are clearly
shaken. The big-talkers will have to wait for ``Blair Witch'' to
catch up with them later. At home. Alone. In the dark.

10 FILMS SO GOOD, IT'S SCARY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies FILM-BLAIR WITCH) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a look at the top 10 most influential, low-budget modern
horror films:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Halloween'': This 1978 horror classic from director John
Carpenter was made for a scant $300,000 and spawned six sequels and
myriad imitators, including the entire ``Friday the 13th''
franchise. Credited with inventing the slasher genre, ``Halloween''
remains a powerfully frightening seasonal treasure thanks to the
creation of its unstoppable killer, Michael Meyers, who stalks
Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends on All Hallow's Eve. Carpenter's
score is almost as haunting as Meyers himself.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Night of the Living Dead'': George Romero's 1968
feature-film debut single-handedly redefined the horror genre. Shot
on a shoestring, the film's cost-cutting measures (it was shot on
dark sets in black and white 'cause the film was cheaper) actually
add to its effectiveness, making the eye think it sees more than is
really there. The story follows seven people stranded in a remote
farmhouse surrounded by flesh-eating zombies awakened by some
unexplained phenomenon. Countless zombie flicks followed, but none
better than Romero's own sequel 11 years later, the equally classic
``Dawn of the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'': In this 1984 chiller, Wes
Craven created one of the greatest villains in cinema history,
Freddy Krueger, a high school janitor who murdered children and was
then burned alive by vengeful neighborhood parents. But he again
returns to kill their children, this time in their dreams. Followed
by five sequels, each of the ``Nightmare'' films benefited from
stylish and original dream sequences that effectively captured the
fears felt in nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'': The title alone earned this
1974 Tobe Hooper film an unforgettable reputation. A group of teens
encounters a clan of cannibals in remote Texas and is quick to turn
up on the menu. Far less graphic than it was rumored to be,
Hooper's film debut remains one of the most unnervingly
claustrophobic and creepy efforts to hit screens. Like ``Blair
Witch,'' the story borrows from real life, namely the exploits of
serial killer Ed Gein.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Phantasm'': Don Cosarelli's 1979 effective blend of sci-fi
and horror is frightening on a number of levels. Angus Scrimm is
imposing as the creepy undertaker whose nighttime activities
attract the attention of a pair of brothers. And who can ever
forget those flying, silver, skull-drilling orbs that patrol the
mortuary, turning trespassers into human blood fountains. Scary
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Re-Animator'': Director Stuart Gordon's 1985 adaptation of
an H.P. Lovecraft story was one of the most pleasantly over-the-top
shockers of the decade. Insanely gory, surprisingly sexy and grimly
hilarious, the film stars Jeffrey Combs as demented egotist Herbert
West, an overly ambitious medical student who creates a serum that
reanimates the dead. Combs and David Gale duel to the death for the
title of ``most scenery chewed.'' The sequel, 1990's ``Bride of
Re-Animator,'' was even grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Evil Dead'': Though Sam Raimi's 1989 gorefest (made for
about $90,000) isn't all that scary, it's certainly frighteningly
outrageous. Bruce Campbell is one of five college students who
become zombie chow in a remote woodland cabin. The film's energetic
cinematography and an endless stream of gushing blood and goo
inspired writer Stephen King to call it ``the most ferociously
original horror film of the year ...'' ``Evil Dead'' and its even
more outrageous sequel also kick-started Raimi's career: His last
film was the nonhorror thriller ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   8. ``2,000 Maniacs'': Director Herschell Gordon Lewis is dubbed
``the Godfather of Gore'' for good reason. His graphic independent
films, which make ample use of butcher-shop remnants, certainly
aren't for the squeamish. This 1964 effort is one of his best,
centering on a Brigadoon-esque Southern town wiped out during the
Civil War. Every 100 years, the town reappears for a little savage
revenge on visiting Yankee tourists.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``The Legend of Boggy Creek'': One of ``Blair Witch's'' true
ancestors, this 1972 docudrama brought to life a number of stories
surrounding a Bigfoot creature that supposedly inhabited the swamps
of rural Arkansas. It spawned two sequels and a number of ``true
story'' films as well as TV shows like the docu-series ``In Search
of.''
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Friday the 13th'': Laugh if you want, but there's a good
reason Sean Cunningham's 1980 slasher yarn about teen-agers
butchered at summer camp spawned so many sequels (eight by my
count, with a ``Jason vs. Freddy'' story in the works). It's the
film that made everyone afraid to go back into the woods, and it
also invented most of the ingredients we now affectionately refer
to as cliches _ morality-based murder, a climbing body count and
the inevitable parade of corpses at the film's conclusion. And you
gotta admit you sure didn't see that ending coming.

ARROGANCE, BUT NO PEACE, IN BALKANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton went to Sarajevo the other day and patted
himself on the back for bringing peace _ or what passes for peace
in that part of the world _ to Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough of ethnic cleansing,'' Clinton proclaimed
after meeting with other leaders to discuss the current state of
affairs in the ever-volatile Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   That comment earns Clinton the understatement-of-the-month
award. Of course we've had enough of ethnic cleansing, which is why
the United States intervened in the Bosnian war back in 1995 and
joined forces with other NATO countries to stop Serbian aggression
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton didn't mention was that America's one-year
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is now in its fourth year, with no
sign of concluding _ and that the just-begun peacekeeping effort in
Kosovo is equally open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also neglected to mention that the newly rescued
Albanians in Kosovo have begun an ethnic cleansing campaign of
their own against the Serbs in retaliation for the Serbs'
persecution of Albanians. This is how these folks have operated for
centuries: Whichever ethnic, religious or political group is up
sets out to slaughter the group that is down.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Clinton went on television to drum up support for
his bombing campaign against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic?
Remember how he said that all this killing and uprooting of
innocent people in the Balkans was too horrible to tolerate and
that we simply had to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
   Remember how he said that the world's lone remaining superpower
couldn't stand by doing nothing and explain away our lack of
involvement by saying, ``That's the way those people are''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's a news flash: That's the way those people are.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows it. NATO knows it. Surely anyone who didn't know
it must be figuring it out now that the much-abused ethnic
Albanians are taking advantage of NATO's so-called peace to turn
the tables on those murderous Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The commander in chief has put American and other NATO forces in
the extremely uncomfortable position of serving as protectors of
the Serbs, who until recently were the enemy. And just what are the
good guys supposed to do if they happen upon some vengeful
Albanians slaughtering Serbs and torching their homes? Should the
peacekeepers intervene on the side of the Serbs and start shooting
the ethnic Albanians whom they were sent into this snake pit to
protect?
</P>
<P>
   No, Clinton didn't mention any of that. He talked about what a
great job he's done in bringing this phony peace to a part of the
world where periods of peace last for approximately the blink of an
eye in comparison to centuries of war.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton was in Sarajevo bragging about how well things
are going, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was driving around
Yugoslavia, accepting the accolades of grateful Albanians. Angry
Serbs, on the other hand, greeted Albright by booing, hissing and
spitting on her motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It surely is just a matter of time before our peacekeepers find
themselves fighting for their lives _ unless, of course, Clinton
can muster up the courage and foresight to remove them from the
deepening quagmire. It would be easy enough to declare their
mission accomplished and bring them home _ or deploy them to some
trouble spot where they might have half a chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   American intrusion in the Balkans can never succeed because it's
exactly that _ an intrusion into a situation that is none of
America's business. If these people have been unable to settle
their differences over the last 600 years or so, how arrogant
and/or misguided does a president of the United States have to be
to imagine that he can settle them by dropping some bombs on
Belgrade?
</P>
<P>
   That's our president for you: William ``Arrogant and Misguided''
Jefferson Clinton. He has raised presidential arrogance from a mere
annoyance to a veritable art form.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, he has to leave in less than 18 months.

FORT WORTH'S AMON CARTER MUSEUM CLOSES FOR $36-MILLION EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By AIMEE COURTICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Robert Teague took one last stroll Sunday
through the museum that has awed him since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime resident of Fort Worth, Teague, 31, was among more
than 2,500 visitors who came to the Amon Carter Museum over the
weekend for a final visit before it closed for extensive
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here so many times,'' he said. ``The architecture
and design of the museum has always been a favorite of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is renowned for its American Art collection, which
has grown from 400 to 300,000 holdings since it opened in 1961. It
is beginning a $36 million expansion that will triple the size of
its gallery space.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will reopen in fall of 2001. The new facility will
add 85,000 square feet and have a 170-seat auditorium, larger
museum store, library and research space. The building's original
facade, with its dramatic view of the downtown Fort Worth skyline,
will remain.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm glad there will be a newer building, but it's a shame to
have to see this one go,'' Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, when I have a free day, I make the rounds in the
cultural district. I like art and there's usually something good to
see here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary location called the Carter Downtown will open Sept.
18 at 500 Commerce St. It will display about 30 works of art at a
time and have a museum store. It will also display models and
information about the expansion project. Admission will be free.
</P>
<P>
   The museum had more than three times the usual number of weekend
visitors yesterday and Saturday. They got to see behind the scenes
at the museum on guided and self-guided, said Bob Workman,
associate director for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped we'd have a good turnout and we're not
disappointed,'' Workman said.
</P>
<P>
   Red arrows on the floor throughout the museum led patrons to
areas usually not open to the public, including the art vaults and
the studio where art is prepared for display.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Berry, 26, said she had not been to the museum for
about 10 years and looked forward to exploring beyond the
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's neat they've opened up all the places you
couldn't go before,'' she said. ``You feel a little adventurous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Debbie Piland of Arlington strolled through the museum
with their sons, John Mark, 7, and Matthew, 5, on the self-guided
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our boys have never been to an art museum,'' she said. ``I
wanted to expose them to it. When we heard it was closing, we
wanted to come take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Myers, chief curator for the museum, spent time yesterday
in the museum's main vault, explaining to visitors the stringent
climate requirements for storing art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very rewarding to speak one-on-one with the public
who have a variety of interests with the museum,'' she said.

   Big Stones and Small
</P>
<P>
   Q. Farmers often have to clear their fields of big stones. Is
this because the stones keep working their way up?
</P>
<P>
   A. Physicists say it is not so much that big stones work their
way up as it is that smaller particles work their way down.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have long known that in a mix of large and small
objects, the large ones tend to end up higher while the small ones
end up lower. This holds true whether the substance is powder,
cornflakes, nuts or fieldstone, and regardless of the texture,
shape or weight of the particles.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1987, however, that scientists at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh published the results of a
simulation study that appears to explain why this happens.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists created a computer model based on particles left
to interact with each other completely at random. With each shake
of a simulated container, the particles bounce a little, lose
energy and settle down again. As particles bounce upward, gaps open
up beneath them, sometimes large gaps, sometimes small, with small
gaps much more common.
</P>
<P>
   As the particles fall, a small particle can move down into
either a large or small gap, while a large particle can move down
only if many small particles happen to have moved out of the way.
That happens, but not often. So over time, the small particles tend
to head downward and the large particles upward.

SUCCESS OF TOILET TRAINING TECHNIQUE STILL A MATTER OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way or another, we all learn how to use the toilet when
nature calls. But the routes taken to achieve that critical
milestone have varied greatly through the years. The passive,
let-the-child-tell-you-when-it's-time approach that prevailed at
the turn of the century was discarded in the 1920s and 1930s in
favor of a rigid method dictated by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Dr. Benjamin Spock, who rejected absolute rules for
toilet training with a warning that rushed, rigid training could
fail and lead to behavioral problems. Parents were instead advised
to observe their toddlers for signs of toilet readiness. In 1962,
Dr. T. Berry Brazelton formalized this child-oriented approach,
which has prevailed since.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the flexible Spock-Brazelton approach, the age at
which children achieve freedom from diapers has risen sharply. In
1957, 92 percent of 18-month-olds were toilet trained; now just 2
percent are trained by age 2 and only 60 percent by age 3.
</P>
<P>
   Not until age 4 are nearly all children _ 98 percent _ out of
diapers. Diaper companies have responded and now anticipate a
multibillion-dollar market in super-size disposable diapers
suitable for 3- and 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Modern parents who are even remotely aware of current views on
child development are understandably reluctant to return to toilet
training techniques and timetables controlled by parents. But for a
growing number of parents who work outside the home, the
laissez-faire approach to toilet training has caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may be unable to devote the six or seven months it
usually takes to complete toilet training. And toddlers cared for
during the day by baby sitters or in day care often lack
consistency in training techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting confusion can lead to training delays and even
resistance to training. And because many day care and most
preschool settings insist that children be toilet trained, parents
are often conflicted about whose needs should come first.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics stands behind the
child-oriented approach, warning parents not to push children into
toilet training.
</P>
<P>
   The developmental stage at which training usually starts is
characterized by increasing pressure to conform to the expectations
of parents and society and the child's growing need for
self-realization and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the Massachusetts Caring for Children Foundation and
Boston Children's Hospital note that at this self-realization
stage, ``parental control over the child to train, concurrent with
the child's will to be in control, leads to conflict and anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Power struggles often ensue, and those can damage the
parent-child relationship and may lead to physical complications
that interfere with bladder and bowel control, the experts add.
</P>
<P>
   Because children develop at their own pace, the first step is to
determine if your child is ready to begin toilet training. Studies
indicate that many children whose training begins before 18 months
are not fully trained until after age 4, whereas those started at
age 2 are nearly always trained by age 3.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers ready to be trained must be ``bladder-ready,'' which
means they void large amounts at a time, remain dry for several
hours at a time and are aware of their need to void. Developmental
clues to toilet readiness, which typically appear between the ages
of 18 months and 2{ years, include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _The child can walk and is ready to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   _The child can pull his or her pants down and up.
</P>
<P>
   _The child can imitate parental behavior.
</P>
<P>
   _The child expresses an interest in toilet training, perhaps by
following parents into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _The child can indicate that he or she is ``going'' in a diaper
and then when he or she needs to ``go.''
</P>
<P>
   _The child is beginning to put things where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   _The child demonstrates independence by saying ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is critical. Training should not be tried when the child
is ill or under stress of a major life change: a new sibling, new
home, parental separation, etc. Nor should parents succumb to
outside pressures to start training.
</P>
<P>
   If the parent is anxious about it, the child will be, too. If
the child is feeling too pressured to become trained, he or she may
start withholding urine or stools, which can cause physical
problems like sphincter malfunction, constipation and painful
movements that impede training. If you encounter serious resistance
to training, wait a few months and try again.
</P>
<P>
   If the child becomes constipated or passes hard, dry stools, cut
back on milk, add fiber to the child's diet and give the child a
stool softener.
</P>
<P>
   For physiological and practical reasons, each child should be
given his or her own potty chair that is kept near the spot the
child spends most of the day or is moved around as needed. For the
first few days, the child sits on the potty fully clothed while you
explain what it's for and when to use it. Then, when the child is
comfortable sitting on the potty, try it without a diaper. Bowel
training usually comes first. By emptying the contents of a full
diaper into the potty, parents can show the child its purpose. Note
that some children are frightened when their stool is flushed down
the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers love to imitate older people. If they see parents or
older siblings using the toilet, they may be more interested in
using their own potty. At first it will be up to you to remind the
child when to use the potty. Watch for behaviors _ grimaces, poses
or other signals _ that suggest an imminent bowel movement and ask
the child if he or she needs to go. Many parents find that by
letting children run around the house naked below the waist for a
few days, children quickly learn to recognize and respond
appropriately to the need to void or defecate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't abandon diapers until the child is successfully using the
potty several times a day, and never deliberately leave the child
in wet or messy clothing as a training lesson. When your child
seems ready to take over the training process, you might try using
training pants, which the child can remove without help. Once out
of diapers and using the potty on their own, children should always
to be dressed in clothes they can easily and quickly remove _ pants
and panties with an elastic waist.
</P>
<P>
   Talk with the child's other caretakers about the training
techniques you are using and ask them to do the same. There is
often a problem in day care settings, which for sanitary reasons
usually do not use potty chairs and may be less willing than
parents to tolerate accidents if children in training are not
wearing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime or nap time training may occur simultaneously with
daytime training or it may not occur until a year later. Be sure to
take your child to the toilet before he or she goes to bed. And you
might place the potty in the child's room at night and suggest that
the child use it just before bed and immediately upon awakening.

<P>
   BERNE, N.Y. _ Even before he was born, Allen Wright had two
broken legs. His first night in the hospital, a nurse accidentally
broke his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Allen has had more than 30 major fractures, and
those are just the ones his parents, Penny and Kenny Wright, have
been able to count.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 2 1/2, suffers from a rare genetic bone defect called
osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because his bones are so weak, even a gentle hug could break his
back and ribs. Because there is no cure, doctors don't expect him
to survive his teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to get old enough to know that's he's
different,'' said his mother, Penny Wright, 27, in the living room
of the family's rural home in upstate New York. ``Things are
starting to bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's parents have stopped waiting for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, almost nine months ago, they gambled on a
controversial, experimental bone marrow treatment at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., that they hope will
reduce the number of fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment has been criticized by the Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Foundation, a research and advocacy group in Maryland, as being too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Penny and Kenny Wright believed they had no better option, even
though it meant putting their son through a grueling, and
potentially fatal, regimen of drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Other current treatments include stabilizing the bones with
rods, a surgical procedure that is available only to children with
milder forms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't walk, he doesn't crawl, he doesn't even lay on his
stomach. If we didn't try it, there's no hope, that's the way he's
going to be,'' Penny Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 Americans are believed to suffer
from osteogenesis imperfecta, an illness which can vary in
severity. Some people with the disease are just more apt to break
bones. Others die at birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a family history but there
is,'' said Heller An Shapiro, executive director of the foundation.
``It could be the clumsy uncle who is always breaking something.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many genetic disorders, the disease can be inherited from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is caused by the gene that normally produces
collagen, the connective tissue that lays the foundation for the
body's bones. In someone with osteogenesis imperfecta, that gene is
defective, either causing the body to produce too little or
weakened collagen.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a parent may carry the defective gene but not
have the disease. As in the case with Allen, it's a mutation and
neither parent carries the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wright learned her son had the disease during a routine
ultrasound during her eighth month of pregnancy. Doctors knew
something was wrong when they couldn't see the baby's legs. Further
analysis showed that his legs were broken and folded up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything I was supposed to during pregnancy,'' said
Penny Wright, who has two healthy daughters from a previous
marriage. ``I drank lots of water, I ate lots of fruits and
vegetables. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest time for the family was the first year after Allen's
birth. Besides trying to learn about a very rare disease, they also
struggled to cope with a baby who cried almost constantly from
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wright couldn't breast-feed him for fear of breaking
something. Like many parents of children with osteogenesis
imperfecta, she and Kenny, 32, were so nervous about picking him up
that they carried him around on a pillow. Even changing a diaper
made them fearful of breaking his legs or back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the blue,'' said Kenny Wright, a mechanic and
supervisor at Loretex Corp. in Guilderland, a company that makes
plastic products. ``We didn't know anything, just to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're more comfortable but no less careful. Because of
his brittle bones, the Wrights don't dare bounce their son on their
knees or cuddle him in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wright said she's at least grateful her son has a good
personality to break up the long hours they spend alone together.
Because of his condition, even family members are reluctant to
babysit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to have lunch one day and not hear `Mom,''' said
Penny Wright, who openly admits she misses not being able to take
her son to play with children his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see other kids running around and playing, it gets
depressing,'' she said.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wrights don't know for certain whether the experimental bone
marrow transplant has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Allen fell over and broke his left arm again.
During the seven months he was at St. Jude's recovering from the
transplant, he also suffered several setbacks, including two broken
legs and an arm.
</P>
<P>
   His parents still believe it's an improvement. ``The older he
gets, the more breaks he's going to get. If he gets 10 breaks in a
year, it's probably better than he would have done anyway,'' Penny
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jude paid the family's expenses to the hospital and the
living costs incurred during Penny and Allen's seven-month stay.
They're returning again this month for one of a series of
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind donor bone marrow in treating osteogenesis
imperfecta is to infuse the body with healthy cells needed to make
stronger bones. Though donor marrow isn't expected to cure the
genetic defect, it's hoped the procedure will help decrease the
number of fractures by building bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several leading medical specialists are critical of St.
Jude's lead researcher, Dr. Edwin Horwitz, who published the
results from an initial study, which showed improvements in three
transplant children, in the March issue of Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up letter to the journal, Dr. Joan C. Marini, a top
official at the National Institutes of Health, urged caution. The
panel of physicians on the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation's
Medical Advisory Council also issued a statement saying more
research is needed before any conclusions are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone marrow transplantation is one of several therapies that
is on the leading edge of OI research, but until we have more long
term results, we felt it necessary to urge caution,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny and Kenny Wright try not to think abut the future or pin
their hopes on possible cure. It's too painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' Penny Wright said. ``What's going to
happen is going to happen.''

   &UR; Control Center for Smells &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Circadian rhythms, the daily cycles of activity and behavior
controlled by a gene-based mechanism, are often referred to as the
brain's clock. But in some creatures, there are clocks outside the
brain as well. Like those inside the head, these ``satellite''
mechanisms act through the expression of proteins by specific
genes, known as clock genes.
</P>
<P>
   In fruit flies, one center of circadian control has been found
to be in cells in the antennas. Just what behavior this satellite
mechanism controls, however, had been a mystery. Now, researchers
from the University of Houston have determined that it controls the
flies' sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the journal Nature, the researchers
reported that normal fruit flies had heightened sensitivity to
odors from certain chemicals depending on the time of day. But
these rhythms disappeared in fruit flies in which the clock genes
in the antennas had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most examples of circadian rhythms, the flies' sense of
smell was not controlled by light and dark, the experimenters
found. The flies' smell was keenest in the middle of the night and
least sensitive during the day, and even when flies were kept in
the dark for several days at a time, they were still more sensitive
to smells at night.
</P>
<P>
   Just why a sense of smell controlled according to a daily rhythm
would be a good thing is a little difficult to understand. The
researchers speculate that olfactory rhythms may aid in detecting
predators at times when the fly is relatively inactive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fastest Asteroid &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone concerned with behavior that is set to daily rhythms
would do well to stay away from asteroid 1998 KY26, where a day
lasts all of 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, an almost spherical chunk of rock about 100 feet
across, is the fastest-spinning object in the solar system,
rotating almost 60 times as fast as the average for all known
asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   It was discovered last year by astronomers with Spacewatch, a
program financed by NASA, the University of Arizona and private
donors to search for near-Earth asteroids, those that are not
contained in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid 1998 KY26 was observed when it was on its closest
approach to Earth, about half a million miles away. Astronomers
from the United States and the Czech Republic, using radar echoes
and data from optical observations, determined the asteroid's size
and shape and its precise spin rate, 10.7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tidying Up Papermaking &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Papermaking can be a messy chemical process, and much of the
messiness comes from removing the lignin that is a major component,
along with cellulose, of wood pulp. In a tree, lignin binds with
cellulose to give wood its structure and flexibility, but in paper,
lignin eventually causes discoloration (which is why this newspaper
will turn brown with age).
</P>
<P>
   One way to make lignin removal easier is to have less of it to
remove. That is the approach taken by a team of researchers, led by
a scientist at Michigan Technological University, who have
genetically altered a type of aspen tree to produce about half as
much lignin as normal.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who wrote about their research in the journal
Nature Biotechnology, say that if the process succeeds in trees
that are major sources of pulp, the amount of chemicals and energy
used in papermaking could be significantly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that a tree with less lignin might fall over,
like an animal without a backbone. But not only do the modified
aspens grow straight and tall, they do so at a faster rate than
unmodified trees.
</P>
<P>
   Some test specimens are 30 percent taller than normal trees. The
researchers don't know why this is so, but speculate that some of
the energy that would have gone into producing lignin is being used
to produce more cellulose.

POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE TO PRIVATE-SECTOR CHARITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush and Al Gore are both such
tendered-hearted guys that surely they won't waste time quibbling
over who first thought of the idea that churches and other
compassionate groups should be given a greater role in helping the
needy.
</P>
<P>
   The political climate is ripe for the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Many government social-services programs have fueled public
dissatisfaction and anger with their ineffectiveness. And that
hostility has been reinforced in recent years by strident
government-bashing from countless politicians seeking election or
re-election to government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 by basically
portraying the federal government as Public Enemy No. 1. So, it
shouldn't be surprising that the front-runners for the Republican
and Democratic presidential nominations are both preaching that
charity begins at home _ or at the neighborhood church, synagogue,
food pantry, veterans' hall or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed efforts to enlist the religious and private sectors _
what Bush calls the ``armies of compassion'' _ to strengthen the
age-old war on poverty should be applauded. And Bush's proposals
(more detailed, so far, than Gore's) to provide additional tax
incentives to individuals and corporations and federal funds to
churches and charitable groups certainly are worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether a laudable idea _ with tons of
political appeal _ can be transformed into a realistic, effective
program, regardless of whom is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed spending about $8 billion, which he said was
about 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus, to support
charities and provide tax breaks to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   He would provide larger tax breaks for charitable donations made
by corporations and would even allow individuals who don't itemize
their deductions _ the vast majority of taxpayers _ to deduct
charitable gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he also would seek changes in federal
regulations to make it easier for religious groups to apply for
federal funds for nonsectarian, charitable programs. Predicting the
proposal wouldn't violate the constitutional line between church
and state, he vowed not to discriminate ``for or against Methodists
or Mormons or Muslims or good people of no faith at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Other beneficiaries of Bush's plan would be children whose
parents are in prison, unwed pregnant teens, faith-based drug
treatment programs and after-school programs run by community
groups, churches and charities.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to his approach, Bush suggests, is that it would
remove decisions about providing assistance from a faceless,
heartless government bureaucracy that ``can't put hope in our
hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But avoiding bureaucracy, even for such an idealistic concept,
won't be easy. Bush already has said that, if elected president, he
would establish an ``Office of Faith-Based Action'' in the
government to serve as a clearinghouse for successful charitable
social programs and to help religious groups with federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   And if the governor's program were to be as successful as he
apparently envisions, thousands of government workers _ bureaucrats
_ would still have to oversee the distribution of federal funds and
check out the validity of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans may like the idea of their tax dollars going to
legitimate charitable programs, but they will demand some
accountability. Just about any group can call itself a church or a
charity, even groups that consist of little more than a phone
number and a fly-by-night operator whose sole charity is himself.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that bureaucracy could be drawn from the existing federal
bureaucracy. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal is worth considering as a supplement to existing
government social services. If it were to successfully take off _
under Bush or another president _ maybe it could even reduce the
size of some public programs.
</P>
<P>
   A potential downside to Bush's plan is that it may encourage
some politicians to try to remove government from the welfare
business altogether. That would be unrealistic because there will
always be a need for government's ultimate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   A hodgepodge of well-meaning churches and charities can make a
huge difference in reducing misery but cannot begin to serve
everyone in need. And, when the economy turns sour, many
good-hearted citizens will reduce their charitable contributions _
at the very time that their poor neighbors would probably need help
the most.

REGULATORS SEEK MORE HONESTLY IN CORPORATE REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As regulators declare war on crooked accounting,
the art of ``cooking the books'' still appears to be rampant in
corporate America, especially among technology companies that live
and die by their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accounting fraud may be the crime of the 21st century,'' said
David Elzinger, a forensic accountant at Lindquist Avey, a
corporate intelligence firm in Vancouver, British Columbia, that
has many Silicon Valley clients. ``It's widespread and appears to
be growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent examples of questionable numbers-crunching:
</P>
<P>
   _ McKesson HBOC Corp. executives in San Francisco said that
``improper accounting'' had forced them to restate and cut revenue
by $327 million and net income by $192 million over the past three
years. Earlier this month, they confirmed that the Securities and
Exchange Commission and Justice Department are investigating the
company's bookkeeping practices.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Insignia Solutions in Fremont, two former executives
admitted to jacking up the profits of their small company by
recording the bogus sale of a large shipment of software. David
Gibbs of Danville and Stuart McIntosh of Laguna Niguel agreed in
May to pay civil penalties totaling $100,000, the SEC reported.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Corp. executives said a month ago that the SEC is
investigating their accounting practices. At issue is whether
Microsoft used ``cookie jar'' accounting, or hoarding cash reserves
to pump up earnings during weak quarterly periods.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know how much improper accounting is quietly taking
place in the offices of thousands of publicly traded companies
nationwide. But more cases than ever before are coming to light,
according to securities lawyers, accountants and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the SEC filed charges in 100 accounting-related
cases. In addition, the SEC recently sent letters to 150 unnamed
companies, warning that their write-offs for mergers and
acquisitions were too high and needed to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are outraged, too. A record 235 corporations _ half of
them technology companies _ were hit last year by federal
class-action lawsuits alleging securities and accounting fraud,
according to a Stanford Law School study.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more volatility in the market and more public companies,
there's a greater prevalence of accounting manipulations,'' said
Michael Perino, a law professor at St. John's University in New
York who worked on the Stanford study.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as ``earnings management,'' cooking the books covers
a range of improper accounting tactics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Falsely recording sales to inflate a company's revenue,
profits and stock price.
</P>
<P>
   _ In mergers, claiming big write-offs, or excessive
restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stockpiling cash reserves, then using those reserves to smooth
out earnings during underperforming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause of shady accounting is the unrelenting pressure
on Wall Street for companies to perform. Executives fall into the
trap by inflating their earnings to pump up corporate shares. And
that pleases big investors and traders _ at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies are under a lot of pressure to keep up their
stock prices and meet analysts' expectations,'' said Helaine
Morrison, the SEC's enforcement chief in San Francisco. ``Even when
they miss their earnings projections by a penny, that has a big
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure greed also plays a role. Executives often are motivated by
lucrative stock option packages linked to their company's financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want their financial statements to look good, knowing
their stock options and bonuses depend on it,'' said Rod Rodriguez,
a forensic accountant at Kroll Associates, an investigative firm
based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Startup companies are susceptible to accounting fraud because of
their supercharged business growth and the Gold Rush atmosphere in
Silicon Valley. When small companies expand at a breakneck pace,
they often lack the legal and accounting safeguards that more
established operations have.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden,'' Rodriguez said, ``the company becomes
successful and goes from 10 to 100 or 1,000 people. The downside is
there are no controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned that much corporate
financial reporting had eroded into ``accounting hocus-pocus,''
with many companies operating dangerously ``in the gray area
between legitimacy and outright fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is pushing for criminal prosecutions, stricter
accounting rules and stronger self-policing by auditors. Under
pressure from regulators, the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
an industry body that draws up accounting rules for businesses, is
debating whether to tighten accounting standards for mergers.

   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: Body Cream Linked to Premature Puberty &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The playful little boy scrambled all over his father's
body-building equipment and mats _ normal behavior for an active
2-year-old exploring his world.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents soon discovered something that was not normal:
their son had developed pubic hair, facial acne and an enlarged
penis.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the case in the current issue of Pediatrics,
doctors at the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology at the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, ascribe the boy's
precocious sexual development to his accidental exposure to the
testosterone cream his father used as part of a body-building
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The boy absorbed the cream through his skin, by contact with his
father, the exercise equipment and the mats. The father had been
applying four ounces of the cream daily to his back and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of virilization caused by topical exposure to testosterone
are rare in the medical literature, said Dr. Y. Miles Yu, the lead
author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case was unusual in part because the parents were so
frank,'' Dr. Yu said. ``But we suspect that this is not just one
isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone is the hormone responsible for growth and
development of male sex organs and maintenance of secondary sex
characteristics, like facial hair in men. The average male produces
four to seven milligrams of the hormone each day.
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone cream is sold over the counter in many countries,
although not in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testosterone is legally prescribed, typically in patches, for
people with low testosterone levels,'' said Dr. George Siegel, an
endocrinologist who practices in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is also sold widely on the black market. Bodybuilders
use it to increase muscle mass, and it is easily absorbed through
the skin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said that the boy seemed to be recovering. Both pubic hair
and acne diminished within four months when he was no longer
exposed to the testosterone cream, although penile size did not.
The long-term effect of exposure during childhood is not fully
known.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurence Baskin, a urologist at the University of California
at San Francisco medical school urged caution in handling of
testosterone. ``Basically, steady exposure to these creams will
lead to premature puberty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK: Unusual Case of Swallowed Toy Flashlight &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An unusual letter appears in the Correspondence column of this
week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine: two doctors
from Children's Hospital in Worms, Germany, wrote about a
10-year-old patient who was admitted to the hospital after
complaining of stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   The boy explained that the pains began after he ate a meal, but
he admitted an hour later that he had swallowed a small object.
</P>
<P>
   The boy would not say what he swallowed because he was ashamed,
said Dr. Tobias Wenzl, who with a colleague, Dr. Heino Skopnik,
wrote the letter to the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that it may have been a sharp object, doctors performed
a routine gastroscopy to find out what the boy swallowed and
whether it could be passed naturally.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting the boy's digestive tract with a flexible
endoscope, Dr. Wenzl was surprised when the camera picked up an
image of a cartoon character. It turned out that the object was a
toy flashlight about an inch in diameter, lodged in the boy's

 DeBARTOLO LEAVES UNUSUAL LEGACY FOR 49ERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The early returns were remarkably generous to
Eddie DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first reactions to his exit from professional
football were downright glowing. He might have looked like Carmen
Basilio at the end, but his legacy is being portrayed as more Sugar
Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to listen to the eulogies, he:
</P>
<P>
   _ Invented Bill Walsh, or at the very least built the laboratory
where he could work his alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saved the San Francisco 49ers from irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gave San Francisco back its swagger after a decade of watching
the Bay Area dance through the '70s to Oakland's bass-driven funk
of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Was generous in ways that would shame Andrew Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Was a man of his time, whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   On the last one, there is no reason to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   We are all people of our time, given the fairly obvious fact
that it's the only time in which we exist (barring reincarnation).
DeBartolo's best times came when money was no object and the sky
was the starting point. You know, the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of it, though, a healthy step back might be in
order, and before the discussion turns cold. He didn't really do
all the things that, in the natural inclination to be charitable to
the defeated, he is being credited with today. He facilitated for
others, and he was a extravagant benefactor, but he didn't make the
49ers you know them today nearly as much as the 49ers made him.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could not have been any other way. DeBartolo was
an owner of a sports franchise, and the most successful owners
understood that there were only three contributions an owner could
make:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have pots of available money and the willingness to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find men and women to entrust the money to, and grant them the
decision-making power to make those dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay interested without becoming a meddler.
</P>
<P>
   In his best days, DeBartolo managed those three tasks, and was
as good an owner as you could imagine. True, he had a gift for the
ostentatious that men like Art Rooney, Walter Haas, Bob Lurie and
Peter O'Malley would find off-putting, but his grander impulses
(trips to Hawaii after Super Bowls, etc.) won him the admiration of
the athletes who cashed his checks. That was, he will admit, his
greatest reward.
</P>
<P>
   To say that he made the 49ers what they became and still are,
though, is to aim badly. Walsh did that, and so did John McVay,
Carmen Policy and Allan Webb, Bill MacPherson and Bobb McKittrick.
So did Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Roger Craig,
Charles Haley and Jesse Sapolu, Ken Norton and John Ayers and a
hundred other players, all of whom had talent, benefited from and
thrived in a system that enhanced that talent, and played for a man
who compensated them better than any other team in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of glory in that, but it proved to be
insufficient for DeBartolo. He wanted to be thought of not only as
The First Forty Niner (hence his scraps with Walsh) but as an
entrepreneur of the first order (hence his fallout with Policy and,
later, with his sister Denise). He got caught in the depressed mall
market and retreated from the club for a while, and when he decided
to become a player in the arcane Louisiana gambling market, he got
played instead.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in many ways, best served when he served best, enabling
others to produce their best work. This can be a harsh lesson for a
man of wealth to learn, and only those least burdened by ego or the
need to be recognized can thrive in such an environment.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the small percentage of owners in history who have
managed it, holding him to that standard might be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   By the same standard, though, neither should he be credited with
more than he actually did. Even in these days, in the wake of his
most galling failure, we ought to remember how much an owner can
do, and how much he cannot. DeBartolo was a fine patron of the
football arts, and to be sure didn't lose his team because he was a
bad owner.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he was too often a bad businessman, and being
a sports owner is still a lot easier than being an entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurs succeed largely on their own; owners succeed largely
because of others. It may seem like a small thing to mention now,
so soon after his banishment, but it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie DeBartolo's legacy in San Francisco requires perspective,
one that is intertwined with, rather than separated from, others.

A MAN, A PLAN AND A ROBOT THAT MAKES EYE CONTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Texas)   (af)  
 By BRUCE SCHECHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meeting Cog for the first time can be an unsettling experience.
Cog, the creation of Rodney Brooks, the director of the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is a legless, human-shaped robot that looks like an
ungainly ancestor of R2D2.
</P>
<P>
   When a visitor approaches, Cog swivels its head in a
disconcertingly human gesture, and stares him in the eye.
Inevitably, the visitor stares back, and for at least an instant
gets the eerie sense that there has been a meeting of the minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody overreacts as a matter of course,'' said Daniel
Dennett, a Tufts University philosopher who works with Brooks on
Cog. ``There's something really unsettling when Cog looks at you.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cog's unsettling gaze is little more than a clever
illusion, but Brooks and his graduate students believe that they
have taken the first important steps toward creating a truly
intelligent machine.
</P>
<P>
   The key to achieving human intelligence, Brooks believes, is to
build a machine that experiences the world in much the way a human
being does. This requires not only the ability to sense and
manipulate the physical world, but the social world as well, since
from infancy on, almost all of what humans learn comes about from
human reaction. And the first step, bridging the gap between humans
and machines, is eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that he directs the world's largest artificial
intelligence laboratory, Brooks is something of a maverick in the
field. ``Most of my colleagues here in the lab do very different
things and have only contempt for my work,'' he cheerfully
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of artificial intelligence researchers pursue an
approach that Brooks calls, Good Old-Fashioned Artificial
Intelligence, or GOFAI. According to this approach, the best way to
make a computer that is as intelligent as a human is to cram it
full of knowledge about the real world and methods to manipulate
it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foremost proponents of this approach is Dr. Douglas
Lenat, president and chief executive officer of Cycorp in Austin,
Texas, and Brooks' former adviser. For more than a decade, Lenat
and his team have fed more than a million facts into a program
called Cyc. Most of these facts are matters of common sense: for
example, that glasses full of water usually should be carried
rightside-up and that people generally stop buying things after
they die.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this tactic, Brooks feels, is that it is ``not
grounded anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Brooks said, ``it's like an intelligence which only
has access to a Korean dictionary. It has perfectly self-consistent
definitions, but it's not connected to the world in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The schism in the artificial intelligence field represented by
these two approaches to building intelligent machines in some ways
mirrors the split among educators. Traditional educators, like
Lenat, believe ``that intelligence is intimately tied up with
having and being able to use knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' approach is closer to that of educators like John Dewey,
who urged ``a philosophy of education based upon a philosophy of
experience.'' As Lenat puts it, ``We represent the `it's worth it
to go to school' point of view, and he represents the `you can
learn stuff on your own' point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out to make a robot that could learn things on
its own, Brooks spent more than a decade building robotic insects
that could freely scurry about and explore his laboratory. Other
researchers had done similar things, but their creations, which
relied on the ideas of GOFAI, were awkward and slow.
</P>
<P>
   The legs of their insects were controlled by a central computer
that had a detailed three-dimensional map of the terrain and knew
all the relevant laws of physics and strategies for setting goals.
Brooks did away with the massive central processor. Instead, each
insect leg contains a small circuit that tells it to swing forward
if the leg is in the air, to swing backward if it is on the ground,
and not to lift if the adjacent leg is up, along with a few other
similar facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all local computation physically coupled through the
body,'' Brooks said. Nevertheless, from the interaction of these
circuits, Brooks' insects spontaneously begin to walk with a gait
very similar to that taken by actual insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this plan,'' Brooks recalled. ``I was going to do
insects and then I was going to do an iguana. And then I was going
to do maybe a simple mammal, then I was going to do a cat, then I
was going to do a monkey, and then I was going to do humans.'' The
problem with this plan, he soon realized, was that it would take
too long; insects alone had taken him 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So he asked himself: ``Do I want to die being remembered as the
guy who built the best artificial cat? No. So I decided to jump and
see where we could get. At least I'd be remembered as the foolish
guy who was way overambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years Brooks, with the help of six or seven
graduate students has begun to realize his ambitious dream. Today
Cog is a skeletal aluminum figure, with a swiveling, octagonal head
perched on broad, motor-studded shoulders from which sprout a pair
of powerful arms that end with simple, fingerless hands. The
researchers decided not to equip Cog with legs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what to do with a toddler strapped to a high
chair, much less something that can walk around as well,'' said
Brian Scassellati, one of Brooks' graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   Cog's eyes consist of two pairs of video cameras _ one wide
angle, the other with a narrower focus to simulate human vision,
which is far more sensitive in the middle than on the edges. They
move much like human eyes move. The output of these cameras is
displayed on a bank of amber monitors mounted on a rack behind the
robot.
</P>
<P>
   Cog also has tiny microphone ears, gyroscopes that work much
like the inner ear to provide a sense of up and down, and various
sensors to report the position of its limbs. With all this
hardware, there is little room left for brains, so these _ a
network of Pentium computers _ are mounted in a nearby rack.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cog's achievements are modest, though impressive by the
standards of robotics. Cog can make eye contact, track motion by
swiveling head and eyes, and even distinguish humans from other
less interesting objects. It can make a Slinky gracefully cascade
from hand to hand, turn a crank and it has even played drums in a
rock video.
</P>
<P>
   Robots programmed using the principles of GOFAI could probably
perform these tasks too, but not with the human grace of Cog, its
creators say. For example, a visitor can halt Cog's playing with a
Slinky by simply placing a hand gently on its arm; when the hand is
removed, Cog resumes its play.
</P>
<P>
   Cog also has a younger sister named Kismet, a cartoon-cute
character with bushy eyebrows, pink ears, a pair of large blue
eyes, complete with eyelids, and a mouth she can open and shut. All
of these endearingly childlike features are carefully calculated to
evoke the maternal instincts of Kismet's human companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kismet is essentially training the human to be a good
teacher,'' said Cynthia Breazeal, a designer of Kismet. Kismet has
a simple set of moods _ for example, happiness, interest, anger,
fear, disgust or surprise _ that she can express on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet also has a set of needs, like the need to be stimulated
by people and toys, a need to interact, and a need to avoid
fatigue. ``These drives are always changing in time,'' Dr. Breazeal
explains. ``When one need becomes very strong, behaviors such as
facial expressions that act to satiate that need become active.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, playing with a toy might amuse Kismet for a while,
which she shows by a happy expression _ eyes wide open, eyebrows
up, ears perked. But then she becomes bored and her face begins to
droop. Like any good parent, Kismet's human companion now tries
desperately to see what else will amuse her and finally hits upon
the reliable standby of making funny faces. Kismet, who was craving
social interaction, is appeased and begins to smile once again.
</P>
<P>
   When speaking of Kismet and Cog, it is difficult to avoid the
trap of anthropomorphism. Even her creators do not claim that
Kismet possesses human emotions, but that does not mean that she
possesses no emotions at all. ``Cog doesn't have all the sorts of
consciousness that a human infant, a dog or a bird has, but it has
some,'' Dr. Dennett said. ``It doesn't have all the rich, lush
embellishments of human boredom, but it's probably pretty much in a
state that might inspire a zoo-goer to say `these snakes are bored,
aren't they?'''
</P>
<P>
   It is to answer questions like these, rather than the thrill of
building a humanoid robot, that Brooks said he had undertaken his
overambitious project. ``The goal of having humanoid robots?'' he
said. ``Certainly from a science fiction point of view, I'd love
it. To me it's a romantic notion. Whether that will make sense in
any sociological, economic or other sense, I can't say at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and his students want to be experimental philosophers,
using Cog as a platform to investigate theories of the human mind.
``You look at some cognitive theory and there's a lot of
hand-waving around the edge,'' Brooks said. ``When you try to put
it in a robot, you have to get rid of the hand-waving and connect
it up to the other stuff, which sharpens everyone's appreciation
and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks has a clear-cut criterion for success: ``I'll know
that I've succeeded when my graduate students feel bad about
turning off the robot.''

PROGRAM AIMS TO COUNTER LACK OF PHYSICAL FITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By MARY DUFFY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American children are notoriously out of shape. In the last
generation, childhood obesity has increased by 50 percent, in large
part because many children have become sedentary. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimates that fewer than
one-quarter of children engage in daily vigorous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Physical education classes would seem an obvious solution, but
in some areas, those programs have been cut or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after Congress passed a resolution encouraging
states to mandate daily physical education, only one state _
Illinois _ actually does.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators and school administrators, as well as parents,
view PE as expendable, a subject lost in the shuffle of academic
priorities and fiscal constraints. Some look back at their own PE
classes and wonder why bother. Others believe that the time is
better spent on academic subjects. In some districts, PE classes
are taught at the discretion of the principal or teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But some schools are taking physical education more seriously,
in part because of a program called Sports, Play, and Active
Recreation for Kids (Spark), a comprehensive curriculum that
promotes activity in and out of school. Started in 1987, it
operates in 600 schools in 15 states. Its aim is simple, said
creator Dr. James Sallis, a San Diego State University professor:
to involve all children, not just the athletically inclined, to
teach basic sports skills and lifetime activities, to keep students
moving throughout class and to make the classes enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, school administrators have argued that expanding PE
would interfere with academic performance,'' said Sallis. ``But
that's just not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   He conducted a study that assessed 759 fourth and fifth graders
from seven elementary schools in San Diego County and the results
suggest that PE may actually help children to learn. The children
had completed baseline achievement tests in the second grade and
post-test scores in the fifth or sixth grade. Despite devoting
twice as many minutes to physical education, students enrolled in a
comprehensive PE program performed as well on the achievement tests
as the control group. The research is published in a recent issue
of the Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Sallis' research has also found that making gym classes fun will
encourage children to exercise more outside of class. He and
colleagues studied 1,504 pairs of parents and their children in
fourth through 12th grades and found that enjoyment of physical
education classes was a major factor in influencing levels of
physical activity for all age groups. The study was published in
the July issue of Health Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the main principles behind the SPARK program.
When a school system invests in SPARK, its teachers are trained to
implement the detailed lesson plans. Among the skills they master
is learning how to direct traffic when 30 elementary schoolchildren
are simultaneously dribbling a ball across a court.
</P>
<P>
   SPARK is designed to be taught a minimum of three days a week
throughout the year and is geared for grades kindergarten through
fifth grade. In addition to the physical education curriculum,
fourth and fifth graders have a 30-minute self-management class to
promote physical activity outside of school. Recognizing the lack
of PE specialists in many schools, the SPARK program also offers
training to classroom teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A typical SPARK lesson lasts 30 minutes and has two equal parts:
a health-fitness activity and a skill-fitness activity. One focuses
on cardiovascular endurance (as well as abdominal and upper-body
strength) through activities like aerobic dance, running games and
jumping rope. As students progress, the intensity, duration and
complexity of the activities can be modified.
</P>
<P>
   The sport fitness component includes activities that promote
cardiovascular fitness and skills like throwing, catching and
dribbling that develop coordination. Sports are modified to make
them more active.
</P>
<P>
   Last year school, Empresa Elementary in Oceanside, Calif.,
implemented SPARK. ``Rather than lining up to take a shot at a
basket, one student at a time, the program gives every child a ball
and teaches dribbling, throwing, catching, kicking, all the basic
sports skills,'' said Lorna Holt, a third-grade teacher at Empresa.
</P>
<P>
   Callie Tuck, a former student in Ms. Holt's class, said, ``At my
old school we didn't really do anything for gym. We just went out
in the playground and stood around.'' Now she loves PE, because it
is not boring, which is high praise from a 9-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dee Weedon, the Health, Physical Education and Lifetime
Wellness specialist for the Memphis City Schools, the 20th-largest
school system in the country, lobbied for two years to get SPARK in
the 108 elementary schools in her area. The holdup was clear: a
$14-million price tag that pays for hiring 250 PE specialists,
equipment (about $8,000 per school), teacher training and
curriculum makes the program out-of-bounds in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weedon said the benefits are worth the cost. ``Our PE
program started phasing out in the '70s,'' she said. ``The economy
tightened, budgets were slashed, and administrators labeled PE as
nonessential. They thought the kids will run around at recess, or
play sports after school, they don't need PE. By the '80s our
program dried up all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Today there are only 20 physical education specialists serving
75,000 elementary schoolchildren, and obesity and lack of fitness
among students is apparent. ``We were seeing health problems you
shouldn't see in children,'' Dr. Weedon said. ``We had to do
something.'' Memphis will roll out the SPARK program in January.
</P>
<P>
   If Sen. Ted Stevens. R-Alaska, has his way, more schools across
the country will build their physical education programs. He
recently introduced the Physical Education Progress Act, a bill
that would authorize some $400 million in federal funds to provide
local school districts incentive grants to initiate, expand and
improve physical education in kindergarten through 12th grades. The
bill has been referred to a committee for study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proven benefits of regular physical activity will
ultimately reduce the enormous burden that lack of physical
activity and obesity place on our health system,'' said Stevens,
whose bill has the support of a coalition of health agencies.
``Good health habits established early develop the discipline to
continue throughout a lifetime,'' he said.

   ARMSTRONG-TAPES (New York) _ A first hearing for some of th
hundreds of audio tapes made by jazz great Louis Armstrong.
Beginning in 1947, Armstrong's bulky reel-to-reel tape machines
captured thousands of hours of raw and intimate chatter, bawdy
stories, noodlings on the trumpet, radio broadcasts and anything
else that caught the fancy of the irrepressible trumpeter and
vocalist. By Ralph Blumenthal. (2000 words)

   SCI-ANT-SYMBIOSIS (Undated) _ Leaf-cutting ants and their fungus
farms are a marvel of nature and perhaps the best known example of
symbiosis, the mutual dependence of two species. But the textbook
accounts, it turns out, don't tell even half the story. From
research over the past five years the ants' symbiosis has emerged
as far more intricate than it appears, involving not two but at
least four different species, their lives knotted together in a
ruthless yet highly successful struggle for survival. By Nicholas
Wade. (2100 words)

<P>
   True or false: Brain research shows that playing classical music
for 2-year-olds makes them smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given the publicity blitz that has attended the so-called Mozart
effect, most people could be forgiven if they quickly answered,
``true!'' Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia is so convinced that he is
providing CDs to every new mother in the state. And in Florida, a
new law requires that toddlers in state-run schools listen to
classical music every day.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the studies behind the Mozart effect were
conducted on college students, not young children. The ``effect'' _
an increase in performance on a specific task of spatial imagery _
lasted for only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The studies involved no brain research, only tests of behavior.
And attempts to reproduce the results have failed, including a
study by Appalachian State University researchers published last
month in the journal Psychological Science.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be made of this? In ``The Myth of the First Three
Years,'' scheduled for publication next month by the Free Press,
Dr. John Bruer argues that the hype surrounding the Mozart effect _
and more generally, the overstatement and at times distortion of
what neuroscientists know about the developing brain _ has
unnecessarily sent anxious parents and educators scurrying to
insure that children receive exactly the right type of ``enriched''
stimulation before the age of 3, lest they suffer untoward
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It has also, he contends, encouraged legislators to forge
educational policy based largely on misinterpretation and
hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``What science-based policy should tell you is something about
root causes and mechanisms,'' said Bruer, who is president of the
McDonnell Foundation in St. Louis, which funds research in
neuroscience and cognition. ``If brain science doesn't support
this, we run the risk of wasting resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he asserts, neuroscience, with all its high-tech brain
scanning and molecular wizardry, still has little (Bruer actually
says ``nothing at all'') to say about how educators should teach,
or parents parent. And the brain science that does exist, he
argues, sends a message that is considerably more optimistic than
the ``it's all set by the age of 3'' that some parents and
educators have taken home.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bruer's critique will be seen by many as extreme, he is
not the only expert who objects to the imprecision with which
neuroscientific findings have been translated in the public arena.
Even some of the researchers whose work is often cited in public
presentations say their findings have been overinterpreted by eager
politicians and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   One popular notion that Bruer challenges in his book is that the
years from zero to 3 are a developmental window, or ``critical
period,'' during which certain types of learning experiences must
occur if they are to take place at all. In reality, he says, the
term ``critical period'' is correctly applied only to very specific
aspects of human functioning, most of them essential for the
organism's survival.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the ability to see normally depends on appropriate
visual stimulation during the first years of life. Many aspects of
language development also are dependent on early exposure. And
infants, as demonstrated by studies of children who have suffered
severe deprivation, and of monkeys who have been reared in
isolation, require appropriate care if they are to achieve normal
social and emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide publicity given two unpublished studies,
however, no neuroscience yet links research on the quality of early
relationships to changes in brain structure or function.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of these basic functions, Bruer argues, no
``extra'' stimulation is needed; the normal experiences and
nurturing most parents provide and that evolution intended suffice.
And when it comes to the ability to think, learn and reason, he
says, the science indicates that no such critical period exists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the brain appears able to learn and change throughout
life, and many early deficits can be remedied in later life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been totally ignored,'' he said, ``is that what the
new results seem to show is the lifelong plasticity of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruer does not hesitate to call those he believes to be
responsible to task. He places a large share of the blame, for
example, on the media, and in particular on science journalists,
who, he says, in their eagerness to mine the public's interest in
brain science, often have omitted essential caveats that limit how
far research can be generalized, have sometimes reported on studies
before they were published or peer-reviewed, and have been too
quick to apply the findings of animal research to human children.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruer has plenty of criticism to spread around. In his list
of culprits he also includes ``Starting Points,'' the Carnegie
Foundation's influential report on young children's needs, which
devoted 3 of its 132 pages to neuroscience, child advocacy
organizations like the Zero to Three and the I Am Your Child
foundations, the White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning, held in 1977, and even a few scientists,
who he claims are guilty of overselling the implications of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   And not surprisingly, ``The Myth of the First Three Years'' is
stirring controversy even before it reaches bookstores. It is not
that Bruer's critics dispute the fact that neuroscience findings
have sometimes been exaggerated or misused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that those extremes do exist, and that is
a danger,'' said Dr. David Hamburg, president emeritus of the
Carnegie Foundation, who spearheaded the ``Starting Points,''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamburg and others mentioned critically in the book said
that what irks them about Bruer's assault is that he seems to
ignore a wealth of research in areas other than neuroscience _
developmental psychology, for example _ which shows that the first
years of life are indeed critically important. Such studies, they
assert, clearly demonstrate that what parents do in the first three
years matters, and underline the need for parents to be attuned to
developmental milestones, and the value of activities like reading
and talking to young children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Neuroscience or not, we've learned a tremendous amount over
the last 30 years through scientifically valid research
mechanisms,'' said Matthew Melmed, executive director of the Zero
to Three Foundation. ``And we do have a lot to say and advice to
share with parents about the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   Melmed, Hamburg and others mentioned in Bruer's book say that
their organizations have never suggested that a window slams shut
on development at the age of 3, or that the later childhood years _
or adulthood, for that matter _ are unimportant. And they worry
that the appearance of a book titled ``The Myth of the First Three
Years,'' will send parents off to the other, equally misguided
extreme _ setting back the field 20 years, as one expert put it _
and make advocacy more difficult in a nation that, in comparison to
other countries, is not known for making the health and welfare of
its youngest citizens a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Some neuroscientists also disagree with Bruer's assertion that
neuroscience has nothing to say about early childhood. Dr. Patricia
Kuhl, professor of speech and hearing sciences at the University of
Washington whose book, ``The Scientist in the Crib'' (William
Morrow), written with two other research scientists, will be
published next month, said she thinks Bruer makes some valid
points.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings of research, she said, ``have shown us that
babies are not just cute faces but the greatest learning machines
in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies revise their views about people and things in the world
based on new information, just as scientists do,'' Dr. Kuhl said.
``A difference is that babies do it more quickly and more
profoundly than adults, because their brains are less committed _
literally less cluttered _ than ours are.''
</P>
<P>
   And while such findings ``don't provide a prescription for
revamping our educational system,'' she said, ``they do alter our
views of the mental life of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is likely that in the wake of Bruer's book,
journalists and child advocacy organizations will be more careful
about how they translate the science in the public arena,
especially because other critical voices are joining the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper, for example, to be published in the
journal Child Development, Dr. Ross A. Thompson, a developmental
psychologist at the University of Nebraska, and Dr. Charles Nelson,
a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota, make many of the
same points, stressing the importance of viewing brain development
as something that begins well before birth and continues throughout
life, and pointing out areas in which the findings of neuroscience
have been oversimplified or misstated.
</P>
<P>
   And some scientists whose work has drawn the spotlight are
voicing complaints. Dr. Francis Rauscher, for example, who was a
co-author of the original studies of the Mozart effect, said she is
uncomfortable with the way her results are mangled by the media,
and bemused by efforts like Miller's in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can hurt,'' said Dr. Rauscher, who is now
assistant professor of cognitive development at the University of
Wisconsin in Oshkosh. ``I'm all for exposing children to wonderful
cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better
spent on music education programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Dr. William Greenough, of the University of
Illinois, who studies the effects in rats of being reared in
complex or deprived environments, is sometimes put forward as
evidence that ``enrichment'' must be provided in the first years of
life, if it is to be provided at all. But Greenough, too, is less
than happy with this construction of his findings. ``I spent most
of 30 years demonstrating that that's not true,'' he said in an
interview last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question of how much of a child's life is written in
the first three years is important to every parent and educator,
and has special poignancy for parents who adopt older children, who
may have suffered intense deprivation earlier in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, many experts believe, is a sober, comprehensive
effort to consider the entire literature of early childhood,
sorting science from hyperbole, what is known from what is not. The
National Research Council has convened a committee to do just this.
Its report is scheduled to be released next year. And whatever the
report says, it will no doubt trigger a new round of debate.

CARACAS JOURNAL: COMIC RELIEF FROM A YEAR OF POLITICAL
VITUPERATION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ To open a newspaper or turn on a newscast
here these days is to be subjected to an avalanche of insults and
aspersions.
</P>
<P>
   When President Hugo Chavez is not branding his opponents a
corrupt ``nest of vipers,'' they are proclaiming him ``a demagogue
endowed with an ability to arouse hatred and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But fortunately, Venezuelans have found a place they can go to
defuse the political tensions. In a country that lacks a strong
theatergoing tradition, a satirical political revue has become a
national political barometer and the hottest entertainment
attraction in this country of 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Laureano Marquez, host of the show, sees it, Chavez, a
45-year-old former army paratrooper who organized an unsuccessful
coup attempt in 1992, is a natural subject for any humorist.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rafael Caldera, his frail 83-year-old predecessor whom
the show lampoons just as mercilessly, Chavez is energetic and
unpredictable. He is a whirlwind of activity and ideas, a man with
little regard for protocol and a slangy, folksy style of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's many escapades since taking office in February include
writing a doting letter to Ilich Ramirez Sanchez _ the
international terrorist from Venezuela known as Carlos _ and
inviting President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to visit Venezuela and
pitching to Sammy Sosa at an exhibition baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   The president has radio and television programs and just this
week suggested that Venezuela be renamed for Simon Bolivar, the
country's founding father, calling it the Bolivarian republic of
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become a sort of parallel government,'' Marquez, 36, a
former political science student, jokes to audience every night,
noting that the revue has existed ``the same number of days'' as
Chavez's presidency. ``Sometimes we get confused. We think we are
the government, and he thinks that he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is regularly revised to reflect new
developments, is named ``La Reconstituyente,'' or ``The
Reconstitution,'' for Chavez's controversial plan to replace the
current constitution with a new one that would vastly expand his
powers.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, voters elected a National Constituent Assembly in
which Chavez supporters hold 121 of the 131 seats, a result that
Marquez promises will produce a raft of new jokes and banter in the
script.
</P>
<P>
   But the focal point of the performance is Rolando Salazar, a
painter and gifted mimic, who plays Chavez. Salazar bears little
physical resemblance to the president, but he bounds on stage in
Chavez's signature red beret.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to mounting laughter, he manages to reproduce the
president's many oratorical quirks: the elongated syllables used as
an oratorical flourish, the habit of interrupting speeches in the
middle of a sentence to greet friends he sees in the audience, the
sniff of disdain as punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chavez's Cabinet, as well as governors, diplomats,
members of Congress and prominent business executives, have seen
the show at least once. Chavez himself has not _ ``unless he put on
a wig one night and sneaked in here in disguise,'' a stage manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about the show at a recent news conference, the
president expressed curiosity and said he would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television programs have also sprung up to caricature
Chavez, a rare, but not unheard of, phenomenon in a country that as
Marquez noted in an interview, ``does not really have a solid
history of satirizing the sitting president.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently, he apparently took umbrage at a poster that
depicted him as a gun-toting Rambo, with his head, red beret
included, imposed on Sylvester Stallone's bare torso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corrupt resort to the lowest form of dirty war, printing a
placard that incites violence, trying in vain to tarnish the
president's image,'' thundered an editorial in a new government-run
newspaper of which Chavez is the editor-in-chief. ``A Chavez-Rambo
is the ultimate brain wave of those who have lost even their
imagination in their desperate effort to cling to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he was not fazed by the prospect of having Chavez
in the audience. ``The night he comes, if he ever does, I'm going
to pull out all the stops and cut loose with every idea that I've
been storing up but haven't used yet,'' he said enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a moment and then, with perfect comic timing,
delivered his punch line: ``After all, that may very well be our
last show.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was originally intended to have a four-day run during
Carnival in February. But the audience response was so
enthusiastic, with sold-out houses every night as word of mouth
spread, that the closing date kept getting put off. Now the troupe
even plans to travel to the United States in August for
performances in Miami, Orlando and New York.
</P>
<P>
   About the only criticism of the revue has come from a few
die-hard Chavez supporters, who point to its ticket price of $25 as
proof that the show is pandering to the prejudices of the moneyed
Caracas elite.
</P>
<P>
   But the show has also traveled to cities in the Venezuelan
interior and charged lower prices, including a recent performance
that filled a 7,000-seat basketball arena in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the country sees themselves and their concerns
reflected in this show in one form or another,'' said Wilmer
Ramirez, a comedian who has a popular morning radio program here
and plays a talk show host in the revue. ``We're like a safety
valve for Venezuela. As the level of political tension rises, so
does the tone of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening monologue, Marquez muses that Venezuelan history
might have been different had South America been settled by the
English and the entire United States by Spain. ``If that had
happened, we would be the United Kingdom of Venezuela, a name with
real class, and Chavez obviously would not be president,'' Marquez
jokes. ``No. He would be king.''
</P>
<P>
   As Marquez and other cast members readily admit, they are trying
through such banter to make some serious points about Venezuela's
crisis and solutions to it.
</P>
<P>
   In one skit, for instance, Chavez is urged to take his oath of
office not on the 1961 Venezuelan Constitution, which he derides as
moribund and wants to replace, but on the 210-year-old U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball glove in hand, he initially demurs, saying, ``That one
isn't moribund; it's a zombie.'' But Ramirez's character rebukes
him, saying, ``If it has served the United States and not been
changed, it must be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez closes the show by citing Gen. Carlos Soublette, a
19th-century president who, when informed of a satirical play in
which he was the main target, responded that Venezuela would remain
in good health so long as ``the people are able to mock their
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The country will only be in danger, he added, ``when the
president makes a mockery of the people.''

FOR SOME CHILDREN, IT'S AN AFTER-SCHOOL PRESSURE COOKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill., N.H., Mich.)   (af)  
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With September on the horizon, families are making plans for the
new school year as well as for the new after-school year. My family
included.
</P>
<P>
   My 5-year-old daughter will play soccer and wants to take an art
class, ballet and possibly gymnastics. My 9-year-old son will be in
the school chorus and may add tennis lessons, but he has vetoed my
suggestion to start piano.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no end to the variety of organized activities
designed to occupy children's ``free'' time these days. We parents
like to sign our children up for activities because they serve many
purposes: They help them make friends, keep them away from the
television, teach them important skills and, of course, look good
on their college applications.
</P>
<P>
   But as we consider the limits of our children's time, as well as
our own bank accounts, we also wonder how many extracurricular
activities are enough and how many are too much.
</P>
<P>
   Child therapists and sports doctors have been pondering this
question, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they say that children who participate in a
variety of after-school activities are lucky: they're socializing,
learning and having fun.
</P>
<P>
   But these experts are also seeing children who are overscheduled
to the point that they're suffering, physically and emotionally. At
the very least, many of the busiest children are sleep-deprived.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gabrielle Carlson, director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, got
a phone call recently from an administrator of the school that one
of her patients, a sixth-grade boy, attended. ``The school people
were saying, can you put in a word with the kid's parents for
cutting down his schedule because he was coming to school
exhausted,'' Dr. Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After school he was going to a couple of music lessons and
sports, tutoring another child and possibly studying a foreign
language. He was getting his homework done between 10 and 12 at
night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the boy's parents were surprised when Dr. Carlson told
them that their son was doing too much. ``The parents hadn't
thought that their child was overscheduled because he wanted to do
all this stuff,'' she said. ``He was like a kid in a candy store.''
But because the boy was tired much of the time, he and his parents
agreed to cut back on his activities.
</P>
<P>
   For many children, the problem is not so much the volume of
activities, but the pressure that sometimes goes along with them:
pressure from parents, coaches and often the children themselves to
excel.
</P>
<P>
   And the pressure is greatest when they are shuttled not to
activities that they want to do, but to activities that their
parents want them to do. Doctors say that some children feel so
much pressure for high performance that they develop stress-related
symptoms like insomnia, stomachaches, headaches, anxiety and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a significant problem, particularly in
upper-middle-class families that are intent on having their
children involved with a lot of activities and doing them well,''
said Dr. Henry J. Gault, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in
Northbrook, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that overscheduling children causes psychiatric
disorders like depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no research examining the relationship. But based on
their clinical experience, many therapists say that the stress of
being overbooked can push children who are susceptible to these
problems over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see kids who are very depressed and they say that they can't
please their mothers,'' Dr. Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids equate overscheduling with high expectations of the
parent,'' she added. ``Sometimes it's not the parent but the kid
who has high expectations. The kid thinks, `I'm doing six things, I
should be No. 1 at them, or at least some of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Herrin, co-director of the Eating Disorders
Education, Prevention and Treatment Program at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, N.H., said there was' a connection between overscheduling
and the development of eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of teen-agers who have no discretionary time,''
Dr. Herrin said. ``Piano is squeezed in before soccer. They've got
theater on the weekends. For some kids that's OK, but for others,
the lack of downtime is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herrin said overscheduling could contribute to eating
disorders in two ways. One is that after years of having their
parents plan their calendars, children and teen-agers feel that
they have no control over how they spend their time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At the most primary level, eating disorders are about wanting
control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, the children feel driven to perfectionism, another trait
associated with eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between eating disorders and activities appears
to be strongest with sports.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of disordered eating among female athletes is
estimated to be as high as 62 percent, far greater than the
estimate of 3 percent among the general population of girls and
young women.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the risk of psychiatric disorders, experts see
another problem with an over-involvement in sports: burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens a lot, especially when parents sign kids up for a
lot of sports or when the competition increases,'' said Michelle
Klein, executive director of the National Youth Sports Safety
Foundation, a national educational organization in Boston. ``They
lose interest in sports because they're not enjoying themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Janda, an orthopedic surgeon in Ann Arbor, Mich., and
director of the Institute for Preventive Sports Medicine, a
research organization, said that burnout was a growing problem
because organized sports were demanding that kids play harder at
younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   And in the course of treating children for sports injuries,
Janda said, some tell him that they don't really like the sports
that they play but that their parents or coaches make them play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times the kid is saying, `Too much,' but no one's
listening,'' Janda said. ``If the child is good at a sport, the
parents or the coach may lay a guilt trip on him if he says no.''
</P>
<P>
   These experts, many of whom are parents themselves, realize that
it can be tough to let children drop sports or other activities
that they're good at, or that seem good for them.
</P>
<P>
   Parents feel pressure to find constructive ways for their
children to spend the hours after school, as well as to help their
children keep up in the increasingly competitive universe of grade
school, college admissions and college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents want to do well by their kids, but there are so
many community pressures,'' said Dr. Georgia Witkin, the director
of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Stress Program and the author
of ``Kid Stress'' (Viking, 1999). ``A lot of parents feel that if
their kids don't do it all, they're not doing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Dr. Witkin and other therapists see children who are
overscheduled, they try to help the parents find the right balance
between enriching activity and downtime. There's no ideal number of
scheduled events per week that children should be doing, because
children have different tolerance levels for activity.
</P>
<P>
   But parents can tell if their child is doing too much by looking
for certain common warning signs. For example, the child may become
increasingly moody, argumentative or tired or may worry about
finding time to do homework.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, schoolwork is neglected. Other times, the child shows
stress-related symptoms like frequent headaches, stomachaches and
insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Or the child says he has had enough, as my son did in February
after three months of intensive preparation after school and often
on weekends for Odyssey of the Mind, a problem-solving competition.
When I asked him what he wanted to do next, he said, ``I just want
to watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitive pressures notwithstanding, when children show signs
of overload, therapists say that dropping an activity or two is in
their best interest, even if that means they will watch more
television.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witkin said that children feel better when they have
permission to cut back, but that they're not the only ones: ``The
parents are relieved, too.''

DANGERS OF ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE BY THE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing problem in the
United States as overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics causes
bacteria to become resistant to the medicines that are supposed to
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the antibiotic prescriptions that are issued each year
are used by children under 6, and this age group is more likely to
be infected by highly resistant bacteria than any other segment of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul A. Offit, the chief of infectious diseases at the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Dr. Bonnie Fass-Offit, a
pediatrician in private practice at Kids First Haverford/Radnor in
Pennsylvania, have addressed this issue in their new book,
``Breaking the Antibiotic Habit: A Parent's Guide to Coughs, Colds,
Ear Infections and Sore Throats'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.), which
they wrote with their colleague, Dr. Louis M. Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they responded to questions about antibiotic dependency in
children and how to avoid it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do antibiotic-resistant bacteria do harm to children?
</P>
<P>
   A. Recently, bacteria that commonly infect children and adults
(like streptococcus pneumoniae and staph) have become progressively
resistant to antibiotics. This resistance is generated by
antibiotic overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread, indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created highly
resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Some children who could normally be treated with a single course
of antibiotics have to be treated with two or more courses.
</P>
<P>
   And some who could have been previously treated by oral
antibiotics at home now have to be admitted to hospitals and
treated with intravenous antibiotics. These children are at greater
risk of developing bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who is at the greatest risk?
</P>
<P>
   A. Infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria are much more
common in high income, white, suburban children under 6, who have
received an antibiotic in the last three months and attend child
care.
</P>
<P>
   These children are much more likely to visit their doctor and
are at greater risk of receiving an antibiotic than populations
that are medically underserved.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the biggest mistakes parents and doctors make?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Antibiotics work against bacterial infections, but not
against viral infections. If you take 100 children with fever, on
average, 90 of them will have a viral infection and 10 will have a
bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the research shows that 60 to 70 of these
children will receive antibiotics, even though antibiotics will do
nothing to lessen the symptoms or to hasten the resolution of the
viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, doctors need to clearly explain to parents the
difference between viral and bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses that cause colds, sore throats, bronchitis and ear
fluid cannot be treated by antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial infections (like sinus infections, strep throat,
pneumonia and ear infections) can be treated with antibiotics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who's to blame?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many doctors say that they give antibiotics because they are
under pressure from parents to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, studies show that doctors are more likely to prescribe
an antibiotic if they think the parents want it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, on the other hand, say that doctors aren't taking the
time to explain when children need an antibiotic and when they
don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the solution?
</P>
<P>
   A. In most cases, if doctors are willing to take time to explain
the differences between viral and bacterial diseases, parents will
be more satisfied with the interaction, and children will be spared
the harmful effects of unnecessary antibiotic use.

   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in remarks laden
with political implications for her burgeoning Senate race from New
York, challenged Congress Monday to forego a ``big tax cut'' and
enact instead a White House proposal to boost education programs
for 15 million Hispanic children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton make her proposal to more than 200 Hispanic lawmakers,
government officials and activists at the White House _ and
television viewers in 11 states linked by satellite hookup.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that 15 million young Hispanics will fill the
nation's classrooms by next year as Hispanics move toward becoming
the nation's largest minority by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford a tax cut that will dramatically cut
education funding at every level, including programs in the
president's Hispanic education agenda,'' Clinton said. ``These are
not somebody else's children _ these are all of our children and we
should begin to act on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady hailed Clinton administration efforts that she
said have benefited many of the nation's 31.4 million Hispanics,
including boosting the minimum wage, expanding the earned income
tax credit, and pouring additional federal dollars into Head Start,
college loans and child care programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which won a $500 million increase
for Hispanic education initiatives from Congress for the current
year, is seeking a $650 million boost for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the trick is getting what the president proposed through
the Congress,'' Clinton said, adding: ``There are many people who
have a lot of rhetoric that is not matched by action or
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as House and Senate lawmakers were trying to find
a compromise version of a tax cut. The Senate and the House have
each approved 10-year $792 billion tax cut packages, but President
Clinton has vowed to veto any tax cut that large.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's allegiance to Hispanics' education priorities
comes as she prepares for a fourth campaign-style foray to New York
state. She launches a three-day swing through western New York on
Wednesday in Jamestown, N.Y., as she continues to ``explore'' a
possible Senate campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not cite New York during her remarks. But Hector
Cordero-Guzman, a researcher at New School University in New York
who was invited by the White House to take part in the round table
discussion, noted the plight of Hispanics in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics face multiple challenges including poverty, the
absence of health insurance, teenage pregnancy, higher
unemployment, low wages and difficulty gaining top flight
education, Cordero-Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 760,000 children in New York City who are living in
families below the poverty line, he said, 394,000 _ or 52 percent _
are Hispanic. Half of all births in New York City to women between
ages 14 to 19 are born to Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are a powerful political force in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York ranks third behind California and Texas with the
largest Hispanic population, with an estimated 2.6 million
Hispanics, or 14.2 percent of the state's population of 18.2
million, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters played a key role in helping then-Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., oust incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., in
New York's 1998 Senate race. Hispanics accounted for 6 percent of
the statewide vote. Schumer carried 82 percent of the Hispanic
vote, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton could face challenges for the Hispanic vote in New
York City if Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani runs for
the Senate seat. Giuliani carried 43 percent of the Hispanic vote
in his 1997 re-election drive during a contest in which Hispanic
voters accounted for 20 percent of the city-wide vote.

<P>
   The latest statewide poll in New York, released last Friday by
the Quinnipiac College Poll, showed Clinton and Giuliani in a dead
head, 45 percent to 45 percent, among 1,241 registered voters
questioned in survey with a margin of error of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed Clinton dominating Giuliani in New York City,
62 percent to 33 percent. But Giuliani drew heavier support in the
New York City suburbs, where he prevailed, 55 percent to 35
percent, and in upstate New York, where he dominated Clinton, 48
percent to 38 percent.

   I was returning home on a crowded Madison Avenue bus one
afternoon when a well-dressed elderly man got on and began looking
for a seat. He had what looked to be palsy in both arms, similar to
that of a person suffering from Parkinson's, and had great trouble
balancing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Though I am in my 70s, I was preparing to offer him my seat when
the one beside me became vacant and I supported him as he sat down.
I planned to help him when he got off.
</P>
<P>
   A few stops later, he started to rise and declined my help.
Indeed, as the bus stopped, I was amazed at how quickly he rose
from his seat, with no longer any signs of palsy. He jumped out the
door and disappeared into the sidewalk crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered that a minute or so before he got up, his left arm
had briefly disappeared from sight _ which was confirmed when I
patted my empty rear pocket. My attention had been diverted by a
healthy, and very active, senior citizen.

   Every building has problems, but the one Gloria Yoshida works in

women's restroom had no hot water. The men's restroom on the same
floor did, he said, so she called the building office. The
following conversation ensued:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yoshida: ``The hot water in the 21st floor ladies' room is
not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Building Office Person: ``You're not going to get hot water up
there _ there's not enough water pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yoshida: ``But there's hot water in the men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   B.O.P: ``That's because they're on a lower floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yoshida: ``You're telling me the men's room on the 21st
floor is lower than the women's on the 21st floor?''
</P>
<P>
   B.O.P: ``Yep.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the offices have moved to the 24th floor of the
same building and the situation has equalized. Neither washroom has
hot water.

   Nancy Horwich appreciates that we're all rushed and distracted
these days, but she recently observed an extreme case on Lexington
Avenue. A young man came out of a shop pushing a toddler in a
stroller at a quick pace. He caught up to a woman loaded with
shopping bags about a block away. ``You forgot this, ma'am,'' he
said. To the amazement of Ms. Horwich, he then handed over the
stroller. As he returned to his store, the shocked mother leaned
against a wall repeating, ``Oh, my God, oh, my God!''

   Barbara Brous' husband, Philip, was looking at the dessert
section at a country club buffet. The table was laden with lavish

simple-looking desserts labeled ``sugar free.'' An overweight man

Suddenly, he lifted the sugar-free placard and placed it in the

   After our regular Saturday tennis session, my doubles partner
and I returned to the parking lot to find that the left rear tire
on his car was flat. He dove into the trunk, came up with a pump,
plugged one end into the cigarette lighter, affixed the other end
to the tire valve and turned it on. The tire gradually inflated but
there was a tiny hole on the sidewall through which air was
escaping. I grabbed a Band-Aid from my bag and we applied it to the
minuscule leak. My friend tooled off, driving perhaps the world's
only Porsche repaired with a Band-Aid.

   Welcome back from Woodstock everybody! I can understand the kids
going nuts a little bit. When Nixon was President, it was easy to
be anti-establishment. Who was straighter than Nixon? Kids today
got Clinton in the White House! When you got an intern under your
desk, How do you beat that?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is billing himself as a compassionate
conservative. Know what that means? He's the guy that gives a
homeless person a housewarming gift.  &QL; 
President Clinton recently criticized George W. Bush for calling
himself a compassionate conservative. And today George W. Bush
criticized Clinton for calling himself married.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's advisors have limited his appearances with President
Clinton. They don't want him to be seen with Clinton because they
feel it casts him as a second banana. Hey, at least he can control
his banana, and that's the important thing.

<P>
   Here's something that was in the paper. Fidel Castro has
survived 637 assassination attempts. Which beats the old record
held by a 7-11 clerk in the South Bronx.

   Kmart now has its own credit card. They have a new slogan too.
``Don't leave your Mobile home without it.''

   I just love how petty politicians get. Hillary Clinton's running
for Senator in New York. Meanwhile, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New
York, he's down in Little Rock where she's from to try and raise
money for his Senate campaign. I guess the Governor of Arkansas,
who's a Republican, treated Rudy to a full-course Arkansas Italian
gourmet meal. Which is Spaghettios at Denny's. ``You get fries with
this pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers at Stanford University, women who
suppress their anger and emotions have memory problems. I think
that's true. Look at Hillary -- she spent so many years hiding her
anger at Bill, she forgot she's not from New York.

   A walk down the aisle of any decent-size drug store offers the
best evidence of the changes taking place in the children's drug
market, estimated at $450 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many over-the-counter medications are now available for infants
and young children, in many more varieties than in the past, and
their numbers seem to be growing.
</P>
<P>
   Some health experts question the health benefits of some of
those in the growing cold-and-flu and pain relief categories, and
say the plethora of products increases the chance that a parent
could give a child the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an unbelievable marketing mania out there to
try to capture parents into using various products,'' said Dr.
Brian Bates, a member of the drug committee of the American Academy
of Pediatrics. The result, he said, is often confusion for
pediatrician and parent alike.
</P>
<P>
   Parents seeking to help a child with teething pain or to reduce
a fever now can choose between the traditional drug, acetaminophen,
and liquid ibuprofen. Some brands offer different versions for
toddlers and infants, with different strengths.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-remedy market is even more complicated, with companies
jumping in with new products designed to increase their share of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Often, one product comes in several varieties (for head colds,
congestion and so on), not to mention several flavors and forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now on its way to stores across the United States, just in time
for cold and flu season, is Bayer's latest addition to the
competition: Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fizzy, it's fun, it's full of flavor!'' says Bayer's
promotional material for the drug. ``And it's sure to be the
hottest back-to-school item on every parent's `must-have list.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are skeptical, if not about Alka-Seltzer,
specifically, then about the many remedies being peddled for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cough and cold preparations, they look sort of pretty in
the bottle, there are a lot of nice colors, and most of them taste
good,'' said Dr. David Nagle, a Kaiser Permanente pediatrician at
Children's Hospital in Washington, who is a consultant for
Zero-to-Three, a nonprofit children's advocacy group in Washington.
``But they don't do very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have also expressed concern about blurring the line
between drugs and candy with products like medicated chewable
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   When pharmaceutical industry officials discuss the growing
number of children's drugs, they say they are simply responding to
the demands of parents. Demand No. 1, they say, is for a drug made
in such a way that their children will actually take it.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Jay Kolpon, vice president Bayer's Consumer Care
Division, is what prompted the company to invent Alka-Seltzer for
children. ``It's like taking soda for relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to A.C. Nielsen, the consumer research group, sales of
both pain relievers and cold remedies for children have jumped
significantly over the last five years. Sales for cold remedies
went to $231 million from $160 million, and sales of pain relievers
to $226 million from $150 million in the time.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors generally recognize the usefulness of drugs like
ibuprofen and acetaminophen for children, when taken after
consultation with a physician (especially for infants under 6
months), they say the varying strengths of some of the products can
produce confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Liquids marketed for infants are sometimes much more
concentrated than those for children _ even though some parents
assume that a drug meant for an infant must be weaker.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon, doctors say, for parents to give their
children overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   While this is not necessarily serious if it happens once, if the
parent is giving the child a drug over a period of days, harm could
result. The solution, some doctors believe, is to have a universal
concentration for children.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cold remedies, the doctors say, the problem is not
only that they might do no good, but that they might have unwanted
side-effects among very young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost I would say: Under 6 months, it's probably
not a good idea to even give any of these products for colds,'' Dr.
Bates said. ``There are so many side-effects. It's very
unpredictable how they're going to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lynette Ciervo, communications director for Zero-to-Three,
``If there is any doubt about a medicine, call the doctor,'' she
said. ``No question that you ever have is a dumb question.''

USE OF SOY FOR BABIES IS FOCUS OF DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ohio, S.C.)   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of infant formula based on soy protein rather than cows'
milk have risen in recent years, driven in part by the vegetarian
allure. But some parents are worried that the estrogen-like
substances found in soy, a popular alternative to pharmaceutical
hormone replacements among menopausal women, may not be good for a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the debate has focused on those substances,
known as phytoestrogens. In 1997, a study published in Lancet found
that phytoestrogen levels in babies fed soy formula were several
thousand times higher than in babies who drank breast or cows'
milk.
</P>
<P>
   This finding led to concerns among parents that puberty could be
delayed in boys and accelerated in girls. A New Zealand group led
an effort to ban soy formula; the effort failed, but sales there
fell more than one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one of the researchers involved in the Lancet study
suggested at a Stanford University conference that new studies
should take the opposite approach, and look at what he said were
the likely health benefits of greater exposure to phytoestrogens.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Kenneth Setchell of the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine, said he had long been interested
because in countries where soy was consumed in large quantities,
like Japan, ``the incidence of hormone-dependent diseases like
breast cancer and prostate cancer are very low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that what you eat early in life has a big effect on
later health,'' Setchell said. ``We know that in animal studies
phytoestrogens have had a protective effect. And we know that in
the adult model they clearly have anti-cancer effects.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is a parent to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Baker, the chairwoman of the nutrition committee of
the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the realistic if
uninspiring answer was that nobody knew, but it seemed unlikely
that after 30 years of widespread use there were either hidden
dangers or hidden benefits to be found for soy milk.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the academy adopted a policy that essentially ranked
soy as a third choice behind breast milk and cows' milk formula.
Dr. Baker, a professor of pediatrics at the Medical University of
South Carolina in Charleston, said the academy ``takes a very
strong stand that mothers' milk is the most important nutrient and
should be the sole food for the first four to six months of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron-fortified cows' milk formula is ranked ahead of soy because
the protein quality seems higher, and premature or low-weight
babies do not create bone mass as quickly on soy milk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Soy is the right choice for children whose mothers cannot
breast-feed or who choose not to and who are lactose intolerant _
that is, have an allergic reaction to cows' milk. But true lactose
intolerance, as opposed to temporary reactions caused by
gastrointestinal infections, is far rarer than is commonly thought,
Dr. Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the American population, people attribute all sorts
of difficulties to lactose intolerance'' that are in fact due to
something else, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dr. Baker says she is befuddled by the appeal of soy
formula, which accounts for 25 percent of formula sales in some
parts of the country, she does not believe it is a bad thing,
either. ``We do know that babies fed on soy demonstrate normal
growth and development; so far we have not identified any long-term
health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Setchell says he, too, is a strong believer that ``breast is
best'' but adds that doctors must ``face the reality that many
women are unable or choose not to.'' Because so many babies drink
formula, it would be worthwhile to investigate what extra benefits
different types of formulas might have, as well as setting to rest
parental concerns about possible hazards, he said.

`STRANGER IN THE EARTH': A CUB REPORTER OUTGROWS THE GARDENING
COLUMN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(yn) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The names of the characters in Marcel Theroux's first novel _
from Horace Littlefair, the book's bumbling hero, to his friends
and acquaintances, Derwent Boothby, Agnes Kettle, Victor Sneasby
and Trevor Diamond _ sound as if they might have come from an
Evelyn Waugh novel, and so do many of the antics that animate its
plot. Indeed ``A Stranger in the Earth'' often reads like a kinder,
gentler, less uproarious version of ``Scoop,'' Waugh's classic
sendup of Fleet Street.
</P>
<P>
   This time around the naive provincial and gardening columnist
turned big-time reporter is named Horace Littlefair, not William
Boot; this time around, the newspaper that employs him is called
The South London Bugle, not The Daily Beast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Theroux's subject matter and approach are all too
derivative, he nonetheless manages in this buoyant novel to amuse
and entertain. He has more affection for his characters than Waugh
and fewer comic gifts, and he aspires less to satirize and skewer
than simply to regale and divert. With ``A Stranger in the Earth,''
he has made an engaging if modest debut.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many first novels, ``Stranger'' is a Bildungsroman that
traces the coming of age of its hero, and it begins in the tiny
English village of Great Much, where Horace Littlefair, an orphan
who has grown up with his grandfather, is about to leave home to
seek his fortune in faraway London.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest, callow and trusting, Horace is ill prepared for life in
the big city. On his first day there, he is ripped off by a taxi
driver and left to spend the night on a park bench. His fusty,
old-fashioned clothes make him the constant butt of jokes, and so
do his credulous good manners. He gives some bad advice to the
first woman he likes and promptly gets her deported, and he gets
himself into an embarrassing situation when he goes to a
transvestite bar and has too much to drink. Most nights Horace sits
quietly at home, playing Scrabble with his landlord, Mr. Narayan,
who almost inevitably wins.
</P>
<P>
   As an apprentice at his great-uncle's newspaper, The South
London Bugle, Horace is an anomaly among the cynical reporters.
Most of the ambitious young trainees treat the third-rate little
paper as though they were felons in a remote penal colony or ``like
young consuls, posted to some fetid African capital, sitting it out
in the hope of more glamorous and lucrative assignments later on.''
Most can ``barely conceal their eagerness to leave,'' whereas
Horace seems to take ``the order of things for granted'': ``there
was no chafing, no unresolved ambitions. He seemed content.'' His
first genuine assignment: to write a gardening column featuring an
easy-to-answer weekly quiz.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of doing his work, Horace makes the acquaintance
of various eccentrics, egomaniacs and would-be mentors. There's
Barnaby Colefax, a boisterous local politician who gets caught in
his car with a prostitute; Trevor Diamond, a publicity-minded
activist dedicated to the plight of the urban fox; a pretty
reporter named Jocasta intent on getting a big political scoop;
Horace's new editor, Harvard Machine, who wants to bring the
newspaper into the 21st century by installing a new system of
computers, and Lakshmi Narayan, his landlord's daughter, who wants
to bring Horace into the 20th by updating his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   As things happen in this sort of comic novel, all these people
turn out to play central roles in the hero's life, and almost all
of them also turn out to be connected to one another. An unlikely
alliance between Colefax and Diamond will lead to Colefax's
political comeback and a nationwide movement that incongruously
links the rights of foxes with British independence from a unified
Europe. It's a bizarre story _ with a hidden link to Colefax's
arrest _ that Horace, Jocasta and Harvard will all end up covering,
and it's a story that will end, predictably enough, with Horace's
transformation from a geeky rube into ``a dapper figure, dressed in
a charcoal grey suit and peacock blue tie, who owned a personal
stereo and spent two evenings a week at the gymnasium.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux, who is the son of the novelist and travel writer Paul
Theroux, narrates these events with authority and brio, fluently
weaving small oddball nuggets of social detail into his story while
tossing off some brightly observed cameo portraits along the way.
Though his ending is a little rushed, though his humor is
occasionally forced, he has written a charming and sprightly novel.

GENE THAT GIVES POWER TO FLOWER IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Calif.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether an elaborate orchid, a simple daisy or a many-petaled
garden rose, the world's flowers are all variations on one simple
plan.
</P>
<P>
   According to this standard floral scheme, at the very center of
a flower lies the reason for its existence, the plant's
reproductive organs, surrounding which are whorls of petals, which
are themselves encircled by the leaf-like sepals that originally
enclosed the bud.
</P>
<P>
   But despite an intense scientific interest in recent years in
how this blueprint gets realized in flowers, researchers had been
unable to find the gene that switched on the making of the
different parts of a blossom. Now, according to two new studies in
a recent issue of Science, researchers have identified the master
gene that lays down the architectural plan for the construction of
a proper flower.
</P>
<P>
   Known as leafy, this control gene turns on the sepal and
petal-forming genes at a flower's perimeter and the genes for the
building of reproductive organs that produce pollen, seeds and
fruit, right where they belong in the center.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say that by identifying a master switch gene for
the formation of a flower's reproductive organs _ the plant parts
that provide most of the world's food _ the new results will be of
particular interest to agricultural scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say the potential to control petal-formation
will be of interest to horticultural researchers, in an industry
always looking for more petals. The studies could even be a step
toward such things as trees that don't shed pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real breakthrough,'' said Dr. Vivian Irish, a plant
developmental biologist at Yale University. Flower development, Dr.
Irish said, is one of the few systems in which both the master gene
and those genes that it controls have been identified. ``It's going
to be a good paradigm for how these things work,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The studies were carried out by two groups of plant
developmental biologists, both working with Arabidopsis, a plant
whose genetics are so well known that it is the botanical
equivalent of the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   One group was led by Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz at the California
Institute of Technology and the other by Dr. Detlef Weigel at the
Salk Institute for Biological Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Based on previous research, biologists already knew that leafy
was a master control gene at a much higher level that could trigger
the growth of an entire flower, initiating the growth of blossoms
where there would only have been stem and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also knew that each of three genes in a group known
as the ABC genes could turn on the making of particular flower
parts. Working from the outside in, the A genes switch on sepals at
the outer edge and the petals that come next. B genes, whose work
overlaps with A and C, turn on petals and the pollen-producing
stamens that form the next circle. Finally, C genes control the
stamens and lastly, in the flower's absolute center, the fruit and
seed-producing carpels.
</P>
<P>
   But what levels of genetic control lay between leafy's authority
to initiate a flower and the detail work done within each flower by
the ABC genes remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is comparable to a corporate CEO, in charge of the
operation but probably not making detailed decisions in every
department. Weigel said researchers had figured that it was
impossible for a master control gene like leafy to be working on
defining individual flower parts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said he and his team spent years looking for the
genes that the high-ranking leafy switched on that ultimately
switched on the lower-level ABC genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find what was in between,'' said Weigel,
``until we realized there wasn't anything in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Weigel and his colleagues discovered that the protein produced
by the leafy gene latched directly onto a particular sequence of
DNA within a C gene, turning on the production of stamens and
carpels. This C gene, also known as the agamous gene, is so called
because plants that carry nonfunctional agamous genes lack sexual
organs (``a'' meaning ``without'' and ``gamous'' meaning
``reproductive organs''). Such a defect can be rather attractive in
a flower as stamens and carpels become petals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other mutant plants in which the agamous gene is turned on not
only in the center of the flower but everywhere become a display of
sexual organs entirely unadorned by petals.
</P>
<P>
   In the other study, Meyerowitz's group showed that leafy could
also turn on one of the A genes, those that control the development
of sepals and petals. In addition, Dr. Irish said her group had
some evidence that leafy might be controlling B genes in a similar
manner, putting leafy in control of the entire show.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers note that while leafy can turn on these genes,
it is not acting alone. Biologists say they are already on the hunt
for other proteins that must be working in concert with leafy not
only to switch the ABC genes on but to switch them on in the right
places and at the right times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leafy's in the middle of a lot of things,'' said Dr. Tom Jack,
molecular geneticist at Dartmouth College. He notes that in
addition to turning on genes and coordinating with other proteins,
leafy is also outranked by genes that can turn it on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers now are particularly interested in those
highest-ranking genes, since they are the ones that can control the
timing of flowering in a plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term application is the control of when crops flower,
which is very important,'' Meyerowitz said, ``because when a crop
flowers determines where it can and can't be grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers may take an interest in the new research as a
step toward turning off the production of pollen altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Because of increasing concerns about genetically engineered
plants and their pollen, which contains foreign genes, researchers
say the new studies are particularly interesting. Conceivably, the
information could lead to the elimination of stamen and pollen
production in genetically engineered trees, which can live for many
years dispersing pollen over long distances.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are only now beginning to identify the genes that
determine what parts grow where in a flower. In nature, however,
evolution has been experimenting with these genes for eons to help
produce the world's diversity of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   One species of Clarkia, for example, a flower in the evening
primrose family, has in place of petals what look like sepals.
</P>
<P>
   Another, which Meyerowitz is studying along with colleagues who
discovered the plant in Mexico, is a bizarre plant without leaves
or roots, but with flowers in which stamens and carpels have
switched places.
</P>
<P>
   Plant breeders have unknowingly become adept at fiddling with
these very same genes. Petal-filled roses and other cultivated
flowers are mutants in which reproductive parts have been replaced
by attractive petals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say these beautiful genetic experiments are probably
alterations in the C gene, which controls the production of
reproductive parts.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders have even toyed with plant genes to the point that such
oddities as the green rose, in which all of the flower parts have
been replaced by leaves, can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiments in floral architecture are nothing new. In
ancient Greece, there were reports of mutant flowers like a rose
with a hundred petals. And Chinese records from the ninth century
mention double peonies, a mutant that carries many extra petals in
place of reproductive parts.

BARGAIN RATES, MAGNIFICENT VIEWS FOR GOLFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ Beautiful as it is, Lake Tahoe is not the
easiest place to grow a golf course. The winter snows are heavy and
the summer season is short, which means either no one or everyone
wants to play 18 today.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Shore was my vacation destination of choice this
summer, and even though there are only two full-size courses here _
glorious Edgewood and the masses' choice, Lake Tahoe Golf Course _
there would be golf.
</P>
<P>
   Nine rounds of golf, in fact, all around the lake and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Only two rounds in California and seven in Nevada. Four rounds
in the mountains, five in the high desert. Four rounds with my
favorite golf partner, five with new friends.
</P>
<P>
   If this is your idea of a vacation, too, it's going to take some
planning and some driving. The less planning you do, the more wind
you're likely to encounter, because it roars onto all of these
courses most afternoons. And the less driving you do, the more
you'll have to spend.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the bad news. The good news is that each of the nine
courses I visited over the course of two weeks had something
special to offer. There wasn't a clunker in the bunch. Here's a
look: First stop, Eagle Valley (775-887-2380) in Carson City, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Carson City is a great destination for golf nuts, because it is
experiencing a golf course glut and course and lodging operators
want your business badly. Eagle Valley's hook is ``Affordable
Golf,'' and if you visit on a weekday you can play two very
different 18-hole courses for under $50 _ even with wheels on the
cart-mandatory West course.
</P>
<P>
   The more popular, very walkable East course is long and flat and
open, ideal for the vacationer whose clubs have been in the garage
for three months. The West offers high desert, target-style golf
and difficult conditions for the more experienced player.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, it's Dayton Valley Country Club (775-246-7888). This
is a longer drive from most anywhere, but there's Arnie's picture
on the scorecard to greet you upon your arrival. Here, too, is a
flat and open course, but with lots of water and picturesque holes.
The par-3s are especially memorable here, and the pristine
conditions and overall quality made it one of the best bargains on
the itinerary, at $55 on a weekday including cart. Casey Martin
shot 64 here during tour qualifying. You go ahead and try.
</P>
<P>
   Empire Ranch (775-885-2100), a 27-hole complex, is the closest
course to downtown Carson, and yet another bargain. Somewhere in
between Eagle and Dayton with its facility and course conditions,
Empire Ranch offers three nines, and you can play all of them for
$45 riding (though you could easily walk here) on a weekday.
</P>
<P>
   The three nines are surprisingly varied _ the yellow the most
open and flat, the red (my favorite) the trickiest and most varied
and the blue, considered the most user-friendly by the
customer-friendly staff here, with several memorable holes.
</P>
<P>
   Back up the hill to Lake Tahoe, Incline Village (888-236-8725)
was the first golfing stop. No more than 30 minutes from the South
Shore, Incline's championship course is virtually private if you're
not living or staying here. That's because the rates for locals are
$35, for visitors $115 _ and yet the course is busy, busy, busy.
It's a narrow slip of fairway, with many dramatic holes twisting
and turning amid tall pines that shelter it from those afternoon
breezes _ the kind of place where you'll remember the holes as you
run through your card later.
</P>
<P>
   Edgewood Tahoe (775-588-3566) is, of course, the jewel of the
circuit here, and the place was booked up for the next two weeks at
$175 a round. You feel the luxury here, from the striking clubhouse
to the stocked pro shop to the wonderful grub at the turn _ and
conditions are remarkable. With 12-minute tee times and three
lakeside finishing holes, you're getting the best of all Tahoe
worlds here, with not a slot machine in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Genoa Lakes (775-782-4653) takes just a 25-minute drive over the
Kingsbury Grade from South Shore, and a worthwhile jaunt at that.
</P>
<P>
   Another place where the layout is not easily forgotten, with all
of the par-4s facing different directions and the challenging,
picturesque yet forgiving signature of John Harbottle's design.
</P>
<P>
   You'll spend $75 here on a weekday without feeling robbed.
Indeed, there's little letdown a day after playing Edgewood.
</P>
<P>
   Our longest ride was to Lahontan (530-582-3702), just north of
Northstar, because we could not pass on the chance to play this
ultra-private course that has won acclaim from the golf magazines
and Northern California's best players.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Weiskopf knew he was on to something special when he laid
his eyes on the wide Sierra vistas here, and he designed a layout
worthy of the location. Problem is, the exclusivity of the course
is keeping it from winning the accolades its owners might like it
to have. Those who have the portfolio might want to look closer at
Lahontan; we won't soon forget the look that we had.
</P>
<P>
   We figured on a rude awakening the next day, yet the area's
busiest course set us down gently. Lake Tahoe GC (530-577-0788),
which is operated in national parkland by American Golf, is a
beautiful place, with the Upper Truckee meandering through and
snow-capped peaks all around, and the course is in remarkable
condition for its 10,000 to 15,000 rounds in these peak summer
months. This is one course you will want to walk ($44 on a
weekday), especially since pace is sometimes slow, as you savor the
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Last stop, back in Genoa, is Sierra Nevada Golf Ranch
(775-782-7700), where stop signs say WHOA and bar stools are
saddles. Another Harbottle design, Sierra Nevada sits higher up
than Genoa Lakes and thus offers a different feeling. There are
great views all day, but a brutal wind comes up most afternoons
making this not worth looking for a twilight bargain. Elevation
changes mean you've got to take the cart, which features the
ever-helpful GPS caddy-on-a-screen. If you're going to play here,
spring for the $100 prime tee-time or else bring your wind game.

 &HT;    Gun control in wake of Atlanta shootings
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Mark Barton's massacre in Atlanta, Time
($3.50) reports on Americans' changing attitude toward gun control.
According to a Time/
</P>
<P>
   CNN poll, 76 percent of those surveyed favor registration of
handguns. And, in an emotional essay, Roger Rosenblatt calls for
getting rid of handguns entirely. ``In 10 years, even five, we
could be looking back on the past three decades of gun violence in
America the way one once looked back upon 18th century madhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek ($3.50) devotes nine pages to the killings, including a
photograph of the gory suicide scene in Barton's van, but kept its
cover story on cosmetic surgery. Once the province of women and men
over 50, plastic surgery has become the fountain of youth for
people in their 20s _ or even teens. Part of the boom apparently is
fueled by doctors who are unhappy with managed care and dwindling
profits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Teen minds: Any parent of a teenager knows that a kid's mood
can change faster than the images on MTV. Hormones are a factor,
but the true source may lie in a higher region. U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($3.50) talks to doctors about the effects of brain
chemistry on teen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Memory lane: The New Yorker ($3) returns to the decade of
flower children, anti-war and civil rights movements with a 16-page
spread of photographs from Richard Avedon's upcoming book, ``The
Sixties.'' Accompanying the dramatic photographs are Doon Arbus'
interviews with many of the participants, including Abbie Hoffman,
Janis Joplin and Bob Dylan. Dylan, recalling 30 years later how he
felt about that time, says: ``One of the feelings of it was that
you were a part of a very elite, special group of people that was
outside and downtrodden. ... That's been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, Rebecca Mead reports on the
burgeoning business of egg donation. Human eggs, that is. There are
nearly 200 egg donation agencies in the United States, Mead says,
offering up to $50,000 for the eggs of healthy women with good SAT
scores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Selling shyness: You may not realize it, but if you're afraid
of speaking in public and have trouble making friends, you're
suffering from one of the trendiest mental illnesses. We used to
call it shyness, but now it's social phobia. The difference, says
Michelle Cottle in The New Republic ($3), is a matter of
definition. And money. Doctors and corporations have mobilized to
warn us about this new health menace _ one that's treatable with
medication, of course. While there are those with real problems,
Cottle insists there is no epidemic and no reason ``for the mental
health establishment and drug companies to push the notion that
more than 35 million Americans are adrift on a sea of morbid
shyness.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Summer sizzler: Actress Angelina Jolie tells all and bares
almost all in Rolling Stone's ($3) ``Hot List'' issue. Jolie
discusses her fascination with tattoos and knives as well as her
recent breakup with husband Jonny Lee Miller. Elsewhere in the
issue, the editors list the hottest actor (Steve Zahn of ``Reality
Bites''), hottest band (Basement Jaxx), hottest model (Gisele) and
hottest food (organ meats).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Jezebel ($3.95) provides a service for singles
this month by listing Atlanta's ``20 Most Eligible Bachelors and
Bachelorettes.'' Among those who made the cut are Mumbo Jumbo
bartender Lindsey Fisher, WXIA-TV reporter Valerie Hoff, music
producer/performer Jermaine Dupri, Hawks forward Alan Henderson and
Falcons cheerleader and professional boxer Nina Ahlin. ...
Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) reports that when ``Notting Hill''
passed $100 million at the box office, Julia Roberts became the
first actress ever to have six films top the century mark. ...
Andrew Weil is not a favorite of most doctors, but do his
alternative medical methods work? Discover ($4.99) profiles the
popular health guru and talks to some of his more vocal critics,
who say alternative medicine is effective primarily for ``the
worried well ... young and healthy people who have trivial
complaints.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Much of the emotional, political and legal excess
that fouls the sorry saga of President Clinton's dalliance with
Monica Lewinsky has been justified as essential to demonstrate that
no citizen is above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that principle was merely an excuse for partisan
craziness and vindictive self-righteousness. But it was always, at
bottom, the legitimate problem the president could not get around,
no matter how he wriggled.
</P>
<P>
   He had to be held legally accountable, and finally last week he
was.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional impeachment process was a political vendetta
wildly disproportionate to his sins. But U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright got it just right.
</P>
<P>
   She fined Clinton nearly $90,000 for civil contempt of court for
denying he'd ever been alone with Lewinsky or had sex with her
during a deposition under oath in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not actually admitted to lying; he still contends
his answers were ``legally accurate'' although deliberately
misleading. The country, of course, has never bought that excuse
and neither did Wright, once Clinton finally acknowledged an
improper relationship. Judges do not take kindly to being deceived.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't capitulate to the Jones' lawyers request to rip off
the president for nearly a half million; she carefully explained
why most of their expense claims were irrelevant to Clinton's false
statements. Nor did she pronounce judgment on the full unhappy
consequences to the presidency and the country of Clinton's illicit
behavior; she addressed only his offense in her own official
presence.
</P>
<P>
   What she did was levy an appropriate penalty at an appropriate
sum, more than Clinton's lawyers wanted but far, far less than
Jones' lawyers wanted. Wright said she did it not just to punish
Clinton but to set an example, ``to deter others who might consider
emulating the president's misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The message: Don't mess with the courts. If you swear you will
tell the truth, you'd better do so, even if it is embarrassing,
even if you are a big shot and even if you think the subject of the
inquiry is nobody's business. It is a powerful message central to
the credibility of the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thus became the first sitting president to be held in
contempt of court by a federal judge, an historic rebuke indeed.
This is less sensational but more legally devastating than the
impeachment farce. It cannot be dismissed as mere politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wisely did not challenge Judge Wright's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Clinton is that this may be the end of his
major legal complications, even though independent counsel Kenneth
Starr is still hiding in the weeds and the political fallout
staggers on.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could still be disbarred in Arkansas, but that wouldn't
matter much. Nobody thinks he wants to practice law in Little Rock
after he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, another appropriate legal decision came down last
week, illustrating that what goes around, comes around not only for
presidents but for those who set out to destroy presidents. Linda
Tripp, the meanie who squealed on Lewinsky, may be about to pay the
price of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland grand jury indicted Tripp on two felony counts for
illegally taping her intimate conversations with Lewinsky without
Lewinsky's knowledge and for playing the tapes to selected
reporters. Maryland law protects individual civil liberties by
forbidding wiretapping without the consent of the tappee. If
convicted, Tripp could go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two recordings Tripp admitted she made after being
informed by a lawyer that such taping was illegal in Maryland.
Ignorance of the law can be an excuse but not in those two cases.
</P>
<P>
   She turned her clandestine tapes over to Starr's prosecutors in
return for a limited immunity agreement. There will be a lot of
legal wrangling about the conflict between a federal immunity deal
and her prosecution under Maryland law, with the outcome uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp claimed self-preservation as her well-intentioned motive
for taping. Clinton also claimed self-preservation as his motive.
And she should be held accountable in an appropriate way, just as
he finally has been. She, too, must set an example.
</P>
<P>
   Jail sounds like the equivalent of impeachment _ far too much
punishment for the error. But a hefty fine, loss of her well-paid
Pentagon job at taxpayer expense and permanent public humiliation
sound about right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Indiana Jones, the daredevil hero of Steven Spielberg's
adventure-film trilogy, had been invented as a zoologist rather
than an archeologist, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz would have made an ideal
model.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years with the Wildlife Conservation Society, Rabinowitz
has tracked and captured jaguars in Belize, tigers in Thailand and
leopards in Borneo and Taiwan. He has lived with Mayan Indians in
Central America and jungle tribes in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently he trekked for a month to reach one of the world's
most isolated areas, in northern Myanmar (formerly Burma), crossing
mountain torrents on hastily built bamboo bridges that would have
given even the unflappable Jones pause.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the treasures that Rabinowitz has helped save, among
them a new 1,472-square-mile national park in northernmost Myanmar
and Taiwan's largest nature preserve, are infinitely more valuable
in the eyes of many than possessions like the fictional Lost Ark,
which caused so much celluloid commotion.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts have drawn the praise of others in the field,
including Dr. Howard Quigley, president of the Hornocker Wildlife
Institute in Moscow, Idaho. ``Alan's passion, expansive thinking
and sense of priorities set him apart in the present conservation
environment,'' Quigley said. ``He's ready to act on a situation and
make a difference, while his colleagues sit around and think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the impending birth of his first child has
grounded Rabinowitz, the society's 45-year-old director of science
for Asia, at his office at the Bronx Zoo. Still, there has been a
flurry of excitement over his discovery in Myanmar of the world's
smallest deer, an animal so tiny that hunters wrap it in a single,
albeit ample, leaf from a tropical plant.
</P>
<P>
   And he is planning a return expedition to the deer's realm,
where Chinese traders crossing the high passes use salt as currency
to buy wild animal parts in order to sell them in Beijing and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinowitz has a plan to curtail the killing. He also has a
mini-lecture that he will readily deliver about all the important
scientific discoveries yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that we've gone to all the remote places and seen
nearly everything there is to see except for a lot of small
insects,'' he said. ``But there are isolated mountain ranges that
have been closed to outsiders for generations for all kinds of
reasons, especially politics and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The northern extremity of Myanmar's Kachin State, along the
China border _ home of the leaf deer or ``leaf muntjac'' _ is one
such place. Burmese refer to the sparsely populated region as the
icy mountains after a rank of lesser-known Himalayan peaks, the
highest of which is the 19,320-foot Mount Hkabo-Razi, the name of
the new national park.
</P>
<P>
   British naturalists collected birds, mammals and plants there in
the early 1900s, but when Rabinowitz arrived, it had been decades
since the last scientific visit. ``I couldn't find anyone who
remembered seeing a white person,'' Rabinowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting permission to travel to the icy mountains took five
years, Rabinowitz said, in part because a rebellious Kachin army
wanted to break away from the central government in the capital
Yangon, formerly Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two years before they even let me in the country to
talk to officials,'' he said, ``and then I had to prove myself by
doing things like tiger surveys.'' Once the insurgents signed a
peace accord, however, the conservation society and Myanmar Forest
Department organized an expedition in early 1997 to survey the
mammals of the Hkabo-Razi area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used photographs and drawings to interview local hunters
and examined their kills in village markets,'' Rabinowitz said.
``Because of the thriving cross-border trade in wildlife parts with
China, the skins, antlers and horns of larger mammal species were
readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the journal Oryx, Rabinowitz reported good news
and bad news. Three species that inhabited the region _ the Asiatic
elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros and the gaur, a large ox _ have
disappeared. Tigers are rare or gone and musk deer are in serious
decline. But Himalayan species that are disappearing elsewhere,
like the red panda and the takin, which combines the features of an
ox, a goat and an antelope, are still relatively abundant despite
hunting pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists added three species to the list of Myanmar's
known mammals: the black muntjac, a deer previously believed to be
endemic to China; the blue sheep, which lives above the timberline
in the foothills of Mount Hkabo-Razi, and the stone marten, a
member of the weasel family that inhabits open rocky areas whereas
other martens tend to be deep-forest creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-mile hike into the icy mountains from the airport in
Putao was both arduous and perilous, Rabinowitz said. ``In the past
I've worked in places where there was always a safety net of sorts.
The people were primitive but they were enough in touch with the
outside world that you could get out in time in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there,'' he added, ``time has stood still. We had a doctor,
actually a Burmese dentist, who had already been to Hkabo-Razi with
a Japanese mountain climber who was the first person to reach the
summit. He brought along a bag of injectable drugs and I asked him
why there were no pills or creams. He said, `Up there you either
stay healthy or get very, very sick. If you need medicine, you need
it fast and strong.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough, he was right,'' Rabinowitz continued. ``You're
walking every day, you're in cool air and you're eating pretty
good. Bugs are not a problem. Malaria's not a problem. But if you
get worn down, pneumonia is a problem. By the end of the two-month
trip, five of our team had deep, hacking coughs and were being
injected with antibiotics. My knees were so swollen that I walked
with a staff and was injecting steroids. I'm not sure I could do
that again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On that expedition, Rabinowitz acquired several heads of a
small, unfamiliar deer that he found displayed on hunters' trophy
boards. ``I thought the features were unusual but I had never seen
the animal's body,'' he said, ``and I imagined it was just a local
race of one of the other muntjac species that inhabit the area. I
put it aside since we were literally buying dozens of animals from
each village.''
</P>
<P>
   The eureka moment occurred when a hunter stepped out of a dense
evergreen forest carrying a freshly killed specimen of what he
called a leaf deer. ``I said, `Hey, this is something totally
different,''' Rabinowitz remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Skull measurements plus DNA analysis by Dr. George Amato of the
Wildlife Conservation Society confirmed that the animal was indeed
a distinct, previously unknown species. And, for now at least,
northern Myanmar's leaf deer, standing 20 inches at the shoulder
and weighing about 25 pounds, is the smallest of nearly 50 known
species in the worldwide deer family.
</P>
<P>
   A qualification is necessary because this deer (Muntiacus
putaoensis) is the third new species of muntjac to be discovered
this decade in Southeast Asia, and a fourth species, known from
only a single specimen collected in Laos in the 1930s, has been
rediscovered. Conceivably, an even smaller deer is in some isolated
rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The muntjacs represent a primitive and poorly studied Asian
group that now numbers nine species. The name is a corruption of a
19th century Javan word, mindjangan, for the little deer, also
known as barking deer for their habit of yelping incessantly if
they sense a predator.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one observer as ``dainty little creatures that are
always on the alert and lift their feet high when walking,''
muntjacs feed on grasses, low-growing leaves, tender shoots and
fallen fruit. Aside from their size, male leaf deer are
distinguished from other species by having the shortest antlers, a
little over an inch long, of any deer in the world. The single-tine
antlers protrude from bony, hair-covered pedicels that form sharp
ridges along the animal's face. Unlike other muntjacs, both males
and females have upper canine teeth that are elongated into tusks
curving outward from the lip, suggesting that both sexes fight for
territory. Among other deer species, males are the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rabinowitz's return in 1998 to obtain more examples of the leaf
deer and map its distribution was less strenuous, merely a 150-mile
hike along river valleys to 13 villages where hunters were
questioned about local wildlife and deer in particular. ``I needed
two and sometimes three translators,'' he said, ``because the
dialect would vary from one village to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Firearms are virtually nonexistent among the local people, he
said, but the hunters' snares are extremely effective. ``They build
bamboo walls in the forest with openings every 15 or 20 feet.
Animals look for a way to get past the wall and step on a snare
hidden by leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the people do eat the meat, the hunting, he said, is
done mainly for animal parts and skins to trade for salt. The
villagers grow their own food, but a lack of salt in the diet, he
explained, causes goiter, which can be fatal, and also manifests
itself in iodine deficiency disease, which contributes to a low
I.Q. or retardation. While the leaf deer's negligible antlers are
not highly valued by traders, Rabinowitz said, the animal is one of
the most exploited species in the area. ``The deer are still
relatively abundant but persistent hunting over the past decade has
reduced their numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaf deer's range was not included in the largely
unpopulated national park because of the many villages in the area.
To curb the China trade, the conservation society will distribute
salt to the villages, start a community development program, pay
for wardens and carry out a management plan.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also financed a new enclosure at the Yangon zoo
for a young male leaf deer captured and brought to Rabinowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked over a hundred miles carrying the deer in a bamboo
cage,'' he said, ``and then the cage had to sit in the aisle of the
plane on the three-hour flight to Yangon where it blocked the door
to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The only captive example of the world's smallest deer is doing
well, Rabinowitz added. But now, he said, it needs a mate.

AMERICA'S PROMISE SEEKS HEALTH AND VALUES FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of Colin Powell and six children 
 By GENERAL COLIN POWELL 
 c.1999 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams's poignant drama ''The Glass Menagerie''
includes a scene in which a mother agonizes over the fate of her
children. The future becomes the present, she declares, the present
the past, and the past turns into everlasting regret if you don't
plan for it
</P>
<P>
   The future is becoming the present sooner than ever for our
children. I see irresponsible sex, inadequate education, and other
booby traps that can damage young lives before they can realize
their full potential. At the same time, there are fewer guideposts,
fewer safety zones, fewer role models, and fewer standards
available to help our growing children find their way.
</P>
<P>
   Any youngster will tell you that it is tough to be a kid in
today's America, and any parent will agree. All children are
struggling to some extent, and the kids from single-parent homes,
poor neighborhoods, or other disadvantaged circumstances have it
toughest of all.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of the young people who are growing up without
the resources they need to succeed in life?
</P>
<P>
   We know what will happen: They will be left behind. Once it was
possible for youngsters who got off to a slow start to catch up and
make something of themselves. But in today's knowledge-based,
technology-driven economy, it is becoming progressively harder for
late starters to close the gap. And what children miss out on
today, they will regret forever _ unless we help them.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, thousands of prominent Americans _ corporate
executives, educators, clergy, heads of nonprofit and service
organizations, 30 state governors, 100 mayors, members of the
president's cabinet, and other leaders _ met in Philadelphia in
April 1997 at the behest of every living U.S. president and first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the crusade I am currently leading _America's
Promise: The Alliance for Youth.
 &UR; Five key building blocks &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The mission of America's Promise is to provide children and
teens with access to the five fundamental resources they need to
grow into self-supporting and contributing members of society.
These are: an ongoing relationship with a responsible, caring adult
_ a parent, mentor, tutor, or coach; safe places and structured
activities during nonschool hours where children can learn and
grow; a healthy start in life; a marketable skill acquired through
effective education; and an opportunity to give back through
service to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about these five resources is that they are
simple, straightforward, and effective. We know they work. Every
successful adult American can identify each of them as part of his
or her own experience in growing up. Each of the five reinforces
the other four. The result is not only a solid foundation for
adulthood, but also a pretty good guarantee that the recipients of
these resources will pass them along to their own children when
they become parents themselves.
</P>
<P>
   +Caring adults come first. People sometimes ask me about the
order in which we present the five resources. Why is a caring adult
or mentor first on the list? Because if society doesn't provide
positive mentors and role models for kids, they're going to find
their own on street corners, in gangs, or in drug dens. But if we
can match a child with a caring adult, we have gone a long way
toward steering that child in the right direction. We know _ and
statistics bear this out _ that if a child has a mentor, he or she
is less likely to abuse alcohol or drugs, less likely to engage in
violent behavior, and more likely to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   A caring adult may be a parent, a relative, a guardian, or
someone outside the family who supports the parent or guardian in
raising the child.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up in New York City's South Bronx, one of my
mentors was the man who gave me my first job: a big-hearted
merchant named Jay Sickser who sold toys and baby furnishings. I
worked for him, on and off, for seven years, until I entered the
army. I'll never forget how much he taught me about dealing with
people and the value of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   +Keep kids out of trouble zones. We know that the hours
immediately after school are when unsupervised kids are most likely
to be exposed to danger or to get into trouble. It is then that
children need a refuge where they can spend that time doing
something positive and constructive. The Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of
America, for example, another youth organization I'm involved with,
has pledged to provide places for half a million youngsters over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But a safe place doesn't have to be a formal youth service
facility. It can be a home, a church, an after-school job, or a
place that gives young people a constructive alternative to hanging
out alone in parks or on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   +Give children a healthy start. This speaks for itself. No child
should show up for first grade without vaccinations, inoculations,
and hearing and vision exams.
</P>
<P>
   +Education should provide marketable skills. We know that kids
will need good job skills. What is less obvious, however, is that
our nation's future prosperity depends on young people getting
those skills. Today's children are tomorrow's workers, consumers,
and stockholders _ but only if we prepare them for successful lives
now.
</P>
<P>
   When my younger grandson was just 3 years old, he had learned
enough about computers to be able to insert a CD-ROM into the
proper drive to play his favorite story. If computers are so much a
part of our home and working lives today, how much larger will
technology loom 5, 10, or 20 years from now? And what is going to
happen to those children who are growing up without any access to
computers?
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies report they are already experiencing
shortages of skilled workers; that's why so many of them are
supporting America's Promise.
</P>
<P>
   +Let kids give back to their communities. I'm sometimes asked if
it is really fair to expect youngsters to give _ especially those
that come from deprived backgrounds. The answer is that children
are never too young to experience the joy that comes from helping
others. In the process, they also learn that when you help others,
you usually wind up getting back even more than you give. Community
service tells young people that they are important _ that the world
needs them. It gives them a chance to acquire confidence and a
sense of responsibility and to develop talents that they might not
know they have.
</P>
<P>
   My work with America's Promise tells me that young people will
respond eagerly to the challenge to make a real difference in the
world, whether it is through tutoring younger children, cleaning up
a neighborhood park, or helping the elderly with tasks they are no
longer capable of managing on their own. Youth organizations such
as the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, the Camp Fire Boys and Girls,
and others have made commitments to America's Promise to involve
their members in more community service activities.
</P>
<P>
   We know we can't give every American youngster an idyllic
childhood of elm trees and picket fences, but we can _ and we must
_ give them the start that they need to grow up into successful and
contributing adult members of society. Parents, educators, and
other Americans who deal with young people know that kids need our
support and that the institutions in our society which nurture
youth-family, schools, youth service groups, and others need
shoring up.
 &UR; A nation's responsibility &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is the role that America's Promise is working to fill. To
carry out our mission, we have been building a national coalition,
drawn from all sectors of our society _ government, business,
nonprofit organizations, service groups, and others _ to put the
five key resources within reach of the young people who need them.
This is as it should be. If it takes a village to raise a child, it
takes a nation to keep America's Promise to our youth.

THE FAMILY BARBECUE: MEN, WOMEN, AND MEAT
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA TAXEL 
 c.1999 Laura Taxel 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbecue is a word with many meanings. It describes a device, a
way of cooking and sauce. To me it's simply food preparation in
another location and an inconvenient way to make dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Left on my own, I would be happy to eat tuna salad all summer.
But to the males in my household, barbecue is a ritual, a rite, and
a form of recreation. For them, to barbecue is to play as men are
meant to play. Instead of being seen as a chore, like taking out
the garbage, it's a warm-weather sport, and like other such forms
of entertainment, those who don't do, watch. Mastery is a measure
of manhood.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about barbecuing that gets guys so excited? What
calls them to the grill? It may be something primal, a hard-wired
biological connection between man, meat and fire.
</P>
<P>
   All the men I know approach the task with a devil-may-care grace
as though they were born to it. They display a ''just pass me the
tongs little lady'' attitude and a confident ''I'll handle this''
style not seen in relation to other food related tasks. Each of my
three sons showed an intense interest in the barbecue and all the
activities connected with it from a very early age while evincing
no enthusiasm at all for the gas range with automatic pilot lights
and extra-large self-cleaning oven.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect it is testosterone-driven; the more of that hormone
you have, the more willing you are to stand outside, cold beer in
hand, flipping pieces of meat over an open flame. Of course, it
could be a purely cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Dad in an apron with the plate of barbecued burgers
is a part of our national mystique. It has an aura of machismo that
must derive in part from its association with cowboys, campfires,
chuckwagons, and Boy Scouts. Legend has it that our barbecuing
methods were passed directly down to us from such illustrious
pirates as Captain Kidd and Long John Silver who fine-tuned their
meat roasting skills with techniques gleaned in the Caribbean. No
wonder it's such a swashbuckling activity.
</P>
<P>
   An industry survey revealed that nationwide, two-thirds of
barbecuing is done by men. And that's a lot of men considering that
79 percent of all U.S. households own outdoor grills
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, long ago, the task of turning a whole pig on a spit
over a fire pit required a certain manly strength. Today, our
demure boneless chicken breasts and lean beef burgers require no
such virile attention, yet barbecuing continues as a male preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the commercials, study the ads. You will never see a woman
in charge of the grill. That's because then people might confuse it
with mere cooking. This is my problem. Cooking outside is
unappealing to me. It involves much running back and forth from the
kitchen to the yard; it's often buggy; and I don't enjoy smoke in
my eyes. I find it awkward, hot, and the source of extra work. But
I've come to understand that's because I'm a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I took an informal survey among my friends. In each family, the
men willingly man the barbecue, even those who do no cooking
whatsoever at any other time of the year. They think of this as
making a meal, and take great pride in it, although it does not
resemble what I or my friends do daily in the kitchen. Nutritional
balance is not required so the need for a side dish is fulfilled by
a bag of potato chips. Pickles and ketchup are vegetables as
everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing gives men an opportunity to help out around the house
without causing undue stress or interfering with the desire to sit
in a comfortable lawn chair and read the paper. Yet, they act as if
they are a cross between a hunter and the guy who scores the
winning goal. The kids support the illusion, cheering from the
sidelines and acting as if a tailgate party is in progress. The
younger ones don't even like the char-blackened parts and carefully
pull the burnt stuff off before they eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly some elemental forces are at work here.
</P>
<P>
   While many people around the world continue to squat over open
fires and cook because they have no choice, Americans are credited
with popularizing barbecuing and making it fun.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the building boom following World War II. ''The
patio'' became an important part of the dream house and barbecuing
became synonymous with the good life, family togetherness, and the
American way of leisure. Data collected by the Barbecue Industry
Association shows that barbecuing is hereditary: there's a direct
correlation between high levels of exposure to the barbecuing
experience in childhood and the likelihood that you will barbecue
as an adult...in the blood, as it were, if not exactly in the
genes.
</P>
<P>
   My father-in-law built a backyard barbecue in the 1950s, and he
was the king of the grill. So my husband is statistically, if not
biologically, bound to answer the siren song of the barbecue, and
our sons to follow in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ceremonial stages of initiation beginning with
Awed Spectator. That period lasts until adolescence; the exact age
varies. Those higher up on the rungs of the socioeconomic ladder
tend to be overly protective and wait longer before allowing their
sons to handle matches and lighter fluid. The ability to light the
barbecue is a boy's rite of passage into the second level. He who
touches match to coals knows he's a real man.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy apprenticeship which involves voracious
consumption of barbecued foods as well as attentive hanging out
around the grill, an initiate is ready to become a full-fledged
Grill Guy. In deference to his father, he may not assume that role
until he has a territory he can call his own. I think it's a sort
of dominant male thing.
</P>
<P>
   This year when we needed a new barbecue, I didn't even bother to
put in my two cents. The boys volunteered to go with their father
to make this purchase. It was an amazing sight _ four guys who
normally will do anything to avoid going to a store, setting out to
shop with the kinds of whoops and hollers usually reserved for home
runs. They did have a brief discussion before leaving about whether
or not to buy a gas grill. The idea was unanimously vetoed because
all agreed it would take much of the excitement out of it, making
it more like cooking inside...only outside.
</P>
<P>
   My point exactly. But don't get me wrong _ I'm not complaining.
Anytime anybody wants to take responsibility for dinner is cause
for celebration. Eat-out, take-out, barbecue: it's all the same to
me because it means I don't have to cook.

CLINTON UNVEILS NEW ANTI-DRUG ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Recalling his own brother's battle with cocaine,
President Clinton on Monday unveiled a new round of anti-drug
advertisements and said the ad campaign that began two years ago
was beginning to reach young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had personal experience with the devastation drugs can
bring to families,'' Clinton said at a news conference where two of
the campaign's new TV ads were shown.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brother, Roger, spent a year in federal prison
after pleading guilty in 1984 for distribution of cocaine and
conspiracy to distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (drugs) can bring death and, as I saw in my own family
with my brother, they can destroy lives,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1997, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has
grown from a 12-city pilot program to a national effort to stop
teen-agers from using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, which will spend $1 billion over five years,
will use television, radio, the Internet, newspapers, magazines,
bus and movie ads to target young people, parents, teachers,
mentors, coaches and others.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will be aired in 12 languages, including English,
Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Navajo, Cherokee and Aleutian dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Andy MacDonald, a 26-year-old professional skateboarder featured
in one of the new commercials, said the ad campaign is working
because it uses people that teen-agers recognize and believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids listen to people who are doing the same things that they
are and live in their world,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said a study by CRS Inc., an advertising consulting firm,
found that 90 percent of young people had seen at least four of
anti-drug ads a week.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which surveyed groups of high school students and
their parents one year into the ad campaign and again six months
later, said that youths and teen-agers who had seen the ads
reported they were less likely to use drugs. In addition, the
number of teen-agers who said they believed such ads were ``lying''
about drugs also decreased as the frequency of the advertising
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a teen-ager or parent, it is nearly impossible to
avoid seeing or hearing our anti-drug messages on television or
radio several times a week,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study also found that the ads were not prompting
parents to speak earlier or more often with their kids about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said parents remain the most influential factor in a
teen-ager's life and have the most impact on whether they use
drugs. ``It may not seem like it sometimes, but teen-agers really
do listen to Mom and Dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and McCaffrey urged Congress to continue funding
the campaign. The Senate has proposed cutting the ad campaign's
budget from the current $195 million to around $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the
campaign was ``well-intentioned'' but that it should include
alcohol, the drug most frequently used by teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can an ad campaign succeed when it ignores underage
drinking, the No. 1 drug problem among teens?'' he asked.

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ASKS RUSSIA TO STOP LEAKING ARMS
TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel pressed Russian
leaders at the Kremlin on Monday to stanch leaks of
advanced-weapons technology to Iran and Iraq, and he received the
same reply that the Kremlin has given the United States _ that no
such leaks have occurred or will occur, if Russia can help it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lone issue on which Barak showed any notable
dissatisfaction after a one-day visit with Russia's top leadership,
his first since becoming prime minister in May.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, President Boris N. Yeltsin and his underlings
greeted Barak as if he were an old friend, a marked change from
relations with his hawkish predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing attention to the fabulous renovation of much of the
Kremlin, Yeltsin said, ``We wish similarly to build up our
relations with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak arrived in Moscow in the middle of the night and met all
day Monday with Yeltsin, Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin and
Foreign Minister Ivan S. Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   The talks centered on the Middle East peace effort, where Russia
sees a chance to rebuild its diplomatic muscle and Barak spies a
chance to influence Israel's old enemy and Russia's old ally,
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Assad met with Yeltsin less than a month ago, and Russian
officials indicated then that they hoped to sell Syria as much as
$2 billion in advanced jet fighters and other weapons. Israeli
holds a clear military advantage in the region, and a rearmed Syria
would hold a stronger position in any peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said Barak hoped that Yeltsin would provide
some measure Monday of Syria's willingness to move toward reopening
peace talks. Afterward, both sides appeared satisfied but offered
few specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have come to the conclusion that Russia could take a
more active part in the normalization of Israeli-Syrian
relations,'' Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said the peace negotiations had moved too slowly, and
called for Russia and the United States to work as co-sponsors of
an intensified search for a permanent accord.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Yeltsin underscored the Kremlin's renewed ties
with Israel by categorically denouncing an outbreak of anti-Semitic
acts in Russia like synagogue bombings, recent stabbing of a Jewish
leader and the defiling of six Jewish graves last week in Tomsk, in
western Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Extremist leaders in the Communist Party have taken a public
lead in promoting anti-Semitism, and Yeltsin has made his
disapproval clear but not consistent. Monday, his deputy chief of
staff, Sergei Prikhodko, called anti-Semitic acts ugly and
disgusting and quoted Yeltsin as having said, ``There will be no
leniency toward those who foment ethnic hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to the synagogue bombings, Yeltsin also
promised Barak that ``the culprits will be found and brought to
justice,'' Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the question of weapons technology leaks seemed to publicly
separate Barak from his hosts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the meetings, Barak told reporters that he had told the
leaders of Israel's concern over ``the penetration of missile
know-how into Iran and about the absence of control over this in
Iraq.'' He also said leaders had told him that Russia was making
every effort to stop the theft and sale of nuclear technologies to
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has raised the same issues in talks with
Russia, and declined to renew contracts with a handful of Russian
research institutes earlier this year because of suspicions that
they were helping to relay weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Over American objections, Russia has negotiated agreements to
help Iran build nuclear reactors that both nations say will be used
solely for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Stepashin said Russia no more wants a nuclear power on
its border than does Israel. ``If there are any fears or suspicions
that know-how which could be used by Iran in the making of nuclear
weapons is leaking from Russia,'' he said, ``Moscow is ready to
look into these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the Interfax news service that he had been assured
that no technology leaks had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm far from thinking that Barak has paid a visit and the
problem is solved,'' Barak said. ``Long-term and careful work is
needed here.''

<P>
   Leaf-cutting ants and their fungus farms are a marvel of nature
and perhaps the best known example of symbiosis, the mutual
dependence of two species. But the textbook accounts, it turns out,
do not tell even half the story. From research in the past five
years the ants' symbiosis has emerged as far more intricate than it
appears, involving not two but at least four species, their lives
knotted together in a ruthless yet highly successful struggle for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The ants and their agriculture have been extensively studied
over the years, but the recent research has uncovered intriguing
new findings about the fungus they cultivate, how they domesticated
it, and how they cultivate it and preserve it from pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the fungus farms, which the ants were thought to
keep free of pathogens, turn out to be vulnerable to a devastating
mold, found nowhere else but in ants' nests. To keep the mold in
check, the ants long ago made a discovery that would do credit to
any pharmaceutical laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there was still so much to learn about leaf-cutter
ants and their agriculture, biologists say, only underlines how
much remains to be discovered about the world's plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Ants invented agriculture 50 million years before people did,
and the leaf-cutters, members of a large family called the attine
ants, practice the most sophisticated example of it. They grow
their fungus, a kind of mushroom, in underground chambers that can
reach the size of a football. A single leaf-cutter nest may contain
a thousand such chambers, embedded in an underground metropolis up
to 18 feet deep, and support a society of more than a million ants.
</P>
<P>
   These ant communities are the dominant plant-eaters of the
Neotropics, the region comprising South and Central America, Mexico
and the Caribbean. Biologists believe some 15 percent of the leaf
production of tropical forests disappears down the nests of
leaf-cutter ants. In the nest, the leaves are shredded and
inoculated with the fungus, which digests them and is in turn eaten
by the ants.
</P>
<P>
   The ants' achievement is remarkable _ the biologist Edward O.
Wilson has called it ``one of the major breakthroughs in animal
evolution'' _ because it allows them to eat, courtesy of their
mushroom's digestive powers, the otherwise poisoned harvest of
tropical forests whose leaves are laden with terpenoids, alkaloids
and other chemicals designed to sicken browsers.
</P>
<P>
   So precious is their particular strain of fungus that the ants'
virgin queens, before their nuptial flight, secrete a mouthful with
which to seed the garden of their new nest. The worker castes they
produce are so tailored to the craft of fungus gardening that they
come in made-to-fit sizes _ large ants to saw off leaves, medium
ones to shred them, and miniature workers to seed them with fungus
and clean off all alien growths.
</P>
<P>
   Fungus-growing seems to have originated only once in evolution,
because all gardening ants belong to a single tribe, the
descendants of the first fungus farmer. There are more than 200
known species of the attine ant tribe, divided into 12 groups, or
genera. The leaf-cutters use fresh vegetation; the other groups,
known as the lower attines because their nests are smaller and
their techniques more primitive, feed their gardens with detritus
like dead leaves, insects and feces.
</P>
<P>
   A question that has long perplexed ant biologists is whether the
funguses cultivated by attine ants are all descended from a single
ancestor, just as the ants are. The issue was hard to settle
because the ants' gardening habits prevent the fungus from forming
mushrooms, the spore-bearing stage by which mycologists tell one
fungus from another. In 1994, a team of four biologists, Ulrich G.
Mueller and Ted R. Schultz from Cornell University and Ignacio H.
Chapela and Stephen A. Rehner from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, analyzed the DNA of ant funguses. The common
assumption that the funguses are all derived from a single strain,
they found, was only half true.
</P>
<P>
   The leaf-cutters' fungus was indeed descended from a single
strain, propagated clonally, or just by budding, for at least 23
million years. But the lower attine ants used different varieties
of the fungus, and in one case a quite separate species, the four
biologists discovered.
</P>
<P>
   After further study, three of the biologists, Mueller, Rehner
and Schultz, reported last year that funguses grown by lower attine
ants fell into four groups of varieties, as if the ants had
domesticated wild funguses at least four times in evolutionary
history. Two of those occasions must have been quite recent because
the biologists identified free-living counterparts for two of the
four fungus groups they found in the ants' gardens. A single
variety of fungus is grown in each nest, but most lower attine
species cultivate at least two of the four fungal lineages,
suggesting that varieties are exchanged among species every so
often, the biologists concluded.
</P>
<P>
   What evolutionary force could be driving these two patterns of
fungus gardening, the pure clone cultivation of the leaf-cutters
and fungus exchange program of the lower attines? The answer, or
part of it, has been divined by Cameron R. Currie, a Ph.D. student
in a climate no wild attine ever reached, the University of
Toronto. Trained as an entomologist, Currie was attracted to the
ants because of his interest in symbiosis and in the cheaters who
take advantage of that mutualism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The pure strain of fungus grown by the leaf-cutters, it seemed
to him, resembled the monocultures of various human crops, that are
very productive for a while and then succumb to some disastrous
pathogen, such as the Irish potato blight. Monocultures, which lack
the genetic diversity to respond to changing environmental threats,
are sitting ducks for parasites. Currie felt there had to be a
parasite in the ant-fungus system. But a century of ant research
offered no support for the idea. Textbooks describe how leaf-cutter
ants scrupulously weed their gardens of all foreign organisms.
``People kept telling me, `You know the ants keep their gardens
free of parasites, don't you?''' Currie said of his efforts to find
a hidden interloper.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years of sifting through attine ant gardens,
Currie discovered they are far from free of infections. In last
month's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, he and two colleagues, Mueller and David Mairoch,
isolated several alien organisms, particularly a family of
parasitic molds called Escovopsis.
</P>
<P>
   Escovopsis turns out to be a highly virulent pathogen that can
devastate a fungus garden in a couple of days. It blooms like a
white cloud, with the garden dimly visible underneath. In a day or
two, the whole garden is enveloped. ``Other ants won't go near it
and the ants associated with the garden just starve to death,''
Rehner said. ``They just seem to give up, except for those that
have rescued their larvae.'' The deadly mold then turns
greenish-brown as it enters its spore-forming stage.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the ants usually manage to keep Escovopsis and other
parasites under control. But with any lapse in control, or if the
ants are removed, Escovopsis will quickly burst forth.
</P>
<P>
   Although new leaf-cutter gardens start off free of Escovopsis,
within two years some 60 percent become infected. The discovery of
Escovopsis' role brings a new level of understanding to the
evolution of the attine ants. ``In the last decade, evolutionary
biologists have been increasingly aware of the role of parasites as
driving forces in evolution,'' Schultz said. There is now a
possible reason to explain why the lower attine species keep
changing the variety of fungus in their mushroom gardens, and
occasionally domesticating new ones _ to stay one step ahead of the
relentless Escovopsis.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Currie found that the leaf-cutters had in general
fewer alien molds in their gardens than the lower attines, yet they
had more Escovopsis infections. It seems that the price they pay
for cultivating a pure variety of fungus is a higher risk from
Escovopsis. But the leaf-cutters may have little alternative: they
cultivate a special variety of fungus which, unlike those grown by
the lower attines, produces nutritious swollen tips for the ants to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of a third partner in the ant-fungus symbiosis raises
the question of how the attine ants, especially the leaf-cutters,
keep this dangerous interloper under control. Amazingly enough,
Currie has again provided the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have known for a hundred years that ants have a whitish
growth on the cuticle,'' said Mueller, referring to the insects'
body surface. ``People would say this is like a cuticular wax. But
Cameron was the first one in a hundred years to put these things
under a microscope. He saw it was not inert wax. It is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie discovered a specialized patch on the ants' cuticle that
harbors a particular kind of bacterium, one well known to the
pharmaceutical industry, because it is the source of half the
antibiotics used in medicine. From each of 22 species of attine ant
studied, Cameron and colleagues isolated a species of Streptomyces
bacterium, they reported in Nature in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Streptomyces does not have much effect on ordinary
laboratory funguses. But it is a potent poisoner of Escovopsis,
inhibiting its growth and suppressing spore formation. It also
stimulates growth of the ants' mushroom fungus. The bacterium is
carried by virgin queens when they leave to establish new nests,
but is not found on male ants.
</P>
<P>
   Because both the leaf-cutters and the lower attines use
Streptomyces, the bacterium may have been part of their symbiosis
for almost as long as the Escovopsis mold. If so, some Fleming of
an ant discovered antibiotics millions of years before people did.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the ants are accomplishing two feats beyond the powers
of human technology. The leaf-cutters are growing a monocultural
crop year after year without disaster, and they are using an
antibiotic apparently so wisely and prudently that, unlike people,
they are not provoking antibiotic resistance in the target
pathogen.
</P>
<P>
   In a loose team, the four biologists involved in the new
findings are seeking to understand the deeper intricacies of the
extraordinary system. Schultz, now at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington D.C., is a specialist in the evolutionary
relationships of ants, and Rehner, of the University of Puerto
Rico, is an expert on fungi. Mueller, now at the University of
Texas at Austin, is an ecologist. Together with Currie, they hope
to unravel the relationships woven between the four members of the
symbiosis _ the attine ants, their mushroom, Escovopsis and the
Streptomyces bacterium. There are doubtless other members to be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The four researchers are pleased but not much surprised to have
discovered so much new about an already well studied system. ``It
may be one of the best studied symbioses in biology but that is a
sad reflection on how little we know in general,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the deadly Escovopsis fungus could change the
correlation of forces between ants and people. In the 10,000 years
since the ants have had to deal with human agriculture, a blink of
an eye in their 50 million year farming history, the ants have
generally prevailed. They thrive in disturbed ground, and so have
usually benefited from the clearing of forests.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, people and the attine empire have co-existed
peacefully: the two species live on different scales and in
separate spaces, people above ground and attines below it. But
attines are a serious agricultural pest in much of the tropics.
Currie, having shown that nests in the lab are devastated with a
squirt of Escovopsis spores, suggests the fungus might prove a
useful way of controlling attine nests.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little objection to applying Escovopsis nest by
nest. But Schultz expressed horror at any idea of spreading the
parasite indiscriminately and wiping out all fungus-growing ants,
many species of which are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   That an Escovopsis-like discovery could tip the scales too far
toward the human side was foreseen by the ant biologists Edward O.
Wilson and Bert Holldoebler. In their book ``The Ants,'' published
in 1990, they wrote that biologists need to search for ``the weak
points'' in the ants' social system: ``The goal, however, should be
intelligent management of their populations and never their
complete eradication. Our advantage _ and responsibility _ lies in
the fact that we can think about these matters and they cannot.''

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``Often women's accomplishments are overlooked,''
Kelsey Roberts, the author of 28 romantic suspense novels, told her
audience at the Romance Writers of America conference here last
week. ``But that's no longer true in terms of murder. We're
starting to kill people almost as often as men do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts' seminar, called ``Arsenic and New Lace,'' was about
creating credible female villains, and her remark left unclear
whether she was referring to life or fiction. But like many of the
dozens of lectures and workshops at the four-day conference that
ended on Saturday night _ from ``Tight Fittin' Jeans or How to
Create Sexual Tension'' to ``Writing African-American Historicals''
to ``Creating the Contemporary Cowboy'' _ the message was that
women in general and romance writers in particular (who are so
overwhelmingly female that most men's rooms at the Chicago Sheraton
Cityfront were temporarily redesignated) are tired of being
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one thing that became clear as nearly 2,000 authors
of romance novels, both published and aspiring, gathered here at
their annual convention, was that romance writers recognize they
have an image problem. No respect, you know?
</P>
<P>
   There was even one seminar called ``Defending the Genre,'' in
which the novelist Valerie Taylor listed the most frequently heard
insults of the genre: it's anti-feminist, it presents too many
woman as needing to escape abusive relationships, all the books are
the same, it's just pornography for women, it's unrealistic, it's
fluff, and it can't be serious if half the population doesn't care
about it. She offered advice on how to respond. For instance, for
insulters who read literary fiction, she advised her listeners,
``Give them well-written books that deal with slightly darker
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall point was that the romance genre is large and
various, its pulpiness and sugar-coating offered in a range of
doses, its plots and settings vastly differentiable, its sentences
not necessarily execrable. Not unlike, say, science fiction, horror
fiction or mysteries, all of which have well-known practitioners
whose work is often treated with seriousness by readers and
reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit 75 percent of romance fiction is dreck,'' said
Jennifer Crusie, who teaches literature and writing at Ohio State
University and has written 11 romance novels. ``But do you read
literary fiction? Seventy-five percent of literary fiction is
dreck. The point is you can't criticize a book on the basis of
genre.''
</P>
<P>
   You also can't criticize a genre _ not this one, anyway _ on the
basis of its economic muscle. Romances _ that is, male-female love
stories that frown on adultery and that must have a happy ending
(``a marriage, the promise of a marriage, the idea that they're
going to be together forever and ever,'' said Charis McEachern, the
spokeswoman for the association) _ far outsell any other genre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year for which figures are available, 38
percent of all adult popular fiction books sold were romance
novels, more than 201 million of them. More than half of all
mass-market paperbacks sold were romances, which are mostly (88
percent) published in rack-size paperback form. Last year
publishers brought out 1,963 new romances (including 95 in
electronic form) for an American audience estimated by the
association at 41 million. Some romance readers consume as many as
14 books a month. The largest publisher is Harlequin (446 titles
last year), which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of voracity demands constant feeding, and throughout
the four days editors and agents met with aspirants to hear them
pitch their manuscripts. ``I'm actively acquiring for Sonnet Books,
our historicals line, and for our mainstream line,'' Caroline
Tolley, an editor at Pocket Books, said. The women around her all
leaned forward urgently, as if choreographed, their pencils poised.
``I will also look at a time travel, I'll look at a paranormal and
contemporary suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitches were feverishly hopeful. One woman, Amy Tollwitch, a
38-year-old former lawyer from Cincinnati, gave her synopsis of a
story set in medieval England: ``A wealthy heiress with a singular
passion for horse breeding marries a bastard-born warrior to
protect her estate and her way of life from a greedy neighbor,''
Ms. Tollwitch began.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tolley instructed her and the others to send along three
chapters of the manuscript, a cover letter and a self-addressed
envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Romance Writers of America is based in Houston. Founded by 37
writers in 1980, it now has more than 8,000 members, including more
than 1,500 published novelists. Among them are a few anomalies. One
was Harold Lowry, a 57-year-old former voice teacher and church
organist from Charlotte, N.C, who, as Leigh Greenwood, writes two
series of western love stories (``The Brides,'' with titles like
``Laurel'' and ``Daisy,'' and ``The Cowboys,'' with titles like
``Jake'' and ``Chet.'') The most successful of the few male romance
writers, he shows up at many of these conferences. Asked if his
admirers have ever made romantic inquiries, he chuckled and gave a
response that might belong in a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have, they haven't told me about it,'' he said. ``And
if they did, my wife would probably take my plane tickets away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another was Ms. Crusie, an academic with a specialty in English
fiction. ``I like to say `The Wife of Bath' was the first romance
novel because it's a toxic story recast so that the woman wins,''
she said, laughing as she acknowledged that a man wrote it. Ms.
Crusie came upon romances when she was researching a dissertation
on ``the impact of gender on narrative strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Genre fiction, she said, is defined by reader expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In literary fiction, the expectation is for the language,''
she said, ``but if you are a genre reader you will put up with a
lot of bad writing if you are interested in the plot and the
characters. The primary thing I have to accomplish on the page is
character, and I will sacrifice language for it.''

 UNDATED: for it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another difference is that ``literary fiction looks ahead'' and
``genre fiction tells us what everyone was thinking five minutes
ago. We're reactive. We don't challenge as much. In my last book, I
challenged the assumption that a woman should lead her life for the
expectations of other people. Well, that's kind of a `duh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, her work pushes the limits of the genre enough that
her publisher, St. Martin's Press, explicitly differentiated her
latest book, ``Crazy for You,'' from her other romances. ``Crazy
for You,'' a contemporary romance about the love travails of a
small town art teacher and an auto mechanic, has plenty of salty
language and sex scenes that are surprisingly raw. (It's OK these
days, for romance heroines to want it and say so.) And it has that
``duh'' theme; all the women take action to change their lives when
they find them stiflingly complacent, a complacency enforced on
them by their men. She was rewarded by a review in The New York
Times, highly unusual for a romance novel, which she is proud of,
even if the reviewer was not quite lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crusie does despair that commerce drives romance writers to
minimize their artistic impulses. What, after all, to make of a
seminar that urges writers to deepen their characterizations by
learning more about the eight female archetypes? (For the
uninformed, they are: the nurturer, the crusader, the librarian,
the waif, the free spirit, the spunky kid, the survivor and the
boss.)
</P>
<P>
   Conference attendees also learned that certain settings, like
England and Scotland, were perennial reader favorites. The Civil
War is no longer sure-fire, but cowboys and babies (particularly
secret babies) are currently irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best-attended workshops dealt unashamedly with the
tricks of selling and promoting; as Ms. Roberts, the suspense
novelist, informed her listeners, the two most important parts of a
book are the opening and the end of the third chapter, ``because
that's the last thing an editor reads before she decides whether to
buy your book.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of aspiration creates an air of unpleasant
competition, which at the conference was characterized by, well,
cattiness. One seminar addressed that, too. It had an oddly
gender-bending title, ``Nice Guys Finish First,'' and encouraged
good will among romance writers. One speaker was the novelist
Rebecca Hagan Lee, who confessed she was appalled at the
mean-spirited things she'd heard women at the conference saying.
Things like this, she said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If only Judith or Katherine or Heather or Nora _ insert your
favorite writer here _ would get on a plane and crash, there'd be a
slot for me,'' Ms. Lee said, pausing for the gasps in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well guess what?'' she said. ``That's not a guarantee.''

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantly warm mid-summer weather will prevail along the axis
of a ridge of high pressure from southern New England westward to
the lower Ohio Valley. Light breezes, comfortable humidity and an
array of puffy clouds amid sunny skies will dominate this region.
</P>
<P>
   A series of fast-moving disturbances along the Canadian border
will trigger patches of showers from Minnesota to northwest New
England. Varying amounts of clouds and an active breeze will keep
readings near seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with sultry air over the South will be active in
northern Florida. A disturbance moving toward the southwest will
cross the peninsula into the northeast Gulf of Mexico Tuesday.
Heavy thunderstorms with flooding rain are expected. Afternoon
thunderstorms will erupt along the sea breeze in southern
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thundershowers will be common from northern Arizona
into Colorado. Jet stream winds will carry moisture across Kansas
and toward the southern Great Lakes. Rain should be lighter in the
central Plains, but a few strong thunderstorms will develop on the
periphery of hot air in northwest Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture circulating northwestward through the deserts of the
Southwest will cause dull skies in parts of California and Nevada.
Streamers of humid air progressing through the central Rockies will
trigger a few storms in Utah and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Pacific Coast, north of Los Angeles, will be bright
and mild. Patches of fog along the Northwest Coast will dissipate
by midday.

   Nearly eight inches of rain fell on Seoul, South Korea during
Sunday as a disturbance along a stalled front generated repetitive
thunderstorms. The front separated cool, moist air over North Korea
from tropical air over the South. In the steamy air mass, Typhoon
Olga was moving slowly north over the East China Sea, helping to
direct large amounts of moisture into the Korean peninsula.
Tuesday, Olga will push inland along the west coast of Korea. Its
broad circulation will send bands of torrential rain into Seoul
once again further aggravating the serious flooding in this region.

CRITICS SAY INVESTORS SPOIL THE SPORT OF KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Thoroughbreds are faster today than 100
years ago, but it has come at a cost: The sport is producing more
fragile horses and jeopardizing the long-term health of the breed,
some industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbreds now run fewer races, race distances are
decreasing, and with new drugs masking problems, genetic weaknesses
are passing to future generations of racehorses, critics say. Those
trends bode poorly for the sport of kings, which some say is
becoming a sport of investors far too focused on short-term results
in short-distance contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are breaking down our best thoroughbreds and getting false
standards,'' said Joseph C. O'Dea, a thoroughbred veterinarian and
breeder and former state racing official. ``We've mucked up the
test of the horse with shorter distances, and we're losing the
quality of stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's theory _ survival of the fittest _ doesn't always apply
in today's hunt for precocious thoroughbreds. ``We've taken away
the wolves and the lions, and now the finish line is our selection
ground,'' said William Wilmot, a thoroughbred owner, breeder and
veterinarian from Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say thoroughbreds are faster now than they were in 1900.
``That is especially true of the average horse, which has gotten
much, much faster,'' said David B. Foye, an equine geneticist who
runs a consulting firm outside Lexington, Ky. The main reason for
the increased speed, he said, is the intense effort made to select
only the fastest horses for breeding.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many horses win with the aid of drugs. ``If
there is artificial support,'' Wilmot said, ``you are in danger of
weakening the genetic pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Most states now allow the use of Lasix, a diuretic that allows
horses to run fast despite bleeding in their respiratory tracts, a
fairly common problem for thoroughbreds. For reasons unknown, the
drug can improve the performance of both bleeders and nonbleeders,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a true test of horses if one or more is on a
performance-altering drug,'' said O'Dea, a former member of the New
York Racing and Wagering Board who wrote a book about the industry,
``The Racing Imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that race results help determine which horses are
used for breeding, so weaknesses, such as bleeding in the
respiratory tract, are being passed to future generations, said
John P. Sparkman, bloodstock/sales editor at the Thoroughbred
Times, based in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Some think purists are overstating drug drawbacks. ``People use
the drugging of horses as a whipping boy,'' said Walker Porter, a
veterinarian and breeder based in New Mexico. ``Don't you believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And some say today's thoroughbreds are as sound as ever. Neil
Cleary, the New York Racing Association's chief examining
veterinarian, said it's still rare to have breakdowns, in which
horses are fatally injured. Each year, about 25 horses break down
on NYRA tracks, he said. Last year saw 1.62 breakdowns per 1,000
starts _ up from 1.21 breakdowns in 1996 but down from 1.72
breakdowns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Dea said those figures only reflect horses that break down
on the track, and many others are injured in morning workouts. The
point, critics say, is that sturdier horses would race more often
and have fewer injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And Sparkman said there is no doubt horses are becoming less
sound. The ``most obvious and purest measure available'' is the
average number of career starts _ or number or races _ per foal for
American-bred and American-raced thoroughbreds, and that average
plunged from a high of 33.6 between 1940 and 1944, to 13.5 between
1985 and 89, according to a study Sparkman published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure, the average number of starts per racehorse,
plunged from 10.91 in 1950 to 7.29 last year, according to the
Jockey Club.
</P>
<P>
   John Asher, vice president of racing communications at Churchill
Downs, said there are reasons, other than unsoundness, why horses
now run fewer races. For one thing, purses are a lot higher, so a
horse doesn't have to race as often to make good money. The 1894
Kentucky Derby winner, Chant, ran 63 times to make $18,280, while
the 1994 winner, Go for Gin, raced 19 times to win $1.38 million.
Still, Asher agreed that many consider the breed less sturdy now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drugs aren't the only problem some critics see.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkman found that unsturdy horses imported after World War II
became popular with breeders and began spreading unsound
characteristics such as bad knees and ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not old, sound American genetic combinations that were
reinforced,'' he wrote. ``Instead, it was the less-sound,
lighter-boned, European combinations that were reinforced and
carried forward in future generations.'' Also, thoroughbreds began
running shorter distances, so breeders produced sprinters rather
than more sturdy distance runners. Last year, the average distance
of North American races for horses 3 or older was 6.86 furlongs,
according to the Thoroughbred Times. A furlong equals one-eighth of
a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the pressure is on for thoroughbreds to race and win as
2-year-olds, and the speed is wearing them out, said Michael D.
Flynn, executive director of New York Thoroughbred Breeders, based
in Saratoga Springs. ``They pop the latch and those young horses go
full throttle until they reach the wire,'' he said. ``It absolutely
grinds them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, critics say, is the waning of rich old racing
families and the advent of investors, who are more likely to push
young horses for quick results and monetary returns.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said owners press horses to race and win early because it
costs so much to keep a thoroughbred in training. ``It's
economics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dea's book traces the rise of ``commercial interests'' as
opposed to ``dedicated sportsmen'' in thoroughbred breeding.
``Although some may deny it, the goal of the market breeder is to
obtain the highest possible selling price,'' he wrote.
``Conversely, the quest of the private breeder who races his own is
competitive excellence with durability on the race course.''
</P>
<P>
   Asher agreed the industry overheated in the 1980s, when many
inexperienced people got involved to make a quick buck, but he said
the frenzy is over and familiar names are left. ``I do think most
breeders are responsible people who have an eye toward the
long-term,'' he said. ``I've got faith in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn believes change will come but not before there is a change
in mind-set. ``There is a real consciousness in breeding and in
advertising of speed, speed, speed, speed,'' Flynn said. ``I think
we are going in the wrong direction.''

GOING OUT WITH A BANG _ LITERALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS SMITH   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Morticians never are short of ideas for the
newly departed who have asked to be launched into the great beyond
solemnly, privately and serenely. And now the cremation industry
has something for folks who want to go out with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   It's a private memorial fireworks show. The ashes of the
deceased are dispersed amid the booming flashes of color and light
of a professional pyrotechnic display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for everybody,'' said Tom Simonson, president of the
Neptune Society of Northern California, which operates a
crematorium in Santa Rosa. The Neptune Society, just days ago,
agreed to offer fireworks memorials at all of its chapters.
</P>
<P>
   For families inclined to bid farewell to a loved one with oohs
and aahs a la the Fourth of July, the new service loads the
cremated remains into a number of fireworks shells. The ashes of an
average-sized person fill the special compartments of about seven
shells.
</P>
<P>
   When the shells explode, the ashes are cast to the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks can be shot off over land or sea. Two weeks ago,
the first San Francisco Bay area family to avail itself of the
service chose to have the ashes of late Bay area rocket scientist
John A. Kotowski carried by fireworks into the sky above the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Kotowski had designed rockets and missiles and a drill that
collected samples from the moon's surface. He was 85 when he died
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of July 17, nine of his loved ones boarded the
Naiad, the 55-foot Neptune Society yacht long used to carry ashes
for traditional scattering at sea and motored about two miles off
Fisherman's Wharf. The fireworks were launched from a second boat.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the shells climbed to about 450 feet, then burst into
fiery shapes that lighted up the faces of Kotowski's two sons and
his widow and six other relatives. The display was accompanied by a
taped rendition of Gioacchino Rossini's ``William Tell'' overture.
</P>
<P>
   As the glowing sparks cascaded toward the bay and burned out,
the scientist's ashes were flung to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   What does it cost? The sky's the limit, said Dick Hessenger, a
partner in Celebrate Life, the San Diego-based fireworks company
that has joined forces with the Neptune Society to offer aerial
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Hessenger said Celebrate Life's sister company, Fireworks &AMP;
Stage F/X America, produces major pyrotechnic shows at theme parks.
So, he said, the memorial show can be as elaborate as a family
wants.
</P>
<P>
   But the standard over-water package, including the use of a
viewing yacht and a second boat from which the fireworks are
launched, a music-accompanied pyrotechnic display lasting 2 1/2 to
3 1/2 minutes and a commemorative plaque, costs $3,250. Cremation
is not included.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Neptune Society office in Santa Rosa has yet to
receive its first order for the service, Hessenger and Simonson
said families can arrange to sail out of Bodega Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The displays also can be performed over land. Disposal of
cremation ashes used to be more tightly regulated in California,
but laws enacted this year make it legal for families to scatter
ashes at least 500 feet offshore or, with a property owner's
permission, on private or public land.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of scattering by fireworks is so new that many
mortuaries are aware of it vaguely if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of such a thing,'' said funeral director
Elvira Carreon of Sebastopol's Pleasant Hills Funeral Home.
``Nobody's ever requested it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Daniels Chapel of the Roses in Santa Rosa, owner Patsy
Daniels had heard a blurb about the service but didn't pay it much
mind. ``We have never had a request like that, ever,'' she said.
``It's not something we would ever consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonson admitted, ``This concept of sending cremated remains up
in fireworks ... when I first heard of it I was skeptical.'' But he
said he came about when he witnessed one of the services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's quite beautiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simonson said that 42 percent of Californians choose cremation
over burial in a casket. Others in his industry cite similar
percentages. He said it's good to offer a host of options to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Before partnering with the Neptune Society, Hessenger's
fireworks company promoted the service through the Internet and
worked with mortuaries and crematoriums willing to assist.
Hessenger said his company shot off the first fireworks with ashes
in 1995 at Marina del Rey in Los Angeles County. He said Kotowski's
service was No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Hessenger plans to practice what he preaches about final
fireworks. He said that once both he and his wife have passed on,
their ashes will be scattered over the Pacific off Kauai in a
couple's fireworks celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans are quite well laid,'' said Hessenger. He said the
music will be ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight?'' from ``The Lion
King'' and some of the fireworks will form great, red hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Couples services, of course, cost extra.

BEFORE THE STORM COMES THE CALM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Hey, Gert, Jose and Katrina, where are you?
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions of a busy hurricane season, it's been a
fizzle so far. So the question is: Were the forecasters way off?
</P>
<P>
   Their advice: Don't start digging into the canned tuna in your
hurricane supplies just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two words: last year,'' said hurricane forecaster Jack Beven
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Last year this time,
Alex, our first tropical storm, was forming. And later on we had 10
storms in 33 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State University professor Bill Gray predicted at the
start of the June-through-November hurricane season that 1999 might
be a repeat of last year, which produced a bumper crop of violent
storms.
</P>
<P>
   There were 14 tropical storms in 1998, 10 of which intensified
into hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and his research team said in June that conditions were
right for 14 storms this season. If he's right _ and he often is _
we'll be closely watching storms named Gert, Jose, Katrina and many
more.
</P>
<P>
   But so far there's only been tropical storm Arlene, which
bypassed Bermuda in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Landsea, a hurricane researcher for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Association and a former student of Gray's, says
the slow start to this year's hurricane season isn't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical average is one and a half tropical storms
forming by Aug. 1, so it's pretty close to average,'' he said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   He said a slow start doesn't indicate that the season will be an
inactive one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 and 1988, the first hurricane didn't form until
September. Diana and Debby were the fourth tropical storms in those
years, but the first ones that developed hurricane-force winds of
at least 74 mph. Both 1984 and 1988 produced 12 tropical storms,
five of which became hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine tropical storms develop in an average year, with six of
them becoming hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the slow start of the storms forming in the
subtropics is a sign that it could be busier than usual later on,''
Landsea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if the ones that form in the subtropics were
forming more regularly, but they're not. It's another sign that
later on, the Cape Verde season could be a nasty one in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Storms referred to as Cape Verde storms develop near the Cape
Verde islands off the west coast of Africa and often become the
biggest and fiercest storms of the hurricane season as they gain
strength sweeping across the Atlantic. They can scour the Caribbean
islands, strike the United States or Mexican mainland, or curve
harmlessly into the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane activity peaks in mid-September. August, September and
October are the three most active months, with 90 percent of all
storms occurring in those months, Landsea said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray will update his forecast Friday, and the NOAA plans to
reassess the hurricane season next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Landsea said he sees no obvious reasons to scrap the
forecast for an active season that he and Gray predicted. Beven,
with the National Hurricane Center, agrees that conditions still
appear favorable for an above-normal hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor is La Nina, the abnormal cooling of water in
equatorial Pacific waters. La Nina is expected to promote hurricane
development through the remainder of the year. Another factor Gray
takes into account is a high-pressure ridge in the North Atlantic,
which also promotes hurricane formation.

SCHOOL UNIFORMS? JUST DO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, Aug. 4)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I fail to see how mandatory school uniforms will improve student
discipline since students voluntarily dress the same way already,
but I saw a news item the other day that leads me to think that
school uniforms may not be an entirely bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Computing Online, Nike and Reebok _ the twin
fashion drains into which so much parent money flows _ are entering
the school uniform business. The Nike uniform features a
greenish-gray warm-up jacket, an oversized sweatshirt with the word
``Nike'' proudly displayed and warm-up pants, all liberally
festooned with the famous Nike ``swoosh.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reebok uniform is maroon with the word ``Reebok'' printed
wherever space will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Other clothing companies that hope to compete with Nike and
Reebok for lucrative school-uniform contracts better wear their
protective cups and batting helmets because these guys are playing
hardball. Both Nike and Reebok have offered to supply not only
complete uniforms, but also free computers to schools that agree to
sign on the dotted line.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both companies will offer incentives to students
who wear their uniforms to sporting events or promote the company
line in other ways like placing logos on their houses, painting
their cars in the official colors, etc.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me think that Nike should perhaps change its
slogan from ``Just do it'' to ``Resistance is futile. Prepare to be
assimilated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although, on the surface, it may seem insane or at least
hypocritical to try to correct the evil of conformity by forcing
kids to conform, I'm guessing that every kid that is made to wear a
Nike or Reebok school uniform will quickly come to hate all things
Nike and Reebok. Kids will no longer clamor for $200 basketball
shoes or $80 sweatshirts or $30 ball caps and we parents will
suddenly find ourselves rolling in the kind of surplus dough one
normally associates with Bill Gates or that Bush kid,
what's-his-name.
</P>
<P>
   I hear what you're saying. You're saying, Dave, you naive dope,
there is no such thing as ``surplus dough'' when you are a parent
because if the kids are not whining for overpriced stuff by Nike or
Reebok they are whining for even more expensive stuff made by
somebody else and you wind up even deeper in the hole than before.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely, which is why we need to keep rotating the school
uniform contracts, perhaps as often as several times a week, until
our kids despise every kind of youth-oriented apparel on the market
and maybe even some that haven't appeared yet.
</P>
<P>
   The day of victory will come when our children request _ no,
make that demand _ that we fulfill all of their fashion needs at
the Dollar Store or, better yet, Goodwill. That, of course, is the
day that we stop requiring our kids to wear school uniforms and
start requiring them to listen to rap music and play violent
videogames during math and English class.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative to all of this, and it isn't a big one, is
that Nike might go out of business, which wouldn't bother my
conscience at all except that all those Indonesians who are living
the good life hauling down 42-cents an hour making Michael Jordan's
tennis shoes would suddenly be out of work.
</P>
<P>
   A possible solution? Retrain them to assemble the millions of
computers that our school systems will be accepting from the
clothing companies trying desperately to win weeklong
school-uniform contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, great days are ahead for the American public school
system, and I almost wish I was a student again so I could be a
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, but not quite.

 &HT;    TV networks provide sneak peeks at fall programs
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The big three networks _ CBS, NBC and ABC _
seeming more clueless every year about how to survive in the
ever-expanding television universe, gave us a clue last week of
what to expect this fall.
</P>
<P>
   There are new characters in old shows: Jesse Martin (Ally's
fictional boyfriend) replacing Benjamin Bratt (Julia's real
boyfriend) on ``Law &AMP; Order''; Jamie Luner (``Melrose Place'')
replacing Ally Walker on ``Profiler''; Heather Locklear joining
``Spin City''; and more newcomers on ``ER'' and ``Chicago Hope''
than you'll find in a real E.R. on a busy Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There are characters talking privately to the camera (``Once and
Again,'' ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' ``Grapevine''), more British
knockoffs (``Cold Feet'' and an upcoming Norm Macdonald game show),
and even more David E. Kelley, who with his new ``Snoops''
preceding his old ``The Practice'' on Sundays now virtually owns an
entire night of prime time on ABC. Next year, maybe all the
networks will let him program their whole week. It'd be an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only NBC has announced the premieres of its shows _ all
except one will air during the week of Sept. 20, the official start
of the season. ``Third Watch,'' a paramedic/cop drama from John
Wells, will get its premiere in the prime ``ER'' slot on Sept. 23,
delaying ``ER's'' debut by one week. The episode will be the first
of two parts. The second part will air in the series' regular time
slot on Sunday at 8 p.m. It will be followed that night by a
special two-hour 25th-anniversary celebration of ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS have yet to officially announce their full
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   But before the new, promising season becomes the old, mostly
canceled season, we gathered comments from the cutting room floor
during last week's TV critics convention in Pasadena, and we offer
them for your consideration. We can think of no better way to start
than with this truism:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have too much of a good thing. Never, ever.
Copying is endemic to television.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Friedman, ``CBS This Morning''
</P>
<P>
   senior executive producer, on all three network
</P>
<P>
   morning shows having indoor/outdoor studios
</P>
<P>
   Other quotes from tv notables:
</P>
<P>
   Television critics meet twice annually to review new shows and
meet with network executives, creators and casts. But in all the
coverage, some great lines remain in the confines of the hotel
where the critics' convention is held. So, for your enjoyment, here
are some of the best:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diane Sawyer, on whether her view of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' has changed since joining the show: ``Yes. It's earlier
than it seemed watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lorne Michaels, ``Saturday Night Live'' creator, on why John
Goodman was cast last season as Linda Tripp: ``It was an incredibly
mean thing to do, and I think that had some appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  D.L. Hughley, star of ABC's ``The Hughleys,'' on TV's racial
divide: ``There are two kinds of shows: good shows and bad shows.
We had `Homebodys from Outer Space.' You had `Wings.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michael J. Fox, ABC's ``Spin City,'' on why he's sporting a
goatee: ``This is me clinging desperately to my vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Heather Locklear, new mother and cast member in ``Spin City,''
on why she's sporting an ankle tatoo: ``That's me clinging
desperately to an old life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jamie Luner, NBC's new ``Profiler'' lead, on her role in a
not-yet-released feature movie: ``I play a nice Jewish
prostitute.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kronish, ``Profiler'' executive producer: ``Where do you
find those?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Martin Sheen (nee Estevez), in ABC's ``West Wing,'' on whether
he was aware a network president used Sheen's Hispanic enthnicity
as an example of TV's racial diversity: ``I didn't realize I was a
symbol. I've been an actor for 40 years and I've played all kinds
of parts. I'm Hispanic by birth and Irish by trade.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lisa Nicole Carson, in the CBS movie ``Aftershock: Earthquake
in New York,'' on where she'd like to be in a real earthquake:
``Under a big... strong... man.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Margaret Colin, on her first reaction to reading the script
for CBS's ``Now and Again'': ``Well, you know, `Blah blah blah,
where's my line?' is my first reaction to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  William Keane, NBC's ``Cold Feet,'' on being Hugh Hefner's
night butler at the Playboy mansion after moving to Los Angeles in
1990 to become an actor: ``I usually brought half his dinner at
around 10:30, and he called down for a frozen Snickers or a yogurt
cone around 1:30 to help him sleep better. From that time on, I did
a myriad of different things... I had a lot of parties of up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anthony Edwards, on being recognized as Dr. Mark Greene from
NBC's ``ER'': ``I was flying back from New York a little while ago
and having the flight attendant say, `God, I wish you were here
yesterday, because we had a stroke on the plane.' And I'm thinking
if I have a stroke on a plane, I hope that, like, the pretend
doctor isn't on the plane. I want a real doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alex Kingston, on her ``ER'' character Dr. Corday having her
relationship end last season with Dr. Benton, who's black, and a
new one begin with Dr. Greene: ``The writers were very quick to
move Corday to a white-on-white relationship. Although I don't
think it has literally been white-on-white yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards: ``White-begging-on-white.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steven Levitan, creator of NBC's ``Stark Raving Mad,'' on how
he got a dog in the show to have sex with a human character's leg:
``The interesting thing is you can't teach a dog to do that. So we
actually had to have auditions for dogs _ either they had it or
they didn't. So a line of dog trainers would come into my little
office and they would go, `Okay, go, go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bobby Shriver, on working with his mother, Eunice Kennedy
Shriver, producing the NBC movie ``Mary and Jesus'': ``We worked
hard and we had some lively conversations and Father Heet (the
show's consulting priest) mediated them all in her confession after
every meeting. I got a lot more penance than she did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bryant Gumbel, on how he'll know he's found the right person
to be his ``CBS This Morning'' co-host: ``I'm afraid it's a little
bit like asking somebody what they think they have to do with
somebody before they decide to marry them. Do they have to meet
their folks? Do they have to come home and meet the kids from a
previous marriage? Do you have to take a vacation with them?
Sometimes you know the minute you see them. There is that moment
when you say, `You know what? I think this works.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Regis Philbin, on the fate of the question writer if a
contestant wins a million dollars on the ABC game show ``Who Wants
to be a Millionaire'': ``He's gone!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paula Jai Parker, black actress on her role in ``Snoops,''
David Kelley's new ABC show: ``It was just fun for me to have a
character with some meat. You know, I'd usually end up somewhere
being Sapphire on the WB.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dennis Haysbert, on his role as a black government scientist
who pieces together a new man on CBS's ``Now and Again'': ``During
the pilot, I was thinking, `What must this man have sacrificed to
be able to accomplish what he's accomplished?' I mean, this guy got
into a lab coat and created an artificial liver, an artificial
heart, all these wonderful things that went into this young man's
body. And I thought it was very cool that he actually built a white
man.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mark Legan, executive producer, explaining the concept of
``Thanks,'' CBS's Pilgrim sitcom: ``A little Mel Brooks, little
`Simpsons,' little `3rd Rock.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dutton, actor: ``Little `Crucible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phoef Sutton, co-executive producer: ``Little `Scarlet
Letter'... The funny parts of `Scarlett Letter.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Judd Apatow, NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks'' executive producer, on
casting kids to play high school students: ``We wanted to do a high
school show that actually looked like high school. My high school
didn't look like any of the shows that are on TV. There was maybe
one gorgeous girl in school, and looking back, she wasn't that hot
anyway. So we said, `What does high school look like?' and we cast
accordingly. And when you open it up for what people really look
like, there's an enormous amount of really talented people that
might not, you know, get work on `Dawson's Creek.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aaron Sorkin, creator of ``West Wing,'' set in the White
House, on whether a presidential scandal will be written into the
show: ``The Monica Lewinsky thing is so hyper-familiar to all of
us, it's frankly kind of ruined scandals for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tom Epstein, PBS vice president of communications, in opening
remarks to TV critics: ``We're celebrating our 30th anniversary
this fall... (and) if it weren't for those damn mailing lists, we'd
see smiles on your faces from beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paul Haggis, CBS's ``Family Law'' creator, on actor Chris
McDonald, who has the show's lone male role: ``Chris would come to
me on the set and ask me a question about his character. And I
said, `Stop bothering me with these questions. It's a chick show,
man. You're a piece of meat in the corner. Just stay there and look
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Adam Arkin, on getting a ``Chicago Hope'' writer to write a
love scene: ``Love scenes _ that's one of the few training tools
they have at their disposal with a cast, so it's like liver treats
for us. You know, you do a good job, you do the surgeries well and
you handle the patients right, we'll give you a love scene. Until
then, just behave.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ed Dector, creator of ABC's ``Odd Man Out,'' on network
expectations after co-writing ``There's Something About Mary'':
``We've been asked for a lot of hair gel jokes.''

NASA SAYS CHANDRA TELESCOPE IN LOWER ORBIT THAN PLANNED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA's $1.55 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched by
shuttle astronauts late last month, is in a slightly lower orbit
than intended, the space agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 559-mile shortfall in the high point of the 40-foot-long
telescope's unusual, highly elongated orbit around the Earth is
well within specifications and should not interfere with Chandra's
five-year mission of observations, said NASA's Jean Olivier,
Chandra's deputy project manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia astronauts successfully deployed the telescope into
low Earth orbit within hours of their launch late July 22. A boost
by an expendable rocket attached to Chandra as well as a series of
five propulsive maneuvers by the telescope itself were to place it
in an Earth orbit with high and low points of 86,992 miles and
6,214 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The third maneuver by the telescope over the weekend left
Chandra in an orbit with a high point of 86,433 miles, 559 miles
below its target destination. However, the high point is still
within the intended range of 83,885 and 90,099 miles, Olivier said.
</P>
<P>
   The low point of Chandra's orbit Monday was 2,150 miles. Two
more maneuvers are planned to raise the low point to the intended
6,214 miles.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fourth maneuver, planned for Monday, was postponed
by two days while engineers consider whether they should switch
from Chandra's primary propulsion system to a backup for the final
orbit adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Each system is comprised of two thruster engines. Olivier said
engineers are not sure why one of the primary system thrusters
fired with less force than anticipated during the third maneuver
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once Chandra attains its final altitude, the primary and backup
propulsion systems will be deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the unusual orbit is to place Chandra well above
the Earth's Van Allen radiation belt, which would interfere with
the space telescope's observations of X-ray emissions from black
holes, colliding galaxies and stellar explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers hope to make their initial observation later this
month.

Letterman and other late-night comedians looking for laughs in
Campaign 2000. Gore has been the butt of the joke at least 85 times
so far this year, according to the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, which monitors the nightly gab fests. His closest

AT SALZBURG, MEDDLING DEITIES AND A DEMANDING DEVIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Getreidegasse' in the lede is correct; Spelling
of `Doktor' in 10th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ The Salzburg Festival is a big musical event
in what is essentially a small town. The huddled masses in front of
Mozart's birthplace on the Getreidegasse add to the general
pedestrian gridlock, but the chestnut trees along the river bank
are as comforting as ever. One accepts the elaborate politeness,
grateful to have neither the time nor the need to explore beneath
it.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Berio's new opera, ``Cronaca del Luogo,'' is with us.
Verdi's ``Don Carlo'' and Berg's ``Lulu'' balance against Achim
Freyer's circus setting of Mozart's ``Zauberflote'' and a new ``Don
Giovanni.'' Philip Glass in concert is to come.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Mortier's adventures in programming continue to annoy
Austria's conservative wing. But if the presence of groups like
Klangforum Wien (featuring music by Georg Friedrich Haas), ``The
Pollini Project (From the Ancient to the New),'' the Ensemble
Contemporain (Pierre Boulez and his own music) and Zeitfluss (about
to begin) stir the waters, there is Johann Strauss and Vienna
Philharmonic concerts to smooth things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Boreades'' on Friday at the Kleines Festspielhaus seemed
both ancient and strangely new. The Salzburg production reverses
priorities. Rather than using song and dance in the service of
characters and plot, Rameau's last opera becomes a contemplation of
song and dance itself. Narrative is slightly stenciled over series
of small episodes. Continuity is tolerated but scarcely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Theater is not cheated. Lost only is the customary Baroque
boilerplate of forbidden love, godly intervention and happy ending.
Alphise, if you really have to know, should marry with her peers
but loves a man less than noble, or is he? You know the rest. The
music, with the advocacy of a largely American cast and the
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under Sir Simon Rattle, is a
revelation of oddly metered dancing, liquid arias and descriptive
orchestral writing. Act II's storm and cataclysm is tone painting
worthy of Haydn's ``Creation'' and Beethoven of the ``Pastoral''
Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Short numbers are what ``Les Boreades'' is about. No big
picture, only smaller ones. Ursel and Karl-Ernst Herrmann give us
the interior of a rotunda whose facades glow lightly like stainless
steel. A balcony reached on either side by elevators spans the
semicircle and from it Apollo, Amor and other godly officialdom can
look down and monitor the proceedings. The circular stage wobbles
agreeably in moments of stress, but mostly it is for dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The costumes assume that mythical presences don't need to worry
about period, and so we are given fanciful versions of pantaloons,
formal gowns, harlequin outfits and tail coats. Top hats of various
shades and shapes are the production's accessory of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing takes its style less from history than from the music
heard afresh. Bizarre and whimsical, it is still a logical
reflection of meter and rhythm. Barbara Bonney sings Alphise with
beauty and dignity. Heidi Grant Murphy as Amor is a bright presence
but difficult to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Two American tenors, Charles Workman as Abaris and Jeffrey
Francis as Calisis, made good impressions. Lutz Forster presides as
majordomo: tall, gaunt and nimble of foot. Sir Simon, with his
50-odd period instruments, shows a delight in this eccentrically
beautiful music. Musical form and theatrical content always compete
onstage, but rarely has form won so decisively.
</P>
<P>
   The production of interest to New Yorkers is a gravely touching
version of Busoni's ``Doktor Faust'' with the Metropolitan Opera as
co-producer, coming to the Met the season after next. Again
Americans are prominent: Thomas Hampson in splendid voice and vivid
form as Faust, and Chris Merritt a nicely calculated
Mephistopheles.
</P>
<P>
   Busoni's setting sidesteps Goethe and goes back to the early
puppet play and Christopher Marlowe. ``Doktor Faust'' is hardly a
repertory standard. It was a lifelong effort and was left
incomplete at the composer's death in 1924. Well done, it is
powerful theater. There are few opportunities for visual coups. And
Peter Mussbach's staging wisely avoids those that present
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is not so much an opera of ideas as one of inner turmoil,
most of it played out in the orchestra pit. One came away from
Sunday's performance wanting more Busoni in the opera house. His
skill at generating, or at least underlining, images of fright,
unease and confrontation through purely instrumental means makes
him a powerful man of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Faust who is indecisive and remorseful from the start.
Busoni's orchestra responds with a soft, queasy quasi-tonality.
Sudden episodes in the major signal brief optimisms. The use of
brass instruments at crucial confrontations is very sophisticated.
Faust's final monologue ought not to work, but so powerful is
Busoni's series of climaxes that bad theater turns to good.
</P>
<P>
   Erich Wonder's stage and Andrea Schmidt-Futterer's costumes are
drained of color. Dull and striking blacks, whites and grays
alternate. The scenes are stark: first, a set of train tracks on
which small flatbed trolleys convey men and materiel. If ``Les
Boreades'' is a celebration of the top hat, ``Doktor Faust'' is an
opera of overcoats in myriad variety.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson sings beautifully. Merritt's laboring of vibrato serves
Busoni's purpose, helping to create a Devil at once strident, ill
at ease and wittily self-possessed. He is also a tenor, which most
operatic Devils are not. Especially pleasing was Katarina Dalayman
as the Duchess of Parma. Kent Nagano led the Vienna Philharmonic
with a cool, subdued fluency. One hopes that the Met will capture
this cast along with the production.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the night's eye-popping, face-mopping finale,
after he put down his horn and retreated to his dressing room or
hotel or (at rare intervals) the paneled den of his brick-clad
house in Corona, Queens, Louis Armstrong often grouped his guests
around his other favorite instrument: his tape recorder. It was in
the recording mode. Not that everyone seemed to realize it, or
care.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1947, Armstrong's bulky reel-to-reel tape machines,
transported in a special trunk for travel, captured thousands of
hours of raw and intimate chatter, bawdy stories and dirty jokes,
noodlings on the trumpet, radio broadcasts and anything else that
caught the fancy of the irrepressible trumpeter and vocalist
revered as perhaps the greatest figure in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly three decades after his death at 69, with his house
being readied for opening as a museum by the centennial of his
birth in 2001 and an expanded set of his writings to be published
this fall, the 650 reels of unedited tapes are being copied for
preservation. At the same time, the tapes are being re-recorded on
cassette for playing by the public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong (he pronounced his first name both Louis and Louie)
would have been 98 on Wednesday, although he always listed his date
of birth as July 4, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings add a rich dimension to a resonant life already
well documented by Armstrong himself and at least seven
biographers. ``They display an intensely personal side of Louis
Armstrong,'' said Michael Cogswell, director of the Louis Armstrong
House and Archives, which manages the collection. He said the tapes
provided an unmatched window into the psyche of the improvisational
genius who molded jazz from its ragtime origins, popularized scat
singing and captivated a nation and a world embattled by racial and
colonialist strife.
</P>
<P>
   The first 280 tapes are now available and the rest should follow
within a year. But even Armstrong's biographers have sampled only a
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can listen to them; you don't have to be a professor
or writing a book,'' said Cogswell in his archives office at Queens
College of the City University of New York. The college administers
the legacy under an agreement with the Louis Armstrong Educational
Foundation and estate and the City of New York. It was the
foundation, backed by the Associated Booking Corp., Armstrong's
agent, that gave the tapes to the archives for sharing with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   But Cogswell acknowledged, ``We have not yet confronted the
issue of a sixth-grader who wants to hear Armstrong's jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   He faced a similar problem when Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
the archives last Dec. 3 with pledges of $120,000 to preserve the
tapes. An additional federal grant of $300,000 was later provided.
``We wanted to play her excerpts,'' Cogswell recalled, ``but we had
the damnedest time finding clean ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his unfettered memoirs and letters, which he relished
typing in idiosyncratic language, the recordings present Armstrong
in an earthy light, expectable perhaps from a man who called
everyone Pops, reveled in his active sex life, touted a daily
regimen of marijuana and proselytized relentlessly on behalf of his
favorite laxative, Swiss Kriss.
</P>
<P>
   But because he did not identify the speakers or settings and
only later intermittently cataloged some of the material by
subject, though not date, the recordings are not always coherent.
Still, Armstrong's trademark silken growl is unmistakable as he
traded raunchy jokes with the black comedian and actor Stepin
Fetchit and other friends and found unlikely humor in encounters
with racism. He was impatient with slackers, black or white, and
members of the young generation: ``They want the horn to play
itself,'' he said on one tape made in Portland, Ore., in the early
1950s, the setting deducible from other references.
</P>
<P>
   He delighted in spinning an endless array of jive-talk stories
worthy of his nickname, Satchmo (for Satchel Mouth); managed to
tape a radio broadcast announcing the shooting of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.; and at times in his solitude took up his
horn, on one occasion blowing a stratospherically high rendition of
``Somewhere Over the Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion in the mid-'50s, he recalled ``that
gooooooood food in Montmartre, in Paris there'' and a visit from
``the royalty cats,'' who from a related reference may have
included Princess Margaret and the Duke of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come over to Paris to catch us when we was at the Olympic
Theater, and after the show they wanted to take me to the big
restaurants,'' Armstrong recounts. ``I say, `I was just on my way
to scarf, man.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He say, `Where you going?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I say: `A little grease joint there, in Montmartre there. They
have pig knuckles and pig's feet and beans.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `By jove, we'll go over there,' you know, and, man,
the cats and wives are sitting next to me and they kept tasting my
beans there so fast I said, `Lookit here, honey, you better get
yourself a side dish there, you're killing me.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In one tender and apparently solitary moment, Armstrong put a
record on the turntable and announced: ``You're now about to hear
some of the finest incidents that will take you way back, way back
as far as the year 1922'' _ actually 1923 _ ``when I, Louis
Armstrong, was playing second trumpet with Joe Oliver at Lincoln
Gardens in Chicago, and also I used to write a lot of tunes. Here's
one that's a beautiful thing called `Tears' and, uh, we made that
one for the Okeh recordings and as this record plays along, I'm
going to noodle a little with it, you know, for old times' sake.''
</P>
<P>
   After the poignant and unlikely duet of young Louis Armstrong
and mature Louis Armstrong, he credited his collaborator on
``Tears,'' the band's pianist, Lil Hardin, ``who probably _ not
probably, eventually _ became my wife.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's life is a continuing source of fascination for
biographers and many readers. In November, the Oxford University
Press will bring out the first extensive addition to his own
writings since his 1954 autobiography, ``Satchmo: My Life in New
Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   The new book, ``Louis Armstrong, In His Own Words,'' edited by
Thomas Brothers, an associate professor of music at Duke
University, will publish for the first time material that Armstrong
wrote for a sequel to his autobiography and that some scholars say
was suppressed for its ardent advocacy of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes memoirs of his life in New Orleans and Corona
and a sexually detailed 1955 letter to his manager, Joe Glaser of
Associated Booking, in which Armstrong recounts an affair with a
young woman called Sweets. Armstrong says they had a child and
directs Glaser to pay the mother and baby $100 a week. But
Armstrong's fourth and last wife, Lucille, later ridiculed his
claimed paternity, saying he was being swindled by the mother. No
proof either way has emerged. All of Armstrong's marriages were
childless.
</P>
<P>
   Another biographer, Tad Jones, a music writer in New Orleans,
has been working for more than a decade on a definitive account of
Armstrong's hardscrabble but loving upbringing and his roots
stretching back to a great-grandfather who was a slave in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 2001, the simple 1910 house at 34-56 107th Street
that Armstrong's widow, Lucille, a former Cotton Club dancer,
bought while he was on the road in 1943 will be opened to visitors,
complete with some of Armstrong's piped-in words and music.
(Armstrong and his first three wives, Daisy Parker, Lil Hardin and
Alpha Smith, had divorced.)
</P>
<P>
   A National Historic Landmark since 1977, it is unremarkably
decorated in circa 1950s Queens style except for a completely
mirrored bathroom with lavish onyx sink and gold-plated fixtures, a
large custom aquamarine kitchen with built-in Sub-Zero
refrigerator, and Armstrong's upstairs den with a built-in Tandberg
recording system. (One night it captured sounds of a marital spat
and the clinking of ice cubes as Armstrong poured himself a drink.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a sketch called ``Our Neighborhood,'' which he wrote less
than a year or two before his death in 1971 and which is included
in his forthcoming book, Armstrong scrawled in his distinctive
orthography that the house might not look like much from outside.
But visitors, he wrote, ``see a whole lot of comfort, happiness +
the nicest things. Such as  &UR; that Wall to Wall Bed  &LR;  _ a Bath Room
with Mirrors  &UR; Everywhere  &LR;  Since we are  &UR; Disciples  &LR; to Laxatives. A
 &UR; Garage  &LR; with a magic up (plus sign) down gate to it.'' He was
proud, too, of his Cadillac, saying: ``The Kids in our Block just
thrill when they see our garage gate up and our fine Cadillac  &UR; ooze
 &LR; on out. They just rejoice and say, `Hi _ Louis + Lucille _ your
car is so beautiful coming out of that raise up  &UR; gate,''  &LR; which
knocks me out.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lucille Armstrong's death in 1983, the city and the estate
agreed to transfer the many artifacts to a six-room archival center
in the new Queens College library in Flushing. Stored there for
examination and study by visitors are Armstrong's tapes and 1,600
phonograph records; his library, including books by his nutrition
guru, Gayelord Hauser, the German natural-foods exponent who was
fashionable in Hollywood and cafe society; and 85 scrapbooks pasted
with photos, collages and news articles going back to the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   There are 5,000 photos, the bulk of them showing Armstrong
performing in jazz clubs and posing with other celebrities _ Don
Newcombe and Junior Gilliam of the Brooklyn Dodgers, George Raft
and so many others that experts in pop culture had to be consulted
to identify them all. There are Armstrong's well-stamped passports,
his 1957 gold record for ``Mack the Knife,'' material from the 35
films in which he appeared and, fittingly enough, leather satchels
monogrammed Satch and Satchmo.
</P>
<P>
   There are also eight of his trumpets, including one that the
King of England presented to him in 1934 and that Armstrong
generously bestowed in turn on a fellow trumpeter, Lyman Vunk,
whose widow left it to the archives. ``Louis saved everything,''
Cogswell, the archives director, said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to his latest biographer, Laurence Bergreen, author of
``Louis Armstrong: An Extravagant Life'' (Broadway Books, 1997),
Armstrong gained his interest in tape recording after hearing
bootleg recordings of his Carnegie Hall concert in 1947. The next
day, the book recounts, Armstrong bought two tape recorders and
took them everywhere. An undated photo, most likely from the 1950s,
shows a grinning Armstrong in a hotel room with a machine made by
Recordio and the steamer trunk he transported it in.
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstrong was often considered an accommodator rather
than an activist on racial issues, he was hardly indifferent to
racism, as some of the tapes establish. On one, he told of meeting
a young white Texan who began, ``Louis Armstrong, I want to shake
your hand'' and added: ``I'm going to be very frank with you. I
don't like Negroes, see what I mean. My family taught me to hate
Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, Armstrong said: `` `You, I like you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man concluded with a request, Armstrong said: ``When you go
through this town, look up my brother _ he's one of your fans.''
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't get away from it, Armstrong reflected: ``Always
some white man like one nigger at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong died at the dawn of the cassette era but did get an
early cassette model from Philips to play around with, Cogswell
said. ``He was a gear freak,'' he said. ``If he were around today,
he'd be surfing the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   On one recording Armstrong said: ``I have all my records on
tape, interviews and every classical number that you can think
of.'' He called it his hobby and boasted of assembling 1,000 reels,
although only 650 have turned up, in boxes that Armstrong
whimsically hand-decorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I always say a man should have some kind of way to idle
away time,'' he continued. ``After all, you don't want to look at
the four walls, which is what a lot of musicians did. Didn't have
anything to do so they hit the bottle and stuff. There's a time and
place for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-minute video made by the archives in 1995 that
incorporates Lucille Armstrong's last video interview and her
husband's earliest film clip, from 1932, Mrs. Armstrong said she
thought of him as still very much part of the present: ``He told me
he was going to usurp Gabriel, sit in his chair.''

BUSH SEEKS TO QUASH DEPOSITION SUBPOENA IN TEXAS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Claiming he had nothing to do with the ouster of
a whistle-blowing state employee, Gov. George W. Bush soon will
file legal papers seeking to prevent being questioned by attorneys
for former Texas Funeral Services Commission director Eliza May,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General John Cornyn said a motion to
quash Bush's deposition subpoena from May would be filed in Travis
County district court by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's motion is based upon the fact that Gov. Bush has
no knowledge of the events surrounding this lawsuit,'' Cornyn
spokesman Ted Delisi said.
</P>
<P>
   May, fired six months ago, is seeking Bush's testimony in
connection with her lawsuit against the commission, the nation's
largest provider of funeral services, Houston-based Service Corp.
International, and its chairman, Robert Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was subpoenaed July 21, is not a defendant in May's
whistle-blower suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Bush and his staff improperly influenced
the regulatory commission to fire May after she had aggressively
pursued an investigation of SCI's embalming practices at 20 Texas
facilities. That probe resulted in a proposed fine of $445,000
against the Houston company, which has 3,700 funeral homes
worldwide, including 106 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers and media interviews in recent months, May's
lawyers have asserted that Bush and Cornyn both had friendly
relationships with SCI officials and Bush took substantial campaign
contributions from the company's political action arm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has denied involvement in May's dismissal, which followed
disclosures that she deployed an agency staff member to research
Bush's campaign finances. The records reflected that Bush's
campaign was given $35,000 by SCI's political action committee in
1996-97, May's lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has no personal knowledge of the facts of the
case. The governor's office has not attempted to influence the
investigation of SCI in any way,'' said Bush spokesman Linda
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys could not be reached for comment Monday.
Previously they have stated that Bush's testimony is essential in
determining whether he had a role in May's termination.
</P>
<P>
   SCI spokesman Bill Miller scoffed at news reports suggesting
that Cornyn and Bush collaborated to help the industry giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dots and you can connect them in a variety
of ways,'' Miller said, but Bush ``had nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller claimed that Bush, a GOP presidential hopeful, was drawn
into the litigation as a ``publicity gimmick.'' May is a former
Texas Democratic Party official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deposition of Bush is in keeping with that theme. We (SCI)
are named simply because we're the biggest and it's a good way to
draw attention,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation comes at a tumultuous juncture at the almost
century-old agency, which was founded in 1903 to regulate
embalmers. Earlier this year, the 76th Texas Legislature voted to
overhaul the commission's nine-member board in favor of a
six-member body with more representation of the general public and
fewer funeral industry-tied members.
</P>
<P>
   The board restructuring, along with several regulatory changes
aimed at curtailing consumer complaints, will take effect Sept. 1.

KILLER E-SPEAK FOR THE 24/7 GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 8)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say ``computer lingo'' to most people, and they'll rattle off
their rudimentary knowledge of the meaning of  &UR; byte &LR; ,  &UR; hacker &LR;  and
 &UR; cybersex gritch &LR;  (the last marries  &UR; digiporn &LR;  to the portmanteau
of  &UR; grouch &LR;  and  &UR; glitch &LR; , producing a phrase meaning ``hacker's
complaint about the encryption of dirty pictures'').
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, say ``management jargon'' to an old-fashioned
CEO in Buggywhip Industries, and that executive will slip into an
archaic patois of  &UR; dotted-line responsibility &LR;  or the oxymoronic
 &UR; structured competition &LR; , taking you down a  &UR; critical path &LR; 
overgrown with  &UR; zero-based &LR;  weeds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's yesterday's talk. As my with-it colleague Maureen
Dowd likes to sigh, ``It's so  &UR; over &LR; .'' The new jeaniuses working
for IPO options at the profit-free start-ups _ intensely laid-back
execugeeks who never trust anybody under $30 million _ have a
language all their own.
</P>
<P>
   I have a lexicographic spy in their midst. He is Edward Bleier
of Warner Bros. (in a lifelong battle against The New York Times'
insistence on spelling out the  &UR; Brothers &LR; ), who has just been
elected to the board of RealNetworks, one of the many modern
companies whose names were created in a tightly packed elevator
(and which The Times rightly resists).
</P>
<P>
   Ed was my Syracuse University classmate, thus no spring chicken,
but he refuses to let the new lingo close down his
communicativeness. At his first board meeting, he jotted down some
examples of the new code of ``e-lingo,'' with his guesses at their
meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Does this company have  &UR; management bandwidth &LR; ? In computerese,
nothing can beat the  &UR; bandwidth &LR; , which used to mean ``a range of
radio frequencies'' and came to mean ``the data-transfer rate of a
communications system,'' among other things. However,  &UR; management
bandwidth &LR;  means ``the strength and depth of senior executives.''
It is what football coaches call a  &UR; deep bench &LR; , rested and
talented reserves who impatiently watch the marching  &UR; bandwidth &LR;  at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says  &UR; now &LR;  anymore; it's all  &UR; in real time &LR; . What is the
 &UR; full stop &LR; ? It's a deadline for a meeting or a phone call to end.
</P>
<P>
   What do you demand when you need measurements, standards for
evaluation?  &UR; Metrix &LR; . Do not confuse this with a  &UR; matrix &LR; , the grid
on which data is shoveled for three-dimensional planning. (Back
when I was a writer, I thought a  &UR; matrix &LR;  was a mixture of
``matronly dominatrix,'' but now I am a content provider and know
better.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't run when you hear  &UR; run rates &LR; ; they are the  &UR; vector &LR; 
(never say ``direction'') and speed of the  &UR; metrix &LR; . But stop when
you come to the  &UR; inflection point &LR; , which is what used to be known
as a  &UR; crossroads &LR; , as in the sage advice of the Old Managers,
``When you come to a  &UR; crossroads &LR; , take it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you make the right decision, you will  &UR; vector &LR;  right to a
 &UR; power point &LR; . This is ``activity that provides added leverage to
improve another aspect of the service or business.'' I think this
used to be called ``synergy,'' but don't use that word, because
it's  &UR; over &LR; . ( &UR; History &LR; , as in ``He's  &UR; history &LR; ,'' is also over.
 &UR; Over &LR;  is not yet over, but will soon be.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor should you seek the old  &UR; consensus &LR; , which used to be the
Holy Grail of the other-directed; instead, seek  &UR; mind share &LR; . Don't
worry about being  &UR; hardcore &LR; ; it used to apply to porn, but now it
is a killer-app adjective meaning ``intense, dedicated,
tough-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists will be dismayed to learn that their favorite
word,  &UR; ecosystem &LR; , has been spirited away by the e-speakers.
According to Bleier's hurried notes (written by ergonomic pencil on
paper, not even scratched on a screen with a stylish stylus), an
 &UR; ecosystem &LR;  is ``a matrix of suppliers, sites and users that relate
to an Internet enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to step back and look at this data
 &UR; longitudinally &LR; . As Ed tentatively explains it (after all, it was
his first meeting), this means ``examining an issue from side to
side, as opposed to top to bottom.'' (Some newly noir Raymond
Chandler will arise to write, ``He looked at her
 &UR; latitudinally &LR; .'')
</P>
<P>
   And what if some Real Networks executive reports to the board,
``This place is a  &UR; beehive &LR; ''? In olden times, that would have
meant ``active,'' as in ``busy as a bee.'' Now, however, if it's
 &UR; beehive &LR; , it's ``not working, because elements are swarming about
aimlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The word  &UR; improvement &LR;  has itself been improved; it is now  &UR; next
generation &LR; .  &UR; Transfer &LR; ? Out. Use  &UR; port to &LR; . And when information
has been not merely  &UR; transcoded &LR;  _ that is, put into another format
_ but  &UR; ported to &LR;  a wholly different source, as from a music CD
onto a computer hard drive, it has been  &UR; ripped &LR; . (Shakespeare
liked ``untimely ripped.'')
</P>
<P>
   Though most of us are still working out Y2K, the year 2000
problem, the question that the boys in the  &UR; bandwidth &LR;  are asking
is, ``Is the new secretary  &UR; 24/7 &LR; ?'' This is no lascivious
reference to anybody's bust-and-waist  &UR; metrix &LR; . It has to do with
the employee's willingness to be on cell call 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   You can always tell if the Internet company management has
 &UR; next-generation bandwidth &LR;  by its ability to achieve  &UR; stickiness &LR; .
This is a measurement of how long an individual Internet user _
you, for example _ stays on the particular Web site without
hypertexting off to some other seductive site like a faithless
wanton.
</P>
<P>
   Holding you as the user fast to the site _ making you  &UR; hardcore &LR; 
_ is what used to be called the name of the game. Are you ready? In
the new Internet boardrooms, this Web-site loyalty is referred to
reverently as  &UR; eyeball hang time &LR; .

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Two crowded trains hurtled head-on into each
other early Monday morning, killing at least 210 people _ many of
them soldiers _ at a railroad station in eastern India near the
border of West Bengal and Assam, railway authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, rescue workers attempted to cut through the
vast tangle of crushed coaches, trying to make their way to
hundreds of bodies still trapped in the smoking wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was expected to rise sharply in what was already
one of the worst accidents in the history of India's rail system,
which is the second biggest in the world after China's, and to a
large extent a dilapidated relic of the colonial era. More than
2,000 people were said to have been aboard the two trains.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 1:55 a.m. at Gaisal station, about 250
miles north of Calcutta. It involved the Awadh-Assam Express, which
was bound for Guwahati, Assam's commercial capital, and the
Brahmaputra Mail, which was headed for New Delhi carrying a large
number of soldiers from the Border Security Force and the Central
Reserve Police Force.
</P>
<P>
   While early reports indicated that the accident may have been
caused by a bomb, officials said later that an initial
investigation pointed instead to a signal failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an explosion or a bomb blast,'' M.G. Arora, a
spokesman for Indian Railways, told Reuters. ``It is a collision of
two trains.''
</P>
<P>
   If a faulty signal was indeed the cause, it is likely to lead to
renewed criticism of the rail system, a public behemoth that each
day transports 13 million people _ a good many of whom hang out the
doorways or cling to the roofs of stuffed cars _ and is notorious
for being a slipshod, uncomfortable and starved for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents are epidemic. Recent analyses of the system, a
sprawling network with 37,000 miles of track, have attributed 70
percent of the accidents to human error and 11 percent to failing
equipment. The trains in Monday's crash were traveling along the
same track.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, there have been eight major accidents in
India, with death tolls ranging from 52 to 302. The worst railroad
disaster took place in 1981 when a cyclone blew a train into a
river in Bihar state, killing more than 800.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's crash left coaches piled atop each other like logs on a
campfire. Survivors described being hurled through the air and
dumped upside down. The dead, covered by white sheets, were laid
out in long rows near the side of the tracks. Rescue operations
were slowed by the lack of a crane to lift one collapsed heap from
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a thing before,'' said Sameer Banarjee, a
district official reached near the scene by telephone. ``I can
never forget it. It was too terrible, in every way too terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Suitcases, broken glass and bedrolls were strewn across a large
area. The injured wandered about, with pieces of torn clothing
wrapped around their limbs to stop the bleeding or cover their
burns. Medical students from a nearby college tended dazed and
wounded passengers, most of whom had been asleep when the hulks of
steel hurtled into each other.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping relatives attempted to identify the dead. ``Many bodies
could not be recognized,'' Banarjee said. ``They were burned and
battered beyond recognition.''

ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE TALKS HIT ROADBLOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Less than a week after warm smiles and pledges of
peace passed between them, Israelis and Palestinians hit snags in
peace talks that Palestinians on Monday described as a ``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli attorney
Gilead Sher, an envoy for Prime Minister Ehud Barak, ended their
first meeting in Egypt over the weekend at loggerheads over how to
implement the latest peace agreement, known as the Wye River
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader has asked the Palestinians to postpone some
of the land transfers until a later date, which Palestinians say
they reject. On Sunday, Sher apparently reiterated the same
request, prompting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday to
accuse Barak of trying to back out of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms what I said at the beginning,'' Arafat said in
Gaza after returning from a weekend trip to Cairo. ``There is an
attempt to evade the accurate and complete implementation of the
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Arafat's aides, Nabil Amr, accused Barak of duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly (Barak) says he won't change the Wye deal if the
Palestinians reject (the delays), but privately he and his people
threaten us if we don't'' accept his proposals, Amr, the
Palestinian minister of parliamentary affairs, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was too early to tell whether a crisis at this
early stage in negotiations spelled trouble. But most said it did
not bode well for talks that have already been badly battered by
three years of stalemate during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   If Palestinians stick by their refusal to accept changes in the
agreement, Barak has committed himself to implementing it and
handing over the required territory.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is not whether Palestinians will receive West
Bank land, but when _ now, as Arafat is demanding, or later, as
Barak wants.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Barak hinted that what he termed Palestinian
``rigidity'' could sour the atmosphere of talks on down the line.
``It will affect the character and the quality of future
negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River agreement, brokered by the Clinton administration
at a conference center in Maryland, lays out a specific timetable
for a complicated three-staged Israeli troop withdrawal from West
Bank land _ 13 percent from areas under Israel's complete rule and
14.2 percent from areas under partial Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the agreement obligates the Palestinians to carry out
specific and verifiable steps to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Netanyahu transferred to Palestinians 2 percent
of territory under total Israeli rule and another 7 percent of the
area under partial Israeli rule. He then froze further land
transfers, citing Palestinian noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Barak inherited the unfinished deal when he entered office July
6. Since then, he has repeatedly asked the Palestinians to consider
forfeiting some of the territory due to come under their control
until a later date and instead accept a smaller chunk of land as
early as Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli observers say Barak opposes putting territory under
Palestinian control that will leave about 15 West Bank settlements
isolated and vulnerable to attack before the parameters of a final
peace deal are in place.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if he does have to give up territory now, the
observers say, Barak would rather hand over land in the northern
West Bank instead of withdrawing from swaths of territory in the
southern Judean hills.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, loath to confront religious settlers living on
hilltops in the northern West Bank, opted to cede parts of the
Judean Desert, but on condition that the Palestinians agreed to
hold the land as an undeveloped ``nature reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Barak, ever putting security considerations first,
would rather keep the Judean hills _ territory that leads to the
strategically important Jordan Valley _ under Israeli control and
give up territory around the northern settlements instead.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the State Department called for both sides to be
patient. ``It's not surprising that the differences that developed
over three years (under Netanyahu) will not be worked out
overnight,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters
in Washington. ``But even with the best of intentions, it's going
to take time to work out these differences. We expect this to be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they still believed a compromise could be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not use the word crisis,'' Haim Ramon, a minister in
Barak's Cabinet and a proponent of the peace agreements, told
Israel Radio. ``I believe we will find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the previous government, we are serious about reaching
a permanent agreement,'' he said.

IN CHINA, FAILURE RATE IS HIGH FOR AMUSEMENT PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIADING, China _ On a recent afternoon, only a few customers
could be found wandering around the American Dream, a sprawling
theme park on the outskirts of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rides were closed. The paint was peeling on the
pillars supporting a worn-looking ``Palladium'' theater. Two
attendants slept on the counter of a ticket booth. The hot-dog
concession was open, but out of food.
</P>
<P>
   The day's take at the gate: 12 people. Pretty paltry for a park
that cost $50 million to build a few years back, when bright
forecasts predicted 30,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless other virtually empty theme parks in China, the
American Dream symbolizes the disastrous miscalculations made by
both Chinese and foreign investors who were persuaded by Chinese
officials that a huge, child-loving populace would fuel a lively
theme-park business.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, projects have been swamped by excessive competition,
poor market projections, high costs and relentless interference
from local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal outcome highlights a glaring fallacy in the rationale
of innumerable foreign investors who come to China, misty-eyed
about the potential demand in China's enormous market but blind to
all the competing supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just sell one item to every Chinese ...'' has been a
mantra of naive Western business executives for over 100 years. But
as the theme-park business shows, as soon as a good idea appears,
so much supply can quickly follow _ much of it cheap and
low-quality _ that a market is often inundated and even ruined.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 theme parks popped up in China in the last five
years, but the quality has been so poor at so many places that
several hundred have already gone out of business. Even worse, many
of the potential consumers expected to flock to the parks have gone
sour on the notion of theme parks altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Zhengtai, a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai who
has studied amusement-park investments, estimates that, so far,
more than 80 percent of theme parks in China lose money.
Construction on new parks has now slowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not quelled talk here about bringing the biggest
theme-park creator of them all _ Walt Disney Co. _ to China.
Despite a terrible track record with theme parks, Chinese officials
from several cities are eager to lure such a big attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, created a stir in China when
he said in his annual report this year, ``We could be getting close
to the time for a major Disney attraction in the world's most
populous nation.'' Chinese officials in Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen said coyly that they had been visited by Disney executives
looking at prospective sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, disclosed in
March that talks had begun about building a theme park at a site
near Hong Kong's new airport. It blew a bubble of optimism among
Hong Kong executives that a new Disneyland could lift the former
colony out of its economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   It also provoked a competitive reaction from Shanghai, where
officials seem to feel that China's largest and fastest-growing
city should be the leading candidate. The city's mayor gamely
suggested that Disney build parks in both Hong Kong and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Disneyland in California, and another in Florida,''
said the mayor, Xu Kuangdi. ``There is no reason why we can't have
one in Hong Kong and one in Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, it seems clear, is that China's track record on
theme parks is so disastrous. Another is that it has yet to be
demonstrated that the market in any mainland Chinese city can
support a high-cost theme park, like American Dream, which at $50
million ranks as one of the more expensive parks. Nor have any
parks been able to attract a significant number of customers from
other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few successes, like the Hangzhou Amusement Park, in
the city of Hangzhou, about 120 miles from Shanghai, where
designers integrated the area's natural beauty into the park.
Managers would not disclose gate receipts, but say they sometimes
get more than 5,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai officials admit that Disney now favors Hong Kong, where
negotiations over a possible theme park have been under way for
months. In July, the Hong Kong government said the discussions
would continue until October, and the outcome is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, China still looks like a field of opportunity for the
theme-park business. There is a fast-growing economy, an awakening
middle class with leisure time and disposable income, and a
cultural disposition toward pampering children, which is
accentuated by a one-child-per-family policy.
</P>
<P>
   For a reality check, consider the experience of the American
Dream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park was largely financed by Robert Miller, who founded DFS
Group Ltd., the duty-free chain. Based on projections of 3 million
visitors a year, tickets were priced at $12.50 each when the park
opened in 1996. This was ambitious in a place where the average
salary is still only $50 a month, but it reflected the optimism
that was infusing the field at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year wasn't bad,'' said Chen Xuan, head of ticketing
at American Dream. ``But people in China only go to a park once, so
once the people who could afford it came, sales dropped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang, the professor who has studied amusement parks, said
Chinese consumers were indeed willing to spend well, and to return,
but only if the park was good enough to merit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that if there is a place with real quality,
they're willing to pay,'' Yang said. ``If it just seems ordinary,
they are unlikely to pay a second time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American Dream, next to a refrigerator factory on a run-down
highway, is not easy to get to for ordinary customers, few of whom
own cars. Most visitors come on buses organized by their factory or
office, and younger groups come with tourist agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of competing parks popped up in the surrounding area. An
even more congested region, measured by theme parks, is around the
city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, where more than 100 parks
fought for market share in the mid-1990s. Most have closed over the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Interference from local officials, often the make-or-break
factor in any large investment in China, was typical. Many local
officials seem to see foreign investors as cash cows, not partners,
and ensuring a high employment rate is one of their main concerns.
At the American Dream Park, more than 400 employees are still on
duty each day, even though few have anything to do when they
outnumber customers more than 25 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   When the owners realized the staff was too big, they tried to
carry out mass layoffs. Workers who had been promised jobs rioted,
forcing the park to pay settlement charges to some and to rehire
many others.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the costs. With inexperienced managers, many
Chinese parks pay top dollar for old amusement-park equipment.
American Dream paid $540,000 for a Ferris wheel that was later
found to be worth about $50,000. Other rides broke down as soon as
they began operation.
</P>
<P>
   Like theme parks in the United States, American Dream was
intended to offer a variety of rides and entertainment, including a
boat ride, a modest imitation of a roller coaster, and a movie
theater. One section carries the flavor of America's Wild West;
another looks like Main Street, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   When revenue plummeted, disappointed local officials demanded
compensation for roads and water lines that had been supplied to
support the projects, as well as taxes that had been waived.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for customers, American Dream now sell tickets for
$2.50 apiece, one-fifth the original price.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese officials, who often seem to struggle to keep up
with the chaotic side effects of the shift from a planned to a
market-oriented economy, have denounced the plethora of theme parks
as badly wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Lantong, a member of China's national legislature,
complained at a recent session that too many construction projects
in China are being built without official approval or inspection.
Among large projects costing over $500,000, Chen estimated, more
than 40 percent were beyond the control of central government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   At American Dream, employees are searching for a bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just staying open in this market is an achievement,'' said a
ticket seller. ``We can't compete with Disney on quality, but we
can offer first-class service.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Germany _ Always a crucible of the best and worst in
Germany, this small town has emerged a decade after the fall of the
Berlin Wall as a focus of national questioning and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Festivity should be in the air. This year is the 250th
anniversary of the birth of Weimar's most distinguished son,
Goethe. The town was selected by European ministers as the
Continent's ``cultural capital'' for 1999, an accolade that has
spurred spending and sprucing on a scale unknown elsewhere in the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Its communist decay dusted off, its church spires repainted,
Weimar now suffuses cobblestoned charm, the stuff of fairy tales.
But the town _ home to Schiller and to Nietzche, birthplace of the
Bauhaus _ is also adjacent to the Nazis' Buchenwald concentration
camp, where more than 50,000 people were killed between 1937 and
1945.
</P>
<P>
   This juxtaposition of high German thought and base German
barbarism has complicated the celebration of culture. Goethe's
drawings have been put on show _ at Buchenwald. Schiller's house
was chosen for an exhibition about the death in 1939 of several
hundred Viennese Jews at the camp. Not everyone approved.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a sign of the tensions, six sculptures by the
British artist Stuart Wolfe that were on display in a Weimar church
and represented concentration camp victims were destroyed by
unknown assailants. The police have offered a reward of several
thousand dollars for information.
</P>
<P>
   Friction has also stirred between the ``Wessis'' from the former
West Germany who have dropped anchor here to direct many of the
cultural events, and the ``Ossis'' who feel resentment over what
they call the ``Western conquistadors.'' Some locals feel that
their past is being misrepresented at Buchenwald and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weimar is a mythical place, our Jerusalem,'' said Volkhard
Knigge, the director of the Buchenwald memorial. ``What we have
been trying to do is sort history from myth, and show the story of
Weimar and Buchenwald are intertwined. The Goethe Society was
furious over our exhibition of drawings, but this process is
inevitably painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain, in many ways, is also that of all of Germany. The
country, a little weary of seeing its history reduced to Hitler, is
struggling to find a balance between a renewed thirst to celebrate
the great flowering of German culture in Weimar and elsewhere with
the duty to remember the Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   It is also battling with a unification process that has proved
far more difficult than expected precisely because the ``cultures''
of east and west are so divergent, and the memories of each part of
the country do not coincide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Germany now feels themselves responsible for
Goethe, for Schiller and for Beethoven _ but nobody for Himmler,''
Ignatz Bubis, the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said in an interview published in the magazine Stern last
week.
</P>
<P>
   It was an angry outburst, and a wild accusation, but it
reflected the cultural uncertainty of a country moving its center
of gravity back to Berlin from Bonn even as Germany's two
20th-century dictatorships _ Hitler's and Erich Honecker's _ are
still heatedly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere more so than in Weimar, which suffered the ravages of
both Nazism and communism with particular intensity. The name of
Goethe, synonymous with German genius, has consistently acted as a
magnet to regimes anxious to bolster their standing. ``The good and
the bad have always wanted to exploit the symbolism of this city,''
said Friedrich Folger, the deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment, six years ago, when Weimar was chosen as
Europe's cultural capital for 1999 _ the first town of the former
Soviet bloc to be so honored _ Bernd Kauffmann, the director of the
festival, was determined to break with the city's habits and treat
Weimar and Buchenwald as a single entity.
</P>
<P>
   This decision, he said, was rooted not in perversity or guilt,
but in the history that has made the alternation of eclectic
culture and narrow provincialism, avant-garde audacity and
reactionary conservatism, enlightenment and repression, perhaps the
single most distinguishing characteristic of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Bach lived here, only to clash with the ruling family and land
in prison. Goethe and Schiller came to Weimar, befriended each
other and together ushered in the ``Golden Age'' of German
literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. But by the
end of the 19th century, reactionary, anti-Semitic thinkers like
Adolf Bartels had made Weimar their home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, the Bauhaus movement was founded here in
1919, drawing the likes of Walter Gropius and Paul Klee to Weimar.
But then the narrow-mindedness of central Germany reasserted
itself, driving the Bauhaus 100 miles away to Dessau, and ushering
the Nazis to power in this region as early as the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hitler loved the place, visiting it dozens of times, trying to
make the town of Franz Liszt and Lucas Cranach a showcase of the
qualities of the German ``Volk.'' Not for nothing did he decide in
1937 to build Buchenwald a few miles from town as a prison for the
Jews, homosexuals, leftists, Gypsies and others seen as enemies of
the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ideology of the Nazis, Buchenwald was a cultural
project that belonged in Weimar,'' said Knigge, the director of the
camp memorial. ``Its purpose was to root out all that was unworthy,
all that was seen as cancerous, from German society, so that the
Volk could be united and at one in its genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The intimate ties between town and camp were graphically
illustrated in 1942 when Otto Koch, the mayor of Weimar, had the
singular idea of ordering prisoners at Buchenwald to build wooden
boxes to protect the works of Schiller and to make reproductions of
the furniture in the writer's house so that the originals could be
stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we understand how close one is to
another, how Weimar and Buchenwald are the light and dark of our
psyche,'' Kauffmann said. ``This, for me, remains a central German
theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way that theme has been illustrated has proved an
affront to some. The former Christian Democratic Interior Minister
Manfred Kanthner has called the emphasis on Buchenwald
``tiresome.'' Petra Uberhause of the Goethe Society said several of
its members were unhappy about the writer's drawings going on
display at Buchenwald, although no formal protest was made.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been fanned by the fact that both Kauffmann and
Knigge are ``Wessis,'' the former from Hamburg and the latter from
Cologne. Achim Preiss, the curator of an exhibition devoted partly
to the art of the former East German state that has prompted
outrage from ``Ossis,'' is also a westerner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the westerners cannot understand is that we also had our
birthdays, our weddings, our marriage, our moments of happiness,''
said Elvira Greiner, a city official who lived in the former
communist state. ``Not everything was the crass stupidity and lies
they portray.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the official East German ``lies'' concerned Buchenwald,
which was turned into a memorial in 1958 by the former regime at a
time when West Germany was doing its best to ignore the history of
camps like Dachau, near Munich. But the memorial was naturally
fashioned to bolster the prevailing ideology of the communist
state.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the prisoners who suffered and died in Buchenwald were all,
for the purposes of the East German regime, ``anti-Fascists'' and
Communists who fought Hitler. This was part of the story _ but said
nothing of the Jews, Gypsies and others imprisoned there, nor of
the fact that the American Army liberated Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that, from 1945 to 1952, the Soviet army used
Buchenwald as an internment camp for Germans, most of them
low-level Nazis, and that thousands died there, was also passed
over in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Knigge has now dragged all this history to the surface and is
organizing an exhibition of the ``history of memory'' at Buchenwald
since 1945 as part of the celebration of Weimar as Europe's
cultural capital. It will open in October.
</P>
<P>
   But although many applaud his efforts, the director has been
attacked by east Germans who feel that their Buchenwald has been
violated, and by some conservative west Germans who argue that the
camp should be devoted as much to the memory of Stalinism as Nazism
as a way to remember the German victims of the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   For 34 years, from 1960 to 1994, Manfred Dathe, aged 65, was the
gardener at Buchenwald. He had enough to live on, he said, and life
was secure and predictable. Then the wall fell and all certainties
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as German as the westerners, but my pension is only 80
percent of theirs,'' he said. ``Why is that? And why are all the
directors _ of the festival, the museums, this camp _ westerners?
Do they think we are incompetent?''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I lost my father on the eastern front in 1942. I
was 8. And then, when the war was over, we were told that Hitler
was bad, and the capitalists who supported him, and fascism, and of
course we believed the Communists. Now these people come here and
tell us that our history, all we learned, was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dathe shook his head in dismay. Memory in Germany remains an
insistent and divisive subject. From the camp, the organizers of
the festival have cut a path through the woods that they have
called ``Slice in Time.'' It connects Buchenwald with the beautiful
Ettersburg Castle, less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at her summer home, Duchess Anna Amalia held her ``Court
of the Muses'' between 1776 and 1780, drawing writers including
Goethe who performed in his own works.
</P>
<P>
   To leave behind Buchenwald's brick-chimneyed crematory, the
photographs of corpses piled high, the fence-posts shaped like
eternal question-marks, and to emerge _ a short time later _ from
the peaceful woods onto a soft hillside dominated by a castle where
civilization bloomed in the 18th century is to grasp something of
Germany's agonizing, and enduring, ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe's hero Faust declared, ``Two souls, alas, are housed
within my breast, and each will wrestle for mastery there.'' The
message from Weimar in this anniversary year is that the wrestling
has by no means entirely abated.

CLINTON BIDS FAREWELL TO FUND-RAISER AT MEMORIAL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Garry Mauro is cq) 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton led mourners Monday at a memorial
service for Dan Dutko, a leading lobbyist and Democratic
fund-raiser, telling the overflow crowd that the former Texas
political operative ``was one of the principal reasons I had a
chance to serve ... as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Dutko ``loved a challenge.... He stuck with me, and
I turned out to be a bigger one than he bargained for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutko, 54, died July 27 as a result of injuries from a bicycling
accident near Aspen, Colo., where he participated in major
Democratic fund-raising events attended by Clinton. Among his
companions on the ride was former Texas state Comptroller Garry
Mauro, the 1998 Democratic gubernatorial candidate and a longtime
friend of Dutko.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko, a former missiles systems engineer, got his start in
politics as West Texas manager for the ill-fated 1972 Democratic
presidential campaign of then-Sen. George S. McGovern. Clinton, who
was McGovern's manager in Texas, recalled the campaign as ``one of
our great lost causes.... That was a doozie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, for whom Dutko was raising funds for the
2000 campaign, said in a eulogy that the former House and Senate
staff member was ``a genuine friend'' and ``a great, great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore and their wives, Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Tipper Gore, were among the more than 500 friends and associates
who packed Temple Sinai. The president said he was certain the
crowd, which included Cabinet, Democratic Party and congressional
officials as well as friends and associates, was ``violating some
fire code.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation was mostly Democrats, including House Majority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri; the party's senior House member,
Rep. John Dingell of Michigan; and national party chairman Roy
Roemer, former governor of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a sprinkling of Republicans, including former
Republican National Committee Chairman Richard N. Bond and former
RNC general counsel Ben Ginsberg. One of Dutko's lobbying partners,
Ron Kaufman, an RNC member who was White House political director
under President Bush, also was present.
</P>
<P>
   Since forming the Dutko Group in 1980, after serving as chief of
staff to Rep. Robert C. Krueger, D-Texas, and Sen. Donald Stewart,
D-Ala., Dutko became a leading Democratic fund-raiser. He was
finance chairman of the 1997 Clinton-Gore inaugural and was a
co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee fund-raising drive
for the 2000 campaign when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko's firm also moved quickly to the top ranks and was among
Fortune magazine's list of top-10 lobbying firms in 1998. The
magazine called Dutko one of the ``kingmakers of national
politics.''

RENTAL CARS, COVERED OR NOT?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Orlando Airport garage, where rental cars stretch out
almost as far as a parent's eye can see, hefty sports utility
vehicles and vans stand bicep to bicep in the rear: Blazers,
Suburbans, Caravans and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   We rented a seven-passenger van, to move a chunk of our family
and its luggage at once. The price was stiff. With an extra-driver
charge, license and battery surcharges, and taxes on top, it came
to $451 for a week. But if we had purchased Avis' collision damage
waiver, which we did not because we were covered otherwise, it
would have cost $18.99 a day extra, and our total would have come
to $592. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our case, because we charged the rental on an American
Express card, we also had the alternative of letting the card cover
us for damage to or theft of the van. But if we had rented
something a little fancier, say a Chevy Sportvan instead of a
regular van, American Express would not have done this, because
neither it nor the Visa and Mastercard bank credit cards will
provide coverage for ``expensive'' or ``exotic'' cars, including
sports utility vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rising popularity of these big cars in the rental-car
fleets, convertibles, Corvettes, Jaguars and similar vehicles, is
making renters ever more aware that the credit cards are picky
about what sorts of cars _ and in what places, for that matter _
they will insure against collision damage and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Renters will have to pay $18 to $20 a day extra to buy the
collision damage waiver for the fancy cars unless they own cars of
their own for which the insurance will cover the rental. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of sport utility vehicles from the money-saving
opportunity provided to many credit-card clients is another of the
continuing changes involving the collision damage waiver, which a
New York court ruled in the 1980s was not insurance, but which is
usually called insurance anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, credit-card coverage for car rentals in
Ireland, Israel and Jamaica has virtually disappeared, as it did in
1993 in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Legislature of New York State, where sale of the
collision damage waiver has been forbidden for 11 years, has had
for most of this year a bill on the docket that would restore it.
The Enterprise car rental company, which is strong in suburbs, has
been leading this battle; other car-rental companies are strongly
averse to discussing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that is being considered puts caps on the daily
waiver charge at $9 and $12, depending on the car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights of changes in the process of insuring a
rental car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, according to Jon LeSage, an expert on the
auto-rental industry, the average daily cost of the collision
damage waiver is $15, with a range of $12 to $20, not counting
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   LeSage, research director of Abrams Travel Data Services in Long
Beach, Calif., said that across the country about 15 percent of
renters buy the waiver, which is also called the loss damage
waiver. Either way, it provides that in return for the fee the
company waives its right to recover money from the renter for
damage to the car from collision or rollover, or for theft of the
car. It does not affect liability for damage to the property of
others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While New York State has been the only state to stick with its
ban on the collision-damage waiver _ LeSage said that rental prices
did rise when the ban went into effect _ other states have put a
cap on the fee.
</P>
<P>
   In California, it is $9 a day; Illinois, which once also had a
ban, now has a cap of $9, with $12 allowed for luxury cars; Texas
has a cap of $9; Nevada, of $10. In Puerto Rico and St. Thomas,
United States Virgin Islands, the cap is $16.95, with $17.95
allowed for sports utility vehicles and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   New York State's ban is linked to a limit of $100 on the amount
a rental company can recover from a renter in case of damage; some
rental companies say this has made drivers careless. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fee charged for the waiver is linked to the value of the
car, and that is why the credit cards have decided the exposure is
too great when expensive cars are involved. American Express
includes a list, constantly in revision, of the cars it will not
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent ``FYI'' sent to card holders, effective June 1,
added the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator to the list of
excluded full-sized sports utility cars, which already identified
the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban, Tahoe and Yukon, the Toyota Land
Cruiser, Lexus LX450, the Range Rover and full-sized Ford Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few of the exotic cars _ and these are for rent by someone,
someplace _ are the Dodge Viper and Stealth, the Plymouth Prowler,
the Jaguar XIS, the Acura NSX and ``all Porsche, Ferrari,
Lamborghini, Maserati, Aston Martin, Lotus, Bugatti, Vector, Shelby
Cobra, Bentley, Rolls-Royce'' cars. This list has the classic
``including, but not limited to ...'' caveat. &QL;

   The Visa and Mastercard lists are merely suggestions of types of
cars they exclude. Diners Club covers most sports utility vehicles,
but not Ferraris, Maseratis and parallel brands. Potential renters
are advised to check on the rules: Mastercard at (800) 622-7747;
Visa at (800) 847-2911; Diners Club at (800) 234-6377 and American
Express at (800) 843-2273. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the impact of the cards' backing away from coverage in
Ireland, Israel and Jamaica? Here are some examples, with rates
quoted for mid-August. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Europe brokerage company in Portland, Maine., can
arrange rentals in all three countries. Miriam Serfes, an Auto
Europe agent, said that in Jamaica the company used Budget and
Thrifty.
</P>
<P>
   A two-door compact like a Suzuki Swift, with automatic shift,
would cost $479 for seven days. With the collision damage waiver,
the rental would cost $120 more for the week. This collision damage
waiver has a deductible of $1,000, meaning that the renter will be
responsible for as much as this if there is damage to the car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, where the broker uses Europcar, Hertz and Budget, a
four-door compact like a Ford Escort would cost $368 for seven
days. With the collision damage waiver, the cost would be about $19
more a week. Ms. Serfes said that some Visa and Mastercards still
provided the coverage in Ireland, so it is worth checking on this.
The deductible on the CDW, she said, is about $375.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where the company also uses Budget and Thrifty, a
four-door manual compact rents for $375 for a week, or $499 with
the damage waiver. In Israel, there is a deductible of $300 to
$600, depending on the car value, but this can be covered for an
added cost of $6 to $12 a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avis no longer has an affiliate in Jamaica, according to Gerard
M. Quirk, the company's vice president for international sales. In
Ireland, he said, a midsized manual car like an Opel Vectra would
rent for $351 a week. The collision damage waiver, with a
deductible of $340, would cost the equivalent of $20.60 a day. He
said that the deductible caused renters to be more careful about
damage and more alert about reporting minor dings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Quirk said, the same sort of car would rent for $294
a week, plus a daily cost of $14 for the waiver. In addition, there
is a mandatory theft protection policy costing $5 a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some basics: If a card is to serve in lieu of the waiver, the
rental must be charged on that card and the renter must decline the
waiver. If the renter owns an automobile, the coverage on a
domestic rental from most cards will be ``excess'' or
``secondary,'' meaning it will reimburse only what the renter's
regular insurance does not cover.
</P>
<P>
   This may mean just the amount of the deductible on the owner's
regular insurance. For those who do not own cars, coverage on
domestic rentals will be primary. Diners Club provides primary
coverage for all domestic rentals by holders of personal cards
except for New York State residents who own cars and rent in New
York State: Their coverage is secondary, according to Walter
Sanders, vice president for corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   On an overseas rental, the card coverage will be primary for
both those who own cars and those who do not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all cards offered by these companies provide this coverage.
American Express corporate cards do not, for example, although many
of its ``co-branded'' cards, those issued in conjunction with an
airline or hotel chain, do.
</P>
<P>
   Visa gold, platinum and Signature cards do, but not the standard
card, which Visa calls Classic. Mastercard gold, platinum and World
Cards do, but not the standard card. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you return a car and see the asterisks explaining all the
exotic fees, it may make you wish you had asked all the ``what else
will I pay'' questions at the reservation counter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the sales tax is piled on top of everything, including the
collision damage waiver. Yes, the state, town and city you have
been visiting know you probably won't be voting against the authors
of these bills in their next election.

TWO DISSIDENTS IN CHINA SENTENCED TO PRISON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese court sentenced two prominent dissidents to
lengthy prison terms on Monday, punishing them for plotting to
subvert the Communist Party's monopoly on political power.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Zha Jianguo and Gao Hongming, were sentenced by No.
1 Intermediate People's Court in Beijing to eight and nine years in
jail, respectively, the official New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   As organizers of the China Democracy Party, Zha and Gao
collaborated with Xu Wenli, a veteran dissident and leader of the
China Democracy Party, who was sentenced last December to 13 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese citizens' rights of freedom of association are
protected by law,'' the news agency reported. ``However, organizing
and plotting subversion of the state political power violates
China's Constitution and laws and shall be punished according to
law.''
</P>
<P>
   At a four-hour hearing, the court authorities ruled that the two
men took part in activities that included plans to overthrow the
government, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Zha's daughter, Zha Huiyi, 23, told Reuters after the court
session that the two men planned to appeal. But in China's legal
system, appeals are rarely accepted in political cases. Ms. Zha
said she had not been allowed to see her father since his arrest in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   Zha is a former manager of a computer design company and was
vice chairman of the China Democracy Party's Beijing branch. His
daughter said he had expected to be jailed and had readied a bag
with a toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a process, and in that process a small number of
people will be sacrificed,'' Zha said in an interview late last
year. ``We want to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we
believe that sacrifice is worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao was an office administrator before he was arrested in 1994,
when he tried to go to Tiananmen Square, the site of the
student-led pro-democracy movement in 1989, to distribute leaflets
protesting the government's violent crackdown that year, in which
hundreds of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities stamped out efforts by dissidents to form
the China Democracy Party late last year.

IN THE AIR, ON THE RAILS, CHANGES IN THE NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 8)  
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choices are growing for travel along the Boston-New
York-Washington corridor. US Airways is making some of the biggest
changes since Eastern Airlines introduced its shuttle almost 40
years ago, and Amtrak is making major improvements on its Northeast
Corridor, especially on the New York-to-Boston segment.
</P>
<P>
   The airline changes begin first. In October, US Airways, most of
whose shuttle flights depart on the hour from each of the cities,
will start replacing its Boeing 727s with Airbus A-320s. The 727s,
which Boeing has not built since 1984, have one advantage: rear
stairs, allowing passengers to exit from both ends. The A-320s will
have laptop power ports at every seat and, said Rick Weintraub, a
spokesman for the airline, a little more leg room and arm room.
They also reduce airport noise, he said, and will result in fuel
savings of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is also rebuilding its passenger lounge at La Guardia
Airport, to look more like that of its competitor, Delta. The
renovated lounge will be more of a business center, Weintraub said,
with club-style seating and table lamps, power outlets and
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has run the shuttle since 1992, at first under
contract for a group of banks that obtained it from Donald J. Trump
after he ran into financial problems. US Airways purchased the
shuttle outright in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which operates every hour on the half-hour between La
Guardia and Reagan National Airport in Washington and Logan
International Airport in Boston, still flies 727s, and has recently
added service from Reagan National to Logan every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways' bigger change is to convert its
Boston-Washington service into a shuttle, with a dedicated fleet of
planes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the leg between Boston and Washington was part of a
longer flight, which meant that the plane could be late because of
a problem in some distant city, but US Airways says that from now
on, those planes will be dedicated to that route. And they, too,
will ultimately be A-320s.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, hourly flights between Dulles Airport, 26
miles outside Washington, and Logan in Boston, and between Dulles
and La Guardia will also become shuttles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, United Airlines, which has been building up
its hub at Dulles and already flew from there to La Guardia and
Logan, recently announced it would begin doing so hourly.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is making a major move for market share on the Boston-New
York segment of the Northeast Corridor. After years of work,
construction crews are nearly finished adding electricity to the
tracks northeast of New Haven. They will be closing the last
grade-crossing in Rhode Island, just north of Kingston, and making
improvements in the remaining ones in eastern Connecticut. The
changes mean that in November or December, Amtrak will be able to
roll out the first of its new high-speed trains, called Acela
Express. By January it will have new schedules in place, and in
about a year, 20 new trains will be in service. Trip time between
New York and Boston, now four and a half hours on the fastest
trains and over five hours on slower ones, will fall to just over
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak says it carries only about 15 percent of the combined
air-rail traffic between Boston and New York because of the long
trip time, but railroad officials say that they think they could
more than double that share. The new trains will double the number
of daily seats, to 8,000 from 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Trip time between New York and Washington, now a minute under 3
hours, is expected to fall by another 16 minutes. The railroad is
counting on a new procedure for intermediate stops _ ushering the
departing passengers off through a door at one end of the car, and
boarding passengers through another _ to cut the time in the
station to a little over one minute, instead of over three minutes
now. The new trains have laptop power outlets, two audio channels
and beer on tap in the cafe car.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak still does not expect to carry many business travelers
from Washington to Boston, although it hopes for a bigger share of
those on intermediate trips, like Philadelphia to Stamford, Conn.,
or Newark to New London, Conn. The railroad will offer through
service at Penn Station in New York, rather than making Acela
Express passengers change trains there.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new trains are already in Amtrak's hands, one running
at high speed around an oval test track amid the sagebrush in
Pueblo, Colo., where it has already exceeded 160 miles per hour,
and the other undergoing tests in the Northeast. (Their top speed
in revenue service between Boston and Washington will be 150 MPH.)
The railroad has not announced pricing yet, but indicates that for
its premium service, it expects to collect a premium fare.

   Kentucky Artifacts, From Muskets to Quilts
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky History Center, a new museum and research facility
devoted to the Bluegrass State, has opened in the capital city of
Frankfort. Designed for tourists and scholars alike, the
167,000-square-foot center, the home of the Kentucky Historical
Society, has exhibition galleries, a research library, conservation
facilities and a gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The center's permanent exhibit, ``A Kentucky Journey,'' traces
the history of the state through 14 interactive displays and more
than 3,000 artifacts, including an 18th-century Brown Bess musket
and a white silk boxing robe donated by Muhammad Ali, who was born
in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   A number of artifacts date from the period just after 1775, the
year in which Daniel Boone blazed the Wilderness Trail through the
Cumberland Gap and Kentucky became the first gateway for westward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 19, the center will present an exhibit titled
``Warm Memories: Quilts from Kentucky Collections.'' Among the 34
historical and contemporary quilts are some on loan from Kentucky
museums and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Included are the modern Celebration Quilt, sewn by Kentuckians
from each of the state's 120 counties, and Elizabeth Roseberry
Mitchell's 1839 Graveyard Quilt, featuring coffin-shaped pieces of
fabric labeled with relatives' names that Mitchell would move to
the quilt's central ``graveyard'' when there was a death in her
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky History Center, 100 West Broadway, Frankfort, (877)
444-7867, is closed Sunday and Monday. Admission is free. &QL;

   Web Sites Guide Those Taking a Dip in Europe
</P>
<P>
   For tips on the cleanest places to swim in Europe, there is no
shortage of studies and reports classifying freshwater and
saltwater beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the annual list published by the Foundation for
Environmental Education in Europe, which awarded nearly 2,500
beaches and marinas in 21 European countries the 1999 European Blue
Flag seal of approval, indicating the beaches have high
environmental standards (based on the previous year's water data,
with ongoing periodic checks) as well as good sanitary and safety
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   France had the highest number of such beaches, 399, followed by
Spain (390), Greece (318), Denmark (176), Portugal (115) and Italy
(98). Germany had only 26 sea beaches approved, but the country has
a relatively short coastline, a spokesman for the organization
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The French Mediterranean coast, long scorned as overpopulated
and polluted, has repaired its image and now boasts the largest
number of Blue Flag beaches in France. Detailed results of all
French beaches are accessible (in French only) on the Internet at
www.reinet.asso.fr. The Blue Flag site in English,
www.blueflag.org, lists 21 countries. (Click on ``Questions and
Answers,'' then ``Previous Questions and Answers.'')
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complete rankings of European beaches is the
European Commission's annual bathing report, which uses data
collected the previous year to classify freshwater and seaside
beaches in 15 countries. The report can be seen at the Internet
site europa.eu.int/water/water-bathing/tourist.html.
</P>
<P>
   Classifications of bathing spots generally range from
noncompliant with ``mandatory values,'' to compliant with mandatory
values or, in the best case, compliant with ``guide values.'' A
small number are listed as banned, where bathing is temporarily
prohibited, and some are unclassified because of insufficient data.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist atlas, a link from the home page, makes it easy to
survey a general area, such as the Algarve in Portugal. The rating
of each beach since 1991 is posted alongside its current rating, so
it is possible to chart a beach's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Airline Starts New York Service
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans are likely to have heard of AirEurope, even though
the Italian airline is almost 10 years old. But it may soon lose
its anonymity, now that it has begun six flights a week between New
York and Venice and Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   To help spread the word, it is offering a round-trip fare of
$425 between Kennedy International Airport in New York and either
Italian city through next month. Tickets must be purchased by Aug.
30 and other restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned AirEurope has flown mainly charter flights
for tour operators in Italy on trips to the Caribbean, the United
States and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled service was added to Havana and Mauritius in 1997. In
March _ following a nearly 50 percent investment in AirEurope last
fall by the SAir Group, the parent company of Swissair and Crossair
_ AirEurope began daily flights to Zurich from Bologna, Turin and
Venice. In May, it added flights from Milan to several destinations
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   AirEurope obtained the rights to six of the seven flight
frequencies between the United States and Italy that became
available in November under the Open Skies aviation liberalization
agreement between the two countries. Reservations: (888) 999-9090.

   New Guidebook Roams Beyond the Reichstag
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall, and just as the
German government makes its historic move back to its old capital,
a book has been published that will guide tourists beyond the newly
restored Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gate, the shop-lined
Kurfurstendamm, the Pergamon Museum and the other usual sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little-Known Museums In and Around Berlin,'' by Rachel Kaplan
(Abrams, $19.95), highlights 30 often overlooked artistic, cultural
and historical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the Film Museum, on two floors of the
former royal stables in Potsdam. It tells the story of Babelsberg,
once ``the Hollywood of Continental Europe,'' which produced as
many as 650 films a year. Relics include the clutch bag and
dressing gown belonging to Marlene Dietrich, who made ``Blue
Angel'' there.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of Prehistory and Early History, visitors will see
artifacts discovered by Heinrich Schliemann during his excavations
of ancient Troy and weapons, implements and jewelry unearthed
during the construction of Berlin's Autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   Other entries in ``Little-Known Museums'' include the Brucke
Museum, with its collection of works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and
other German Expressionist painters; the Brohan Museum, with its
cache of Art Nouveau objects; Pfaueninsel, a 200-acre historic
castle and garden estate; and the Zucker Museum, which tells how
sugar in the industrial world came to be made from beets (rather
than from cane imported from the tropics).
</P>
<P>
   The paperback book includes descriptions and photographs of the
museums, along with addresses, phone numbers, opening hours, travel
directions and a locator map. Ms. Kaplan, the author, also wrote
``Little-Known Museums in and Around Paris'' and ``Little-Known
Museums in and Around London.''

   A 20th-Century Art Display In a Medieval Dungeon
</P>
<P>
   An hour north of Paris, in the medieval dungeon where Joan of
Arc sought shelter on the eve of her capture, visitors can view a
collection of 20th-century art gathered to celebrate the solar
eclipse that takes place on Wednesday. The exhibition at the
Dungeon of Vez _ in the Picardie region near the city of Senlis _
will be on display through Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors climb to the top floor of the 81-foot-high dungeon
discovering contemporary and modern art. Among the exhibits is a
tower of 1,256 Champagne glasses, assembled in the dungeon's chapel
by the German artist Marcus Hansen. In the crypt, a magician named
Damania does disappearing acts with a display of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Above, in the library, sun and moon lithographs by Miro, a
Braque painting and a Calder wood sculpture are successively
illuminated by a collection of lights spanning 20 years of design.
In another room, Jacqueline Dauriac, a contemporary French artist,
has made a mirror with a hole in the center titled ``When I Smile,
You Smile Back.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is one of those organized each year at the
dungeon by Francis Briest, a Paris auctioneer who bought it in
1988. Visitors are also free to roam the underground galleries and
stroll in the gardens and apple orchard with its permanent
collection of Bourdelle sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open daily. Admission is $6.30 (at 6 francs to the
dollar), free for children under 12. The dungeon is off Highway A1;
it can be reached by train from the Gare du Nord in Paris.

   NAGO, Japan _ When Japan's prime minister announced recently
that the site of the conference of leading industrial nations next
year would be this charming little city in Okinawa, the mayor
danced a jig at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected our city to be chosen, so I did what all
Okinawans do when we are happy,'' the mayor, Tateo Kishimoto, said.
``I danced and I danced and I danced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little different from the rest of Japan. We are not
afraid to show our emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much to celebrate. Okinawa, Japan's poorest
prefecture, seemed a long shot for staging a meeting of such
international importance. Tokyo was the site of three previous
summit meetings of the world's wealthiest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the central government and Okinawa, once a
separate kingdom, have never been great, and Okinawans have long
opposed the American military bases in the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's decision to hold the economic
summit meeting here is widely viewed as a shrewd political move to
stimulate Okinawa's stalled economy and to make progress on
long-disputed plans to reduce the U.S. military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of Word War II, Okinawa was the site of a fierce
battle between Japanese and American soldiers in which more than
200,000 people, including civilians, were killed. Under a 1951
peace treaty, Okinawa was placed under the authority of the U.S.
military, which established vast bases on the island. Okinawa
reverted to Japanese rule in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   There are many logistical and political hurdles to overcome if
the summit conference, scheduled for next July, is to be
successful. There is much that can go wrong. For starters, Okinawa,
an island prefecture of 1.2 million people, lacks the
transportation, hotel, communications and security demanded by an
event of the conference's size.
</P>
<P>
   While Tokyo is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build
new conference halls, widen roads and install advanced
telecommunications, conference organizers still worry about whether
necessary preparations can be completed on time.
</P>
<P>
   The main site will be here in Nago at the Okinawa International
Friendship Hall, which is under construction on a striking cape.
Nago, which has a population of 55,000, is in the center of the
main island. But the main airport is a two-hour drive away in Naha,
the capital of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are considering using helicopters to ferry heads of
state from the airport to the main conference site, but they are
also concerned that typhoon season will be under way. While several
U.S. military airfields are closer to Nago than the public airport,
Okinawa officials are reluctant to use them.
</P>
<P>
   For Okinawa, the potential economic benefits of holding the
summit conference are huge. Okinawa officials estimate that 7,000
people will visit for the conference, generating hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from the mainland and long dependent on the military
bases and Tokyo for subsidies, Okinawa has the country's highest
unemployment (6 percent), lowest household savings rate and lowest
per capita income (about $18,000, or 70 percent of the national
average).
</P>
<P>
   Morisada Maeshiro, an economics professor at the University of
Ryukyus in Okinawa, said that if handled properly, the conference
would provide Okinawa with a prime opportunity to expand its
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit is a sort of coming-out party for Okinawa,'' he
said. ``If we show the world a good time, that could mean millions
of dollars in future revenues in repeat business and a chance to
become less financially dependent on the national government and
the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Okinawans said that by holding the conference here, the
national government was pressing them to choose between economic
development and accepting the American bases, which comprise
one-fifth of the land in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the bases issue is an agreement between the
United States and Japan to relocate the Marine Corps Futenma Air
Station, which is in the middle of a residential area in Ginowan.
Residents complain that the noise from military aircraft makes
living in Ginowan almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two governments agreed to replace the air
station, a nuisance to local residents, with a sea-based site off
the coast of Nago, but that plan was rejected by the prefecture
government. Several other options are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by local newspapers showed that 65 percent of
registered voters in Okinawa want the Futenma station relocated
outside the prefecture, a move that U.S. military officials have
said is unfeasible because the air station needs to be close to
Marine ground operations.
</P>
<P>
   If the matter is not resolved before the start of the summit
meeting, President Clinton could face protests from local residents
when he arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy that the summit is being held here and we want to
show the world our wonderful prefecture,'' said Yasuhiro Miyagi, a
Nago city councilman, ``but if the government forces us to accept a
new Futenma air base in Okinawa, we will disrupt the summit with
protests.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Okinawa residents said that they wanted to express their
concerns about the military bases directly to Clinton and that they
hoped he would hold a town hall meeting during the summit
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, many Okinawans said, is that the islanders
use the summit meeting to introduce the world to their culture and
way of life, which they maintain are not typically Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans are descendants of the inhabitants of the Ryukyus
kingdom, which became part of Japan in 1879. Because of the
Ryukyus' trade links with Taiwan, China and Thailand, Okinawans
have developed their own distinct cultural forms, dialect and
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional Japanese society is very rigid and hierarchical,
based on one's status,'' said Etsuko Ashimine, a local resident.
``Okinawan society is vertical. We are warmer and more friendly
than people on the mainland. We are proud to be Japanese, but we
are different.''

   It may be hard for the been-there-done-that crowd to believe,
but there really are some intriguing places out there that may have
escaped their detection. Industry professionals and three
well-traveled writers share their thoughts on what could be the
next place to go.
</P>
<P>
   TONY WHEELER, a founder and director of the Lonely Planet
guidebook series: ``Krakow with its wonderful historical
architecture, is set to become the next Prague. ... Syria has great
potential. Friendly people, good food, and all sorts of historical
elements like Roman ruins and Crusader castles. ... The Philippines
don't get as much attention as they should, but there are beautiful
beaches and good scuba-diving, and the sheer number of islands is
good for people who want to go island hopping. And in the north, in
Banaue, there are those beautiful rice terraces, thousands of years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   SARA WHEELER, travel writer, author of ``Terra Incognita:
Travels in Antarctica'': ``I'm amazed that tourists always go to
the same places in India. The waves of change that have swept
through India in the last decade haven't seemed to have landed in
the state of Orissa. It's a wholly unknown India, very tribal, with
hill tracts back from the coast where the tribes live. You can
barter for jewelry and tribal artifacts and have your dinner cooked
over an open fire. ... Chilean Patagonia is another place. Most of
Patagonia is in Argentina, but this part is relatively
inaccessible. Thousands of miles of mountains and lakes. Very
silent. Great walking. Fantastic trout fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ALISTAIR BALLANTINE, president of Abercrombie &AMP; Kent: ``I see a
growing interest in Laos. It's one of those time-warped
destinations. Luang Prabang, in particular, is an unspoiled city.
... In Africa people are looking more at Botswana and Namibia. If
you're insecure about safety in East or South Africa, Botswana's
game parks are a great alternative. You go to Namibia for the
scenery, the sand dunes on the Skeleton Coast. ... If you're
knowledgeable you'll go to Croatia this summer, despite Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   PAM HOUSTON, short-story writer, essayist and traveler, author
of ``Waltzing the Cat'': ``In America everything has been
discovered in a way, and places seem to be more and more the same.
I look for places that have maintained their character, like
southwestern Nebraska. I spent a few days there once. I was on my
way to Colorado from Provincetown. Near Scottsbluff, I saw little
farmhouses on huge amounts of acreage. There were big white bluffs
with rivers running through them, huge thunderclouds and that
late-afternoon prairie light. It was magical. I was only three
hours from Denver, but I stayed for a few days. ... In Alaska,
there is the Brooks Range. I've been dog-sledding there. You're so
far north at that point that there are no trees. A beautiful,
bizarre landscape: white mountains, white sky, white rivers. It was
the most vast, wilderness feeling I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   JIM SANO, president of Geographic Expeditions, a tour company
based in San Francisco: ``Saudi Arabia is relaxing its rules for
leisure travelers. We're not seeing a huge amount of interest yet,
but as word gets out, we expect more. There are archaeological
sights there that rival Petra. ... Interest in Iran has grown
tremendously. There were hiccups in the last few weeks with the
riots, so we're in a wait-and-see mode. We have a hiking and
camping trip there in September. Most people don't know there are
peaks in Iran over 18,000 feet high.''
</P>
<P>
   PAUL THEROUX, novelist, travel writer, author of ``Sir Vidia's
Shadow'': ``I see travel as an experience of time, not so much of
place, but of situations, people. The place I would most like to go
to is the southern part of Nyasaland in 1964. I was there in 1964.
It was a peaceable kingdom. Remote. No fax machines. Wonderful.
Looks like getting there will be a challenge.''

LACK OF DIVERSITY BLAME AS PLAIN AS PIGMENT ON HOLLYWOOD'S FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The hue and cry over the hue of guys and gals
on your TV screen has subsided for a while. The nation's television
critics are heading home from their summer sojourn in Southern
California, and the producers of programming can enjoy at least a
momentary respite from reflexively covering their exposed _ and
very pale _ flanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 days, it seemed as if a mass revival of the
macarena craze had swept the TV industry, though the urge to
protect one's assiduously toned glutes is understandable when 200
or more cranky critics are taking aim. It's not that we're
incapable of achieving diversity in our questions, although sitting
through six to 10 news conferences a day for three weeks has been
known to cause brain damage in laboratory pundits. It's more that
we need to hear the answer from the lips of each network suit and
each executive producer in succession, because we certainly
wouldn't want to put words in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Having now heard from every precinct, it does seem that all
these ostensibly creative people _ most of them male and almost all
of them white _ employ the same speech writer. For, with minor
modifications, the standard response to the ``diversity question''
these past few weeks has been: ``We are fully committed to
colorblind casting. It is an absolute priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do so many of the new fall shows look like something
from the ``White Bread Theatre'' highlight reel? Why are there 38
new prime-time shows on the six networks (41, if you count Pax TV)
and only 12 in which people of color have principal roles? (And
four of those 12 are on tiny UPN.)
</P>
<P>
   True, minorities make up about 29 percent of the U.S. population
and, as it happens, 29 percent of the new shows have a minority
player in a prominent role. But having significant minority
representation on 29 percent of the new shows shouldn't be anyone's
idea of proper balance in casting. An average of 29 percent
minorities in each cast would be more like it. Sure, there are
shows that will, of necessity, skew all-white, just as there are
some that should skew all-black or all-Asian or all-Hispanic or all
French-Canadian. But if TV is at least partly about art imitating
life, having a target to shoot at can't be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one explanation from Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of the
ABC Entertainment Television Group, on why networks miss the
target: ``When you get into picking pilots and casting them, you're
looking for the best casting possible, and sometimes, in the speed
of that, you don't recognize the larger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg and Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment,
say this was apparently the case with their own network's new fall
lineup, and they realized ``we had to make some changes'' even
before the NAACP rose up last month and decried the lack of color
in the major network's fall offerings. Last week, the National
Hispanic Foundation for the Arts issued similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The cast changes involve adding people of color to some new and
returning shows _ NBC has said it will do the same thing _ but it's
not as if Michael J. Fox, the star of ``Spin City,'' is being
replaced by, say, Eddie Murphy or Paul Rodriguez or Garrett Wang.
</P>
<P>
   The additions, for the most part, are in supporting roles, which
is certainly better than bubkes for all the black, Hispanic and
Asian American actors who've been waiting years to see their TV
opportunities improve. But major roles for minority actors remain
scarcer than dark hairs on my chinny chin chin. And the standing
joke at the TV critics' summer press tour in Pasadena was that all
of this season's new shows actually have actors of color in them,
they just don't appear in the pilot episodes.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a common excuse offered by producers that it
instantly suggests that TV pilots, which are essentially sales
tools, are better received by advertisers when the shows' casts are
perceived to be all white. Every network executive denies this, but
the suspicion will persist until the pilots show a little
multicultural casting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bloomberg's argument about hiring the best actor
possible is also suspect, because he's implying that, for quite
some time, white actors have been flat-out better than people of
color in just about every casting scenario, save for the ensemble
shows set in urban locales. Since this isn't true in any other
field of endeavor, it's not likely to be true in the acting
profession, yet the most common refrain from producers is: ``We
chose the best person for the part.''
</P>
<P>
   What most of them don't say, possibly because they're
backpedaling faster than a Wallenda on a wire, is something
Jonathan Prince disclosed in a briefing session for ``Grown Ups,''
a comedy he's producing for UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you write a script,'' Prince said, ``unless you
(specifically) write the minority that the person is, it is assumed
that that person can or might be white, and that's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince, who is white, cast Jaleel White, who is black, in the
lead role of ``Grown Ups.'' The guy who plays White's best friend,
Dave Ruby, is white. Prince says Ruby got the part not because of
his race _ the show isn't about race relations _ but because ``he
just happens to be the funniest little fat guy around.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris Barclay, an African American and the acclaimed director of
the ``NYPD Blue'' episode in which Jimmy Smits' character, Bobby
Simone, died last season, says the short answer to the diversity
question is simplistic, but nonetheless quite real: ``Most of the
people who develop and oversee network television shows are white
males who live in Malibu, Brentwood or Bel Air. They don't know a
lot of black people and they're not interested in really writing
those kinds of characters. They never grew up with them. They're
not familiar with them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Steven Bochco, Barclay is co-creator of ``City of Angels,''
an ensemble drama about a hospital in the heart of inner-city Los
Angeles scheduled for midseason on CBS. Most of the cast members
will be black, Hispanic or Asian, and at least two-thirds of the
production crew will be made up of minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay said half of the writers on the series are African
American. None has been on a writing staff before. But he said
Bochco is mentoring this new group of writers, from whom other
series will most likely spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (`NYPD Blue' producer) David Milch about
this,'' Barclay said, ``and we were just batting about how can it
happen that there could be so many shows developed with young white
kids who are in prep school. And he said, basically, people are
afraid. They're afraid of what they don't know, and if you don't
know a lot of different people, you're not going to write them,
you're not going to invite them to be in the room with you to
create the shows, and the shows aren't going to get on the air
because they're not going to be the things that the networks have
to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay, of course, is stating the obvious. But sometimes it's
the obvious that what we fear the most.

PELOSI MOUNTS CAMPAIGN FOR MAJORITY WHIP

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced Monday that she would
seek the post of majority whip, the No. 3 slot in the House
leadership, if the Democrats win control of the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, D-Calif., said ``it's about time'' a woman won an
elected leadership post in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to break into the leadership,'' Pelosi said in an
interview. ``We're very optimistic that we can win. The response
has been excellent. It's going exceedingly well. I'm very confident
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would need a net gain of six seats to take control of
the House, assuming that the lone independent, Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, continues to vote with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi wouldn't divulge how many commitments of support she has
won from other Democrats for the secret-ballot vote that will take
place a week after the November 2000 election, if the Democrats
gain a majority, but said she was ``closing in'' on the number she
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the current minority
leader, would likely become speaker if the Democrats take control
of the House, and Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, now the
minority whip, would likely become majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of unseating Tom DeLay is one that I'll look
forward to,'' she said, referring to the Texas Republican who is
the current majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a co-chairman of the Democratic
Steering Committee, and John Lewis of Georgia, one of several chief
deputy whips, also have said they would run for the whip post,
which involves lobbying members to round up votes for legislation,
carving out an agenda and presenting the party's views to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, 59, has represented the San Francisco area for seven
terms and is a former chairwoman of the California Democratic
Party. Politics runs in her family. Her father, Thomas J.
D'Alesandro Jr., was a representative from Maryland and served as
mayor of Baltimore for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she started calling representatives last year to
gauge their support for her bid when she thought Democrats might
win a majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If Pelosi were elected majority whip, she would become the
highest ranking woman ever in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida now holds the No. 5 leadership
post as vice chairwoman of the Republican House Conference, an
appointed post formerly held by Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington
state and former Rep. Susan Molinari of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi is quick to add that she ``is not running as a woman,''
but that as a mother of five and a grandmother, she thinks she has
a lot to offer. ``Women across the country are very encouraged to
see women making decisions that affect their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she believes the country won't elect a woman
president until they see other women in other leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get people to think in different ways to vote for
a woman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message would be very clear,'' Pelosi said. ``There's a
woman to be reckoned with that could help to pave the way for other
women.''

</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Pelosi said, Democratic Reps. Loretta L.
Sanchez of California, Janice D. Schakowsky of Illinois and Gary
Condit of California have organized dinners with 12 to 20 other
lawmakers to help her drum up support. She said Democratic Reps.
Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Nita Lowey of New York are planning
to host dinners for her soon.
</P>
<P>
   She brushed aside criticism that she has started her campaign
too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate I have ever seen be successful is the one who
started early,'' she said, adding ``My supporters were getting
eager to start something going ... I want to clear to deck of it,
do it and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she decided to run for a top leadership post after
former Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., now a lobbyist, decided to step
down as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for this to try to bring the fresh open approach
of California to leadership in Congress,'' Pelosi said. ``In
California, you think differently. It's in the water. You're not
wedded to old assumptions. It's just that this place isn't as
forward thinking or focused on the future as I think it should
be.''

   DROUGHT-FARMERS (Frederick, Md.) _ After the television

``What a lot of... spin _ that's the right word, isn't it?'' the
family's matriarch, Janice Harshman, asked as the clutch of federal

dust. Speaking to about 40 troubled farmers gathered here for a
news conference, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declared West
Virginia and parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania and
Virginia a drought disaster area and promised low-interest loans
for farmers. ``I sure don't need any more loans,'' Vaughn Harshman
said. ``We need a fair market and fair playing field,'' he said. By

   WEIMAR-EUROPE (Weimar, Germany) _ Always a crucible of the best
and worst in Germany, this small town has emerged a decade after
the fall of the Berlin wall as a focus of national questioning and
conflict. This year is the 250th anniversary of the birth of
Weimar's most distinguished son, Goethe. The town was selected by
European ministers as the continent's ``cultural capital'' for
1999. But the town _ home to Schiller and to Nietzche, birthplace
of the Bauhaus _ is adjacent to the Buchenwald concentration camp,
where more than 50,000 people were killed. By Roger Cohen. (MOVED)

1,200 BID FAREWELL TO KEVIN DIAL, SON OF FOOTBALL GREAT, AT
MEMORIAL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ More than 1,200 friends and family members gathered
Monday to remember Kevin Dial, 36, son of football legend Buddy
Dial and one of 12 people slain by a day trader in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was my closest friend and I loved him more than anything
in the world,'' said Sherri Dial, who remembered her older brother
as a role model who was generous and possessed a quick wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please share your thoughts of Kevin with us, don't forget
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dial, an office manager for Houston-based Momentum Securities,
was one of nine people shot to death Thursday at two stock-trading
firms by Mark Orrin Barton, 44, who killed himself as police
cornered him.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's wife and two children were later found beaten to death
with a hammer in their suburban Atlanta apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a former chemist, had lost $105,000 last month in day
trading, but left no explanation for his killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened that morning in Atlanta was not God's will,''
said Dr. Richard O'Brien, director of prayer ministry at Second
Baptist Church in west Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not punishment for wrongs done, nor was it an act of an
angry God. It was the evil heart of one man, no matter what the
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our place nor our purpose here today to dissect this
horrible event, nor to pass our judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Texas, Dial had moved from
Tyler, Texas, to Atlanta about a year ago to open a new branch of
Momentum. He had longed to return to Houston and was scheduled to
return this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Dial said she remembered how her brother put people at
ease with his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure you're with Elvis, having cocktails, trying to
convince God to let (John) Belushi visit,'' she said. ``I'm sure
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the family stated, ``As a family we are
devastated by the loss of our son and brother to this tragedy.
Kevin was a unique individual adored by his friends and family,
appreciated for his contagious humor and sheer joy of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that special ability to lift all those around him to
provide humor when it was needed. He made everyone he came in
contact with feel special and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   About 19 months ago, Dial was diagnosed with an inoperable brain
tumor and was under medication to prevent seizures.
</P>
<P>
   He was buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Dial, 62, was an All-American at Rice University before
playing football for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1959 to 1963 and
the Dallas Cowboys from 1964 to 1966. &QL;

TALKS STALL BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinians and the new Israeli government of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak clashed openly for the first time on
Monday as they traded blame for an abrupt break-off of negotiations
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, over Israeli troop withdrawals called for by the
latest land-for-security deal with the Palestinians, echoed the
recriminations exchanged during the tenure of Barak's right-wing
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians accused the Israelis of trying to wriggle out
of a signed agreement. The Israelis charged that the Palestinians
were playing tough for their own public and trying to draw American
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said there was ``an
attempt to avoid'' Israeli withdrawals. A member of the Palestinian
Cabinet, Nabil Amr, said, ``There is a real crisis now.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Barak's office accused the Palestinians of
``inflexibility,'' and the prime minister told reporters during a
visit to Moscow that he expected the Palestinians to consider his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every attempt to make this path more difficult or to put up
obstacles bewilders us,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said the crisis was manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is interested in creating an atmosphere of crisis and
drama,'' Levy told the Israeli radio. ``Someone thinks that by
creating a drama, a third party will come and decide. That's not
the way to cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute flared over Barak's proposal to delay troop
withdrawals in the West Bank that are called for by the Wye River
memorandum, the agreement signed near Washington in October.
</P>
<P>
   The accord requires Israel to withdraw in three stages from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures. Netanyahu carried out the first stage but suspended the
rest, charging that the Palestinians had not kept their part of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to concede territory before negotiations start on a
permanent peace, Barak has suggested that the last troop withdrawal
be postponed until after talks begin on a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with Barak last week, Arafat agreed to a two-week
pause for consideration of the Israeli ideas, with representatives
of both sides carrying on the discussions. Barak said that changes
would be made only with Palestinian consent and that he was
committed to carrying out the accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat's cabinet, meeting on Friday night, rejected any
changes in the Wye accord, and Palestinian officials called the
two-week postponement a waste of time, insisting that the agreement
be carried out fully and without delay.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, a meeting between the Israeli representative,
Gilad Sher, and the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat,
broke up in disagreement, and the Palestinian team was summoned for
consultations with Arafat, who was in Cairo. A Palestinian official
said there were differences ``over the timetable, the content of
implementation and the manner of implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Monday in Gaza, Arafat accused the
Israelis of breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms what I have said from the beginning, that this
is an attempt to avoid the accurate and honest implementation of
what has been agreed upon,'' Arafat said, repeating a mantra that
he often voiced during quarrels with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who in a meeting of his cabinet on Sunday estimated that
that he could start carrying out the Wye agreement on Oct. 1,
criticized the Palestinian position in the statement issued by his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The statement expressed ``surprise that the Palestinians are
avoiding an examination together of ways to implement the Wye
memorandum more successfully for both sides, while combining it
with the negotiations on a permanent settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is proposing real progress, while the Palestinians are
responding with inflexibility, apparently for internal
consumption,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Tibi, an Israeli-Arab member of Parliament and a former
adviser to Arafat, said Palestinian officials could not understand
why Barak, a leader of the left-leaning Labor Party, was unwilling
to carry out an agreement signed by his right-wing predecessor,
Netanyahu, and approved by many rightist lawmakers in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has argued that the final phase of the withdrawal, from an
area around Hebron, could leave Jewish settlements exposed, risking
violence and domestic political resistance that could hurt efforts
to reach a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before his election, however, Barak argued against
handing over too much territory to the Palestinians as part of the
Oslo interim accords, asserting that such areas should be kept as a
bargaining chip in future negotiations on a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Haaretz in 1996, for
instance, Barak said such hand-overs ``transfer very many cards to
the Palestinians'' that are ``vital assets we'll want to demand in
the negotiations on a permanent settlement.''

COATES INJURES KNEE DURING PRACTICE DRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Ben Coates went down in the morning session
of Patriots camp Monday and lay still for a few moments before
lifting his big No. 87 off the ground. The tight end suffered a
knee injury during a simple drill and underwent an MRI in the
afternoon, the results of which should be known Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, the vulnerability of the team passed before
everyone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Bruce Armstrong and Drew Bledsoe huddled over
Coates until he got back to his feet, a sign that this team holds
its breath every time it steps on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The thought process began. Who could replace Coates? Rod
Rutledge? Mike Bartrum? Just a few plays after Coates went down,
Bartrum also suffered a knee injury, and suddenly the Patriots were
down to John Lumpkin, a 6-foot-7-inch former center on the Ohio
State basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Coates missed the afternoon practice and is sure to miss more
time, while Bartrum missed the afternoon practice but was on hand
on the sidelines. This after rookie tight end Devon Smith suffered
a major knee injury on the first day of camp.
</P>
<P>
   The first few days of camp have shown that the Patriots are
again only an injury or two away from not living up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   They may have smart, experienced, and high-production veterans,
but they also are young. They don't have adequate alternatives if
the Willie McGinests and Terry Glenns of the world go down again
and the Damien Woodys, Andy Katzenmoyers, and Kevin Faulks aren't
dominating players right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the effects of the Willie Clay release will linger
here for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clay was cut, a day has not gone by when Ty Law hasn't
spoken to Pete Carroll and Bobby Grier about bringing Clay back.
</P>
<P>
   While there is optimism about the way Chris Carter and Tony
George have performed in camp so far, they are works in progress
and may not be ready when the season opener rolls around Sept. 12.
Any glitch against the experienced and battle-ready New York Jets
could be decisive, especially with Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne
Chrebet floating around.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the Patriots need some things to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A defensive line that holds its breath on McGinest must come up
with a ``surprise'' player. The Patriots had a nice rotation last
season with seven interchangeable linemen. Then Brandon Mitchell,
McGinest, Ferric Collons, and Mark Wheeler went down with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is currently battling Chris Sullivan for the starting
defensive end job and is expected to win it, with Sullivan used
both outside and inside. But the player who could give the Patriots
depth and a ``surprise'' in case McGinest went down is Sterling
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was a four-year starter at defensive end for the
Washington Redskins until knee injuries knocked him out of the
game. He sat for 2 1/2 years until he had a revelation while
watching TV one day at home in Fort Lauderdale:
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching TV and seeing those guys out there making a hell of a
lot of money and me saying to myself, `These guys are bums!' I just
took it to heart. It took a year of just watching games every
Sunday to realize I need someone to give me another chance. I kept
watching Charles Haley with the 49ers and thinking how he came back
from serious back injuries, and I said, `Somebody's got to give me
a chance.' I hooked up with an agent, and we took it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Palmer played for the Redskins, Patriots defensive backs
coach Ron Lynn was Washington's defensive coordinator. Lynn
remembers Palmer as being much heavier. Palmer, who is at 270
pounds now, used to be 297. He was more of a run-stopper with
Washington but now appears to be a player who is quick around the
edge and can pass-rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take a lot of crap from people on or off the field,
and that's probably gotten me into a lot of trouble here and there,
but now I'm here and ready to learn things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer has had ACL and arthroscopic procedures on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was over,'' he said. ``Once I got up and got
going after my knee injury in Washington, they killed me. I went to
Philly and the guys there said, `Well, we don't know if he can make
it through half a season.' They were saying I might not hold up. I
just packed up my bags, threw them in my truck, and went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington I started for four years, so I'm not going to
lay down and have someone beat me to death out there. So if I don't
feel I can go, I'll just go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm aggressive here and there, but the schemes are
new so I'm a little tentative. This is the third day after sitting
for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary, if Carter and George aren't ready, veteran
Larry Whigham could be the guy. And if none of them can do it,
perhaps the Patriots will have Lawyer Milloy play free safety and
move Tebucky Jones to strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a surprising player in the secondary has been Kato
Serwanga, who spent time on the practice squad last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive line, all eyes are on Woody. And head coach
Pete Carroll, who needs Woody to be all-world right away, has
decided to hit him with a combination of Henry Thomas and Chad
Eaton for two practices each day.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who is in his 13th training camp, is not taking it easy
on the kid. ``He needs to work on everything,'' said Thomas. ``I've
been up against a lot of centers in my career. Dermontti Dawson is
probably the best. All of the great centers have quickness. Damien
has good quickness, and I can see what made him a No. 1 draft pick.
He's got good hands, good feet. He does a good job balancewise, and
on the running plays, he does a great job of getting out and
getting the linebackers. Once he gets the technique down and
understands the game, he'll be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has had good moments and bad. During a blocking drill
against linebackers, he was beaten repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   And if there's a candidate for ``surprise player'' among
receivers, it would be Sean Morey. The seventh-round pick has
caught everything in sight and is starting to look like the second
coming of Randy Vataha.
</P>
<P>
   If veteran players are to be dismissed and injuries begin to
stack up, the Patriots must get lucky to stay good. If they can't
accelerate the performance level of their young veterans and
rookies or come up with a ``find,'' it could be another vulnerable
season at Foxboro.

AUTHOR SAYS FEAR IS MORE PERCEPTION THAN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Barry Glassner, professor of sociology at
University of Southern California and author of ``The Culture of
Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things,'' didn't know
whether to laugh or to cry. He was on a cable station panel talking
about the shootings at a Colorado high school when a specialist on
school safety took center stage to list a series of strange weapons
youngsters were bringing to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the course of this, she said she was doing some
research and had determined people with the last name of `Harris'
tend to commit these kinds of crimes most often,'' Glassner said in
a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``I spoke up immediately,
jumped right in ... but the host didn't even raise an eyebrow.
Nobody else said a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the video to prove this actually happened ... people
named `Harris' ... It was a great example of how this feverish
media fear-mongering results in a bizarre laundry list of people
and things we should be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner reeled off a list of those fears in the wake of the
Littleton shooting, including ``the Internet, video games, movies
and TV shows, Marilyn Manson, male teen-agers in general, guns,
and, oh yeah ... day care.''
</P>
<P>
   The list changes and grows daily, Glassner explained, depending
on what the media decide is the hottest scare topic of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Glassner, whose ``Culture of Fear'' (just out from Basic Books)
points to this nation's unrealistic fears, said fear-mongering has
always been with us, in some way.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s and '40s were filled with scare stories, from random
kidnappings and gruesome murders to Orson Welles' 1938 radio
adaption of ``War of the Worlds,'' which left large sections of the
country trembling.
</P>
<P>
   But today the fear is heightened, Glassner suggests, ``by highly
competitive 24-hour news stations that run with every frightening
story and every frightening image for as long as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrage of coverage of the death of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
with its asides about the dangers of flying in small planes, is
just the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you've got the network (news) magazines,'' the professor
added, ``where there are basically two methods to gain viewers:
one, celebrity interviews _ celebrity scandals, really _ and two,
`the scare of the week.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me particularly was the aftermath of Columbine,''
Glassner said, referring to the name of the high school in Colorado
where 15 students, including the two gunmen, died. ``It was an
obvious tragedy and I don't want to minimize it, but look what came
out of that one, isolated incident _ there are now scares about
killer kids running rampant in schools, at a time when youth
homicide rates have declined by 45 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Money being spent to make schools safer in the wake of Columbine
could be used to rebuild deteriorating campuses, buy books and
otherwise increase the quality of education, said Glassner, who
time and again sees this country, out of conjured fear, throwing
money at the site of a rare crime or accident.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Culture of Fear,'' Glassner points to the $1 billion
President Clinton authorized to improve airport security in the
wake of the TWA 800 explosion, saying the money could have been
spent on other causes. He quotes Los Angeles Times writer K.C.
Cole: ``The price of lives lost on airlines is clearly higher _
according to the powers that be _ than lives lost to simple
hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner writes that fewer than 13,000 people have died in
airplane crashes since 1914 _ three times that many Americans die
every year in car crashes _ but the press continues to fan fears
about flying. In July, newspapers printed a study showing
near-collisions at major airports increasing 75 percent from 1993
to 1998, leading Glassner to say, ``Near-collisions ... this, after
a year in which 600 million people flew on major airlines without
one fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the American public demanded safe air travel, and it
succeeded by ``passing very restrictive rules, procedures and
laws,'' explained Glassner, ``putting the industry in a position
where it was absolutely terrified of accidents, leading the
industry itself to spend a lot of money on safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The same hasn't happened in the field of gun regulation, which
Glassner sees as crucial to cutting crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to find anyone in the country who
would not agree with the following statement _ `Disturbed persons
of any age should not have access to guns, and teen-agers should
have access to guns only under extremely restricted circumstances.'
So how can it be that our politicians, both Republican and
Democrat, can't find a way to enact that request from the
population? How can that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer, I think, is they just hide behind the scares and
counter-scares,'' he said. ``One side says, `You'll destroy the
Second Amendment' and the other side says, `You're heartless.' They
put these scares on each other instead of dealing with each other.
Nobody says, `You should have the right to carry a gun on an
airplane.' There's no argument about that.''

THE AVANT-GARDE: FOLLOW THAT BACKPACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them budgeteers or independent travelers or plain old
backpackers, but those who travel light and cheap are often the
trailblazers of the tourist set. With limited cash and a thirst for
uncommon sights, backpackers have pushed into challenging territory
well before the big-money resorts or tchotchke merchants. In the
late 1980s and early 1990s, that meant backpackers in the
cobblestoned streets of Prague, hitting its dirt cheap bars and
soaking up the city's glimmering, storybook architecture.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, closer to home, Costa Rica, with its eastern
beaches and western jungles, was gaining favor even as much of
Central America struggled with political and military strife. A
generation earlier, Americans and Europeans flocked to warmer
places like Bali, where beautiful beaches and inexpensive hotels
continue to draw sun- and bargain-worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   So where is the backpack crowd headed now? An informal survey
indicates that points east and southeast continue to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list is Thailand, which many travel professionals
say has become the top low-cost destination in Asia. Jesse
Walkershaw, a part-time backpacker and full-time manager at
Airtreks.com, a San Francisco-based travel service, said his
clients usually arrived via Bangkok, and then trek either north to
the highlands around Chiang Mai or south to the coastline near Koh
Samui. ``The north is hill tribe country,'' he said. ``The south is
all about the beaches.'' Edward Hasbrouck, the author of ``The
Practical Nomad: How to Travel Around the World'' (Moon
Publications), said Vietnam remained hot. The appeal, he said, is
its untouched flavor. ``It's very easy to get off the tourist
track,'' in Vietnam, Hasbrouck said. ``It's a country as big as
California with twice as many people.'' One caveat, however:
Tourist visas are commonly limited to a month.
</P>
<P>
   The recent _ and long-term _ economic struggles in the region
have also made Thailand, as well as Laos and Vietnam, ``super
cheap,'' Walkershaw said. That appeals to people like Joey Kern, a
college-age traveler who lives in New York. ``I hear for $4.50 you
can make it for three months,'' said Kern, who is planning a trip
there. ``OK, maybe $4.75.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that is an exaggeration, but Walkershaw says $10 a day is
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Paonessa, a graduate of New York University who backpacked
across Europe last summer, said Thailand was next on his list. He
put his fascination down to ``The Beach,'' a recent novel by Alex
Garland, a young British writer, that tells the story of a
compulsive 21-year-old traveler and his friends who, in pursuit of
unspoiled nature, head to Thailand. ``I want to go there and try
that out,'' Paonessa said.
</P>
<P>
   Other classic Asian locales for those looking for enlightenment
_ or just good, cheap fun _ include India and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America offers an enormous number of choices. Peru,
Mexico, Bolivia and Central America have long been destinations for
backpackers seeking close contact with nature and indigenous
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   David Kirby, a writer who travels about once a year to Mexico on
a daily budget of $10 to $40 a day, says that outside of Cancun and
other high-end resort areas, backpackers in Mexico can travel like
kings. ``When you backpack through Europe, which I did, you feel
poor,'' he said. ``But in Mexico, $20 a day can get you three basic
meals and a decent room. You don't feel deprived.''
</P>
<P>
   While Palenque and the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca are fixtures
on Mexico's backpacking trail, Kirby said, the often overlooked
central state of Michoacan is gaining adherents for its colonial
towns, pristine lakes and Indian villages.
</P>
<P>
   A modest budget can also take you far in Peru and Bolivia.
Christine Corcoran, a graduate student at Columbia University whose
trip to Machu Picchu two years ago was a ``life altering''
experience, spent as little as $8 for a room in nearby Cuzco.
</P>
<P>
   As adventurous as Asia and Latin America sound, many budget
travelers still head to Europe for their first trips. The usual
suspects like London, Paris and Amsterdam continue to draw hordes
of backpackers, said Caroline Sherman, the editor of ``Let's Go:
Europe '98,'' the popular budget guidebook series put together by
Harvard students. But even in Europe, less obvious locations are
being scouted out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman said, via e-mail, that Krakow, Vilnius and Berlin
were all hot; Walkershaw mentioned Bratislava.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, Portugal has recently taken advantage of overflow
crowds from Spain. And money and sunny matter. ``It's less
expensive than Spain,'' wrote Ms. Sherman. ``And has great
beaches.'' That sentiment was echoed by Mira Svatovic, 20, a
student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``The beaches
are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,'' she said. ``Rocks
protruding out of the water and underwater caves.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite place was the coastal city of Lagos in the Algarve,
where her hotel was $30 a night and she ate cheap seafood from the
blue waters of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the thermometer, Iceland is also cool right
now. Backpackers rave about the budget accommodations and hostels,
which usually include a bed and a sleeping bag and are uniformly
clean, though prices are considerably higher in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the island's popularity can be traced to a continuing
promotion by Icelandair, which allows short stopovers between the
United States and Europe. On a low-budget trip to Reykjavik last
spring, I was impressed by the rugged landscape, the northern
lights and, most of all, a night life that lasts past dawn _ which,
above the Arctic Circle, is about 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Prague, too, apparently continues to hold a Saturnalian appeal
for young travelers. ``Prague is probably still the hottest city
around,'' Paonessa said. ``It's so beautiful and so cheap. It's 50
cents for a pint, and for three bucks you can get steak and a
drink.'' Which raises the question of whether young backpackers are
seeking new frontiers or just a good party (cheapness remaining an
essential component).
</P>
<P>
   Another party destination that continues to lure crowds of
backpackers is the Spanish island of Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands
of the Mediterranean. Several travelers said the scene there _ with
stadium-sized discos and a crush of youngsters from across Europe _
was legendarily libertine. ``Everybody's sleeping on the beach,''
Paonessa said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the usual type of accommodation for today's
backpackers. While European travelers still prefer the
affordability of hostels, many visitors to Asia stay in swankier
hotels, bungalows or guesthouses for as little as $5 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Some popular locations in Europe have suffered of late because
of the turbulence in the former Yugoslavia. Ms. Sherman said that
was especially true of Greece and Turkey. ``Istanbul and the west
coast of Turkey had really taken off,'' she said. But since the war
in Kosovo and the trial of the Kurdish rebel Abdullah Ocalan,
tourist trade to Turkey's western coast has ``slowed down
considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Kern, 22, said his buddies have also cooled on Russia, in vogue
in the early 1990s. ``You get the feeling that they're so poor it
just wouldn't be fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regional instability has had an impact elsewhere. Walkershaw
said some American backpackers have steered clear of Central and
East Africa since last summer's terrorist attacks on the United
States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. That may
be a boon for countries like Mozambique, which is slowly recovering
from a 17-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things keep getting hairier and hairier in East Africa,''
Walkershaw said. ``And Mozambique is picking up a lot of that
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring South Africa is also on the rise, Ms. Sherman said.
The Tourism Bureau of South Africa reports that approximately
200,000 backpackers visited the country's hostels in 1998, an
increase of some 20 percent from the previous year. The coastal
city of Durban and the entire Kwa-Zulu/Natal region are
particularly popular with backpackers.
</P>
<P>
   What of the future? Travel professionals regard China as most
likely to succeed. The World Tourism Organization predicts that
China will be the most popular destination in the world in the
early 21st century. But free-spirited backpackers may be put off;
most travelers are strictly scheduled on tours, with little
latitude for exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Walkershaw suggested that Iran might be an up-and-comer, though
backpackers would have to adapt: ``They ain't going to put up with
you doing whatever you please,'' he said. ``There'll be no girls in
halter tops, that's for sure.'' (Recent student protests and a
crackdown by the government have since caused concerns about the
area's safety this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Hasbrouck, who has circled the globe twice, says Iran is on his
wish list despite the problems. ``Everyone I know comes back and
says, `This is a wonderful place, you have to go.''' He also
mentioned India and other parts of the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a backlash among backpackers against the
commodification of travel and the homogenization of the world,''
said Hasbrouck. ``Simply going to a town you find on the map, or
riding a bus to the end of the line, can be wonderful experiences.
And you don't find them in brochures.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In an era when political spouses like Hillary
Rodham Clinton harbor great ambitions for their husbands, Laura
Bush is a throwback. She is a former librarian with little interest
in politics. She says she never dreamed that her husband would run
for office, or emerge so early as the candidate to beat for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has tugged his wife into a
national maelstrom. And it is only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something almost scary about it for both of us,'' Mrs.
Bush said in an interview here as she embarked on her first solo
campaign swing outside Texas. ``There's a certain pace and a
certain timing to the campaign that George wants and that I want.
And that's not quite as quick as it seems to have taken off.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Hillary Clinton scornfully, and famously, said she
would not have been satisfied if she had ``stayed home and baked
cookies and had teas,'' Mrs. Bush, who is 52, sounds as if she
might be content doing just that. She calls herself a ``traditional
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   And plainly she does not see Mrs. Clinton, who is preparing to
run for the Senate from New York, as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never run for office _ that's just not my
temperament,'' she said. ``In fact, I never would have guessed I
would have married someone who would run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her interest in politics, Mrs. Bush said: ``It
doesn't drive me. I don't know that it drives him either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush seems determined not to be controversial. She is
poised and approachable, but is also skilled at steering clear of
saying anything that could get her in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging that she was a bit scared about her
husband's bid for office, she revisited the question and said:
``I'm not afraid of it. I mean, it seems like it's going very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her feelings on how Mrs. Clinton handled the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, she said, ``I don't really want to talk about it,
about what she's been through.'' The closest she came to
criticizing anyone was when she questioned whether Mrs. Clinton was
improperly using the White House to advance her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does have to be careful,'' Mrs. Bush said, ``not so much
about her duties. She has to be careful about what's so-called
official and what's political. And we're careful about that in our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Mrs. Bush say how active she would be if her husband
was in the White House. In Texas, Mrs. Bush, who was also a public
school teacher, has pressed for legislation to create
reading-readiness programs for preschoolers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, was was born in Midland, Texas, received her
bachelor's degree in education from Southern Methodist University
and a master's degree in library science from the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been that active on policy with the Texas
Legislature,'' she said. ``I had several legislative initiatives
for this session and they all passed, I'm glad to say. But I never
testified before the Legislature. I don't really think that that
was my role.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush is known as a calming influence in her extended
political family. ``I'm really quiet compared to the rest of
them,'' she said. She said she was quite close to her
mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, but that the former first lady had not
counseled her. ``Daughter-in-laws don't really want a lot of advice
from their mother-in-laws,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said she was most nervous about the loss of privacy
that comes with her husband's run for president. She reflected on
how her sister-in-law Columba Bush, the wife of Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, apologized recently after an embarrassing episode in which
she failed to declare $19,000 worth of clothing and jewelry that
she had just bought in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're in public life or your spouse is in public
life, you run the risk of being embarrassed by something you do or
something you say,'' Laura Bush said. ``It happens to everybody
over a lot of different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her initial lack of enthusiasm about her husband's
bid for the White House, Mrs. Bush said she had been concerned
about the rumors and allegations that might be thrown at her
husband, who has said he was more than rambunctious as a young
adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things I was most hesitant about even
getting into a presidential race,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``But I also
know that that's just part of it. And when George decided he did
want to run, that was one of the things that we could live with. I
really don't think it will be that bad. It really doesn't make that
much difference to us, I guess, if really terrible things are said
about him. We'll try not to read them _ or know about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said her twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna (who are
named after their grandmothers), were even more wary of the
governor running for president. ``They didn't want him to run,''
she said ``because they wanted to be perfectly private teen-agers
like every teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the campaign, Mrs. Bush said: ``It's hard work
running for office. It really requires a whole lot of energy. A lot
of focus and determination. And I know George has all that. I'm not
quite so sure I have it.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I am pretty good at interviewing job
applicants and getting an idea of their skills and capabilities.
However, I don't know how to get a clearer picture of issues such
as their ability to get along, stay cool under pressure or keep a
positive attitude. Can you suggest any good questions to ask? A.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: When you conduct a job interview and learn about the
applicant's work experience, training and expertise, you are
actually obtaining around half of the information you need to make
an informed hiring decision. In essence, all you have determined is
that the applicant has the technical skills to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question is whether the applicant possesses the
less apparent competencies that are essential for success. In a
word, does he or she have the necessary motivation, drive,
interpersonal skills, outlook and persistence to perform well in
your company?
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, when employees fall on the job, they tend to do so
as a result of these competency factors. This has led to the rise
of what is called competency-based interviewing. These interviews
not only walk through an applicant's work history, training, and
experience, but they also include questions about real work
situations and how the applicant handled them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the applicant would not be asked if he or she is
able to handle pressure well, because the obvious answer is a
resounding yes. The competency questions would be something like,
Tell me about a high-pressure situation you faced on the job and
how you handled it.
</P>
<P>
   Competency questions can cover a broad range of an applicant's
work history, and asking them will help make you a more competent
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My new supervisor is rude, abusive and intimidated by my
previous professional experience and technical knowledge. Although
I previously received excellent yearly assessments, he has given me
several verbal and written warnings within the first three weeks of
reporting to him. I have begun searching for a new position, but I
am concerned over what this supervisor will say about me in a
reference check, and I fear a backlash from him if I do not obtain
the new position. My previous management contacts have moved to
other organizations. How do I approach this situation? S.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: When providing the names of your employment references, there
are a number of steps to take if your supervisor is not exactly
super.
</P>
<P>
   In your job interview, let the potential employer know the facts
of your situation _ your solid work history, your previously
excellent ratings, the questionable changes that have been recently
implemented, and your fear of reprisal if management learns of your
desire to change jobs. Be sure to avoid any personal attacks on
your supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is absolutely no one else in the company who can be
confidentially contacted, you should advise the potential employer
that your present employer cannot be contacted unless a decision to
hire you has been made.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you should give the potential employer the
names and phone numbers of managers who knew you at the company,
but no longer work there. If a potential employer refuses to be
accommodating on this matter, that employer is probably
less-than-accommodating on all sorts of all other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company has many social gatherings and parties during
work hours, and people from just about every job level attend. I am
a friendly and sociable person, but I have a lot to do and I
usually skip these events. The other day, my manager told me that I
should stop being so aloof and come to more of them. I'll go
because she wants me to, but I think it's ridiculous. What do you
think? L.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although these informal gatherings can seem to be rather
meaningless, attending them can be quite meaningful. However, you
need to apply a standard of reasonableness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you are deeply involved in a key project, skip
the get-together or just make a brief appearance. And, do not feel
compelled to attend every single gathering, particularly if they
have evolved into a far-too-frequent ritual: ``Hey everyone, it's
Lindsay's half-birthday! Party at 3:00!''
</P>
<P>
   Attending these gatherings has a number of advantages. They can
provide you with increased opportunities to learn, network, and
promote yourself, particularly if you can use them to demonstrate
some leadership, creativity, or communication skills. In addition,
management in many companies is placing increased emphasis on
teamwork, and attending such gatherings not only signals to
management that you are a team player, but also lets you build
stronger relations with your associates.
</P>
<P>
   Although you may be busy, it is important to remember that these
parties are often more than fun and games.

HOG FARMER TO   SPEND $25M TO CONTROL HOG ODOR, POLLUTION

<P>
   The country's third-largest hog producer agreed last week to
invest $25 million to control odor and pollution from waste on its
farms in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms will also pay the state of Missouri $1
million to settle a lawsuit alleging water pollution from manure
spills and other violations of environmental laws on its farms. It
is the largest penalty an animal feeding operation has ever paid a
state, Missouri Attorney General Jeremiah W. Nixon said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is demanding that the company spend at least half of the
$25 million within three years and the rest within five years.
Premium Standard Farms spokesman Charles Arnot said the company is
investigating new forms of waste treatment technology to determine
how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that we'll be able to spend our efforts and
energies into making environmental improvements,'' said Arnot.
``It's a good win for the environment, it's a good win for the
state, and it gives us the opportunity to make the improvements
that are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Globe series last year chronicled the environmental hazards
posed by waste from hog farms and reported that Premium Standard
Farms produces five times more waste than the city of St. Louis,
without a sewage plant to treat it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials Monday defended
their investigation of a nuclear scientist at Los Alamos Nuclear
Laboratory who was fired for security breaches, despite his claim
that it was common practice for secret data to be transferred from
classified to unclassified computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no way to assess whether it's common practice,'' said
White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart. ``What I do know is
that would violate the internal safeguards within the Energy
Department. So whether it's common or not, it shouldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Dr. Wen Ho Lee, who is under investigation by the
Justice Department, says he is being scapecoated for committing
routine, minor offenses because he was the only Chinese-American
who worked on top-secret nuclear weapons at the lab for the last 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Danneskiold, a spokesman at Los Alamos, said such transfers
of secret information were not routine at US nuclear labs. ``The
bottom line is every employee at Los Alamos knows that the
unauthorized transfer of classified information to an unclassified
computer now and always has been a security violation.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said no decision had yet been made
on whether to bring charges against Lee. An American citizen since
1974, Lee is suspected of supplying the Chinese government with US
nuclear secrets, specifically design information on the
miniaturized W-88 thermonuclear warhead. The weapon sits atop the
Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile and is the newest
nuclear warhead produced by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice official said Lee is unlikely to be charged with the
more serious crime of espionage, apparently because of a lack of
evidence. But the official said Lee could be charged within weeks
under a criminal statue that forbids the misuse or mishandling of
classified computer files.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' Lee
told correspondent Mike Wallace: ``The truth is, I'm innocent.'' He
denied passing US nuclear secrets to the Chinese government. ``I
never have done that, and I have no intention of doing that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired in March by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on
suspicion of having committed security breaches by improperly
transfering nuclear weapons information from classified to
unclassified Los Alamos computers. Richardson had pointed out that
Lee made two trips to China where he allegedly had unauthorized
contact with Chinese government officials that he had failed to
report, as required.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who also was on the CBS program, said: ``All I know
is that it is wrong and improper to download nuclear weapons
information from the classified component of the computer to the
unclassified. This was done. This is something that we are not
going to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in his interview, Lee said what he did was part of his job.
``The reason I download the computer code from classified machine
to unclassified machine is part of my job, to protect my code, to
protect my file. I do that routinely,'' he said, adding that he has
three passwords on his unsecured computer that makes it difficult
even for him to log on.
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, why the government's investigation would focus on
him, Lee speculated that he was easy to scapegoat because he was
born in Taiwan. ``I am the only one Oriental or Chinese people
working on the top secret for last 18 years. There's no other
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold, the Los Alamos spokesman, said that while Lee may
be the only Chinese employee with 18 years on the job, there are
167 Asians out of a total of 7,000 full-time regular university
employees at the lab.

TWEETER JOINS INTERNET RETAILER TO BOOST HIGH-END SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. has joined the popular
move to Internet retailing, announcing a joint venture with
Cyberian Outpost Inc. to create an on-line consumer electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter plans to expand its mid- to high-range electronics
business _ which now includes home and car audio systems, portable
audio equipment, large-screen televisions, and digital satellite
systems sold in its 73 stores in 14 states _ through Cyberian
Outpost's Internet experience, said Joe McGuire, Tweeter's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will complement our in-store sales,'' McGuire
said Monday. ``We'll be able to reach existing customers and
provide them with services they are not already getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter also invested $1 million in Cyberian Outpost, an
e-commerce superstore that until now has sold only computer-related
products on line. McGuire said each company is expected to invest
$4 million in the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter, a Canton, Mass. company that owns stores in the New
England, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Texas, and Southern California
markets, will provide Cyberian Outpost with vendor relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrific thing for both of us,'' Cyberian Outpost
chief executive Daryl Peck said. ``It allows us to increase revenue
with a really insignificant financial investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in on-line consumer electronics retailing has soared
since Amazon.com _ the Internet's leading bookseller _ added
electronics to its growing list of products about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics has been targeted as one of the most
potentially profitable on-line industries, said David Cooperstein,
director of consumer e-commerce at Forrester Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   On-line sales of consumer electronics are expected to reach $411
million this year, according to Forrester. By 2003, those sales are
projected to yield $6.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line sales industries need brick and mortar to appeal to
the consumers who like to try their goods before they buy them,''
Cooperstein said. ``It shouldn't take away anything from their
in-store business. This is a case where one plus one equals 2 1/2
or three.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to nonbrick-and-mortar operations, consumers using
the Tweeter-Cyberian Outpost alliance will be able to go into a
Tweeter store to see the products they want, and then order those
exact products on line, Cooperstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter shares rose 1/16 to close at 33 3/8 on the Nasdaq stock
exchange. Shares of Cyberian Outpost closed down 11/16 to 10 1/16
on Nasdaq.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The highly respectable journal Scientific American reports on
research conclusions of the British supermarket chain Tesco, in
response to surprisingly brisk sales of pies.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket management concluded, says the story (forwarded to
Personals by  &UR; Bruce Townley &LR; ), that the baked goods were being used
as projectiles. ``Here in the U.K. we have a law called the Food
Safety Act,'' said  &UR; Melodie Schuster &LR;  of Tesco. ``While we are
certainly in business to encourage people to eat our pies, if our
customers were going to throw them, we had to look into the
possibilities of people having an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The best pie for ``maximum face-filling coverage,'' said
Schuster, was the egg custard tart; lemon meringue also flew well
and left a sticky yellow smear. Miniature strawberry and raspberry
fruit tarts, two to a package, ``fit neatly into the hand, so you
can be sneakier.'' Tossers are advised to eschew nut pies (which
could cause eye injury) and partly frozen pies, for similar
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific American provides historic reference by noting that
 &UR; Buster Keaton &LR;  was particular about his pies, each of which was
held together by two crusts stuck together with flour and water. He
never used a pie plate, and found that the double crust held the
thing together in his hand. ``Filling then depended on the target's
complexion. Blondes could expect chocolate or blackberries in the
mix. Brunettes were stuck with lemon meringue.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In related news,  &UR; William Gates Sr. &LR;  told the Sunday Times
of London that his son, who is the world's richest man and was an
early victim of a pie-ing, is on the verge of announcing a series
of charitable donations in which he will give away $100 billion.
``My son is going to have critics all his life because of his
wealth,'' said Pa Gates, ``but I'm optimistic now that we have put
to rest any criticism on the basis of his not being sufficiently
generous. We've pretty much drowned that out.'' He said the money
will go toward research on disease, including AIDS and malaria.

   Around the time the first lady was to visit the town, says the
Hill, the company placed an ad in the Oneonta Daily Star about a
sale on its ``Hillary Clinton manure spreader. One medium-size,
heavy-duty manure spreader with a floor so slick, nothing sticks.
She spreads manure to the right or left depending on how the wind

easier. I can print as many copies as I want for my band.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he travels with as many as 60 CD-ROMs, plays computer
chess and checkers, and looks up all kinds of information. ``I only

   Three new sitcoms planned for this fall will not use laugh
tracks, reports Entertainment Weekly.

<P>
   &UR; Jeff Eastin &LR; , who created one of them, ``Shasta McNasty,'' for
UPN, told the magazine that when he watched tapes of episodes of
``Friends'' and ``Seinfeld'' without laugh tracks, they ``didn't
work; the jokes just hung there.'' His new show, however, uses ``a
more situational writing style,'' allowing the canned laughter to
be deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night,'' an ABC show, started using fewer fake laughs
last season. ``It might fade into the sunset,'' said  &UR; Tony &LR;

noted that the burning was actually in 1814.

generous. We've pretty much drowned that out.'' He said the money
will go toward research on disease, including AIDS and malaria.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEALDSBURG, Calif. _ On a bright day, the sunlit vineyards in
the Alexander Valley in Sonoma County may be enough to inspire a
biblically minded person to ponder a phrase from the Psalms, the
passage in the 104th, thanking God for ``wine to gladden the human
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The words would seem most appropriate at the valley's south end,
where a 50-acre property is run by a man who is both theologian and
vintner, the Rev. John Staten.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when an increasing number of professionals have taken
second careers as members of the clergy, Staten, 61, offers a
counterexample. With degrees from Princeton Theological Seminary
and the University of Chicago Divinity School, he is a Presbyterian
minister and religion professor turned winemaker, head of the Field
Stone Winery and Vineyard here.
</P>
<P>
   Staten retains the perspective of his first calling, as he is
also theologian-in-residence at a nearby Presbyterian church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the good life not in terms of consumer society, not in
terms of American affluence,'' Staten said. ``The good life for me
has to include elements of the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Field Stone produces reds and whites (cabernet sauvignon,
merlot, petite sirah, chardonnay and others), but Staten has lately
created a dry communion wine, Convivio.
</P>
<P>
   The name _ from the Italian word for banquet and literally
meaning ``with life'' _ reflects his belief that wine (taken in
moderation by people able to do so) can be a vital element in ``the
fellowship among human beings,'' rather than a source of hedonistic
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Convivio label declares Staten's theology of wine: a ``sense
of enlivening connectedness'' results ``when we gather around a
table to share bread and wine and the substance of our lives with
one another.'' In such ``genuine communion,'' it adds, God is
present.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between wine and Western religions runs deep,
though the Bible warns against excess. Within Jewish tradition, a
benediction is said over a cup of wine at weddings and wine is
present at Passover seders.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Testament, the Gospel of John recounts Jesus turning
water into wine at the wedding at Cana, his first miracle. That act
``revealed his glory,'' states John 2:11, ``and his disciples
believed in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Less well known is how religious groups have been active in the
spread of winemaking. ``Religion was a huge factor in the spread of
the wine industry in the United States,'' said Robert Fuller,
professor of religious studies at Bradley University in Peoria,
Ill., and the author of ``Religion and Wine'' (University of
Tennessee, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Wine production expanded with Christian communities' sacramental
needs, Fuller said. In California, he said, vineyards followed the
Spanish missions. Wine was important in the East, too. ``There was
no such thing as a grape-juice Protestant in colonial times,''
Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Temperance movement changed that, and Prohibition
accelerated the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Staten said he had long had an interest in wine and recalled, as
a student at Chicago, being shown around the wine cellar of the
theologian Paul Tillich. But he came to his current work
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he became a professor at Reed College in
Portland, Ore., then at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., in 1976.
In the meantime, his father-in-law, Wallace Johnson, an aluminum
scaffolding manufacturer, was re-establishing an Alexander Valley
vineyard where wine had once been produced. He opened Field Stone
in 1977 but died two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to step into the picture,'' Staten said. ``Here I was, a
one-man religious studies department at Mills College, the chaplain
of the college.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tried to do both, but he left his college job in
1982. He has taken the transition in Emersonian stride. The
vineyard and winery, he said, offer ``a world in which I could
still theologize,'' he said, adding, ``I could think, I could read,
but I could also be a farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   He runs it with his wife, Katrina; their son, Ben, the general
manager, and the Rev. Roger Hull, another Presbyterian who is
director of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Staten credited what he learned about winemaking early on to
courses in wine production at the University of California at Davis
and later to the advice of a consultant, Andre Tchelistcheff. ``He
was probably my only other close spiritual contact in the trade,''
Staten said.
</P>
<P>
   Tchelistcheff, a Russian Orthodox who called Staten ``Father,''
encouraged him to hold a service to bless the grapes. The ceremony,
offering thanksgiving to God, takes place every September with
different clergy members invited to preside. ``It's always followed
by a banquet,'' Staten said.
</P>
<P>
   He often speaks to churches about the history of wine in
religion, drawing interest among congregants intrigued by his dual
role. His training and vocation have also led him into deep
conversations at wine industry events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer the odd minister who's there,'' he said, ``and
who's asked to give the blessing, and then say no more about the
subject of the evening.''

YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM FILLS TOP EXECUTIVE SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The next generation of top leadership was designated
on Monday by Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York, one of the world's
largest agency companies. And while the new leaders are not new
faces, the succession has its surprising elements.
</P>
<P>
   The changes involve promotions of the two most senior executives
of Y&AMP;R, positioning them to succeed Peter A. Georgescu, who has
served as chairman since January 1995 and chief executive since
December 1993. The promotions will in effect settle the race for
the top spot that had been narrowed to the pair, Thomas D. Bell Jr.
and Edward H. Vick, in Bell's favor.
</P>
<P>
   And the promotions open up the top post at the largest Y&AMP;R unit,
Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, which is expected to be filled this
week by an executive who works for Y&AMP;R _ but not for Y&AMP;R
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel shifts at Y&AMP;R _ the world's fourth-largest agency
company in billings, at $14.7 billion, and fifth-largest in
revenue, at almost $1.7 billion _ indicate a generational change
along Madison Avenue. Executive suites populated by managers in
their 50s and 60s, who started their rise to power in the mostly
boom days of the 1950s and 1960s, are being remade with younger
leaders whose career ``wonder years'' date a decade or two later.
</P>
<P>
   Effective Jan. 1, Georgescu, 60, will take the new post of
chairman emeritus, working with large clients to which he has been
close, like the Ford Motor Co. and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Under
Georgescu, Y&AMP;R has grown significantly, beginning or expanding
relationships with behemoths like the AT&AMP;T Corp., Citigroup and the
Colgate-Palmolive Co. as well as ending its decades-long status as
a privately held agency by selling stock to the public in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing a chief executive has to worry about
is leaving the company in great hands,'' thing a chief executive
has to worry about is leaving the company in great hands,''
Georgescu said in a telephone interview where he was joined by Bell
and Vick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Y&AMP;R benefiting from having a management team with 10
years ahead of them, who will be part of the new world of
databases, the Internet, well into the first decade of the 21st
century,'' Georgescu added.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively immediately, Bell, 49, who has served since
September as chairman and chief executive of Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising, becomes president and chief operating officer at Y&AMP;R.
The post of president has been vacant since John McGarry retired in
December; as chief operating officer, Bell succeeds Vick, who has
served in that capacity since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 1, Bell, who has worked predominantly for Y&AMP;R units
outside the realm of traditional advertising, will take over
Georgescu's duties as chief executive while continuing as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Also effective immediately, as Vick, 54, relinquishes his
responsibilities as chief operating officer, he assumes a new post,
chief creative officer, responsible for overseeing the creative
output of all Y&AMP;R units. In addition to Y&AMP;R Advertising, those
units include Wunderman Cato Johnson, the direct marketing agency;
Landor Associates, the brand and corporate identity consulting
agency, and Sudler &AMP; Hennessey, the health care agency.
</P>
<P>
   The new post will be an intriguing experiment because although
Vick has worked for creatively focused agencies like Ammirati &AMP;
Puris and Levine, Huntley, Vick &AMP; Beaver, he has always worked on
the management side of advertising rather than the creative side.
How he performs also bears watching because this may be the first
time a huge agency company has had a top executive devoted to
enhancing creative performance across divisions.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, as Bell becomes chief executive, Vick will take over
Georgescu's duties as chairman while continuing as chief creative
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption in these situations is that somebody is sitting
around moping,'' Georgescu said. ``This is one time everybody's
excited, for all the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this among the three of us,'' he added, ``and
we crafted this together.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of Bell's experience seems to be what won him the
chief executive's post over Vick. Besides his seasoning stint at
Y&AMP;R Advertising, Bell has served as president and chief executive
of two important Y&AMP;R units, the Burson-Marsteller public relations
agency and the Diversified Communications Group, composed of units
like Burson-Marsteller and Landor.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has worked for Y&AMP;R twice in his 26-year career, which also
includes stays at Gulfstream Aerospace; the Ball Corp.; the Hudson
Institute, a public policy organization, and a Washington agency
specializing in political advertising for Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unique combination of skills,'' Georgescu said, which
``spans all of the marketing disciplines,'' has made Bell ``one of
the most outstanding business strategists I have come across.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bell's elevation over Vick was not entirely
unexpected. Still, many executives both inside and outside Y&AMP;R
thought that Vick's achievements in the field of traditional
advertising would land him the top spot. Vick has also worked at
Benton &AMP; Bowles, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather and Y&AMP;R Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year the three of us were talking about who was going
to do what, ``trying to get the right skills against the right
tasks, Ed drove the process,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have cut the pie in many different ways,'' he
continued. ``It was clearly Ed's call.''
</P>
<P>
   So why then is Vick winding up as chairman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has this reaction, that everyone should want to be
CEO.,'' Vick said, ``but I never wanted to run a public company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has the pedigree to run a great public company,'' he
added. ``I didn't have the pedigree. I'd rather focus on the work;
that's what really turns me on. I would rather sit through a
creative meeting than an analysts' call.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgescu described Vick as ``the perfect bridge'' between the
creative executives at Y&AMP;R's various units _ who will have
so-called dotted line reporting responsibilities to Vick _ and the
executives at client companies who make advertising decisions
because he ``knows how to stimulate the creative process and at the
same time understand the business world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick concurred. Though his lack of direct creative experience is
``obvious,'' he said, ``I don't have to write the ads'' to focus on
improving creative output.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interest is from the very top of the company,'' he added,
``to push our people to do better work and push our clients to buy
better work, maybe riskier work.'' Vick was a central figure in
convincing AT&AMP;T to run a risky commercial last year that told a
story about a father and son and the Vietnam War; it received
widespread acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The executive changes were endorsed unanimously by the board of
Y&AMP;R, which is scheduled to release quarterly earnings Tuesday.
Shares of Y&AMP;R closed Monday at $45.8125, up 50 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.

SENATE APPROVES NEW RULES ON SWEEPSTAKES MAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mich.)  (lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a unanimous vote, the Senate on Monday night
approved new restrictions and penalties for companies that try to
tempt people into buying magazine subscriptions and other products
by sending them mail filled with promises of millions of dollars in
``sweepstakes'' winnings.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require the companies behind these
direct-mail promotions, which often arrive with typographical bells
and whistles that appear to virtually guarantee the recipient
instant wealth, to make it ``clear and conspicuous'' that winning
is not automatic, that purchasing products does not increase the
odds of winning and that those odds are very, very long.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed 93-0, would also grant the U.S.
Postal Service new investigative and prosecutorial authority over
the multibillion-dollar sweepstakes industry, including the ability
to issue fines of up to $2 million to companies that flout the
proposed new regulations. Currently the maximum fine is $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senators said that the bill, called the Deceptive Mail
Prevention and Enforcement Act, is intended largely to protect
elderly Americans, many of whom have been duped into parting with
thousands of dollars by the bold come-ons _ ``You Have Won a
Million Dollars!'' _ of sweepstakes. Too many of these elderly
people did not notice the very tiny fine print, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my constituents in Maine actually postponed needed
surgery because she was convinced that that was going to be the day
her winnings were delivered,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,
the principal author of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who co-sponsored the bill, said that
plenty of other people had been similarly fooled. ``Many can get
caught up _ and do get caught up _ in a spiral of emotional and
financial trauma,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved Monday generally requires the display _ but
not necessarily on the envelope _ of various statements and
warnings, including the specific odds of winning a prize and all
the contest rules. And the bill says that the information must be
displayed prominently and not be overshadowed by patently false or
misleading claims, which are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   But it leaves judgments about whether those criteria have been
met to the Postal Service. So a person might still receive an
envelope with the fantastic news that he or she is on the cusp of
riches beyond imagining. Under this legislation, however, the
accompanying reality check would come much faster, and would be
bolder, louder and more difficult to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   In the House there is no bill precisely analogous to the Senate
legislation and no immediate plan for consideration of such a
measure. But two bills proposing different kinds of regulations for
the sweepstakes industry have been introduced, and a House
subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings on Wednesday into
deceptive direct-mail promotions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are no estimates of how many people have fallen victim to
such promotions, but officials with the Direct Marketing
Association, which represents 3,700 direct-marketing companies,
have said that sweepstakes account for roughly a billion pieces of
mail each year and that about 11 percent of Americans buy products
in response to sweepstakes promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, there has been a rising clamor from
some of those people, who realized that they had been utterly duped
into thinking that they had actually won an enormous cash prize, or
were about to, when they had not.
</P>
<P>
   Many state attorneys general have filed suits against large
sweepstakes companies. In May, one of those companies, American
Family Publishers, paid $4 million to settle the civil charges that
it faced in four states.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for American Family Publishers, said
Monday that the Senate legislation merely spelled out operating
procedures that the company had already begun to implement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is extend it to the whole industry,'' Ms. Meyer
said. ``We're happy to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cerasale, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing
Association, said that the trade group also welcomed the
legislation as an important step in the industry's effort, already
under way, to ``get some confidence back in sweepstakes
promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the industry's acquiescence to Monday's
legislation is that it is, in fact, less invasive and exacting than
a Senate bill that was being promoted last year but that never
reached the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That bill actually dictated the wording and type size of a
disclaimer that would have been mandatory on the envelope of any
sweepstakes solicitation.

   ``Inside the Oval Office'' &QL; 
By William Doyle (Kodansha, $28) &QL; 
What were they ``thinking,''``'' these powerful men who recorded
conversations that should have been left to our imaginations?
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a microphone hidden in his desk lamp, and
it preserved, among other things, his embarrassing responses to
civil-rights leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White, who in
1940 went to the Oval Office to push for integration of the U.S.
military. The tape of the meeting reveals the visitors to be
eloquent and firm, while Roosevelt is condescending and vaguely
racist. At one point, he addresses the issue of putting Black men
aboard Navy ships with this suggestion: ``Another thing (that) I
forgot to mention . . . is this. We are training a certain number
of musicians on board ship. The ship's ``band.'' There's no reason
why we shouldn't have a colored band on some of these ships,
because they're ``darn good at it.'' That's something we should
look into. You know, if it'll increase the ``opportunity,'' that's
what we're after. They may develop a ``leader'' of the band.'' And
consider this exchange as John and Robert Kennedy and their aides
deal with riots after James Meredith's attempts to register as the
first Black student at the University of Mississippi. JFK: ``It's
going to be a long fall in Oxford. I think we oughta get the
National Guard within, you know, shouting distance.'' RFK: ``Yeah.
We have control over the air. If you have gas, you got a pretty
good operation going. They got 500 marshals. You see, they're
sitting there, and they're throwing iron.'' JFK: ``Spikes?'' RFK:
``. . . spikes and they're throwing Coke bottles and they're
throwing rocks.'' JFK: What's Barnett (Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett) doing?'' RFK: ``I suppose laughing at us.'' (Laughter in
room.) VOICE: ``This reminds me a little bit of the Bay of Pigs.''
RFK: ``Yech!'' (Laughter in room.) Doyle looks at the bugging
habits of the past 11 presidents. The transcripts are brief but
fascinating, although they are faulty history. Less interesting is
the analysis Doyle offers as he explores the 20th-century tradition
of presidential eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weight of Dreams''By Jonis Agee (Viking, $24.95) &QL; 
Agee's new novel is so packed with stories that it's not easy to
describe. The central character is Ty Bonte, who has grown up on a
Nebraska ranch with an abusive father and a mother grown distant
after the death of Ty's younger brother, Ronnie. Ty is 17 when the
book begins and about to take part in an event that will govern the
rest of his life: One night, he and his friend, Harney Rivers,
brutally beat two Indians from a nearby reservation, and Tyruns off
before he can be arrested. He ends up in Kansas, where he builds a
life for himself as a horse trader. Now, 20 years have passed, and
although he is haunted by both Ronnie's death and that horrible
night with Harney, he has managed to reinvent himself enough to
begin a comfortable relationship with a woman who has secrets of
her own. It all goes well until Harney reappears and commits acts
so vicious that they make his previous sins seem like child's play.
All of this, astonishingly enough, takes place in the first 100
pages, leaving nearly 300 to resolve everything. This novel offers
violence, romance, ranch life, lots of horses, parental blame,
parental forgiveness, courtroom drama, a hate crime, lots of
remorse and even more redemption. And Agee's fans will be happy to
see Latta Jaboy and Cody Kidwell, characters from her novel,
``Strange Angels,'' who play supporting roles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for the Goal''By Mia Hamm (HarperCollins, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She can do anything he can do and better. Even Michael Jordan
must believe it by now. This book was released in April, but its
publisher is sending it around again for those of you who woke up
with the World Cup. Part autobiography, part soccer primer, part
paean to the joys of team play, it is earnest to the point of
stodginess, which just makes Hamm more admirable than she already
was. There are photos of skill and rough play, a glossary of soccer
terms, diagrams of maneuvers and even a page from Hamm's training
log, which we read but did not understand (New &AMP; Notable is not
intense). There are also words of wisdom, as when Hamm talks about
soccer's way of humbling its players. In any match, she says, there
are two opponents _ the other team and soccer itself. Sometimes,
you can outplay the different-color shirts. But you never beat the
game.

   ``The Queen Mother's Century''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lacey &QL; 
(Little Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   She was awfully cute when she was little, and she's awfully cute
now. In between, there was a long succession of bad hats. And bad
jewelry, bad parasols, bad photo opportunities, as when she posed,
smiling sweetly, in a bombed-out London neighborhood after a Nazi
air raid. But if anyone could pull it off, it was the Queen Mother,
who was born in 1900 and whose plump, serene presence is certainly
a hook upon which to hang another century book. Lacey makes a lame
effort to mention news events over the years, but this is really
just an excuse to look at royal photos. Our favorite shows Princess
Margaret, Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother dressed in plaid
skirts and standing in a barnyard, frumpy women all. Queen Mum has
a Band-Aid on her shin and is gamely balancing a milk bucket on her
head. It's an improvement over those hats.

GORE TO FOCUS ON GOP RIVAL BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Gore-Kennedy)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign will mostly
ignore former Senator Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic
nomination, and focus its research and attention on Texas Governor
George W. Bush, according to Gore aides who met with congressional
staff members Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stacie Spector, Gore's deputy campaign manager and director of
strategic operations, made the remarks during a meeting between
senior campaign officials and chiefs of staff and press secretaries
to House and Senate members, one participant said. On Thursday,
lawmakers will meet with Tony Coehlo, the campaign's general
chairman, and Marla Romash, the deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's approach to Bradley, according to one person who
attended the meeting, is to try to avoid overt attacks. ``They
said, `We're just not trying to go after him. We can't afford to
alienate too many folks,' ' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that assertion, both Coehlo and Romash attacked Bradley
recently when he called for a ban on soft money contributions to
the national party committees. Coehlo suggested that Bradley had
been absent on the subject of campaign finance reform during his
years in the Senate and would leave Democratic candidates in 2000
vulnerable to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While some participants characterized the tone as an attempt to
reassure Capitol Hill Democrats that the campaign is in good shape,
Gore officials said there was nothing out of the ordinary about
this week's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They said similar meetings have already taken place with
Democratic women senators, freshmen House members and the House
``Blue Dog'' Democrats, conservative members of the party. Gore met
personally with members of the Hispanic Caucus, and has plans to
meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, too. Officials
said the meetings were merely a means of keeping lawmakers up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Craig Smith painted a rosy picture for
lawmakers' aides, saying that fund-raising was on track and that
Gore is solidly ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to
several people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to allay concerns that the vice president is not
doing as well as he should and could be in trouble if he faces Bush
in the general election, Smith said polling data show that the more
people learn about Gore, the more they like him. On the other hand,
Smith said, the more voters learn about Bush, the less they like
him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said he expects Gore to wrap up his fund-raising by
the end of the year so that will not be scrambling for funds during
the heat of the primary campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want what happened to Bob Dole to happen to us,''
Smith said, according to another aide who was there.

 &HT;    Returning to work traumatic for many
 &HT;    By Clint Williams

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was back to business Monday at Two Securities
Centre, but is wasn't back to business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers were stationed at the front door and security
officers patrolled the grounds, but they were there mostly to keep
the press away from the scene of the worst shooting spree in
modern-day Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although some employees of the office building worked part of
the day Friday, for many Monday marked the first day back at work
after Thursday's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very somber in the building,'' said Amy Bledsoe, manager
of business development at a dental benefits company.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's office is on the third floor, just down the hallway
from Momentum Securities, the day trading firm where Mark O. Barton
first opened fire shortly before 3 p.m. Thursday. Four people were
killed in Suite 310.
</P>
<P>
   The new carpeting in the hall is a reminder of the carnage,
Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it when you go to the bathroom, you think
about it when you go to the elevator,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said her company is providing counseling for employees.
Help also is available on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Lang LaSalle, the building management company, opened a
clinic of sorts in Suite 208. The warren of rooms was staffed with
15 counselors, some provided by the company, some by the mayor's
office, said Jane Raftery, facilities human resources manager for
Jones Lang LaSalle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a great concern for all the employees in these three
buildings,'' Raftery said.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people troubled by the tragedy visited Suite 208, and
counselors also visited offices throughout the complex, Raftery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Piedmont Road, at the offices of All-Tech Investment
Group, three counselors were on hand to talk with the day traders
who do business there. Barton also traded at All-Tech and vented
his rage there after leaving Two Securities Centre, killing five
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (day trading) system is up and running, but I don't know
if anyone has logged on,'' said Derek Schimming, the branch manager
of the All-Tech office in Kansas City who is in Atlanta to keep the
office open. The four All-Tech staffers here remain hospitalized
with gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to speculate on how long until things get back to
normal,'' Schimming said. ``I'm sure some of the traders are ready
to go now. These people have come to depend on All-Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts at normalcy, a few workers remained anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little spooked,'' said Aretha King, who works at Two
Securities Centre. ``It is eerie. A lot of people are saying
lightning doesn't strike twice, but every time a door opens, I'm
thinking, `Who's that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   King, who said she was evacuated from her office after the
shooting, admitted she thought of changing jobs, ``but that was
just an emotional response. There are crazy people in this world.''

 &HT;    Shooter's children remembered in funeral service
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The heart-shaped wreaths _ one blue, one pink _
flanking the two oak coffins simply said: ``Gone to be with Mama.''
A pair of teddy bears rested on a red crepe cross behind the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 300 mourners, many of them choking back tears, filled the
White Columns Chapel in Lithia Springs, Ga. Monday to memorialize
Matthew David Barton, 11, and his sister, Mychelle Elizabeth, 8,
who were slain last week by their father, Mark O. Barton. The
pianist performed ``Danny Boy'' and ``Jesus Loves Me'' and the Rev.
Kenneth Hennesy invoked Jesus' Biblical invitation to children:
``Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not;
for of such is the kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the children's bodies passed an honor guard of
Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts and saluting sheriff's deputies. They
were driven to a sun-scorched hill in the nearby Sunrise Memorial
Gardens and buried next to their mother, Debra Spivey Barton, and
their grandmother Eloise Powell Spivey, who preceded them in
violent death.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spivey has now endured the deaths of a wife, a daughter and
two grandchildren. He was comforted Monday not only by Virginia,
his wife of five years, but by much of the Lithia Springs
community. Residents in this historic town have been unified in
their grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt everybody here,'' said Jack Calhoun, a tire dealer
who flew his flag at half-staff. Calhoun got to know Spivey when he
worked at the Ace Hardware across the street from his business. He
said he recently overheard Spivey talk about his frustration that
Alabama authorities were never able to catch the man who killed his
wife and daughter in 1993. Spivey blamed Barton,
</P>
<P>
   But Spivey was not eaten up _ outwardly at least _ by
bitterness, say those who know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always met the public with a sweet smile,'' said James D.
Millwood, who sat outside his home across the street from the
funeral home and watched the procession, as did about a dozen media
crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Spivey is a hero,'' said attorney Joe Fowler, who knows
Spivey and who worked on Barton's will just hours before the
shooting spree Thursday. ``Mr. Spivey bore up under the loss of his
wife and daughter like a champion. And I'm sure he will do it
again. But I just don't know _ how much can one man take?''
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent deaths did not only hurt those who knew the
Spiveys.
</P>
<P>
   Henry County police detective Renee Swanson, wearing her
detective's shield on a chain, came to tears as she hugged and met
Mychelle's Girl Scout leader Barbie Grammel. ``I'm Renee,'' the
veteran officer said, introducing herself.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson attended the funeral ``not to represent the department,
but because I'm a mother.'' She has a son, 17, and daughters ages
16 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson was among the first officers to go inside the apartment
and was shaken deeply at the sight of the children tucked lifeless
in their beds, the covers pulled up to their chins, ``snuggled in
like it was real cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he had washed their bodies, and the little girl's
hair smelled of shampoo like my 10-year-old, Brittany's, hair
smells after a shampoo,'' said Swanson. ``And when I saw the notes
(Barton) left with the children, I just felt complete sorrow,
devastation that they wouldn't be playing tomorrow, or ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennesy, pastor of Lithia Springs' Union Grove Baptist Church
and a friend of Spivey's, posed to the congregation the
unanswerable question: ``Like many of you, I ask the question
`why?' There are a lot of mysteries to life we can never know,
never understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we feel confusion, we feel anger, but we trust that God
is the creator. When children die at an early age, God has a
special place for them in his kingdom. And we shall see Matthew and
Mychelle again.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending the service were family members of Leigh Ann Barton _
Barton's second wife, whom he killed last week. Sisters Kelly Argo,
35, and Dana Reeves, 32, her mother Patricia Murray and stepmother,
Katy Vandiver, sat a row behind the Spivey family.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Vandiver, Leigh Ann Barton's father, said he didn't come
because he was too angry, mostly at Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was convinced Mark didn't kill his first wife, it was
always a point of concern for me,'' said Mr. Vandiver. ``There were
not enough details of the investigation we knew about. I probably
would have been more forceful in my attempts to dissuade her from
the relationship with Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey was convinced his son-in-law murdered his wife and
daughter. But he had to internalize most of those feelings because
he wanted to keep a relationship with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled it with grace,'' said Hennesy. ``He couldn't allow
himself to be bitter the first time because of the kids. He had to
look after their interest. He was able to do what needed to be
done.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rory Kennedy, whose July 17 wedding was postponed
after her cousin John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal airplane crash,
married film and book editor Mark Bailey Monday in a private
ceremony outside Athens, sources close to the Kennedy family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Bailey were married before about two dozen family
members and close friends at the home of Greek shipping tycoon
Vardis Vardinoyannis. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the family
patriarch, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Athens television stations reported Monday that Vardinoyannis's
villa was lit up, as songs by Frank Sinatra and other American
singers played inside. Bodyguards stood at the villa's entrances in
the wealthy northern suburb of Ekali, keeping reporters and
paparazzi at bay, according to Greek media reports and the Reuters
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 30, a New York documentary filmmaker, had planned to
wed Bailey on July 17 at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.
More than 300 guests were invited to attend the original ceremony,
which was postponed after the single-engine plane piloted by her
cousin was reported missing while en route to the wedding. The
bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
and her sister Lauren Bessette were found in the plane's wreckage
off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, Rory was born
after her father was assassinated while campaigning for the
presidency in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Rory is the third member of the Kennedy family to wed in Greece.
In 1993, her sister Courtney wed Irish rebel Paul Hill in the
Aegean Sea aboard The Varmar, a ship owned by Vardinoyannis.
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s mother, married
shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis in 1968 on his private island,
Scorpios.

NIRAD CHAUDHURI, INDIAN AUTHOR, DIES IN ENGLAND AT 100 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas)  (Eds: an abbreviated version, OBIT-CHAUDHURI-ABRIDGED, will also
move tonight.) (DW) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nirad C. Chaudhuri, whose first book in English, ``The
Autobiography of an Unknown Indian,'' was written when he was 53,
and when he thought his life would soon end, died on Sunday at 101.
In the five decades of grace he received after completing the
autobiography he saw it acclaimed as a classic and wrote many other
provocative, crotchety and elegant works of prose, completing his
most recent book in his 99th year.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri died at his home in Oxford, England, where he had
lived since leaving India when he was 73. His expatriate years were
spent thinking and writing about the land of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri (pronounced CHOW-dree) drew upon his personal
experiences as he chronicled the transformation of India from
British colony to independent state. ``Nirad Chaudhuri is a fiction
created by the Indian writer of the same name _ a bizarre,
outrageous and magical transformation of that stock character of
imperialist literature, the Bengali Babu,'' David Lelyveld, a
historian of modern India, wrote in The New York Times Book Review
in 1988. ``Ever since Chaudhuri failed his M.A. examination in
history at Calcutta University and threw over a secure post as
clerk in the military accounts department, he has devoted himself
to responding to the notion that Indians could not be truly learned
in the civilization of Europe. As a man of culture _ not, as he
would put it, in the anthropological sense _ he would beat the
British at their own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beat them he did. When ``Autobiography'' appeared in 1951 it
established Chaudhuri's reputation in influential portions of the
English-speaking world far beyond India. He became known as a
writer of the first rank and as an interpreter _ and raging
defender _ of the vanished civilization of the Bengal Hindu
aristocracy into which he had been born.
</P>
<P>
   V.S. Naipaul wrote, ``Chaudhuri's `Autobiography' may be the one
great book to have come out of the Indo-English encounter. No
better account of the penetration of the Indian mind by the West _
and by extension, of the penetration of one culture by another _
will be or now can be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri's book originated in despair. He was not pleased with
the rise of Indian nationalism or the imminent withdrawal of the
British from the subcontinent it had ruled since 1757. He realized
that both developments would put an end to the time of the Babus,
his fellow intellectual Bengalis centered in Calcutta, who had
reached out to European civilization and who he thought should be
the political and cultural rulers of modern India.
</P>
<P>
   He saw himself as the last survivor of the Bengal Renaissance,
the vital and creative cultural movement that was initiated by Ram
Mohan Roy in the 19th century and that ended with the death in 1941
of Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobelist in literature.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he felt more personal frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dormant dissatisfaction woke up and I could no longer shut
my eyes to the stark fact that I had no achievement to speak of
although I was going to be 50,'' Chaudhuri wrote in the second
installment of his autobiography, a 963-page volume titled ``Thy
Hand, Great Anarch!: India, 1921-1952,'' which he completed in
1988. ``The sense of failure was made more acute by an idea which I
had just at that time that I was not going to live much longer and
my health being what it was I would probably die in two or three
years. What could I do, I bitterly thought, in that short space of
time?'' His title refers to Alexander Pope's 1728 poem ``The
Dunciad,'' with its last lines, ``Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the
curtain fall; And universal darkness buries all.''
</P>
<P>
   His idea was to weave recollections of personal experience with
accounts of the history he had lived through from his birth in the
village of Kishorganj on Nov. 23, 1897, until 1921, when he failed
to gain his master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala added, ``What makes it a truly
great autobiography is that the author is himself the illustration
of his subject, demonstrating in every line how the highest
achievements of European culture can be effortlessly absorbed by
the Hindu personality without making it any less convoluted, deep,
wildly humorous, devious and sublime.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirad Chandra Chaudhuri set out to write ``Autobiography'' in
1947, the year of India's independence and partition. Bengal was
divided, with Chaudhuri's birthplace within what was then East
Pakistan and is now Bangladesh. Every day in his Delhi apartment,
before he went to work writing news commentaries for All India
Radio, he typed 2,500 words of autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``His memoir follows the pattern of much Bengali fiction,''
Lelyveld noted. ``There is a sensitive and lyrical description of
early childhood and education in the rural heartland of Bengal,
followed by an account of a painful uprooting to the city of
Calcutta; in the end, the hero is cast adrift in tragic isolation _
all this a romantic echo of the classical Hindu stages of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri wrote of the humiliating end of his academic career,
how his friends considered him a failure and how, when he was 34,
his father regarded him as the only one of his six sons who would
never make his way in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But with equal emphasis _ pari pasu, as he would say _ he also
wrote about the tangled relationship between Britain and India,
using citations not only in Latin, but also in French, Italian and
German.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext of the book and of much of Chaudhuri's subsequent
work was that the Bengal Renaissance was being overwhelmed by a
combination of British racism, Indian nationalism and the rise of
democracy. Though the British scorned the Babus and laughed at
Kipling's caricatures of them, the Bengalis had risen under British
rule. Chaudhuri believed that as British power receded, the
Westernization of Indian civilization, which had been sponsored by
the Bengalis and which he so cherished, was doomed. He felt that
Gandhi and Nehru had thrown away any chance of India fulfilling
what he believed to be its destiny as a Western country.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas were in a controversial dedication in Chaudhuri's
autobiography: ``To the memory of the British Empire in India,
which conferred subjecthood on us but withheld citizenship; to
which yet every one of us threw out the challenge: `civis
Britannicus sum,' because all that was good and living within us
was made, shaped, and quickened by the same British rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lines infuriated many of Chaudhuri's countrymen, who never
read much beyond the dedication and who came to regard the author
not so much as the Bengali supremacist that he was but as a
sycophant for the departed British. In fact, in this and other
books, he frequently described Britain as a decadent society and
condemned the British for their racism directed at Bengalis.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri, who remembered slights and enjoyed repaying them in
print, was not surprised by the reaction of his countrymen. Years
later he would write that he intended the book primarily for
foreign readers. ``I was determined that I would not give the book
to an Indian publisher because I knew that a book in English
published in India would not be regarded as worth much even by
Indian readers, not to speak of those in the English-speaking
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Unknown Indian of the title approached several London
publishers and in the end Macmillan published his book.

   WASHINGTON _ Rory Kennedy, whose July 17 wedding was postponed
after her cousin John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal airplane crash,
married film and book editor Mark Bailey Monday in a private
ceremony outside Athens, sources close to the Kennedy family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Bailey were married before about two dozen family
members and close friends at the home of Greek shipping tycoon
Vardis Vardinoyannis. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the family
patriarch, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Athens television stations reported Monday that Vardinoyannis's
villa was lit up, as songs by Frank Sinatra and other American
singers played inside. Bodyguards stood at the villa's entrances in
the wealthy northern suburb of Ekali, keeping reporters and
paparazzi at bay, according to Greek media reports and the Reuters
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 30, a New York documentary filmmaker, had planned to
wed Bailey on July 17 at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.
More than 300 guests were invited to attend the original ceremony,
which was postponed after the single-engine plane piloted by her
cousin was reported missing while en route to the wedding. The
bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
and her sister Lauren Bessette were found in the plane's wreckage
off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, Rory was born
after her father was assassinated while campaigning for the
presidency in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Rory is the third member of the Kennedy family to wed in Greece.
In 1993, her sister Courtney wed Irish rebel Paul Hill in the
Aegean Sea aboard The Varmar, a ship owned by Vardinoyannis.
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s mother, married
shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis in 1968 on his private island,
Scorpios.

UNDATED: his book.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1990, when Oxford University gave Chaudhuri an honorary
doctorate, the Public Orator, speaking in Latin, offered the
following comment: ``Chaudhuri expressed his views on contemporary
events with a frankness which was too great to make him popular
with his fellow Indians, praising certain aspects of the Raj, and
lacking in the requisite enthusiasm for the birth of New India. But
with passage of time his reputation at home is now restored. The
Unknown Indian of his book has deservedly won fame and
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   However true that may have been, the process was slow and
Chaudhuri felt less and less comfortable in New Delhi while being
praised abroad. Before the transformation, he had worked as a
government clerk and as a Bengali editor in Calcutta. In 1937 he
became a private secretary to Sarat Chandra Bose, an important
leader of the Indian National Congress whose more famous brother,
Subhas Chandra Bose, had obtained Japanese support to form the
militant Indian National Army to pursue independence through armed
struggle in opposition to Gandhian nonviolence. In 1937 he also
stopped writing in Bengali.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of World War II he became, as he described it,
``an Englishman except in birth'' and began preparing commentaries
for All India Radio. Chaudhuri left Bengal in 1942 as the Japanese
closed in on the region and the political leadership of Bengali
Hindus was eclipsed by Bengal's Muslim majority and by non-Bengalis
like Gandhi and Nehru. ``My people had no future,'' he declared,
``and I was not prepared to share their fate.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Delhi, where he became a political commentator on
the radio, a post he lost when ``Autobiography'' appeared.
</P>
<P>
   With him was his wife, Amiya, whom he married in 1932, a bride
whose face he did not see until after the wedding. In an interview
at their home in Oxford in 1982, as Amiya Chaudhuri served a
splendid Italian meal, Chaudhuri told how they had wed. Originally
influenced by Western ideas, he said, he told his father, a lawyer
and a municipal official, that he proposed to find his own bride as
was done in the West. He spent a year visiting Socialist clubs in
fruitless searches for a potential mate. Finally he returned to his
father and asked him to find him a wife by traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he praised his father for selecting such a
remarkable woman, one who had followed him around the world,
endured his poverty and tolerated his eccentricities to join him in
learning about opera and wine and who bore him three sons, Dhruva,
Kirti and Prith, who are his survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' Chaudhuri described the first
words he and his wife exchanged once they were alone after their
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took up one of my arms, felt it and said: `You are so
thin. I shall take good care of you.' I did not thank her, and I do
not remember that beyond noting the words I even felt touched,''
Chaudhuri wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On his wedding night, Chaudhuri, who was then in his early 30s,
was anxious and worried that his wife would not want him to pursue
his passion for collecting recordings of European classical music.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``The horrible suspense about European music had
reawakened in my mind, and I decided to make a clean breast of it
at once, and look the sacrifice, if it was called for, straight in
the face, and begin romance on such terms as were offered to me. I
asked her timidly after a while: `Have you listened to any European
music?' She shook her head to say `no.' Nonetheless, I took another
chance and this time asked: `Have you heard the name of a man
called Beethoven?' she nodded and signified `yes.' I was reassured,
but not wholly satisfied, so I asked again: `Can you spell the
name?' She said slowly, `B, e, e, t, h, o, v, e, n.' I felt very
encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   In Delhi, Chaudhuri contributed to newspapers and in 1955 was
invited on his first trip to Europe. That voyage was the subject of
his second book, ``A Passage to England,'' which appeared in 1959.
E.M. Forster, the author of ``A Passage to India,'' praised the
book, saying of Chaudhuri: ``Besides having integrity and courage,
he possesses enthusiasm, cheerfulness and a good English style.''
Six years later he wrote ``The Continent of Circe: An Essay on the
Peoples of India.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri and his wife moved to Oxford in 1970, never to return
to India. Over the years he became a familiar sight walking the
lanes and quadrangles, a thin, short, spry man in dhoti and kurta,
the traditional loincloth and collarless jacket of India. In 1972
he was a guest lecturer at the University of Chicago and the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He kept on writing and publishing; among his books were
``Scholar Extraordinary,'' a biography of Friedrich Max Muller, a
German-born Orientalist (Chatto &AMP; Windus, 1974); ``Clive of
India,'' (Barrie &AMP; Jenkins, 1975); ``Culture in the Vanity Bag:
Clothing and Adornment in Passing and Abiding India'' (Jaico,
Bombay; 1976); and ``Hinduism: A Religion to Live By'' (Oxford
University Press, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1987, Chatto &AMP; Windus published ``Thy Hand, Great
Anarch!,'' the autobiographical work that took up where ``The
Autobiography of an Unknown Indian'' left off in 1921, and
documented Chaudhuri's life until that earlier book appeared in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics admired his accounts of personal experiences but
winced at what some regarded as a grand and idiosyncratic approach
to history, often expressed with flowery erudition.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of that book's publication, the writer was 90 and
with the death of Amiya in 1994, it seemed that his prodigiously
examined life would close without further scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, Oxford University Press brought out Chaudhuri's
``Three Horsemen of the New Apocalypse.'' It began this way: ``The
very first thing I have to tell those who read this book is that it
is being written by a man in his 99th year. I have never read or
heard of any author, however great or productive in his heyday,
doing that. This confession alone will be enough to make the reader
expect only senile babbling from me. It is not for me, however, to
reassure him. He must be his own judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has its share of the author's characteristic fondness
for outrageous or contrarian views. For openers, the three horsemen
of the title are identified as Nationalism, Individualism and
Democracy. Decadence, he wrote, was on the march in India, Britain
and the United States, where its rise was best reflected in the
decline of the institution of marriage. But while some passages
still stung and the allusions still dazzled, the book was far
shorter, and sketchier, than what had come before. Turning 100, the
writer, it seemed, was finally running out of time.

<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. _ After the television reporters finished their
stand-ups in the fields of stunted corn and the orating politicians
departed the shade of the front porch, the Harshmans still had a
drought on their hands and a farm crisis the family described as
the worst since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of ... spin _ that's the right word, isn't it?''
the family's gray-haired matriarch, Janice Harshman, asked
pleasantly as the clutch of federal and state officials drove away
toward Washington in a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 40 troubled farmers gathered here for a news
conference on the drought conditions that have bedeviled this
region for three straight years, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
declared West Virginia and parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland,
Pennsylvania and Virginia a drought disaster area and promised
low-interest loans for farmers there.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton and congressional Democrats, reacting to
the drought as a pressing issue, began proposing emergency farm
relief of $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quietly, American farmers and ranchers are losing their
businesses,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, warned in Washington, noting
that net farm income this year was 29 percent below the average of
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Frederick, Mrs. Harshman's 41-year-old son, Vaughn, who
played host to Glickman, gratefully accepted the politicians' words
in lieu of rain. Even so, he emphasized that the natural disaster
of the drought, though painful, was only compounding and
underlining American farmers' far more deeply rooted crisis: a
world market glut and depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure don't need any more loans,'' Harshman said, adding that
the government should show as much alarm for the farmers' problems
in world markets as it did Monday for the drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a fair market and fair playing field,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loans won't do it, we need  &UR; prices,''  &LR; agreed Christie
Brandenburg, Harshman's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Down from the porch steps, other farmers said that while general
price decline in a wide array of produce might be their biggest
problem, the water shortage was certainly an added burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pastures are nonexistent, just dried-up exercise yards for
the livestock,'' said Glenn Eaves. He described already cutting
into next winter's forage supplies for his 5,000 head of livestock,
with the financial damages rolling well over into next year,
whether it rains soon or not.
</P>
<P>
   With the news conference sparking larger complaints about the
general state of the farm economy, Glickman could only agree during
a later tour of drought-ridden farmlands here and in West Virginia,
where he accepted disaster aid requests from state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had four years of worldwide record crop produce,'' he
noted, standing for a photograph by a waist-high healthy soybean
plant and a shin-high version wilted from drought. ``That's never
happened before in human history. You have a double whammy of low
prices plus a natural disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   His hopes and prayers, the secretary told the farmers, are for
Congress to allocate emergency funds for the suffering farmers
along the lines of the $6 billion emergency appropriation last year
when farmers in the Southwest were struck by drought. In the face
of the farmers' complaints, he also had to concede that the 1996
Farm Reform Act, linked to an open world market, ``needs mending''
to protect American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live long enough, you'll see the cycle of history come
back and hit you,'' he declared as the farmers stood and listened,
privately noting that the emergency proposals were more about loans
than grants for needed emergency feed supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing will turn, I'm convinced of it,'' Glickman said of
the drought as he joked that a federal meteorologist using a cell
phone at the rear of the crowd ``was on the line with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the audience, far from banking on divine
intervention, talked yearningly of the past when government policy
was built less around free-market vagaries and more around price
supports and subsidies to brace them through hard times. They
laughed out loud when one speaker talked of possibly freeing up
forage from government conservation lands to help farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' one farmer shouted. ``That's all dried up.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought-stricken counties in the East Coast farm belt running up
into central New York have been submitting requests through their
governors for emergency agricultural assistance, Glickman said.
While his immediate options center mainly on low-interest loans, he
said Congress would likely consider an emergency package of more
direct aid. There was no immediate estimate on Capitol Hill of the
chances of such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's drought, the $6 billion emergency aid package
included direct payments to farmers for crop and livestock damage
as well as for lost income. ``I don't know what we're going to end
up with,'' Glickman said of the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening promised farmers $3 million in
state aid, not loans. He emphasized that small and medium family
farms were especially vulnerable to drought pressures while large
corporate farms were better able to capitalize against hard times.
``This is about farmers fighting with their families for
survival,'' the governor declared, warning that the alternative
might be more farms plowed under for housing subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Mrs. Harshman agreed after the politicians
trailed off through the family's parched fields. ``The only option
we're being left with is  &UR; subdivision &LR; ,'' she declared darkly, as
if she were talking of the plague of spider mites that has swept
across the soybean crop because of the drought.

KENNEDY RAISES $2.4M, SOME FROM PACS, FOR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy, scrambling to avoid the
scare he suffered in the 1994 election, raised more than $2 million
in the first six months of the year, including $340,000 from
sources he once snubbed: political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   With no Republican yet in contention, Kennedy Monday released a
midyear report that shows his campaign has nearly $2.4 million on
hand as he gears up for the 2000 election and tries to defend the
seat he has controlled since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Senator John F. Kerry's campaign fund remains
burdened by debt, nearly three years after he won a bruising
re-election race against then-Governor William F. Weld. Kerry's
midyear report shows his committee still owes $175,000, despite his
predictions that the debt would be erased by now.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who disdains the fundraising grind, raised $643,541 in
the first six months of 1999, yet his campaign maintains the
nagging debt and has only $9,589 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry owed $2 million immediately after his race against Weld.
Hee has since resisted tapping the personal fortune of his wife,
Theresa Heinz, as he has struggled to eliminate the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Through his spokesman, Kerry expressed satisfaction with his
fundraising performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of the ugly realities of modern American
politics, this is an impressive achievement,'' said Kerry's
spokesman, Jim Jordan. ``He has managed to raise a stunning amount
of money over the past two years or so and is essentially out from
under the debt of 1996 and now can look forward to 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kerry, who does not accept PAC contributions, Kennedy's
six-month receipts nearly matched the $393,000 he tallied in PAC
money during all of 1997 and 1998. Kennedy swore off PAC funds for
his 1994 race against Mitt Romney, but changed his mind after
Romney spent $7.6 million and gave Kennedy the scare of his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kennedy prevailed in 1994, he spent $10.4 million,
including $1.25 million of his own fortune. And he has made clear
that he wants to avoid a similar scenario next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy already has amassed as much cash as he had on hand at
the end of 1993, when he entered that election year with $2.4
million in his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his fundraising effort this year was his 67th
birthday party in Boston, when he received about $500,000 for the
2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Kennedy is looking forward to the campaign,'' a
spokesman said Monday after releasing his mid-year report. ``He has
strong issues to run on, and he is gratified by the strong support
he is receiving from the people of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kennedy's fundraising tentacles reach across the country,
from Boston to New York to Washington to Florida to Louisiana to
Chicago to Las Vegas to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In PAC money and individual donations, the senator obtained tens
of thousands of dollars from trial lawyers, lobbyists, health-care
professionals, and a vast array of corporate and union interests.
</P>
<P>
   His individual donors included West Coast celebrities such as
rock musician, Don Henley, and television producer Norman Lear, and
East Coast financial titans such as Peter S. Lynch, vice chairman
of Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman emeritus of Archer
Daniels Midland, the agriculture conglomerate, donated $5,000. The
Reggie family of Louisiana, relatives of Kennedy's wife, Vicki,
contributed $7,000. And the extended family of Steven Grossman,
president of Massachusetts Envelope and a former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, continued its prodigious giving,
steering $10,000 to Kennedy's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, Kennedy accepted $1,000 from Farhad Azima,
a Missouri businessman whose contribution the senator returned two
years ago amid questions about Azima's past. The Democratic
National Committee also refunded $137,000 to Azima in 1997 after
published reports linked Azima's aircraft charter company to the
Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Azima has since denied any wrongdoing, and Kennedy is among
several candidates and campaign committees who have agreed to
accept Azima's contributions.

COMMENTARY: THE DUMB OLD PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columnists for The New York Times are not allowed to endorse
politicians, but I'm going to break that rule just once and come
out and say it: I'm a Trent Lott man. Really.
</P>
<P>
   I'm for Lott because he appears intent on holding to the extreme
Republican position _ that we pass an across-the-board tax cut that
gives away virtually the entire projected budget surplus, and that
there be no compromise with the more realistic Clinton proposal.
I'm for Lott because his extremism guarantees a Clinton veto of the
whole tax bill, and, given the idiotic debate on this issue, that
is the best outcome we could have right now. Because with no new
tax bill, just gridlock, nothing changes. Gridlock when you're
running a deficit is terrible. But gridlock when you're running a
surplus is a blessing. It means the surplus just keeps piling up
and goes to paying down the national debt. That reduces government
borrowing and lowers interest rates, which means lower mortgage,
student loan and credit card payments for everyone _ the best tax
cut of all.
</P>
<P>
   So I say, ``Go, Trent, go!'' _ take the Republicans right over
the waterfalls, insure the Clinton veto, and then we can wait for a
more sane Republican leadership, knowing that in the meantime the
national debt is being repaid. It's too bad it has to come to this,
but there's no other option at a time when the GOP has simply
become the Dumb Old Party _ the DOP _ which is so lost and divided
it can only agree on one big dumb idea _ an irresponsible tax cut
to feed consumption in a white-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing is any Republican strategic concept about where
America is today and what sorts of investments will be required for
American workers, society and armed forces to thrive in an
increasingly globalized world. Committing to long-term tax
reduction schemes _ without any strategic vision _ is like going to
war not only without an exit strategy but without even an entry
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., the Republican author of the $792 billion
tax giveaway, said it was ``a giant step forward to give the
American people a tax break.'' How about a giant step to prepare
the American people for the next century? A real domestic strategy,
Republican or Democratic, would start with an honest plan for
tackling the twin debts of the 1980s _ the huge deficits run up by
the Reagan administration and the Democratic Congress in those
days, plus the unfunded liabilities of the future in both Social
Security and Medicare. Really eliminating these twin debts would
put America on a fiscal footing that would not only make us the
envy of the world, but insure our dominance well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   What the Republican leadership doesn't understand is that in
this age of globalization you not only need to get the size of your
government down, you also have to get the quality of your
government and workers up. You don't win by mindlessly shrinking
government alone. And that's why a domestic strategic vision must
include investment in the quality of government _ whether it is
improving the FAA, police, schools or the FBI _ and the quality of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Investments in innovation, human capital and new technologies
are what will drive our growth in the future, much more than plant
and equipment. And a public policy focused on promoting the former,
with tax incentives, not the latter, with huge capital gains cuts,
is critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this new economy a worker's security will not come from a
union card or the promise of lifetime employment at a big
company,'' notes Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute.
``It will come from the quality of the tools you carry around in
your own head. We need a tax policy that will encourage lifetime
learning, so every worker can master the skills for global
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   We also need investment in families and communities, through
family-friendly tax policies, because families and communities are
the best safety nets for sustaining people in today's high-pressure
labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with the whole Clinton budget (I'd have no tax
cut), but at least it is based on a realistic vision of the world
we are heading into. I wish there were a real Republican
alternative. The country would benefit from that debate. Instead,
what we have now is one party saying, ``The world is new, and this
is the only way to tackle it,'' and the other saying, ``The world
is flat, and there's nothing new to be done.''

WOMEN CITE LACK OF CHANCE TO ADVANCE AS REASON FOR LEAVING FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)  (mk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with what she claims is sexual discrimination
because she was denied a promotion to managing director, Allison
Schieffelin took her case against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She chose to stay with the
firm as a senior saleswoman as a way of ``trying to reform the
institution,'' her lawyer told a reporter last week.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ms. Schieffelin so unusual is not her belief that
Wall Street is a hard place for women to succeed. Whatever the
merits of her individual case, debate about discrimination at
various firms focuses on degree, not whether it exists. But what is
extremely rare is Ms. Schieffelin's decision to stay and fight when
most women who think they are encountering the glass ceiling simply
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a practical point of view, when I began litigation with
the firm, I was more or less perceived as a pariah in the
industry,'' said Ann Hopkins, whose sex-discrimination case against
Price Waterhouse, one of the major accounting firms, was ultimately
heard by the Supreme Court in 1989. Criticized for being ``macho''
and in need of ``a course at charm school,'' Ms. Hopkins prevailed
in her quest to become partner, the equivalent of managing director
at a Wall Street firm. She rejoined Price Waterhouse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Most women would rather go quietly. Catalyst, a nonprofit group
in New York that studies women in the workplace, has conducted more
than 500 exit interviews with women managers who left companies and
firms in the 1990s. While the vast majority of the women claimed
that they were leaving to spend more time with their families, only
15 percent were still at home six months after they left.
</P>
<P>
   So why did they leave? Nearly three quarters of the women told
Catalyst that they were greatly influenced by their belief that
there was a lack of opportunity for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are slowly recognizing the problem. Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, for example, created a committee of senior partners in 1992
to figure out why so many women were leaving. After interviewing
women who had quit and those who still worked there, the firm's
partners discovered that many women believed that Deloitte was not
flexible enough for them to successfully balance work with the rest
of their lives, and that they were concerned about their chances to
move up. Having made a push to address these issues, by offering
flexible schedules and trying to be more inclusive, Deloitte has
closed the turnover gap between men and women. The percentage of
women who leave each year has dropped from 29 percent in 1991 to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war for talent is not a myth,'' said Sheila Wellington,
the president of Catalyst. ``There is a great deal of concern for
retention.''
</P>
<P>
   But many women hesitate to speak up because they are not sure
that they are being discriminated against. Promotions, especially
at the top firms, are not guaranteed, after all, and some figure
that the powers that be passed them over because they did not
recognize their brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   One female investment professional, who spoke only on the
condition that she not be identified, said that she believed she
was denied a promotion in part because she was a woman but decided
not to bother wasting time trying to figure it out. Instead, she
simply joined another firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend 10 or 15 years hitting the glass ceiling?'' agreed
Janet Tiebout Hanson, who spent 14 years at Goldman Sachs before
founding her own investment firm, Milestone Capital Management.
``Why not go directly to Go and collect $200?''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Hanson's case, she said she believes that the decision to
take three years off for her children derailed her career. ``You
can't leave and have children and come back,'' she said. When she
returned to the firm in 1991, technology had transformed her
business, leaving her too far behind to catch up. She quit to start
Milestone, an institutional money-management firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Few women would ever want to bring a lawsuit, even if they
believed that they had the grounds. Others question whether
progress is best made by bringing a lawsuit. They say that
litigation makes life even more difficult for women by making the
workplace even less friendly. ``It was hard enough to be part of
the inner sanctum,'' Ms. Hanson said. ``I think it is going to be
much, much harder'' if women turn increasingly to the courts for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But what motivates someone to bring a lawsuit is not always
easily explained. Ms. Hopkins, for one, is quick to admit that she
was not acting ``rationally and analytically'' when she waged her
long battle against Price Waterhouse. In the preface to her book,
``So Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way,'' published in 1996 by
the University of Massachusetts Press, she describes herself as
being characterized as ``victim, villain, heroine, pioneer,
zealot'' and says that she is ``none of these.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a value-driven person,'' she said, describing a value
system that places a priority on bringing about change, when
needed. While returning to the firm was not easy, she said that she
was not without allies. ``The people who didn't like me still
didn't like me,'' she said. ``The people who liked me still liked
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins describes herself as ``very comfortable'' in her
current environment. In the Arlington, Va., office where she works
as a consultant, she said that there are enough senior women to
make her environment a good one in which to work. And people have
come to expect her to lobby on behalf of those who may be
underrepresented. ``I'm a pro-active outspoken advocate'' for the
minority, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also counsels patience for anyone trying to seek change. In
1983, the number of women who were partners in the United States at
Price Waterhouse was about 1 percent, she said. When she came back
to the firm, it was about 5 percent. Today, about 10 percent of the
partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the successor firm, are women.
Maybe in another 15 years, she said, there will be enough women to
make the issue of gender moot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins said that it never occurred to her to give up on
Price Waterhouse and move on to something else. The moment the
courts cleared the way for her to return to the job she loved, she
turned in her notice at the World Bank. And has the firm changed
for the better? One can't help but note that Ms. Hopkins' daughter,
Tela, joined PricewaterhouseCoopers last September after graduating
from college. ``I think it's a good profession,'' is all her mom
would say.

MACCORMACK INTERIM   HEAD OF UMASS-DARTMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Jean MacCormack, a longtime top administrator at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, has been named interim
chancellor of UMass-Dartmouth, university President William M.
Bulger said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MacCormack will replace Peter H. Cressy, who announced last
month that he would step down as of Sept. 1 to head a liquor
lobbying group in Washington. MacCormack will serve as head of the
6,600-student campus for no more than two years, Bulger said,
during the search for a permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of UMass-Amherst and a former secondary school
teacher, MacCormack came to the Boston campus in 1980, and was in
charge of the development and expansion of several programs the
university has run with local schools. Now deputy chancellor and
vice chancellor for Administration and Finance, she oversees a $147
million budget and 2,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed to the vice chancellor's job in 1988, MacCormack
oversaw many of the cuts brought on by the state budget crisis of
the early 1990s. University officials credit her with managing the
revitalization of the campus, which has included the addition of
graduate programs, improvements in technology, and the development
of a $60 million student center to be opened in 2002. From June
1995 to January 1996, she served as interim chancellor of the
Boston campus while Chancellor Sherry Penney served as interim
president of the five-campus UMass system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed first-hand the skill and determination that Dr.
MacCormack brought to the task of keeping the Boston campus a
vibrant community during an exceedingly difficult time,'' UMass
board of trustees chairman Robert Karam said in a statement
announcing the appointment. ``Now, thanks in large measure to the
efforts she made then, the Boston campus not only survived, but has
become a thriving urban center of educational opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my knowledge of the South Coast and Jean
MacCormack,'' said Karam, a Fall River native and graduate of the
Dartmouth campus, ``this is a great fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cressy, a retired rear admiral, had won widespread respect for
creating partnerships between the Dartmouth campus and local
businesses, schools, and government, trying to bring the economic
recovery that has lifted the rest of the state to one of its more
stubbornly depressed areas. MacCormack said in a statement that she
expected to be an ``active partner'' in continuing that work.

 &HT;    Coke causing environmental problems, group warns
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Athens, Ga.-based environmental group, claiming two
out of every three clear-plastic Coca-Cola soft drink bottles end
up in a landfill, has launched an ad campaign to pressure the
company to reuse more of those containers.
</P>
<P>
   GrassRoots Recycling Network, a 3-year-old group whose financial
backers have included the Turner Foundation, Greenpeace and Sierra
Club chapters, began taking out ads in The New York Times on Monday
and said more are planned in other markets. The group said Coke
stopped using recycled plastic, or polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), in the United States four years ago. It said the company now
uses virgin-plastic instead of collecting and reusing the vast
number PET bottles discarded annually.
</P>
<P>
   GrassRoots Recycling Network said the world's largest soft drink
company is being targeted because of its leading market position
and because the company has abandoned a commitment to use
recyclable plastic for its beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switching from recycled glass bottles and aluminum cans,
Coke's move to plastics is creating a growing problem for the
environment, recycling and taxpayers,'' said GrassRoots Recycling
Network President Rick Best. The group specifically mentioned the
company's use of 20-ounce, single-serving plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola acknowledges that it doesn't use recycled soft drink
containers, but says it spends $2 billion annually on containers
that are recycled, including cans, bottles and wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Bill Hensel said Coke found it wasn't
cost-effective from a production standpoint to recycle its plastic
containers and knows of no competitor that does so. Hensel added
that Coke has been conducting tests over the past 12 months to see
if it has become more economically viable to recycle PET bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola does use PET containers in countries where it is
required. The drop in the market for PET containers, which can be
turned into carpet and other products, underlies much of the
frustration in the recyling industry. As the recycled plastics
market becomes increasingly unprofitable, frustrated collectors are
dumping used containers into landfills.
</P>
<P>
   GrassRoots Recycling Network says it isn't calling for a boycott
of Coca-Cola. The group says that if producers like Coca-Cola would
recycle more of their containers, more companies would follow suit
and the pressure on landfills would ease as the market for PET
improves.

JUDGE DISMISSES MOST CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST CHRISTIAN COALITION BY
FEC
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the beleaguered Christian
Coalition, a federal judge on Monday rejected most charges in a
lawsuit that accused the group of illegally distributing millions
of voter guides and mailings to promote Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Joyce Green took issue with the Federal
Election Commission, which in filing the lawsuit here three years
ago argued that the coalition's nonpartisan posture was a sham. She
dismissed charges that the organization sought to improperly help
candidates, including former President George Bush and Sen. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, through its literature, telephone banks
and other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was not completely vindicated. Judge Green ruled
that it must pay a civil penalty _ the amount has yet to be
determined _ to the election commission for advocating the election
of Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia during his drive in 1994 to become
speaker of the House. She also ruled that the coalition improperly
shared its mailing list with the Senate campaign in 1994 of Oliver
L. North, a major figure in the Iran-Contra affair who is now a
talk radio personality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall ruling was welcome news for the coalition,
the largest organization of religious conservatives, which has been
riven by deep financial problems and leadership turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the coalition acknowledged that its application to the
Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status had not been
approved and that the organization would reorganize in a move to
retain its influence. The IRS action is separate from the court
ruling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decisive victory for First Amendment freedom for all
groups that want to involve themselves in federal issues,'' Pat
Robertson, the television evangelist who founded the coalition in
1989, said in a telephone interview. ``It shows that all of those
critics who have been trying to scare the churches under the guise
of revocation of tax exemption are just not telling the truth.''
Ron Harris, a spokesman for the election commision, said: ``We
don't normally comment on litigation matters. We're still looking
at the ruling _ it's 117 pages.'' In an interview when the suit was
filed, Lee Ann Elliott, a Republican who was then the commission's
chairwoman, said of the coalition, ``There was a majority of the
commission that felt they had gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of tightening campaign finance laws argued that the
verdict will encourage other organizations across the spectrum _
from environmentalists to abortion groups to unions _ to bend and
stretch the laws by trying to help candidates but not reporting
their efforts as independent expenditures or in-kind contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly another large piece of plaster which is
falling off the ceiling of campaign finance regulation,'' said
Robert F. Bauer, a Democratic lawyer who specializes in campaign
finance law. ``It's a serious setback for the commission's ability
to control unregistered organizations or issue advertising of
independent groups of all stripes.''

 &HT;    No longer superfluous, Millwood simply super
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The implication that Kevin Millwood has driven the
Braves' pitching staff is not particularly fair, partly because it
is blatant understatement. More precisely, he saved the staff,
bought it time and watched its back during the kind of season
Braves pitching was supposedly immune to.
</P>
<P>
   And that is still understatement, because in the process,
Millwood has become something more than any scout thought possible.
In theory, he remains the Braves' fourth starter, a roll of the
dice out of Richmond a couple of summers ago that turned into a
cute sidebar to the game's glamour rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But when he makes his 22nd start of the season tonight, the
Pittsburgh Pirates face one of the National League's most complete
pitchers. Millwood (12-5) is allowing a .180 average to
right-handed hitters, the lowest in the league. His hits-per-inning
rate of 0.83 is second only to Arizona's Randy Johnson. And those
hits don't go that far, either. Millwood is allowing a .358
slugging percentage, third only to Los Angeles' Kevin Bown and
Houston's Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   On a staff of stars, Millwood this summer casts his own light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the first part of the first half, it wasn't there,''
John Smoltz said. ``I was able to start off pretty hot (at 5-0),
but trouble hit me, and Kevin just took over. He went on a nice
streak,'' and won nine games in 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew (Tom) Glavine and (Greg) Maddux were going to turn it
around,'' Smoltz said. ``I'm still not in a position to be counted
on yet, but Kevin basically saved us from a dire need no one ever
said we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Millwood was such a mechanical mess, the Braves
discussed returning him to Richmond. Experimentation with a
changeup in spring camp caused him to lose the proper shoulder
``slot'' for his fastball, and he routinely threw the pitch over
the heart of the plate. In his first three starts, he allowed 18
hits and nine walks in only 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But two things happened. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone shortened
his stride at delivery, which helped correct the shoulder problem.
And Millwood began throwing his curveball, heretofore unseen in the
majors. Thrown around 77-79 mph, it provided the offspeed pitch he
lacked, made his 85-88-mph slider appear more sinister and his
94-mph fastball quicker and effectively recast him as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the back of my head, I didn't think it was good
enough to use, or maybe my slider was good enough before that I
didn't have to use it,'' MIllwood said. ``I think a lot of times
people say that, if you're throwing a curveball and a slider, one
is going to take away from the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen it. The curve gives me something slower to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood ranks 10th in the league -- and first on the Braves --
with 116 strikeouts. After posting a 4.08 ERA last summer in his
17-win season, he has cut down nearly a run to 3.15, third in the
league, behind Johnson (2.62) and Houston's Mike Hampton (3.05).
Hall of Famer Don Sutton does not hesitate to compare Millwood to
Philadelphia Curt Schilling, a durable power pitcher capable of
reaching late innings every start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's not going to be your really pretty finesse artist out
there,'' Mazzone said. ``He's very proud of his fastball and
rightfully so. He's going to attack you with it. But he also has a
better idea of how he wants to pitch to hitters. He's also a guy
who can pitch north and south.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that willingness to throw his fastball in the upper
reaches of the strike zone that has made Millwood's curveball, and
its rush to the knees, a greater mystery. He also is refining a
modified split-finger fastball he has thrown it only twice in game
situations that will give him four options. All of that, before he
has had time to make 60 major-league starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of fight in him,'' Mazzone said. ``He doesn't
say a lot, but I think he feels now that he is a part. Last year,

belongs. He'll never say that, because he's that type of
individual. But he's no longer an additional starter but one of the
main parts.''

NIRAD CHAUDHURI, INDIAN AUTHOR, DIES IN ENGLAND AT 101 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas)  (Eds., a longer, 2-take version, OBIT-CHAUDHURI, moved earlier.)
(DW) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nirad C. Chaudhuri, whose first book in English, ``The
Autobiography of an Unknown Indian,'' was written when he was 53
and thought his life would soon end, died on Sunday at 101. He saw
it acclaimed as a classic and wrote many other provocative,
crotchety and elegant works of prose, completing his most recent
book in his 99th year.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri died at his home in Oxford, England, where he had
lived since leaving India when he was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri drew upon his personal experiences as he chronicled
the transformation of India from British colony to independent
state. When ``Autobiography'' appeared in 1951 he became known as a
writer of the first rank and as an interpreter _ and raging
defender _ of the vanished civilization of the Bengal Hindu
aristocracy into which he had been born.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri's book originated in despair. He was not pleased with
the rise of Indian nationalism or the imminent withdrawal of the
British from the subcontinent it had ruled since 1757. He saw
himself as the last survivor of the Bengal Renaissance, the
cultural movement that was initiated in the 19th century and he
felt more personal frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   His idea was to weave recollections of personal experience with
accounts of the history he had lived through from his birth in the
village of Kishorganj on Nov. 23, 1897, until 1921, when he failed
to gain his master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Nirad Chandra Chaudhuri set out to write ``Autobiography'' in
1947, the year of India's independence and partition. Bengal was
divided, with Chaudhuri's birthplace within what was then East
Pakistan and is now Bangladesh. Every day in his Delhi apartment,
before he went to work writing news commentaries for All India
Radio, he typed 2,500 words of autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri wrote of the humiliating end of his academic career,
how his friends considered him a failure and how, when he was 34,
his father regarded him as the only one of his six sons who would
never make his way in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext of the book and of much of Chaudhuri's subsequent
work was that the Bengal Renaissance was being overwhelmed by a
combination of British racism, Indian nationalism and the rise of
democracy. He felt that Gandhi and Nehru had thrown away India's
chance of fulfilling its destiny as a Western country.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas were in a controversial dedication in Chaudhuri's
autobiography: ``To the memory of the British Empire in India,
which conferred subjecthood on us but withheld citizenship; to
which yet every one of us threw out the challenge: `civis
Britannicus sum,' because all that was good and living within us
was made, shaped, and quickened by the same British rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lines infuriated many of Chaudhuri's countrymen, who never
read much beyond the dedication and who came to regard the author
not so much as the Bengali supremacist that he was but as a
sycophant for the departed British. In fact, he frequently
described Britain as a decadent society and condemned the British
for their racism directed at Bengalis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Oxford University gave Chaudhuri an honorary
doctorate, the Public Orator, speaking in Latin, offered the
following comment: ``Chaudhuri expressed his views on contemporary
events with a frankness which was too great to make him popular
with his fellow Indians, praising certain aspects of the Raj, and
lacking in the requisite enthusiasm for the birth of New India. But
with passage of time his reputation at home is now restored. The
Unknown Indian of his book has deservedly won fame and
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the transformation, he had worked as a government clerk
and as a Bengali editor in Calcutta. In 1937, he became a private
secretary to Sarat Chandra Bose, an important leader of the Indian
National Congress. With the advent of World War II, he became, as
he described it, ``an Englishman except in birth'' and began
preparing commentaries for All India Radio. Chaudhuri left Bengal
in 1942 as the Japanese closed in on the region and the political
leadership of Bengali Hindus was eclipsed by Bengal's Muslim
majority and by non-Bengalis like Gandhi and Nehru.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Delhi, where he became a political commentator on
the radio, a post he lost when ``Autobiography'' appeared.
</P>
<P>
   With him was his wife, Amiya, whom he married in 1932, a bride
whose face he did not see until after the wedding. Originally
influenced by Western ideas, he said, he told his father, a lawyer
and a municipal official, that he proposed to find his own bride.
He spent a year visiting Socialist clubs in fruitless searches for
a mate. Finally, he asked his father to find him a wife by
traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he praised his father for selecting such a
remarkable woman, one who had followed him around the world,
endured his poverty and tolerated his eccentricities to join him in
learning about opera and wine and who bore him three sons, Dhruva,
Kirti and Prith, who are his survivors.
</P>
<P>
   On his wedding night, Chaudhuri, who was then in his early 30s,
was worried that his wife would not want him to pursue his passion
for collecting recordings of European classical music.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``I asked her timidly after a while: `Have you
listened to any European music?' She shook her head to say `no.'
Nonetheless, I took another chance and this time asked: `Have you
heard the name of a man called Beethoven?' she nodded and signified
`yes.' I was reassured, but not wholly satisfied, so I asked again:
`Can you spell the name?' She said slowly, `B, e, e, t, h, o, v, e,
n.' I felt very encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Chaudhuri was invited on his first trip to Europe. That
voyage was the subject of his second book, ``A Passage to
England,'' which appeared in 1959. E.M. Forster, the author of ``A
Passage to India,'' praised the book. Six years later, he wrote
``The Continent of Circe: An Essay on the Peoples of India.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri and his wife moved to Oxford in 1970. Over the years
he became a familiar sight walking the quadrangles, a thin, short,
spry man in dhoti and kurta, the traditional loincloth and
collarless jacket of India. In 1972, he was a guest lecturer at the
University of Chicago and the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Among his books were ``Scholar Extraordinary,'' a biography of
Friedrich Max Muller, a German-born Orientalist (Chatto &AMP; Windus,
1974); ``Clive of India,'' (Barrie &AMP; Jenkins, 1975); ``Culture in
the Vanity Bag: Clothing and Adornment in Passing and Abiding
India'' (Jaico, Bombay; 1976) and ``Hinduism: A Religion to Live
By'' (Oxford University Press, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Chatto &AMP; Windus published ``Thy Hand, Great Anarch!,''
the autobiographical work that took up where ``The Autobiography of
an Unknown Indian'' left off in 1921, and documented Chaudhuri's
life until that earlier book appeared in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The writer was 90 and with the death of Amiya in 1994, it seemed
that his life would close without further scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, Oxford University Press brought out Chaudhuri's
``Three Horsemen of the New Apocalypse.'' It began this way: ``The
very first thing I have to tell those who read this book is that it
is being written by a man in his 99th year. I have never read or
heard of any author, however great or productive in his heyday,
doing that. This confession alone will be enough to make the reader
expect only senile babbling from me. It is not for me, however, to
reassure him. He must be his own judge.''

STOCKS END LOWER AMID CONCERN OVER EMPLOYMENT REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices ended lower Monday after a bout of late
selling erased what had been healthy gains.
</P>
<P>
   Equities received a nice boost during the morning after a
monthly report from the National Association of Purchasing
Management showed that the manufacturing sector in July was not as
strong as some analysts had projected.
</P>
<P>
   But the positive momentum evaporated on worries that the July
employment report, scheduled to be released on Friday, would help
persuade the Federal Reserve Board that short-term interest rates
need to be raised again at its meeting in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traders and analysts cautioned about reading too much
into the market's moves at this point in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of folks who are nervous about what the
Fed might do at its meeting later this month,'' said Rob Cohen, a
managing director and co-head of block trading at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``But it will be very difficult to draw a lot of
conclusions about the market's direction based on what happens over
the next couple of weeks, because the market will be pushed around
on light volume. I don't think we will have a meaningful move one
way or another until the Fed meeting at the end of August.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.19 points, or 0.1
percent, to 10,645.96. Early in the day, the Dow was up by more
than 130 points. It was the seventh decline in the blue-chip index
over the last eight sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in shares of Intel helped to limit the declines in
broader market measures. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
0.67 point, to 1,328.05, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.86
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,623.63.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks fared poorly, and Internet issues were punished.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.14 points, or
0.5 percent, to 442.63.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume remained light. Just less than 650 million shares
changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the fourth-lowest
total this year. Volume on the Nasdaq market was 754.2 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
said stock prices might have been expected to bounce a bit on
Monday, given the extent of their recent declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was entitled to some sort of reflex bounce, but
there was no breadth to it,'' he said. ``Between now and late
September or early October, I think we will see further weakness,
with the major averages falling anywhere from 10 percent to 15
percent off their recent highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the semiconductor maker, was one of the session's
brightest stocks. Its shares rose 2 5/16, to 71 5/16, on optimism
that its new, faster chips would generate faster sales.
</P>
<P>
   However, computer stocks, which performed well early, ran into
selling pressure as the day progressed.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the Dow's biggest drag, losing 3 7/16, to 122\.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about prospects for breakthrough medications helped to
push up prices of biotechnology company stocks. Amgen gained 1 7/8,
to 78}. Biogen jumped 4, to 72 13/16. And Genentech gained 3, to
145.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet stocks, America Online continued its recent
slump, falling 2 5/16, to 92 13/16. Yahoo slid 4 1/8, to 132 5/16.
And Amazon.com fell 6 1/16, to 94.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Chicago Title jumped 5 5/16, to 48 1/16, after
Fidelity National Financial said it had agreed to buy the company
for $1.2 billion, or $52 a share, creating the United States'
largest insurer of property titles.
</P>
<P>
   And Varlen rose 3 57/64, to 41 49/64, after it agreed to be
acquired by Amsted Industries for $42 a share.

TESTS TRACE SHROUD OF TURIN TO JERUSALEM BEFORE 8TH CENTURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel, Italy, Spain, N.C.)   By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ An analysis of pollen grains and plant images taken
from the Shroud of Turin, believed by millions of Christians to be
the burial shroud of Jesus, places the cloth's origin in or near
Jerusalem before the 8th Century, scientists said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The finding appeared to contradict radiocarbon dating tests
which in 1988 led a group of experts to put the origin of the cloth
at between 1260 A.D. and 1390 A.D. and to conclude that the shroud
was most likely a medieval forgery. But revisionist scholars have
raised many doubts since then, Monday's disclosure being the
latest. While the scientists who issued the report said they did
not question the accuracy of the 1988 tests, they nevertheless
disputed the validity of the claim that the shroud was of medieval
European origin.
</P>
<P>
   The rectangular linen shroud, which bears faint traces of a
man's face, is one of the most venerated objects in the Roman
Catholic Church. Many of the faithful continued to embrace it as
authentic and capable of making miracles even after the Vatican,
after the 1988 tests, said it appeared inauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   Avinoam Danin, a botantist at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, said at a news conference at the 16th International
Botanical Congress here that flowers and other plant parts
apparently were placed on the shroud, leaving pollen grains and
imprints on the cloth. Analysis of the grains and the images, he
said, identified them as coming from species that could be found
only in the months of March and April in the Jerusalem region.
</P>
<P>
   The pollen of one plant, a species of thistle called Gundelia
tournefortii, was especially abundant on the cloth, and an image of
the plant was identified near the image of the man's shoulder. Some
scientists say this may have been the species from which Jesus'
crown of thorns was plaited.
</P>
<P>
   Two pollen grains of this species were also found on another
ancient fabric, called the Sudarium of Oviedo, which many believe
to be the burial face cloth of Jesus. A First-Century origin for
the face cloth has been documented, the scientists here said, and
it has been in the Cathedral of Oviedo in Spain since the 8th
Century. The shroud has been kept in Turin, Italy, since 1578.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sudarium and the shroud appear to carry type AB blood
stains, and the stains are in a similar pattern, Danin said.
``There is no way that similar patterns of blood stains, probably
of the identical blood type, with the same type of pollen grains,
could not be synchronic _ covering the same body,'' he said. ``The
pollen association and the similarities in the blood stains in the
two cloths provide clear evidence that the shroud originated before
the 8th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the apparent contradiction between the 1988 radiocarbon
dating test and the new findings, Danin noted that the analysis of
a decade ago was performed on only one small corner of the cloth,
while the new one involves the whole shroud and compares it with a
cloth known to exist before the 8th Century.
</P>
<P>
   While the radiocarbon date represented an accurate reading of
the sample, the sample itself may have been contaminated, said Alan
D. Whanger, of the Duke University Medical Center, an expert on the
shroud.
</P>
<P>
   The sample came from a water-stained, scorched edge of the
shroud, he said, adding that carbon could have been added to the
cloth, obscuring the true date of its origin. Also, living fungi
and bacteria have been discovered growing inside the fibers said,
and this could also have contaminated the sample.
</P>
<P>
   A peer-reviewed report of the pollen and plant evidence is to be
published this summer by the Missouri Botanical Garden Press.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO DOWNPLAY `ABUSE' COMMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton had a ``generally favorable''
reaction to views expressed by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in
a published interview in which she partly blames his ``weaknesses''
for extramarital sex on an abusive childhood.
</P>
<P>
   While saying the president is ``comfortable'' with what Hillary
Clinton says in Talk magazine, White House officials tried to
downplay her description of his having been ``scarred by abuse'' as
a child in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some suggestion about some sort of physical abuse or
something. I can tell you that that's not the case,'' said White
House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``But the issues, the difficult
issues the president faced growing up are a matter of record.''
</P>
<P>
   The new twist on Clinton's extramarital affairs surfaces six
months after the Senate acquitted him of alleged criminal behavior
in the Monica Lewinsky affair and as Hillary Clinton considers a
run for the Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Details from Clinton's childhood, including conflicts with his
abusive stepfather and disagreements between his mother and
grandmother, have been widely known and reported. The conflicts
were detailed in books by the president's mother, author Roger
Morris and Washington Post reporter David Maraniss.
</P>
<P>
   In the article in Talk, Hillary Clinton suggests that her
husband's infidelity was linked to a desire to please women that
grew out of a troubled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by friend and journalist Lucinda Franks about the impact
on her husband of his stepfather's alcohol addiction and physical
mistreatment of his mother, Hillary Clinton replied: ``That's only
the half of it. He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by
abuse. There was a terrible conflict between his mother and
grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to a physical altercation between the
president's mother and grandmother, Edith Cassidy. Cassidy was
outraged that her daughter was planning to marry Roger Clinton, her
second husband. As Virginia Kelley _ her name after marrying
husband No. 3 _ wrote in ``Leading With My Heart,''Cassidy wanted
legal custody of her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was actually announcing that she was willing to rip this
family apart,'' Kelley wrote, recounting how she and her mother
tussled over young Bill, one grabbing his foot, the other his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed that the only way she was going to get my child was
over my dead body,'' Kelley wrote. ``I clutched Bill, who was four
years old. I probably thought he was too young to be seriously
affected by even such scenes as this, but I was dead wrong, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   In her magazine interview, Hillary Clinton said she has endured
``enormous pain, enormous anger'' as a result of her husband's
infidelities. ``But I have been with him half my life, and he is a
very, very good man,'' she said.``We just have a deep connection
that transcends whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she had been told by a psychologist that
``a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the
worst possible situation _ there is always a desire to please each
one.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged in the article that since the Lewinsky affair
the president ``has been working on himself very hard'' and ``has
become more aware of his past and what was causing his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more responsible,
more disciplined,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton had ever sought counseling for possible
emotional problems, Lockhart said he did not know if help was
sought before Clinton was elected president. However, Lockhart
said, since publicly acknowledging his role in the Lewinsky affair
and lying to his family and the nation, the president has continued
ministerial counseling sessions, often by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the president continues to deal with
the ministers that he talked about at the outset. I can't tell you
about the details of that because they are private,'' Lockhart
said. ``But he has sought to work with ministers who he is close
with and friendly with, and that's the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was unsure whether the president knew prior to
the interview that Mrs. Clinton would discuss the incident between
his mother and grandmother. ``He knew some time ago that she'd done
this interview and the story was coming out,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential spokesman said Clinton ``believes that like
many young people, he had difficult times within his family, but he
feels he has been blessed with love and a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president told him that ``from the reports
he's gotten that it's a generally favorable article about the first
lady, that he's comfortable with the views expressed in the article
and the fact that she did the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to say whether Clinton blames events or
tensions from his childhood for affairs with Lewinsky, the former
White House intern, or Gennifer Flowers, a former Arkansas
resident. Instead, Lockhart said, the president has ``stated
openly, publicly, that he is responsible for all of his actions,
and he's working hard to make right some mistakes he's made within
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Clinton's analysis of the president's sexual
misbehavior was designed to help inoculate her in the New York
Senate race, Democrats and Republicans agree it was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was something intended to get this behind her, I
simply don't think it's going to work. I think she's brought it all
back up again,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat
who supports Hillary Clinton's Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea if this was planned or not, but if it
was I wish it hadn't happened,'' Slaughter told Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blankley, who was a spokesman for former Republican House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, said the interview ``is another example'' of
Hillary Clinton showing that she doesn't have ``a light touch in
politics but a heavy hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have made a dignified statement or two,'' Blankley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Hillary Clinton said: ``I want to be judged on
my own merits'' in the Senate race. She is the first presidential
spouse to ever consider a post-White House political career.
Hillary Clinton has formed a political exploratory committee and is
raising money to fund a likely race to replace New York Democratic
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Her likely opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said his
campaign would not try to exploit the first family's marital
troubles. ``I don't believe somebody's private life ... should be
part of a political campaign,'' said Giuliani, who has faced
questions about his own marriage.

HOUSE RECOMMENDS LESS FUNDING FOR SEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when record numbers of Americans are investing their
money and their trust in the stock and bond markets, the House of
Representatives has recommended a budget for the nation's top
securities regulator next year that would require it to cut its
work force by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms approved by the House of Representatives
Appropriations Committee last week, funding for the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the year 2000 would be $324 million, 7.6
percent below the $351 million the commission says it needs to
maintain current staffing and activities. The House is expected to
vote on the funding measure this week before members of Congress
recess.
</P>
<P>
   A diminished SEC budget is the result of stringent caps placed
on discretionary congressional spending in the 1997 budget
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bill that we have, with the exception of defense, is at
or below last year's levels,'' said Elizabeth Morra, communications
director for the House Appropriations Committee. ``It's not a
question of whether we wanted to fund them. It's a question of not
having enough funds to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   At $324 million, the House's recommended budget for the SEC is
well below the $370.8 million funding approved for the commission
by the U.S. Senate in June. At the time, Judd Gregg (R-N.H.),
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said additional
money was needed for the SEC to combat swindlers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between the funding levels by the Senate and the
House will have be reconciled in conference on the Hill this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining its current level of staffing and operations
would require a budget of $351 million, the SEC says cracking down
on the increasingly sophisticated securities frauds that many
investors are falling victim to requires even more money. ``We were
expecting and need a large increase to keep up with the Internet,
additional litigation support and more staffing,'' said James
McConnell, executive director of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to laying off 10 percent of its staff, the
commission said the House's recommended budget would jeopardize the
SEC's ability to bring new fraud cases.
</P>
<P>
   Also at risk would be its monitoring of new market developments
such as the anticipated moves by the New York Stock Exchange and
the National Association of Securities Dealers to become
for-profit, privately held exchanges. Scrutiny of day trading
firms, online brokerage houses and the flock of new, privately run
electronic exchanges would be hindered as well, a spokesman for the
SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said the
House's budget ``would cause very serious consequences for all
investors but especially for small investors. Any substantive
reduction in the enforcement budget would embolden fraudsters to
expand their illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in stocks, combined with the sweeping
transformation that electronic trading has brought to the markets,
has already strained SEC resources. Corporations registered a
record $2.55 trillion in securities with the commission in 1998, up
77 percent from the amount filed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And the total average trading volume of all online brokers was
approximately 340,000 trades per day in late 1998, a 258 percent
increase over electronic trading volume in early 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commission also said that it had brought nearly 100
Internet-related enforcement actions since 1995 and that it
received between 200 and 300 electronic mail messages each day,
many related to possible frauds conducted on the Internet. The
number of complaints from investors about online brokerage services
received by the SEC increased 500 percent from fiscal 1997 through
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC more than pays its freight through fees that it levies
on issuers of securities and on market participants. Thanks to the
robust stock market, the Congressional Budget Office projects that
next year the commission will collect $501 million in fees that
will then go into the so-called appropriations pot from which
Congress funds the SEC and other agencies. Those fees would exceed
the House's funding level for the SEC by $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Harold Rogers, chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary, which parcels out
funding to the SEC, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the commission said:
``Online trading now accounts for approximately one-third of all
retail stock trades. Increasing our staff to maintain and enhance
Internet surveillance, conduct investigations and prosecute
violations of Internet fraud is absolutely essential to our efforts
to effectively protect investors.''

 &HT;    Salesman grabs gun, prevents tragedy
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVONIA, Ga. _ Salesman Brian Green found himself holding a
jammed handgun while a cocked and loaded 12-gauge shotgun was
pointed at his chest, allegedly by an angry co-worker who had been
fired hours earlier at a pickup truck parts business.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had worked at the northeast Georgia store only four
days, wrested control of the shotgun, wrestled the gunman to the
ground and held him there until police arrived Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Oh no. My kids aren't going to have a daddy,'
'' Green, a 28-year-old father of three pre-schoolers, said Monday.
``Would I have done it again? If I knew the gun would work, I would
have done it again. If I had really had to shoot him, I would have
felt bad about it. But coulda, shoulda didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery C. Green, 36, was in the Franklin County Jail Monday and
could go to prison with no chance for parole if convicted. Franklin
County Sheriff's Department investigator Chad Bennett said Johnson
faces charges that include kidnapping, making terroristic threats
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had been fired over a missing $900.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Carr, the owner of O.E.M. Truck Accessories, bought the 9
mm weapon less than an hour before Friday's incident. Carr said he
was afraid Johnson would come back, and images of Thursday's
Buckhead shootings were fresh in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how copy cats happen. . . ,'' Carr said. ``We made
the decision in the morning that we were going to buy a gun at
lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law requires an instant background check, so Carr could
buy the gun that day because he had no record of a felony
conviction or an involuntary commitment to a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about guns,'' Carr said. ``I don't want
them around. But you're defenseless unless you have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the store at 2:45 p.m., Carr put an empty clip in
the gun and placed a loaded clip in a case beside the weapon. It
was all locked in a drawer because Carr worried about accidental
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:40 p.m., Johnson's wife rushed into the store with a
warning that her husband was on his way, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone ran out a back door as the gunman came through
the front, but in the warehouse he caught the store's receptionist
while she was calling police.
</P>
<P>
   He put the shotgun to her head, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carr loaded the weapon, and he and another employee
gave it to Green, who has handgun training. The gunman spotted
Green behind some boxes, ordered him out and walked to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the gun up and pulled the trigger,'' Green said. ``It
didn't go off. I pulled it three or four more times. . . (Then) I
put my left had over the mouth of the (shotgun's) barrel, thinking,
`If it goes off, it will just blow my hand off.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed the barrel to the ceiling. Got both hands on the gun.
Wrestled with him and threw him on the ground. . . Jumped on top of
him and hit him about five times in the face. I held him until the
police came.''

UMPIRES TO FILE LABOR CHARGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American League accepted the resignations of Drew
Coble and Greg Kosc because they told the league orally they were
resigning, a league official said Monday. The umpires' lawyer,
however, disputed that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the two umpires came into question Sunday because
Coble said he never resigned and Richie Phillips, the union lawyer,
said Kosc rescinded his resignation and never officially changed
that position.
</P>
<P>
   The position of the two umpires is one of many issues the Major
League Umpires Association has raised and will raise in its dispute
with Major League Baseball over negotiations for a new labor
agreement. The union will file a series of unfair labor practice
charges Tuesday with the National Labor Relations Board in New York
and has scheduled a news conference to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leagues plan to file their own charges, a
baseball official said Monday. He said they had been prepared to
file them now, but decided to wait until the union files its
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coble and Kosc were two of nine umpires whose resignations were
accepted by Gene Budig, the American League president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were contacted by phone by our office and both affirmed
their resignations to us,'' said Phyllis Merhige, the league's
senior vice president. ``Because there was a little bit of
confusion, we wanted to know their status for certain and both
confirmed that they were resigning. The matter is in the hands of
the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Budig's letter to Coble in which he said he was accepting his
resignation, the president wrote that he had received on July 15
Coble's letter dated July 14. However, Coble said he did not attend
the umpires meeting July 14, at which more than 50 umpires signed
resignation letters, and only later signed a letter and sent it to
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips said he never forwarded Coble's letter to the
league office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the wording in Budig's letter, Merhige said: ``It
was an oversight in the wording. We treated him like we treated
everyone else, and we should have been more exact in the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Phillips, Coble said Monday that Derek Irwin, the
American League's vice president, called him at some point and
asked what he was going to do. `` `I told him that I hadn't
received any paperwork,''' Phillips quoted Coble as saying, `` `but
that I was considering joining the union umpires.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips suggested that Coble's response was too indefinite for
the league to act on. He cited a similarly indefinite response from
Kosc to the league office. Kosc had rescinded his resignation
during a period when other umpires withdrew their resignations and
saved their jobs. Kosc is different in that the union subsequently
announced that Kosc was reinstating his resignation but, as with
Coble, the union never sent anything to that effect to the league. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading a statement he had from Kosc, Phillips quoted him as
saying someone from the league office called him and said he heard
that Kosc was rescinding the withdrawal of his resignation. ``I
told him I am a union man and have been a union man 24 years and if
he wanted any more information to call my lawyer,'' Phillips read.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can infer what they want from that,'' Phillips said,
``but the fact of the matter is there was no rescission of the
rescission.''
</P>
<P>
   While the status of the two umpires remained in dispute, the
union planned to go forward with its case before the NLRB. &QL;

SENATE VOTES 93-0 TO BEEF UP LAWS AGAINST SWEEPSTAKES COMPANIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate cracked down Monday on sweepstakes
companies that prey on the elderly and unsuspecting through
misleading mailings, voting overwhelmingly to strengthen laws
against deceptive mail practices and to impose tougher penalties on
violators.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 93-0, ended nearly two years of Senate hearings on the
issue and represented a stunning congressional reprimand to the
four giants of the sweepstakes industry _ Publishers' Clearing
House, Readers Digest, American Family Publishers and the Time
Warner Company _ and dozens of smaller businesses that use
sweepstakes promotions to entice people into buying everything from
magazines to jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweepstakes in this country for may Americans has become a
cruel joke,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who recounted stories
during debate on the sweepstakes measure of people giving away
their life savings after being led to believe that ``buying more
... would make them a sure winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Levin, who
joined with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to craft a bill that would
strengthen the terms, rules and conditions governing sweepstakes
mailings to prohibit deceptive practices that are used as come-ons
to get people to purchase goods or contribute money.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would specifically force companies to display clear
disclaimers on their mailings, including a statement that no
purchase is necessary to win and that purchasing will not improve
chances of winning. The disclaimers would have to be placed in
three prominent locations in mailings so that they could not be
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies would be prohibited from describing
recipients in their mailings as ``winners'' unless they have
actually won a prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact is that consumers, far too many consumers,
frequently fall victim to deceptive and sophisticated mailings,''
said Collins, who, as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Subcommittee on Investigations, has been putting the heat on
companies that reap huge profits through deceptive mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Collins told her colleagues that the subcommittee's probe of the
sweepstakes industry ``has demonstrated that sweepstakes companies,
both large and small, use deceptive mailings to entice people to
purchase things they do not need or want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to
deceptive mailings,'' she said before the vote, noting that some
recipients have been so convinced that they were about to win that
they didn't dare leave their homes ``for fear of missing the prize
patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to vote on its measure dealing with
sweepstakes mailings, but it is expected to pass a similar bill
later this year imposing the same restrictions that the Senate
legislation contains. The White House has indicated that it would
sign a bill making it as tough as possible for sweepstakes
companies to mislead people.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also would make it easier for consumers to have
their names taken off sweepstakes mailing lists by requiring
companies to include a toll-free number and address in their
materials so they can better respond. The removal request _ whether
in writing or over the telephone _ would have to be honored within
35 days.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would be forbidden from using mailings that resemble
government documents, which are used to suggest to recipients that
a contest is backed by the federal or state government.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the bill would expand the authority of the U.S.
Postal Service to stop misleading or fraudulent mailings and to
impose tougher penalties for first time offenses. For example, a
first offense could cost as much as $1 million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the ranking Democrat on the governmental affairs
subcommittee, said that while most Americans ``have a healthy
skepticism'' about sweepstakes ``and don't believe the misleading
representations,'' too many do and ``get caught up in a spiral of
financial and emotional trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   During hearings earlier this year, for example, the subcommittee
heard from dozens of people who had spent their Social Security
checks, life savings, or in some cases, borrowed money on
sweepstakes-related items because they thought it was necessary in
order to win whatever ``big prize'' was being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hearings focused a good deal of attention on the
misleading mailings of the big four sweepstakes companies, which
send out more than a billion mailings a year, they also dealt with
the problems caused by smaller, ``fly-by-night'' companies`` that
use ''extremely deceptive mailings`` that amount to mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   She called them ``stealth companies'' because they are often
hard to track and to stop, because many of them use multiple
business names.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the big four companies, which she said do run
``legitimate sweepstakes'' that eventually award a prize, she said
smaller operations quite often never follow through with any kind
of prize.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A routine investigation into cable television
piracy has evolved into an exploration of the secret world of
off-shore money laundering, giving investigators what one agent
called an unprecedented insight into banking in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In a court appearance Monday, federal prosecutors said records
they had obtained from a defunct Cayman Island's bank had sparked
investigations involving 1,500 people that could eventually net
more than $300 million in unpaid taxes and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, IRS officials and FBI agents said Monday
that the case has already helped them penetrate the veil of secrecy
that one prosecutor said has ``been one of the greatest allies of
individuals committing crimes in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelations came at the sentencing Monday of John Mathewson,
a U.S. citizen who once offered his Cayman Island bank as a
one-stop money launderer. He was charged with money laundering in
the cable television case and gave prosecutors records from his
bank as part of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Already some $50 million in back taxes and penalties has been
recovered as a result of Mathewson's help to prosecutors in seven
federal judicial districts, said John J. Carney, an assistant U.S.
attorney who prosecuted the cable box case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In court, Carney had dozens of letters and documents from
prosecutors detailing some of the criminal cases that have resulted
from Mathewson's bank records: Dr. Jeffrey E. LaVigne, the New York
proctologist who once advertised his practice on subway posters
(1-800-MD-TUSCH), has been charged with using the bank to evade
taxes on $187,667 in income; Mark Vicini, a New Jersey millionaire
who owned a computer company, Micro Rentals and Sales, and who
admitted putting $9 million in Mathewson's bank to avoid $2 million
in taxes; members of the Abboud family in Omaha, Neb., who were
indicted in May on tax and other fraud charges for allegedly
funneling some $27 million into the bank from cable piracy schemes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``His is the most important cooperation for the government in
the history of tax haven prosecution,'' said Carney, who is in the
federal prosecutor's Fraud and Public Protection division in New
Jersey. ``That is in terms of the complexity of the scheme, the
number of dollars involved and the number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney and Robert J. Jordan, in charge of the FBI's Newark
office, said that the case had seriously damaged the banking
secrecy that had helped the Cayman Islands become the fifth-largest
banking center in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman government had unsuccessfully gone into U.S. courts
to try to retrieve copies of computerized tapes of bank
transactions that Mathewson had kept and to block disclosure of
other information. The government had also refused to assist FBI
officials in decoding the computer records. Without the Cayman
government's missing part of the code, it took 18 months to be able
to read the files.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that, to his knowledge, this was the first time that
a U.S. law enforcement agency had gotten such detailed information
about the dealings of a Cayman bank. ``The Caymans is no longer the
safe haven that they were,'' he said, ``because we have gotten our
nose in the tent and seen how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing Monday, Mathewson, who offered his cooperation
immediately on the night that FBI investigators arrested him for
helping the cable pirates launder and hide profits, delivered a
long autobiographical statement detailing his role in the crimes.
He finished up by repeating the creed by which he had lived his
life: ``Yes, sir, no sir, no excuses sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no excuse for what I did in aiding U.S. citizens to
evade taxes and the fact that every other bank in the Caymans was
doing it is no excuse,'' he said. ``But I have cooperated and if
Guardian Bank and Trust had been a sting operation and I an FBI
agent, it could not have been more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson's cooperation began in mid-1996, after he had left
Guardian Bank and Trust and moved with his Caymanian wife and three
children to San Antonio, Texas. FBI agents in Newark came upon his
name through wiretaps in connection with a then two-year-old
undercover sting operation aimed at the traffic in illegally
outfitted cable television decoder boxes, estimated by the National
Cable Television Association to cost up to $7 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   What was already a tantalizing prosecution that featured
high-tech industrial espionage, a bribe in the form of a $40,000
Porche and strong hints of swaggering south Florida ``wiseguys''
said to be part of the Luchese crime family, suddenly became a high
stakes international dispute. Once Mathewson had been caught
laundering money for the cable ring leaders, he volunteered to give
the arresting agents the computer tapes. He also offered them his
own ``electronic Rolodex'' that told him which individuals were
connected with the hundreds of ``shelf corporations'' he had set up
for the bank's customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started from very humble beginnings,'' said Jordan, the
FBI agent, ``but we looked to maximize things.''
</P>
<P>
   While the four-year cable piracy investigation netted 25
indictments and closed down $40 million-a-year operations in
Florida, New Jersey and California, the motherlode from Mathewson's
records keeps on producing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson, 71, was once a wealthy construction company owner and
executive in the Chicago area. He moved to the Caymans in
``semiretirement'' in 1982, and along with some local business
people, set up the Guardian Bank and Trust Co. in 1986. He said in
court Monday that he was told that Europeans would be the bulk of
the depositors but he came to learn that ``90 percent'' of the
depositors in Cayman banks were U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When the European investors did not materialize, Mathewson got
directly involved in the bank's operations in an effort to protect
his investment, he said Monday in court. He said this included
using a little ``Yankee ingenuity'' to promote the bank with
advertisements at the British West Indies island's main airport,
and videotape presentations starring himself with his chiseled
features, shock of white hair and banker's self-assurance. He would
explain the benefits and confidentiality of the Cayman bank's
services at special sales sessions in local Grand Cayman hotels. He
touted the nearly 700 shelf companies that the bank had
preregistered on the island as ready conduits for funds.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bank eventually acquired deposits totaling $350
million. But in early 1995, he said, he was approached by a
Caymanian government banking regulator who solicited a $250,000
bribe. He refused and some months later his bank was the subject of
an investigation into unspecified irregularities. It was eventually
taken over by the Cayman government and liquidated.
</P>

   Mathewson, intending to seek new authority as a banker in the
Bahamas, left the Cayman's and temporarily moved to San Antonio.
Federal agents arrested him in June 1996 as they were closing in on
others in the cable piracy scheme.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The tapes Mathewson offered to investigators were encrypted
using a specialized software and when U.S. authorities sought the
help of the Royal Cayman Police, the island's government learned of
their existence and demanded their return.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr., assigned to
hear the cable piracy case, eventually heard the Cayman's argument
that the tapes were the property of the Cayman Islands Monetary
Authority and should be returned and not used in any prosecutions.
He rejected all those arguments. In a 1997 opinion, he pointed out
that, by its own admission, the Cayman Islands was trying to avoid
the possible prosecution of the bank's customers and damage to
their reputation for confidentiality that is ``vital to the banking
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest of the Cayman Islands in maintaining
confidentiality of records protected by the Cayman Confidential
Relationship Law, while vital, does not overcome the interests of
the United States government in investigating violations of its
criminal laws,'' wrote the judge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Mathewson, who contacted European sources to
get the software applications, the entire computer file was decoded
in 18 months. Most of the tax-evasion and money-laundering cases
resulting from the tapes are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, said Eric D. Bernstein, an assistant U.S.
attorney with the Eastern District in New York, the information
Mathewson provided from his own files has assisted in numerous
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No financial crime is without a trail even though the banks
are in Caymans,'' said Carney, the assistant U.S. attorney. ``The
bottom line is that if you look, you can find the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the government's expectation that when the entirety of
the defendant's cooperation is utilized, the benefits to both the
criminal and civil law enforcement authorities of the United States
will be immeasurable,'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson, who faced a possible five-year prison term, was
sentenced Monday to five years probation, 500 hours community
service and a $30,000 fine.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lechner said the number of requests for leniency he had received
from prosecutors was ``extraordinary and had not been equaled by
any other case.'' And, the judge noted as he peered down at
Mathewson from the bench, if it had not been for his cooperation,
``I would have put you in prison for the maximum sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government of the Cayman Islands was not happy with
Mathewson's cooperation. In court papers filed two years ago, the
government's official liquidator of Guardian Bank and Trust noted
in a letter to the Royal Cayman Islands Police that the information
Mathewson had turned over to the FBI ``will sooner or later be
passed on to the Internal Revenue Service for purpose of
investigating and, where appropriate, prosecuting any bank clients
subject to U.S. taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a spokesman for the Cayman Islands said that they wanted
to ``set the record straight'' regarding the Guardian Bank and
Trust Co. case and would be releasing a statement on it and its
impact on the islands' banking business on Tuesday.

CHINA ANNOUNCES TEST OF LONG-RANGE MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China said it test-launched a new type of long-range
missile Monday and then excoriated the United States for selling
military equipment to Taiwan in the middle of a major diplomatic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China launched the ground-to-ground missile successfully, the
official New China News Agency reported. Military experts said it
was probably the Dong Feng-31 missile, which can carry a single
1,500-pound nuclear warhead in a range of about 5,000 miles,
capable of reaching the United States, and which relies on mobility
to evade attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-sentence report, the news agency said the test was
conducted within Chinese territory. It provided no additional
information, but it was unusual for China to report a missile
launch at all.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon reaction was muted. One senior official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said this was the first full test of the
Dong Feng-31, which has been under development for several years.
Its chief advance, he said, is that ``it's mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day that Chinese authorities
publicly expressed their outrage at the American decision to
proceed with the sale of sophisticated military equipment to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Taiwan and China are extremely delicate.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and Chinese military forces have been on low-level alert
since President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan asserted on July 9 that from
now on Taiwan would talk with China only on the basis of ``special
state-to-state relations.'' This indicated abandonment of the
diplomatic framework that has kept peace between the two sides for
decades, and outraged China's leaders, who see Lee's new stance as
a significant step away from reunification with China, which
remains a cherished goal in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Clinton administration's evident irritation with
Lee, who effectively thumbed his nose at State Department pressure
to go forward with negotiations with China, the Pentagon went ahead
with a decision to sell Taiwan $550 million worth of weapons,
including two E-2T Hawkeye 2000E early-warning aircraft and parts
and equipment for F-16 and F-5 fighter planes and C-130 cargo
planes. Taiwan already has four of the Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon decision, which requires congressional approval,
was announced on Saturday and appears to balance diplomatic
pressure on Lee with military support for Taiwan. Pentagon
officials, who expressed surprise at China's vehement reaction,
described the military sale as small-scale and said it had been
approved by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee's announcement, Pentagon officials said a long-planned
visit to Taiwan in mid-July by senior Defense Department officials
would be postponed. The Pentagon has yet to reschedule the visit.
</P>
<P>
   China regards American arm sales to Taiwan as a violation of a
1982 agreement between Washington and Beijing that the United
States would gradually reduce such sales to Taiwan, which China has
regarded as a renegade province since Chinese Nationalist forces
fled to the island in 1949. To go ahead with any sale of military
equipment at a time when tension over a potential military conflict
is so high has outraged Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government disregarded the strong opposition and
solemn representations of the Chinese government,'' said Deputy
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. ``The U.S. side needs to be aware of
the seriousness and danger of arms sales to Taiwan and must cancel
arms sales to Taiwan and take practical steps to correct this
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many congressmen have expressed concern about China's
growing military power, military experts point out that China has
only 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the
United States and that they all require such a long warm-up period
that the United States could conceivably knock them all out before
a single one was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's defense ministry issued a statement condemning China's
test launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to intimidate the world's powerful nations,''
the statement said. ``It's unlikely to be used to attack Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Defense Weekly, the authoritative publication on military
matters, said China had been expected to begin testing the Dong
Feng-31 by 2000. It has been designed to replace the Dong Feng-4, a
missile with half the range that was developed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   China has been expected to build between 10 and 20 Dong Feng-31s
for deployment beginning next year, some of them on mobile
launchers that are hard to detect, Jane's reported.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run news media reported in June that another
missile, the submarine-launched Julang II, was also scheduled for
testing this year. The Julang II is based on technology similar to
the Dong Feng-31s and also has a range of about 5,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dong Feng-31 and the Julang II were cited in a report
by a congressional committee under the chairmanship of Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as weapons that had benefited from what
the report described as two decades of spying on American missile
and nuclear-warhead technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may or may not be a coincidence that Monday's test also came
the day after China's leaders celebrated the anniversary of the
founding of the People's Liberation Army, a day when military
leaders try to call attention to their strength.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception honoring the military over the weekend, Defense
Minister Chi Haotian condemned President Lee for trying to ``split
the motherland'' and warned him that China's military was prepared
to defend the territorial integrity of the nation at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, military experts have said they detected
little willingness in China to conduct the kind of provocative
military exercises near Taiwan that it did in 1995 and 1996, when
China fired several test missiles off the coast of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, deep alarm in Taiwan over the possibility of
military conflict was quelled only when the United States sent two
aircraft carriers toward the region as a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of military conflict appear to be lower
this year, any issue that mixes national sovereignty with military
affairs is highly unpredictable. Even if Beijing decided not to
take direct military action, military leaders are believed to
support some show of force.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the army's anniversary, Monday's China Daily, the
official English-language newspaper, praised the nation's
development of missile technology and asserted that many of the
rockets ``can match the leading missiles of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peoples Liberation Army is working hard to catch up with
the major military powers of the world,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   China has continually tried to blame the current crisis entirely
on Lee, arguing that his move to establish Taiwan's diplomatic
stance as a ``special state-to-state'' relationship with China
amounts to a traitorous action that is tantamount to abandoning the
goal of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee has put relations across the straits in a state of crisis,
caused social instability in Taiwan and put the 22 million
Taiwanese in a dangerous situation for his political ambition,''
the New China News Agency said in a commentary Monday. ``The
Taiwanese are part of one big Chinese family and their ancestors
all come from the mainland and their interests are the interests of
all Chinese people.

 WASHINGTON: all stripes.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State and a longtime critic of the
coalition, said the ruling was ``disappointing but not surprising''
because ``the courts have been lax in enforcing federal election
law.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The decision still provides plenty of evidence that
the Christian Coalition is a hardball partisan political
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Green offered a detailed definition of what constitutes
improper coordination between a campaign and an outside group. But
she said the coalition did not appear to cross that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corporation's mere announcement to the campaign that it
plans to distribute thousands of voter guides on the Sunday before
Election Day, even if that information is not yet public, is not
enough to be coordination,'' she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Green also said one reason the coalition did not act
improperly was because the Bush campaign refused its entreaties
during the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that ``it appears that the coalition avoided
impermissible coordination'' of its spending on voter guides and
get-out-the-vote efforts ``although not for lack of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``The primary reason that these expenditures were
not coordinated is that campaign staff, armed with foreknowledge of
the coalition's plans, chose not to respond to the coalition's
implicit offers to discuss or negotiate those plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit brought against the coalition took aim at one of its
most effective _ and controversial _ organizing tools: the millions
of voter guides that list candidates' records on assorted issues.
The suit asserted that while the guides distributed between 1990
and 1994 did not expressly advocate the election or defeat of
candidates, legal questions arose because the coalition coordinated
the distribution and content of the guides to favor particular
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The suit resulted from a four-year inquiry by the Federal
Election Commission that was prompted by complaints from the
Democratic National Committee and the Virginia Democratic Party.

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Booming amplification systems have pervaded movie
houses, Broadway theaters and even churches and synagogues, but an
unwritten pact between classical-music companies and their
audiences has kept them out of concert halls and opera houses.
There, no electronic processors have been allowed to interfere
with, say, the enveloping warmth of a soprano's soft high notes
wafting into the upper balcony.
</P>
<P>
   However, the New York State Theater, home to the New York City
Opera and the New York City Ballet, is about to break this pact.
What the companies' officials call an electronic sound-enhancement
system is being installed in the theater this month on an
experimental basis in time for the opening on Sept. 11 of the City
Opera's fall season with Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera company, which has long bemoaned the hall's acoustics,
has been the leader of the project, though the City Ballet is fully
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The City Opera will be the first major U.S. company to embrace a
comprehensive sound-enhancement system. Many opera companies use
such systems in certain circumstances, as when the spoken dialogue
in Berg's ``Lulu'' or Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' is given a boost of
amplification. And the State Theater routinely amplifies its
revivals of musicals, using body microphones, as is the practice on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have long suspected that opera companies and
concert halls use partial amplification discreetly but, fearing
audience rebellion, keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   The City Opera and City Ballet companies assert that their
system, which will install stationary microphones and more than a
hundred inconspicuous speakers of varying shapes and sizes in the
2,700-seat auditorium, is nothing like a conventional amplification
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as electronic architecture,'' said Martin
Oppenheimer, the board chairman of the City Center of Music and
Drama, the parent organization that oversees the City Opera and
City Ballet. It will ``enhance the acoustics of the space,'' not
amplify voices, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But just the thought of a sound-enhancement system, however
sophisticated, is likely to elicit fortissimo protests from many
fans and dire warnings from professionals. ``It's an implicit
contract with audiences that there will be no amplification of any
kind and that they will hear the voices as God made them,'' said
Rudolph Rauch, the editor of Opera News.
</P>
<P>
   Even Beverly Sills, the chairman of Lincoln Center, who made her
career in the New York State Theater as a leading soprano and later
as general director of the City Opera, has reservations, although
she endorsed the move. ``I hope it's temporary,'' she said
recently. ``I would not like it to become a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because it was designed for dance, not opera, the
35-year-old New York State Theater has inadequate acoustics for
music, especially the singing voice. The hall has long struggled
with its acoustics, and the new system could change that,
Oppenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the hall was designed, the New York City Ballet was one of
the most prestigious cultural institutions in the United States and
the City Opera was a solid, enterprising but second-tier
organization.
</P>
<P>
   So when the companies, then sharing the City Center of Music and
Drama building on West 55th Street in Manhattan, were invited to
help create a new arts complex in Lincoln Center, the ballet
company's founders, George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein,
stipulated their demands to the architect, Philip Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, they did not want to be able to hear one
footfall on the stage. And they got their wish: The theater was
quite efficient at containing sound on the stage, to the
everlasting dismay of the City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been so frustrating that every one of the City
Opera's general directors has openly considered moving from Lincoln
Center to a renovated theater or a new hall.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kellogg, the current general manager and artistic director
of the company, said that the acoustical problem is especially hard
on the younger American singers that City Opera prides itself on
nurturing. Yet even company stars with enormous voices, like the
soprano Lauren Flanigan, can find the New York State Theater a
challenging place to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, who assumed his post in the fall of 1996, had never
considered a sound-enhancement system. Last year he said he had an
epiphany of sorts when he attended a demonstration in Malmo,
Sweden, of new sound technology developed by a Dutch company,
Acoustic Control Systems (ACS).
</P>
<P>
   There, at an all-purpose, acoustically weak theater, Kellogg and
other City Opera officials listened to singers and diverse
instrumental ensembles as they played first with and then without
sound enhancement: The system can be turned on and off with a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely striking,'' Kellogg said. ``The thing that
impressed me so much is that this system is not amplification in
any sense that I've known it before or imagined it possible. This
is as natural a sound as you can get. It simply works on the
architecture of the room. It increases the presence and resonance,
not the volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 60 halls in Europe use sound-enhancement technology like
the type being installed in the New York State Theater, but only
one in the United States does: a church in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Many American theaters have systems that do not involve the body
microphones common on Broadway. One is right across the plaza from
the State Theater: the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center.
The system there comes from the ``same gene pool of research,'' but
is considerably less sophisticated, said Lawrence Kirkegaard, a
consultant in architectural acoustics who will supervise the
installation of the State Theater system.
</P>
<P>
   He described the technology as a breakthrough that allowed him
for the first time to use electronic sound enhancement in opera
houses and concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   How does it work? Some 18 to 20 small microphones, mostly
hidden, will circle the orchestra pit; a similar number will be
oriented to the stage. (These are not to be confused with the
microphones that commonly hang from wires in auditoriums for use in
recording.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the pit as divided into 18 or so modules,''
Kirkegaard said. ``Each microphone picks up a portion of that
sound. What is transmitted to the speaker is what the natural sound
would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The speakers, connected by wiring to the microphones, vary in
size and shape: Some are small and round; some are long and thin.
Those who attended the demonstration in Sweden said that even when
they put their ears next to the speakers, it was hard to tell that
any sound was being emitted from them.
</P>
<P>
   The system will neither amplify nor equalize sound throughout
the house, Kirkegaard maintained, but will distribute portions of
the sound throughout the dead spots of the house with new presence.
A baritone will still sound different when heard from the fourth
row of the orchestra section and when heard from the top of the
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is not to raise the sound level,'' Kirkegaard
said. ``The effect will be that the singers sound like they are
singing in a more intimate space.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch company, hoping that the system will be embraced by
New York audiences, is lending the equipment (valued at $400,000 to
$500,000) to the State Theater at no charge. The ballet and opera
companies are paying for the temporary installation, for which the
cost has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment is deemed a success, the State Theater will
buy the equipment. The wiring and speakers could then be
permanently installed when the theater is eventually renovated.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is difficult to describe, Kirkegaard said,
because ``we lack words for it.'' Still, the system involves terms
like ``microphone'' and ``speaker'' that carry powerfully negative
connotations for many opera buffs and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous slope,'' said Lotfi Mansouri, the general
director of the San Francisco Opera and a noted operatic stage
director who has worked at the New York State Theater and
understands its problems. ``People are getting used to manufactured
sound on CDs,'' he added. ``We have to fight hard not to compromise
the natural sound of the voice and its natural projection.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kellogg arrived at the City Opera he hired Kirkegaard to
tinker with the theater's acoustics. Kirkegaard installed rounded
plywood reflectors on each side near the stage and put absorbing
carpets on the back wall. Most critics noticed some improvement,
especially in the clarity and presence of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet Orchestra also has problems with the house. The
orchestra plays a repertory of some 150 works each season, with
scores that call for everything from a single piano onstage to full
Tchaikovsky-size orchestras in the pit. Some new works incorporate
electric instruments as well. The ballet company is interested in
making the sound of the orchestra more present.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike City Opera, the City Ballet does not want to make the
sound from the stage more audible. ``Footfalls are a real issue for
us,'' said Christopher Ramsey, director of external affairs for the
ballet. ``Ours is a company renowned for the quietness of its
dancing.'' If the system works as planned, the ballet company could
turn off the stage microphones, or turn off the system entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Ms. Sills would like to see the problems addressed
structurally, not electronically, as part of an overall
refurbishment being contemplated for the hall. General improvements
would include more backstage and rehearsal space, upgraded air
conditioning and a new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the problems in the house,'' Sills said. ``Paul
Kellogg has to do what he feels is best for the company. I would
certainly be one of his strongest supporters in making the
acoustics better.''
</P>
<P>
   But to do this with structural changes alone, Kirkegaard said,
would be a massive and expensive project that could involve
lowering the ceiling and bringing the walls closer together. The
City Ballet would never condone such tampering with its iconic
dance house.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Goldman, executive producer of City Opera, said that by
contrast the sound system could quickly obviate the longstanding
problems _ that is if audiences go along with electronic sound
enhancement. And opera buffs tend to be a strong-minded bunch when
it comes to the unsullied purity of the human voice.

COLORADO REINSTATES OWN BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN BUYERS

<P>
   DENVER _ After scrapping its own criminal background checks of
gun buyers to use a system the Federal Bureau of Investigation
began eight months ago, Colorado has resumed its prior efforts,
certain that the federal system has weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   A triple slaying in June convinced state lawmakers that federal
records often do not reflect a gun buyer's complete criminal
history, so on Sunday Colorado resumed checking state and local
records for the first time since March. Eight of 76 potential
buyers were turned away, including two, local officials said, who
had criminal pasts that would not have shown up in FBI records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's back,'' Gov. Bill Owens said Monday. ``It's
something we should have. I just regret that we had to have a
tragedy as the proximate cause for my reinstating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before federal gun legislation known as the Brady Bill
passed in 1993, creating a five-day waiting period for prospective
gun purchases, 18 states, including Colorado, were checking state
and local records for criminal activity that would deny the buyer
the right to purchase a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since the instant checks replaced the
waiting period, Colorado, New York, Delaware and Missouri abandoned
their own checking systems, assuming that the federal program would
perform adequately and some bureaucratic redundancy would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other three, Colorado reversed course, largely
because of Simon Gonzales' purchase of a 9mm Taurus handgun on June
22. His application, made through a licensed gun dealer in Castle
Rock, a distant suburb of Denver, failed to show that his estranged
wife had secured a restraining order against him through a state
court, which under federal law would have disqualified him from
owning a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after his purchase, Gonzales shot to death his three
daughters, ages 7, 8 and 10. Shortly after that, he died in a gun
battle with the police.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said one gun application on Sunday was denied
after a search of state records revealed an outstanding restraining
order, which was not included in federal records, and another
applicant had a felony charge that did not show up because the
buyer had not been fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a federal background check will deny a prospective
gun buyer for a variety of reasons, including evidence that the
applicant has a felony conviction, has been dishonorably discharged
from military service, has renounced American citizenship or
suffers from mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   But federal checks do not always have access to state or local
records that would show, for example, restraining orders or
misdemeanors. In Colorado, more than 50,000 people have restraining
orders against them at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the FBI to have all the data states have, it would take
years to convert all that information,'' said Robert Cantwell,
director of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. ``There is so
much information. To capture it all is almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a Republican who took office this year, conceded that the
decision to end the state checks was made largely for cost
considerations and that even though he supported state background
checks as a supplement to federal review, ``We did not put the full
force and majesty of the governor's office behind it, so it died.''
</P>
<P>
   But days after the Gonzales killings, he set aside $604,000 in
emergency funds, ordering the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to
resume the background checks temporarily until the state
Legislature considers a permanent program when it returns to
session in January.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 15 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey,
conduct criminal background checks on anyone who attempts to
purchase a gun. Another 10 states initiate checks on anyone buying
a handgun, but not rifles and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While Owens said state efforts, as a supplement to the FBI
checks, might help discourage criminal behavior, no credible
studies have shown that background checks have played a role in the
overall decline of crime rates throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,
which supports instant checks over any waiting period for gun
purchases, said the federal system ``seems to be working reasonably
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc., a
nonprofit organization that favors tighter gun-control laws,
predicted that more states would follow Colorado, adopting their
own system of checking for criminal activity out of ``a creeping
awareness that the national system does not have access to
everything.''

(EXCLUSIVE)

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The murders, abductions, threats and
beatings of Serbs and gypsies in Kosovo has largely been the work
of members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, says a Human Rights Watch
report that asserts that neither the guerrilla army's leaders nor
the international force are doing enough to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a copy of which was shown to the New York Times by
one of its authors before its official release on Tuesday, details
cases in which Kosovo Albanians are believed to have intimidated,
beaten or killed members of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the perpetrators were wearing KLA uniforms or
identified themselves as KLA members, according to the report,
which notes that peacekeepers have said that not everyone arrested
wearing KLA uniforms is a member.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not accuse the KLA leadership of directing the
violence, but condemns its inability to stop it. ``We do not have
any evidence of a policy, or of official sanctioning, but it is
clear it is widespread and in some cases local KLA units are
involved,'' said Ben Ward, a Human Rights Watch researcher who
contributed to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Watch report includes 40 documented killings of
Serbs and two of gypsies and recounts 30 documented cases of
beatings or abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most serious incidents of violence have been carried out
by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes testimony by a young gypsy man who said he
was interrogated and abused by KLA members as well as details of
slayings of elderly Serbian civilians, by killers described as
uniformed KLA members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frequency and severity of such abuses make it incumbent
upon the KLA leadership to take swift and decisive action to
prevent them,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch suggests that the Albanians' motivation is
largely revenge for violence on the part of Serbs and that their
goal is to drive the Serbs out of Kosovo. Some 100,000
non-Albanians have fled Kosovo in the last six weeks since NATO
forces arrived, and there has been widespread looting and arson of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not attempt to cover the full spectrum of the
violence that has erupted here since the war ended and ethnic
Albanians began returning. The peacekeeping forces reported 198
murders in the period that ended on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers and foreign observers here say that while they are
sure the violence is not condoned by KLA leaders, they are
tolerating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tolerance for this rather than deliberate
coordination,'' said one military observer working for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has denied its members are responsible for most of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Fatmir Limaj, a senior KLA commander and chief of military
police, who is now the deputy defense minister of Kosovo's
self-appointed government, blamed the incidents of murder and
intimidation on criminals, some of whom may have posed as KLA
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA had every possibility during the war to attack Serb
civilians, but we never did,'' he said in an interview on Monday.
``We have won our freedom and we want to build the future of our
people, but not at the expense of other people. That has always
been the political-military philosophy of the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said the response by the NATO force in Kosovo, and the
United Nations administration, has been ``belated and
insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence of a firm commitment to a new and
tolerant Kosovo,'' in which minorities can live without
discrimination, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the southern town of Prizren, once
renowned for its ethnically mixed population, was the scene of
particularly brutal murders of two elderly Serbs, Marica
Stamenkovic, 77, and Panta Filipovic, 63, on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Marica's husband, Trifun, and Panta's wife, Marica, returned
from doing the shopping at mid-morning to find their spouses dead,
their throats cut. Peacekeepers were on the scene soon after.
</P>
<P>
   The Filipovic family's neighbors said they had seen KLA soldiers
enter the house. The killings came after days of intimidation from
KLA soldiers who demanded money, and threatened the two couples,
who had decided to stay in Prizren, although the majority of Serbs
had left.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While some of the cases in the report detail the deaths of Serbs
who had been accused of atrocities against Albanians, many appear
to have been innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been caught up in what Human Rights Watch describes as
an ``ongoing conflict'' between armed Serbian civilians and units
of the KLA in eastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies, or Roma, have also experienced severe violence at the
hands of returning Albanians. Widely accused of collaborating with
the Serbian police and military, they have been subjected to
beatings, abductions and threats that have forced the majority to
flee their homes or seek the peacekeepers' protection in a tented
camp outside Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One account in the report comes from a 23-year old Roma man,
identified only as F.F. in the report, who said he had been
abducted near his home in Pristina by uniformed KLA men June 21 and
taken to a KLA base in the district of Dragodan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me until I fainted. Then they put water on my face
and when I woke up they beat me again,'' he told interviewers from
Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they asked me who was in uniform and which ones did some
killing. They asked me if I was in uniform. After that they brought
photos with names on a piece of paper. They would show me a picture
and say, `Do you recognize this man?' all the time beating me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a man who identified himself as the KLA commander for
Dragodan and Pristina, joined by others, ``took me to another room.
He had a pair of scissors and told me, `We're going to cut your
fingers and ears off.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The report urges for the immediate deployment of the promised
3,000 international police. As yet there are only 35 foreign
policemen in Kosovo and the onus of the policing is left to the
military police in the NATO-led force. The peacekeepers, too, are
looking forward to the arrival of the international police.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch called for KLA leaders to investigate and
prosecute members who have been involved in abuses of human rights,
and act to curtail any further abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Limaj countered accusations that the KLA was not doing anything
to stop the violence, saying that its movement and activities were
restricted by the demilitarization agreement that confines its men
to base.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will try to create conditions for all people to stay.
It is our duty to do that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Germany _ Always a crucible of the best and worst in
Germany, this small town has emerged a decade after the fall of the
Berlin Wall as a focus of national questioning and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Festivity should be in the air. This year is the 250th
anniversary of the birth of Weimar's most distinguished son,
Goethe. The town was selected by European ministers as the
Continent's ``cultural capital'' for 1999, an accolade that has
spurred spending and sprucing on a scale unknown elsewhere in the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Its communist decay dusted off, its church spires repainted,
Weimar now suffuses cobblestoned charm, the stuff of fairy tales.
But the town _ home to Schiller and to Nietzche, birthplace of the
Bauhaus _ is also adjacent to the Nazis' Buchenwald concentration
camp, where more than 50,000 people were killed between 1937 and
1945.
</P>
<P>
   This juxtaposition of high German thought and base German
barbarism has complicated the celebration of culture. Goethe's
drawings have been put on show _ at Buchenwald. Schiller's house
was chosen for an exhibition about the death in 1939 of several
hundred Viennese Jews at the camp. Not everyone approved.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a sign of the tensions, six sculptures by the
British artist Stuart Wolfe that were on display in a Weimar church
and represented concentration camp victims were destroyed by
unknown assailants. The police have offered a reward of several
thousand dollars for information.
</P>
<P>
   Friction has also stirred between the ``Wessis'' from the former
West Germany who have dropped anchor here to direct many of the
cultural events, and the ``Ossis'' who feel resentment over what
they call the ``Western conquistadors.'' Some locals feel that
their past is being misrepresented at Buchenwald and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weimar is a mythical place, our Jerusalem,'' said Volkhard
Knigge, the director of the Buchenwald memorial. ``What we have
been trying to do is sort history from myth, and show the story of
Weimar and Buchenwald are intertwined. The Goethe Society was
furious over our exhibition of drawings, but this process is
inevitably painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain, in many ways, is also that of all of Germany. The
country, a little weary of seeing its history reduced to Hitler, is
struggling to find a balance between a renewed thirst to celebrate
the great flowering of German culture in Weimar and elsewhere with
the duty to remember the Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   It is also battling with a unification process that has proved
far more difficult than expected precisely because the ``cultures''
of east and west are so divergent, and the memories of each part of
the country do not coincide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Germany now feels themselves responsible for
Goethe, for Schiller and for Beethoven _ but nobody for Himmler,''
Ignatz Bubis, the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said in an interview published in the magazine Stern last
week.
</P>
<P>
   It was an angry outburst, and a wild accusation, but it
reflected the cultural uncertainty of a country moving its center
of gravity back to Berlin from Bonn even as Germany's two
20th-century dictatorships _ Hitler's and Erich Honecker's _ are
still heatedly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere more so than in Weimar, which suffered the ravages of
both Nazism and communism with particular intensity. The name of
Goethe, synonymous with German genius, has consistently acted as a
magnet to regimes anxious to bolster their standing. ``The good and
the bad have always wanted to exploit the symbolism of this city,''
said Friedrich Folger, the deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment, six years ago, when Weimar was chosen as
Europe's cultural capital for 1999 _ the first town of the former
Soviet bloc to be so honored _ Bernd Kauffmann, the director of the
festival, was determined to break with the city's habits and treat
Weimar and Buchenwald as a single entity.
</P>
<P>
   This decision, he said, was rooted not in perversity or guilt,
but in the history that has made the alternation of eclectic
culture and narrow provincialism, avant-garde audacity and
reactionary conservatism, enlightenment and repression, perhaps the
single most distinguishing characteristic of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Bach lived here, only to clash with the ruling family and land
in prison. Goethe and Schiller came to Weimar, befriended each
other and together ushered in the ``Golden Age'' of German
literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. But by the
end of the 19th century, reactionary, anti-Semitic thinkers like
Adolf Bartels had made Weimar their home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, the Bauhaus movement was founded here in
1919, drawing the likes of Walter Gropius and Paul Klee to Weimar.
But then the narrow-mindedness of central Germany reasserted
itself, driving the Bauhaus 100 miles away to Dessau, and ushering
the Nazis to power in this region as early as the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hitler loved the place, visiting it dozens of times, trying to
make the town of Franz Liszt and Lucas Cranach a showcase of the
qualities of the German ``Volk.'' Not for nothing did he decide in
1937 to build Buchenwald a few miles from town as a prison for the
Jews, homosexuals, leftists, Gypsies and others seen as enemies of
the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ideology of the Nazis, Buchenwald was a cultural
project that belonged in Weimar,'' said Knigge, the director of the
camp memorial. ``Its purpose was to root out all that was unworthy,
all that was seen as cancerous, from German society, so that the
Volk could be united and at one in its genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The intimate ties between town and camp were graphically
illustrated in 1942 when Otto Koch, the mayor of Weimar, had the
singular idea of ordering prisoners at Buchenwald to build wooden
boxes to protect the works of Schiller and to make reproductions of
the furniture in the writer's house so that the originals could be
stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we understand how close one is to
another, how Weimar and Buchenwald are the light and dark of our
psyche,'' Kauffmann said. ``This, for me, remains a central German
theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way that theme has been illustrated has proved an
affront to some. The former Christian Democratic Interior Minister
Manfred Kanthner has called the emphasis on Buchenwald
``tiresome.'' Petra Uberhause of the Goethe Society said several of
its members were unhappy about the writer's drawings going on
display at Buchenwald, although no formal protest was made.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been fanned by the fact that both Kauffmann and
Knigge are ``Wessis,'' the former from Hamburg and the latter from
Cologne. Achim Preiss, the curator of an exhibition devoted partly
to the art of the former East German state that has prompted
outrage from ``Ossis,'' is also a westerner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the westerners cannot understand is that we also had our
birthdays, our weddings, our marriage, our moments of happiness,''
said Elvira Greiner, a city official who lived in the former
communist state. ``Not everything was the crass stupidity and lies
they portray.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the official East German ``lies'' concerned Buchenwald,
which was turned into a memorial in 1958 by the former regime at a
time when West Germany was doing its best to ignore the history of
camps like Dachau, near Munich. But the memorial was naturally
fashioned to bolster the prevailing ideology of the communist
state.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the prisoners who suffered and died in Buchenwald were all,
for the purposes of the East German regime, ``anti-Fascists'' and
Communists who fought Hitler. This was part of the story _ but said
nothing of the Jews, Gypsies and others imprisoned there, nor of
the fact that the American Army liberated Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that, from 1945 to 1952, the Soviet army used
Buchenwald as an internment camp for Germans, most of them
low-level Nazis, and that thousands died there, was also passed
over in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Knigge has now dragged all this history to the surface and is
organizing an exhibition of the ``history of memory'' at Buchenwald
since 1945 as part of the celebration of Weimar as Europe's
cultural capital. It will open in October.
</P>
<P>
   But although many applaud his efforts, the director has been
attacked by east Germans who feel that their Buchenwald has been
violated, and by some conservative west Germans who argue that the
camp should be devoted as much to the memory of Stalinism as Nazism
as a way to remember the German victims of the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   For 34 years, from 1960 to 1994, Manfred Dathe, aged 65, was the
gardener at Buchenwald. He had enough to live on, he said, and life
was secure and predictable. Then the wall fell and all certainties
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as German as the westerners, but my pension is only 80
percent of theirs,'' he said. ``Why is that? And why are all the
directors _ of the festival, the museums, this camp _ westerners?
Do they think we are incompetent?''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I lost my father on the eastern front in 1942. I
was 8. And then, when the war was over, we were told that Hitler
was bad, and the capitalists who supported him, and fascism, and of
course we believed the Communists. Now these people come here and
tell us that our history, all we learned, was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dathe shook his head in dismay. Memory in Germany remains an
insistent and divisive subject. From the camp, the organizers of
the festival have cut a path through the woods that they have
called ``Slice in Time.'' It connects Buchenwald with the beautiful
Ettersburg Castle, less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at her summer home, Duchess Anna Amalia held her ``Court
of the Muses'' between 1776 and 1780, drawing writers including
Goethe who performed in his own works.
</P>
<P>
   To leave behind Buchenwald's brick-chimneyed crematory, the
photographs of corpses piled high, the fence-posts shaped like
eternal question-marks, and to emerge _ a short time later _ from
the peaceful woods onto a soft hillside dominated by a castle where
civilization bloomed in the 18th century is to grasp something of
Germany's agonizing, and enduring, ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe's hero Faust declared, ``Two souls, alas, are housed
within my breast, and each will wrestle for mastery there.'' The
message from Weimar in this anniversary year is that the wrestling
has by no means entirely abated.

A FEE FIT FOR A LAWYER: $5,000 PER HOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Although the lawyers who led Massachusetts' fight
against the tobacco industry argue their $775 million legal fee is
not as big as it seems, a preliminary analysis indicates attorneys
may be paid nearly $5,000 per hour for their work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one tobacco company argued, the fee is so excessive the
lawyers could buy both the Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots
with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award should be a concern to everyone who values a fair
legal system,'' Mark Smith, a spokesman for the Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp. of Louisville, Ky. ``Attorney fees should be based on
legal principles, not a jackpot-lottery mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrators Thursday awarded the firms a fee equivalent to
9.3 percent of the state's $8.2 billion settlement from the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer, the lead firm on the case, has not
said whether it will seek to enforce a contract with the state
entitling lawyers to 25 percent of the settlement, or $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the possibility of legal challenge to this
(arbitration) process and to our award, the unknown impact of
future arbitration awards and the present uncertainty of payment,
it is premature to publicly discuss its impact on our agreement
with the Commonwealth,'' Brown Rudnick chairman Andre C. Jasse
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick lawyers have said because the arbitration award
will be paid out over 25 years or more, its value will decrease
dramatically with time. And because the tobacco industry is under
assault and may shrink, the lawyers argue, they may never see all
the money.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony before the arbitration panel, two of the
five law firms hired by Massachusetts logged 65,000 hours of work
in the three years before the national settlement in 1998. Three
other firms failed to keep records of their time as required. The
names of the firms that kept records could not be determined
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the labor is divided equally among the firms, the fee works
out to $4,769 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take 44,995 Massachusetts citizens -- or more than
the entire combined populations of Lexington, Hyannis, Wilbraham
and Concord -- working an entire year to earn what the
Massachusetts legal team has been awarded for its work on this
single lawsuit,'' Smith said, basing his assertion on Massachusetts
wage statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fees to be paid by the industry will not reduce the
$8.2 billion to be given Massachusetts under the national tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci and Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly
have pledged to fight any attempt by the law firms to gain a share
of the state's settlement. Cellucci, for his part, has filed
legislation to block such payments.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel split, 2-1, in its decision. The law firms
found an ally in Harry Huge, the attorneys' appointee to the
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, risks taken by lawyers, and results achieved by
lawyers, are not held to the same standards of risks and rewards
taken by entrepreneurs or the compensation of professional
athletes, entertainers or CEOs of major corporations,'' Huge said
in his dissenting opinion.
</P>

   ``The Massachusetts case is not one of an hourly wage-earner ...
but of the risk-taker whose synergistic effort of long-term and
constant contributions lead to extraordinary success,'' Huge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick lawyer Thomas M. Sobol, the firm's lead attorney
in the case, has cited the long odds in challenging an industry
that had never lost a lawsuit, the risk of great financial loss
from the litigation, and the contribution to the state's public
health as factors that support a large award.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the arbitration chairman, wrote that although the law
firms ``deserve to be handsomely compensated for their efforts,''
they do not merit ``the same treatment as the truly pioneering
states. An award of 25 percent, or more than $2 billion, would be
grossly excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts was the fifth state to sue the tobacco industry,
about 1 1/2 years after Mississippi filed the first lawsuit. A
total of $8.6 billion in legal fees is to be paid to the states
considered consensus pioneers in the anti-tobacco fight:
Mississippi, Texas, Florida and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown Rudnick, the other law firms retained by
then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger are Thornton, Early and
Naumes; Schneider, Reilly, Costello and Zabin, both of Boston;
Leiff, Cabraser, Heimann and Bernstein of San Francisco; and Ness,
Motley, Loadholt, Richardson and Poole of Charleston, S.C.

   NEW YORK _ As Marc Jacobs put it before the first of his models
ambled out in boyish T-shirts and dull brown trousers, ``You don't
really want to notice what a guy is wearing.'' But he was putting
it mildly. By the time the New York spring men's wear shows had
ended last week, you could scarcely remember what anybody was
wearing, so banal were most of the collections.
</P>
<P>
   Not every designer can afford to be as audacious as Tom Ford of
Gucci or as tersely elegant as Hedi Slimane of Yves Saint Laurent.
Nor are there enough male glamour pusses for their kind of drama.
But the shows demonstrated such a mindless affection for the
commonplace that they almost subverted interest in the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   How many designers does it take to create a pair of cotton and
nylon trousers with that sporty edge? Answer: About 15.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of collections based on such generic street styles as
sleeveless T-shirts and cropped nylon pants is not that their
designers insist on putting them on a runway. Rather, it's that
they actually think people will believe that these clothes are new
just because they're now made of resinated cotton instead of plain
old cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about fabrics,'' said David Chu, the Nautica
designer, as he led pointed out such marginal details as orange
piping on a khaki windbreaker or the tonal effect of white ribbing
on a cream-colored sweater.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the party line heard everywhere. If a collection
wasn't all about comfort, it was all about individuality. At Donna
Karan, where Ms. Karan personally presented selections from both
her DKNY and her main lines , there was a winning sense of comfort
and individuality as models lounged around in brightly colored
linen shirts, washed cotton trousers and what she called her shirt
suit _ a kind of yogi ensemble in rumpled linen that might be said
to be all about self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karan paused reflectively and said of her collection, ``It's
all about what guys like to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not about design.
</P>
<P>
   At least Jacobs' show displayed confidence. Out came models
dressed in caramel-brown leather jackets that looked worn and
slightly offhand with green trousers that resembled rinsed denim.
His collection relied on low-key styling rather than obvious
design. Classic elements like glen plaid trousers were worn with
gold knit pullovers, while baby-blue or gold corduroy trousers had
a kind of geeky charm, especially with plain striped shirts. The
models mostly wore sneakers, and many hadn't bothered to shave.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley's poolside review at a West Side hotel looked
playful as models padded around the deck in her signature flower
prints, with ruffled white shirts fanning open over bare chests.
Some of the prints seemed to draw on Gucci's flower power, but this
is Ms. Rowley's territory, too, and with hotter shades of orange
and yellow a trend in the Italian men's wear shows last month, Ms.
Rowley was smart to stage a riot of color. Many New York shows
suffered from having too many bland ice cream shades of peach and
lemon that added to the ``neither here nor there'' quality of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Rowley's models jumped into the pool, agreeably
splashing overheated guests, while the designer seemed to consider
her diving form before taking the plunge herself.
</P>
<P>
   Few American designers are as adept as Sandy Dalal at giving
clothes an edge without making men look foolish or self-conscious.
His show opened with white and pale-gray suits worn with Converse
sneakers, and subtle glen plaid trousers, also shown with Converse,
and high-neck windbreakers. Here and there were offbeat prints,
like a zigzag pattern in navy and orange on cropped trousers, and a
sweet but not unmanly daisy print on a pale blue background. But
this collection lacked Dalal's usual verve, and he might have
pushed some of his stronger details to the forefront. They seemed a
little squandered amid many of the ubiquitous sportswear shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cole opened his show at the Manhattan Center Studios
with a video montage that showed New Yorkers as fun-loving,
politically tolerate, semi-adorable people. In each image, someone
held up a placard displaying one of Cole's slogans, and there was
even a shot of the shrine outside 20 North Moore Street, where John
F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy lived, that showed
flowers and a placard placed by the video crew that said, a little
cloyingly, ``Remember Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole certainly knows how to pour on the sap. He played a lot of
old Beatles and John Lennon numbers, like ``Imagine,'' and
eventually there were some clothes, too: nylon windbreakers and
beach jams, crinkly cotton trousers and satchel bags, and jumpsuits
and zip-front jackets that looked like filling station attire.
There wasn't much new here, but it will look good on video.
</P>
<P>
   With Tommy Hilfiger and John Bartlett opting to show their
spring men's clothes with their women's collections in September,
and Ralph Lauren deciding not to make any presentation ( Lauren has
long maintained that there's something embarrassing about men's
fashion shows, and he's not completely wrong), the New York
collections seemed shy of big-league significance, to say nothing
of real news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the Paris and Milan shows, I did think those
collections were more aggressive, especially with deeper colors,''
said Dan McCampbell, men's fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue.
Of the New York shows, he added, ``There were good elements, but
you have to be a good editor.''
</P>
<P>
   That might mean plucking from Joseph Abboud's trademark
many-hues-of-beige collection a black unlined suit of narrow
pinstripes, or perhaps a graphite-gray jacket worn with dove-gray
trousers and a gray herringbone shirt. It could also mean John
Scher's polished cotton tops and windbreakers with ruching down the
side or tiny gathers at the hem, a not-too-veiled reference to
Gucci but an intriguing counterbalance to ubiquitous nylon surfer
pants.
</P>
<P>
   At Perry Ellis, there were leather Indian slip-ons worn with
suits of pale wrinkled cotton, as if the wearer had just alighted
from a sleeping car in Delhi, and the usual file of men in filling
station windbreakers, slouchy pants and the odd, vaguely appealing
jacket in spearmint leather. Gene Meyer's collection was
straightforward, with many fine knits and some vests, in vivid
shapes of aqua and lavender, that were ventilated for sex appeal.
They could be unzipped at the neck or discreetly over the abs.
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Nigel Curtiss, a British designer who used to work
for Comme des Garcons and until this season was showing his own
collections in Paris, to say something that, at least in this
arena, seemed farsighted. Curtiss used color and pattern, like
gingham checks, to convey his message. For instance, he mixed a
yellow and black flame-licked print shirt with pink-check baggy
pants. A lot of the fabrics, like navy-stripe and brown-check
cotton, looked homespun.
</P>
<P>
   This idea, distilled from the Arts and Crafts style, turned up
in March in the women's shows, notably at Marni and Fendi. Curtiss
appeared to be equally touched by the guilelessness of the look,
which, when his models wore white opaque knee socks, brought to
mind an eccentric caretaker careening around a decrepit English
estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got fed up with this nylon futuristic fashion,'' he
said backstage. ``I wanted to make something that was a bit softer
and more romantic.''

AUTONATION TO SHED CAR RENTAL BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Thomson' in 7th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Trying to raise a sagging share price, H. Wayne
Huizenga announced Monday that Autonation Inc., the giant
automotive retailer that he controls, would spin off or sell its
struggling car rental businesses, which include National Car Rental
and Alamo Rent-a-Car.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the move might look like a retreat from Huizenga's
vision two years ago of assembling an empire that would reap
economies of scale by being involved in every stage of selling,
renting and servicing new and used cars, he insisted in an
interview that it was not a step back.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he hoped to preserve many of the advantages of
a large-scale operation by writing a contract with the car rental
groups before disposing of them. Under the contract, Autonation
will continue to service many cars for the rental businesses and
will continue to sell them some new cars, Huizenga said. He added
that he hoped to spin off the rental operations to shareholders or
sell stock in them to the public. He said selling the businesses to
another company would be his last choice.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the plan is to increase Autonation's share price by
making it purely an automotive retailing company, Huizenga said.
</P>
<P>
   The move will be the latest in a flurry of changes at
Autonation, which also named a new president Monday, Michael E.
Maroone, a longtime Florida car dealer who until now has been the
president of Autonation's car dealerships group. Autonation
announced on June 30 that it had begun looking for a new chief
executive with automotive experience to replace its current
co-chief executives: Huizenga, who will remain as chairman, and
Steven R. Berrard, who is leaving Autonation's management but will
remain on its board.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Autonation spun off its garbage hauling business and
changed its name from Republic Industries. Since 1997, it has also
sold its home-alarm business and shifted its emphasis toward
new-car retailing and away from used-car superstores and automobile
repair shops. The pace of the changes has dismayed financial
analysts, who say that the company should choose a strategy and
stick to it long enough for its earnings to be better understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to see them settle down and put some numbers
on the board and have a pure auto retailing business and not try to
be recreating the world at every turn,'' said Tom Thomson, an auto
retailing analyst at First Union Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Autonation's shares rose 31.25 cents Monday to close at $15.25.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is trading at a third of its level of two years ago.
Wall Street was captivated then by Huizenga's vision of
consolidating the automotive business as he had already
consolidated the garbage hauling and video rental businesses by
building Waste Management Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Autonation has become the world's largest seller of new
automobiles, with 412 franchises and 42 used-car superstores. Its
sales of $5.07 billion in the second quarter included 119,000 new
vehicles and 84,000 used.
</P>
<P>
   Investor interest in the company has cooled as its profit
margins have lagged behind those of some competitors, although
Autonation said Monday that margins inched up in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga said he still believed Autonation would transform auto
retailing. ``Our vision is to change the way customers are treated,
to change the way customers buy their cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Autonation sells used cars at fixed prices and has said that it
will gradually move its new-car dealerships toward the same policy.
Though such sales are popular with consumer advocates, who accuse
many traditional dealers of unscrupulous negotiating tactics, the
policy allows rival dealers to take away business by slightly
undercutting Autonation's fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been turning to the stocks of companies that own
only dealerships and are run by people with lots of automotive
experience. Lithia Motors Inc., which is based in Medford, Ore.,
has thrived under the control of Sidney DeBoer, a car dealer since
1968. The United Auto Group, which has struggled under a succession
of chief executives from outside the auto industry, has won friends
recently on Wall Street with the pending sale of a 39 percent stake
to Roger Penske, a prominent car dealer who also races cars and
controls a diesel engine company.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals like DeBoer have been skeptical that the highly
competitive dealership business has room for new approaches like
Huizenga's. ``You're not going to come up with a new concept and
turn the world over,'' DeBoer said Monday. ``It has all been
tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The car rental businesses that Autonation plans to dispose of
include not only National and Alamo but also a third company,
Cartemps USA, which Huizenga created by buying and renaming two car
rental businesses, Spirit and Thrifty, and merging them with
Alasys, an affiliate of Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Autonation said Monday that its second-quarter operating income
from car rentals fell to $30 million from $45 million a year ago on
revenue of $893 million, up 3.2 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Huizenga, who made one fortune from Waste Management and another
from Blockbuster, has many other investments. Although he sold the
Florida Marlins baseball team after it won the World Series in
1997, he still owns the Miami Dolphins football team and is the
chairman of a holding company that owns the Florida Panthers hockey
team and some hotels. He is also the chairman of Republic Services
Inc., a garbage hauling company in which Autonation sold its
remaining 63 percent stake in April.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Huizenga has become more focused on selling new cars,
the Ford Motor Co. has begun following his example to some extent
by trying to provide cradle-to-grave services for automobiles. Ford
has formed partnerships with dealers to buy up all of the Ford,
Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda and Jaguar dealerships in half a dozen
cities, and then set common prices at all the dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Ford agreed this spring to buy one company that owns junkyards
and another company that sells extended service contracts. And Ford
is trying hard to increase sales of auto parts by encouraging
dealers to do repair work at more competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has run into other problems. Texas car dealers, for
example, recently pushed a law through the state legislature
banning manufacturers from owning dealerships. Autonation said
Monday that it had signed an agreement to buy four Ford-owned
dealerships in Ft. Worth that the auto maker must sell.

LAWMAKERS URGE CASTRO TO VISIT SEATTLE DURING WTO MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By zzz  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dear Fidel Castro: Please come to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the invitation sent to the Cuban leader by Rep. Jim
McDermott, a majority of the Seattle City Council, and a minority
of the Metropolitan King County Council.
</P>
<P>
   The elected officials, undaunted by what Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright last week called ``growing concern about Cuba's
dismal human rights'' record, sent separate letters urging Castro
to attend the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle
beginning Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Castro needs a invitation from Seattle to
attend the meeting _ Cuba is an active member of the organization
attended a WTO meeting in Geneva last year.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott, unhappy that Castro had been snubbed by New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani when the Cuban leader attended a celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in New York in 1995,
wanted Castro to know he would be more welcome in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that our entire community would be eager to hear
from you, discuss with you, and probably debate with you about the
future of our relationship,'' McDermott, a Seattle Democrat, wrote
to Castro. ``You will be received respectfully, graciously and
warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott described himself in the letter as an opponent of the
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba who visited the nation in 1992.
McDermott also touted what he said was Seattle's ``long history of
involvement with Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was one of the most ardent supporters of the
Venceramos Brigades of the late 1960s and early 1970s,'' McDermott
wrote. ``In fact, several of Seattle's prominent political and
business leaders were Venceramos Brigade graduates or supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1970, a group of young Seattleites chartered a Greyhound bus
for Canada and then boarded a freighter for Cuba, where they spent
several months helping to harvest sugar cane. They returned
denouncing U.S. policy toward Cuba.)
</P>
<P>
   The members of the city and county councila wrote somewhat less
enthusiastic letters urging Castro to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the expectation that Cuba, as a founding and current member
of the World Trade Organization, will be sending a delegation to
Seattle ... we hope you will take this opportunity to personally
visit us,'' wrote five of the nine City Council members, including
President Sue Donaldson and members Nick Licata, Richard McIver,
Tina Podlodowski and Peter Steinbrueck. ``There is much that we
hope that you could learn from your visit to increase trade between
our region and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The County Council letter was signed by five of the 13 members,
all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should you decide to lead the Cuban delegation to this
historic event, we would be honored to have you visit with us,''
wrote council members Maggi Fimia, Larry Gossett, Greg Nickels,
Dwight Pelz and Larry Phillips. ``We think your visit here will be
a very educational and enriching experience, both for you and the
people who reside in communities throughout our region of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican county councilman, Peter von Reichbauer, said he
didn't sign the letter only because he wasn't asked, but that he
had no objection to its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be a strong believer in free trade, and I believe
that by inviting Fidel Castro to Seattle, we recognize he is the
leader of a nation in our regional sphere of influence as well as
internationally,'' von Reichbauer said. ``It would be shortsighted
not to invite him to participate in the WTO meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But two City Council members said they declined to sign the
letter because they oppose the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it's appropriate because of our (lack of)
diplomatic relations with him,'' said City Councilwoman Martha
Choe. ``I was embarrassed by the letter. I took one look at and
said, `I'm not signing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Conlin said it was inappropriate to single
out only one head of state to invite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel differently if he was a hero _ if it was Winston
Churchill after World War II,'' Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Licata said he signed as a courtesy to McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Trade Organization is open to a wide variety of
organizations, and inviting Castro would encourage a more fuller
discussion of the WTO's role,'' Licata said. ``And we might get
some business out of this. I'm concerned about improving trade
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Council on International Trade President Patricia
Davis said she believes it is up to President Clinton to decide
which world leaders to invite, because the WTO meeting is geared
for trade ministers. She said Seattle would welcome any world
leader who chose to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is so politically touchy that the United States Trade
Representative's office declined to comment on the letters to
Castro. State Department officials were not immediately available
for comment last night, and a spokesman at the Cuban government's
interest section in Washington, D.C., said he did not know whether
Castro would attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state is heavily dependent on exports, and industries
such as aerospace and agriculture have chafed under the strictures
of the United States' many economic sanctions against other
countries. The state's pea and lentil growers in particular have
mourned the loss of Cuba as a trading partner, because it had been
the largest importer of those commodities in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Castro took power in Cuba on Jan. 1, 1959, and, according to the
State Department, consolidated his power by imprisoning or
executing opponents. Castro declared Cuba a socialist state in
1961, and maintained close relations with the Soviet Union until
its demise in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says the Cuban government's human rights
record is ``abysmal'' and that ``it systematically violates
fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. The United
States has maintained an economic embargo against Cuba since 1962.

ASIAN LUXURY HOTEL IS NEAR A RARE SALE

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ In a relatively small deal with broad implications,
an investment firm connected with the Rockefeller family appears
set to buy a luxury hotel on the island of Bali from a company
controlled by one of Indonesia's own wealthy industrial dynasties,
according to people close to the buyer and seller.
</P>
<P>
   Surya Semesta Internusa, a company controlled by the Suriadjaya
family of Indonesia, plans to sell the 500-room Melia Bali hotel to
Trenwith Holdings Ltd. for approximately $50 million, one of the
informants said. Trenwith is a joint venture 70 percent owned by
Rockvest Development, a Rockefeller trust controlled by Nicholas
Rockefeller, a California lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   More than the names of the buyer and seller, the deal is
important because big real-estate transactions in Asia,
particularly any involving prominent hotels, have been extremely
rare, even with the Asian economic crisis severely hurting the
hotel business.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury hotels are considered business trophies that symbolize
success, and Asian owners try to keep them regardless of their own
financial problems. From that perspective, the sale of the Melia
Bali may signal the sales of other big Asian hotels in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by telephone, a spokesman for Surya Semesta said the
company had not signed any agreements, and he rejected requests for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   One person said Surya Semesta had already signed a sales
agreement and another said other prospective buyers who met with
the company's vice president and director, Johannes Suriadjaya,
last week in Jakarta, Indonesia, were told that the hotel had
already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Trenwith also did not respond to repeated requests for
interviews, and Rockefeller did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Asia's financial difficulties, the real-estate market
has been remarkably slow. Hotels are a good example.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Singapore office of the real-estate brokerage
firm Jones Lang LaSalle, only eight hotel transactions took place
last year, $300 million in deals that represent just 0.2 percent of
the entire Asian hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, more than 15 percent of the
market changed hands last year. Would-be investors and brokers say
hotel owners are hanging onto their properties, often defaulting on
loans, in hope that the market may recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pulling a Gadhafi,'' said Robert Stiles, managing
director at the real-estate investment bank Sonnenblick-Goldman,
alluding to practices of the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
of moving from place to place to elude attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel owners, Stiles says, typically play potential buyers
against their bankers in a bid for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this constant shuttling between the tents,'' he said.
``The hope is that conditions will improve so you don't have to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The noisiest complaints about such tactics have come from
potential buyers, who say that this reflects the underlying
cronyism and favoritism still permeating Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are less critical, though. Speaking in Bangkok,
Thailand, last week, the World Bank's chief economist, Joseph
Stiglitz, praised the progress he said Asia had made in recovering
from the deep crisis that began in the summer of 1997, saying
criticism was coming largely from foreigners disappointed that they
had failed to pick up cheap assets.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hotels have occupied a special place in Asia's corporate
firmament. Where hotels in the United States tend to be owned by
institutional investors who put a priority on profit, Asian hotels
are typically owned by family-run conglomerates and managed by
foreign companies, serving as glamorous testaments to corporate
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Among these, the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong is owned by the
Kadoorie family. Singapore's Ritz-Carlton belongs to four
Indonesian brothers named Kwee. The Shangri-La hotels are
controlled by the Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok. And the Meridien
President in Bangkok is owned by a former deputy prime minister and
prominent businessman, Chalermphan Srivikorn.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-acre, $200-a-night Melia Bali, with its plunge pools and
personal butlers, is no exception. The Suriadjaya family's
patriarch was William Suriadjaya, an ethnic Chinese trader who in
1957 started an automobile company called Astra.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Suriadjaya remains one of the most respected figures in
Indonesian business and Astra International is the country's
largest automaker, a $1.7 billion company with diversified
interests ranging from palm oil to running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Suriadjayas no longer own it. While it was
trust-busters who spelled the end of the Rockefeller empire _ if
not its riches _ in 1911, the Suriadjaya family's nemesis came in
the form of William's son, Edward. In 1992, Edward ruined the
family bank, forcing his father to sell the Astra stake to cover
his losses.
</P>
<P>
   Surya Semesta Internusa is a holding company in which William
had a stake when it was founded in 1971, but which is now
controlled by William's brother Benjamin Suriadjaya and his son
Johannes. It has interests in construction, building material, real
estate and the Melia Bali, which is managed by Sol Melia SA of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said the $50 million price for the Melia
Bali is high, but they hope it will encourage other property owners
in the region to sell.

 START-UP OFFERS FREE iMACS FOR ONLY $718.20  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Los Angeles-based start-up company said Monday
that beginning next month it intended to give away one million of
Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMacs to customers who sign up for
its Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The news briefly sent Apple shares to a new 52-week high, but
they had settled back by the close of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up, Freemac.com, said it would give away iMacs to
customers who qualified for a Freemac-brand Visa card and agreed to
pay $19.95 a month for three years for Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Freemac said it was a partner with Earthlink Network, a major
Internet service provider; First USA, the Visa and Mastercard
issuing subsidiary of the Bank One Corp.; Cybercash, an electronic
commerce company, and Peter Max, the 1960s pop artist, who will
serve as spokesman and ``chief creativity officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares closed Monday at $55.75, up 6.25 cents, in Nasdaq
trading, having traded as high as $58 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokeswoman said the company had no comment other than
to confirm that Apple was not affiliated with Freemac in any way
and was not offering the company any special terms or discounts.
Freemac said it would purchase the machines through Ingram Micro, a
major Apple distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Apple could only benefit from Freemac's offer
but that the company was right to stay out of the free computer
business itself. Although a million iMacs is a goal of the new
service, rather than a commitment, Freemac will almost surely add
to Apple's revenues, and without any risk to Apple's capital,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac has already garnered a reputation as the easiest way to
use the Internet, and the Freemac deal should enhance that
reputation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it gets more Macs out into the market, they have to
be pleased,'' said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative
Strategies. ``The traditional consumer who's heard all the hype
about the Internet and what a cool machine the iMac is might see
this as an easy point of entry.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all so-called free PC deals, Freemac has some fine print
in its agreement. Customers must qualify for the credit card, which
carries a competitive annual percentage rate and no annual fee, and
must agree to remain with the service for the full three years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each iMac comes with 2 gigabytes of its hard drive
_ one-third its capacity _ filled with promotional materials from
Freemac's partners. Freemac said customers would be offered
discounts and services from a group of as yet unnamed marketing
partners, as well as Peter Max posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different about it is we're actually giving away a
computer that people have heard of and that has a recognized value
in the marketplace,'' said Jonathan Strum, Freemac's founder and
chief executive. ``We're taking the approach that the iMac is a
gateway into the Freemac community, and we're putting together a
whole bunch of value-adds that the rest of the world doesn't get
access to. It's up to us to make it worth your while.''

AFTER WOBBLING, HILLARY CLINTON STRIKES BALANCE ON MIDDLE EAST
POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen months ago, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared
that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state was
``very important for the broader goal of peace'' in the Middle
East. The administration disowned her remarks the next day, and she
was attacked by Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the first lady, preparing for a possible Senate race in
New York, wrote a letter to Jewish leaders proclaiming Jerusalem
the ``eternal and indivisible capital of Israel'' and called for
the American Embassy to be moved there. Once again, her husband's
administration disavowed her comments, and this time, she was
assailed by Arab groups.
</P>
<P>
   She tried yet again last week to address one of the most
difficult issues she will face if running for senator from New
York, which has perhaps the most influential bloc of Jewish voters
in the nation. This time, in speeches to two Jewish groups in
Washington, she was nuanced and uncontroversial, sounding more like
a State Department bureaucrat than an advocate propounding either
side of a difficult argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Israel continues to take risks for peace, I believe the
United States must stand beside her as any good friend does,'' Mrs.
Clinton said at the 85th annual convention of Hadassah, the Jewish
women's group. ``We must do everything in our power to facilitate _
not dictate _ the peace process. If there is to be peace in the
Middle East, it must come with a guarantee of Israel's security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be peace, we must honor the Oslo process and
oppose any unilateral actions that circumvent the negotiating
table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her evolving commentary on an always central topic in New York
campaigns has drawn criticism from Republican leaders, perplexed
some Jewish leaders and stirred concern among some of her own
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican who is considering a race
for the Senate seat, earlier this year described Mrs. Clinton's
remarks about Palestine as a ``big mistake,'' and a small group of
conservative Jewish leaders last month protested after Hadassah
gave Mrs. Clinton its annual humanitarian award.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stir over her statements, Jewish and Democratic
leaders say they doubt that her handling of the issue so far will
hurt her with this important segment of the New York electorate.
And while her views on the subject, her own advisers acknowledge,
have been clumsily presented _ a more experienced New York
politician would never publicly embrace the notion of a Palestinian
state _ they are ultimately in keeping with those of many Jewish
leaders in the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't said anything that mainstream Israelis haven't been
saying for years, including Barak,'' said Ed Koch, the former
Democratic mayor, referring to Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister. ``It's the people who really want to harm Israel who
convey that what she is saying is outlandish.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli analysts said there was no inconsistency between
Mrs. Clinton's Middle East pronouncements, even as she has sought
to argue both the Israeli position on Jerusalem and the Arab
position on Palestine. ``If you ask most Israelis, there's no
inconsistency between those two views,'' said Jonathan Jacoby, a
New York-based expert on Israeli policy. ``Because most Israelis
have already accepted that there will be some sort of Palestinian
state, and know that Jerusalem is the capital and will remain
undivided.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has devoted much attention to cultivating support among
Jewish voters, and his advisers say he will do so again in a Senate
race, if he runs. He invoked Mrs. Clinton's remarks about Palestine
as soon as it became clear that she was seriously considering a run
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, like President Clinton, appears to have broad
support among American Jews. A poll commissioned by the Israel
Policy Forum, conducted among 606 Jewish voters from June 27
through July 4, found that 72 percent of the respondents viewed her
favorably. The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus
four percentage points, was taken after she made her comments about
Palestine and before the release of her letter about Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Mrs. Clinton's struggle to strike the right note on
this issue suggests that the Middle East is one topic, as one
adviser said, where she is going to have to find a way to reconcile
the public policy demands of being First Lady with the political
ones of being a candidate for office.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has rigorously avoided taking positions on
the future status of Jerusalem, the placement of the American
Embassy, or the establishment of a Palestinian state, which are all
sensitive subjects in the peace talks. But Mrs. Clinton cannot
afford such ambiguities in a state where about 12 percent of the
voter turnout is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks track her evolution from first lady into
near-candidate. She made her statements about a Palestinian state
well before she had any idea that she might be running for office
from New York. Her Jerusalem letter was written to the Union of
Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, a conservative
organization, in the first week of June, about the time that she
reached a final decision on forming an exploratory committee on a
possible Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Her speeches last week in Washington to Hadassah and the
National Jewish Democratic Council, a group of Jewish Democrats,
were part of an attempt by Mrs. Clinton and her aides to repair
what they acknowledged had been a disjointed presentation on the
subject. Significantly, she made no mention of a Palestinian state
in either speech, and she did not diverge from her husband's view
of Jerusalem as the ``eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''
Even as she endorsed the idea of moving the embassy, she packaged
her views as safely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look forward,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ``to the day when,
as Prime Minister Barak said on his recent visit, Jerusalem will be
home to the Embassy of the United States and all other nations as
well.''

SUCCESSFUL TRIAL FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-TAIWAN) 
(mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a second straight success, an experimental
theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday
at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that
the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.9 billion Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD,
has been plagued with problems, and it failed six earlier tests. It
intercepted its first target in June. One failed test in March led
the Pentagon to impose $15 million in penalties against the
developer, Lockheed Martin, and members of Congress had asked the
Pentagon to find another contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's test involved the missile's ability to hit its first
target outside the earth's atmosphere as well as hitting a
separated warhead for the first time, said Jennifer Canaff of the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Canaff said Monday's test was more difficult because the
cooling of the target in outer space reduced the ability of the
missile's infrared sensors to detect it.
</P>
<P>
   Approved in the early 1990s, the program to create a mobile
ground missile defense system against medium-range ballistic
missiles would be used overseas, if it is ultimately deployed.
</P>
<P>
   China has protested American plans to create theater missile
defense systems with Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan to
protect allied and American troops based in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Several independent scientists questioned the importance of
Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested
against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the
results were going to be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to test against realistic targets that actively try
to evade the defense system _ simulate real world targets _ and not
just hit missiles on a test range,'' said Tom Collina, director of
the arms control program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a
Washington watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lockheed Martin say those tests will come in the
next engineering and manufacturing phase of development.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile defense system must still pass one of two final
tests to be held in September and next February before it can move
to that phase.

LAWMAKERS URGE CASTRO TO VISIT SEATTLE DURING WTO MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dear Fidel Castro: Please come to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the invitation sent to the Cuban leader by Rep. Jim
McDermott, a majority of the Seattle City Council, and a minority
of the Metropolitan King County Council.
</P>
<P>
   The elected officials, undaunted by what Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright last week called ``growing concern about Cuba's
dismal human rights'' record, sent separate letters urging Castro
to attend the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle
beginning Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Castro needs a invitation from Seattle to
attend the meeting _ Cuba is an active member of the organization
attended a WTO meeting in Geneva last year.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott, unhappy that Castro had been snubbed by New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani when the Cuban leader attended a celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in New York in 1995,
wanted Castro to know he would be more welcome in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that our entire community would be eager to hear
from you, discuss with you, and probably debate with you about the
future of our relationship,'' McDermott, a Seattle Democrat, wrote
to Castro. ``You will be received respectfully, graciously and
warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott described himself in the letter as an opponent of the
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba who visited the nation in 1992.
McDermott also touted what he said was Seattle's ``long history of
involvement with Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was one of the most ardent supporters of the
Venceramos Brigades of the late 1960s and early 1970s,'' McDermott
wrote. ``In fact, several of Seattle's prominent political and
business leaders were Venceramos Brigade graduates or supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1970, a group of young Seattleites chartered a Greyhound bus
for Canada and then boarded a freighter for Cuba, where they spent
several months helping to harvest sugar cane. They returned
denouncing U.S. policy toward Cuba.)
</P>
<P>
   The members of the city and county councila wrote somewhat less
enthusiastic letters urging Castro to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the expectation that Cuba, as a founding and current member
of the World Trade Organization, will be sending a delegation to
Seattle ... we hope you will take this opportunity to personally
visit us,'' wrote five of the nine City Council members, including
President Sue Donaldson and members Nick Licata, Richard McIver,
Tina Podlodowski and Peter Steinbrueck. ``There is much that we
hope that you could learn from your visit to increase trade between
our region and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The County Council letter was signed by five of the 13 members,
all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should you decide to lead the Cuban delegation to this
historic event, we would be honored to have you visit with us,''
wrote council members Maggi Fimia, Larry Gossett, Greg Nickels,
Dwight Pelz and Larry Phillips. ``We think your visit here will be
a very educational and enriching experience, both for you and the
people who reside in communities throughout our region of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican county councilman, Peter von Reichbauer, said he
didn't sign the letter only because he wasn't asked, but that he
had no objection to its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be a strong believer in free trade, and I believe
that by inviting Fidel Castro to Seattle, we recognize he is the
leader of a nation in our regional sphere of influence as well as
internationally,'' von Reichbauer said. ``It would be shortsighted
not to invite him to participate in the WTO meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But two City Council members said they declined to sign the
letter because they oppose the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it's appropriate because of our (lack of)
diplomatic relations with him,'' said City Councilwoman Martha
Choe. ``I was embarrassed by the letter. I took one look at and
said, `I'm not signing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Conlin said it was inappropriate to single
out only one head of state to invite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel differently if he was a hero _ if it was Winston
Churchill after World War II,'' Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Licata said he signed as a courtesy to McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Trade Organization is open to a wide variety of
organizations, and inviting Castro would encourage a more fuller
discussion of the WTO's role,'' Licata said. ``And we might get
some business out of this. I'm concerned about improving trade
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Council on International Trade President Patricia
Davis said she believes it is up to President Clinton to decide
which world leaders to invite, because the WTO meeting is geared
for trade ministers. She said Seattle would welcome any world
leader who chose to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is so politically touchy that the United States Trade
Representative's office declined to comment on the letters to
Castro. State Department officials were not immediately available
for comment last night, and a spokesman at the Cuban government's
interest section in Washington, D.C., said he did not know whether
Castro would attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state is heavily dependent on exports, and industries
such as aerospace and agriculture have chafed under the strictures
of the United States' many economic sanctions against other
countries. The state's pea and lentil growers in particular have
mourned the loss of Cuba as a trading partner, because it had been
the largest mporter of those commodities in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Castro took power in Cuba on Jan. 1, 1959, and, according to the
State Department, consolidated his power by imprisoning or
executing opponents. Castro declared Cuba a socialist state in
1961, and maintained close relations with the Soviet Union until
its demise in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says the Cuban government's human rights
record is ``abysmal'' and that ``it systematically violates
fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. The United
States has maintained an economic embargo against Cuba since 1962.

RODHAM CLINTON SAYS CHILDHOOD ABUSE IMPAIRED HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The glitterati turned out Monday night for the
long-awaited party celebrating the premiere of Tina Brown's Talk
magazine _ models, movie stars, movers and shakers from Manhattan
and the Coast. But conspicuously absent from the fete was its main
attraction _ the cover lady, and the source of all the buzz,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax Pictures, which owns the magazine, did invite the First
Lady, but her no-show should have taken no one by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smart thing for her not to be there,'' Hank Sheinkopf,
a Democratic consultant, said earlier in the day. ``It's too
elitist a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to continue her
Senate-campaign ``listening tour'' across upstate New York _
journeying to Jamestown, Buffalo, and Rochester, once-prosperous
industrial cities that never bounced back from the 1980s'
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid photos of the First Lady laughing and swigging champagne
with the likes of Kate Moss, Demi Moore and Spike Lee may not have
cast the sort of image she needs to project.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, an pollster based upstate, said Monday, ``She's got
to appear less the celebrity _ and less the friend of celebrities _
and more the plodding, hard-working campaigner.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Talk magazine has already helped _ or, some say, hurt _
her enough.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue, which appears on newsstands Tuesday, contains
an interview with Mrs. Clinton. And, at least in excerpts leaked to
both of New York City's tabloids over the weekend, she discusses
President Clinton's illicit affairs in greater detail than she ever
has before.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges her husband's ``weaknesses,'' and attributes
them to the pains of his childhood _ the desperate desire to please
both his mother and grandmother, who were in ``terrible conflict''
with each other, as well as the emotional ``abuse'' inflicted by an
alcoholic stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicos, from both parties, see these remarks as
deliberately planned and politically motivated. Support for that
view comes indirectly from her husband. His spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, told reporters in Washington Monday that President
Clinton is ``comfortable with the views expressed in the article
and the fact she did the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   However, assuming that all statements in a campaign are
politically motivated, the real question is whether it will work.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf sees the First Lady's remarks as a ``very important''
development in her campaign. ``It takse some of what's been dogging
her and puts it behind her, so she can start moving on to issues,''
he said. ``It shows New Yorkers that she will talk to them frankly
and courageously.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Joseph Mercurio, a Republican consultant,
sees it as pure opportunism. ``It's 'Go for the sympathy vote,'''
he scoffed, ``especially since she's doing poorly among women above
45 _ the daytime talk-show women, the soap-opera women. But it
might have no net effect because she's going to hurt herself among
younger women.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Zogby, who is generally Republican-leaning, agrees more
with Sheinkopf, the Democrat. ``It's a wise strategy,'' Zogby said.
``Better she talks about it in August 1999 than in August 2000. Get
it all out of the way, and in such a way that there aren't any more
questions. This is pretty blunt and frank stuff, what she's
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pollster, Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac
College Polling Institute, is less certain of the interview's
consequences. Waving off Mrs. Clinton's psychoanalysis of her
husband as ``yuppie talk,'' Carroll proceeded to ask, ``Is it good
for Hillary, good for Rudy Giuliani? Ehhh. I don't know. I'll tell
you who it's good for _ Tina Brown.''

REFORM PARTY LEADERS SEEK CHANGE IN RULES FOR PICKING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New leaders of the Reform Party say they are considering changes
to their rules in an effort to recruit a presidential candidate who
would appeal to a broader spectrum of voters than the base of
support established by Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   After the election two weeks ago of a party chairman endorsed by
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the party's power base shifted
immediately from Perot's tower in Dallas to St. Paul, where the
governor's political aides are talking to potential candidates and
planning a strategy for mounting a challenge to the two major
parties next year.
</P>
<P>
   One change the Ventura camp is contemplating is to move the
selection of the nominee to the party's national convention next
summer. Current plans call for a primary to be conducted by mail-in
ballot, with the result to be announced at the convention. Any
registered voter would be allowed to participate, and some in the
party fear that could produce an unpredictable and possibly tainted
result.
</P>
<P>
   The mission to retool the party is urgent for Ventura's aides
because they expect him to consider a presidential campaign in
2004, and the Reform Party candidate must attract at least 5
percent of the vote in 2000 to preserve the party's federal
financing and its slot on many ballots. Several political
scientists said the quality of the nominee would determine whether
the party will last, or will follow the shooting-star life cycle of
every other third-party movement in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third parties can survive without winning elections, but they
have to show they have a significant amount of support,'' said
Ronald B. Rapoport, a professor of government at the College of
William and Mary who is writing a book about the Reform Party. He
called the party's survival ``an open question,'' saying, ``They
need a message, and they need a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Perot drew enough votes in 1996 for the party to qualify
for federal financing in the next election, the party's nominee
will have $12.6 million to spend, making it a tempting backup for
one of the major party candidates who washes out. None has
expressed interest so far, however, and many political analysts
said they were skeptical about the party's chances of finding a
large following when voters seem satisfied with the economy and
their government.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura's aides said they became very optimistic about the
Reform Party's future after the election of the new chairman, John
G. Gargan, who had promised he would distance the party from Perot.
Douglas E. Friedline, who was Ventura's campaign manager and now
handles his licensing deals, said the party would begin gathering
petition signatures this fall to be sure it gets on every state's
ballot, so that it will be ready if a popular candidate decides to
run under the Reform banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by the calls I'm getting this week, I can see people are
finally looking at the Reform Party as a viable alternative,'' he
said. ``This was beginning to look like a Gore versus Bush
election, so if we have the right candidate, we could generate
tremendous excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's national convention, held July 23-25 in Dearborn,
Mich., revealed a sharp mismatch in supply and demand for possible
presidential nominees. Delegates tried to whip up draft movements
for big names who have said they have no interest in the party _
Donald J. Trump, Ralph Nader and Gen. Colin Powell. But the
candidates who came courting were unknowns like Jerry G. Beck, 60,
a shaggy-haired manufacturer of electrostatic filters from Windsor,
Mo., who said his qualifications included his status as a
32d-degree Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's strategists hope to open a middle road by grooming a
machine that might appeal to someone like Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who is seeking the Republican nomination and has so far
turned aside Reform Party overtures.
</P>
<P>
   The only seasoned politician who has publicly contemplated
carrying the Reform Party banner next year is Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., the former independent governor of Connecticut. He said the
party remained ``a fuzzy landscape'' for a candidate, but said it
had taken an encouraging first step in electing a new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not,'' Weicker said, ``they're the ballgame as far
as challenging the Republicans and the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman, Gargan, a retired financial consultant known
as Jack, said that in choosing a nominee, the party would look for
a record of pushing issues like an overhaul of the campaign-finance
system. ``We're not going to take retread Democrats and Republicans
who can't hack it with their own party and think we're going to be
an easy mark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The old leaders remain in office until Jan. 1. But as an
indication of how swiftly Ventura has seized his opening, news
media calls for Gargan are now funneled through Ventura's campaign
staff. Gargan wants to hold next year's convention in Minnesota.
Gargan acknowledged the enormous financial and organizational
problems the party faces when he declared at a news conference on
the eve of his election, ``The Reform Party is salvageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political scientists question that. Alan I. Abramowitz, a
specialist in electoral politics at Emory University, said
Ventura's ascension would do nothing to dispel the party's ``flaky
image,'' and pointed out that the country did not currently have
``the conditions to propel a strong third party or independent
candidate, in terms of economic recession or widespread discontent
with the status quo.''

ARSON SUSPECTED IN ABORTION CLINIC FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENLAND, N.H. _ Tucked between the police and fire departments
and a cemetery on a quiet tree-lined street, the Feminist Health
Center here, just 15 miles from the Massachusetts border, had
gained a reputation as a place where teens could seek abortions
without having to tell their parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the clinic's rural calm was broken late Sunday night after a
fire that federal officals said Monday was most likely deliberately
set.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed as arson, the fire at the Feminist Health Center of
Portsmouth would be the eighth such incident at an abortion clinic
this year _ and the first in New England since advocates began
keeping track in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, federal and local law enforcement and fire investigators
determined that an accelerant had been used to start the fire. They
would not say exactly what they found, but noted that the evidence
will be sent to the ATF's Rockville, Md., lab for testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obviously a strong possibility that it was foul
play,'' said Greenland Police Chief Scot Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators examined the damage, clinic's director, Diana
Braun, declared Monday that her non-profit center, which has two
doctors and a staff of about 20, weren't intimidated by the fire.
The clinic was closed Monday, but expected to reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to stop us,'' Braun said. ``My phone has
been ringing since early (Monday) morning with people saying
`Whatever you need, whatever you want, I'll be there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ATF agent David L. Brown said two passers-by spotted the fire at
9:44 p.m. Sunday. The police and fire departments, which share a
building only a few hundred feet from the clinic, were on the scene
within minutes and quickly doused the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently started behind the building under the wooden
handicapped ramp and caused about $12,000 damage, according to an
insurance adjuster. He said the inside of the building was damaged
from smoke and water; outside, the handicapped ramp and wood siding
were charred, and walls and windows were smashed by firefighters
battling the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, near the city of Portsmouth, performs about 800
abortions a year in a converted 150-year-old farmhouse. Under
Massachusetts state law, children under 18 must get to get an
abortion in Massachusetts, but a parent's permission is not
required in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fire was disturbing, it wasn't the worst act of
anti-abortion violence in the region. In December 1994, John Salvi
killed two people and wounded five others in a shooting spree at
two Brookline, Mass. clinics.
</P>
<P>
   If the fire is ruled arson _ as the clinic's executive director
and national experts said they expect _ it will be the eighth such
fire at a U.S. abortion clinic this year, according to the National
Abortion Federation, a Washington organization that tracks
anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, similarly extreme acts of violence _ such as
murders, bombings, and arsons _ have begun to spread across the
country. Still, New England has largely remained untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Feminist Health Center workers nor its neighbors
were shocked by the fire. Each week, protesters picket the
building, and workers recently received threatening mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old clinic, which sees 6,000 patients a year,
relocated from downtown Portsmouth in 1985 when anti-abortion
protestors hindered people from getting to nearby businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic moved to Greenland, but the protestors followed.
Every week as many as 10 people picket in front of the white,
two-story building, Braun and police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same people that have been protesting us week after
week for what seems like forever,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, protesters picketed outside the home of a woman
who works for the clinic. A year earlier, four people were charged
with trespassing and resisting arrest after they posed as patients
and ransacked the building.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the clinic received two pieces of mail that were
turned over to the Greenland Police, Braun said. One item contained
a vaguely threatening message on a coat of arms, and the other
consisted of photocopies of meticulously cut and pasted
anti-abortion literature.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing braced the clinic for possible arson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always somewhere in your subconcience that this could
happen, but there has been nothing to make me believe it really
would happen,'' said Laura Thibault, who works at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Braun said the clinic spends about $35,000 annually on security,
including a metal detector and an off-duty police officer on
detail.
</P>
<P>
   That's a stark contrast to the surrounding town of 3,100, which
has just one fast food restaurant and three gas stations. Several
residents said they sometimes leave their garage doors open and
doors unlocked at night. The police department has only six
full-time officers, including its first detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're coming out here, you have a sense of security,''
Braun said. ``We tell women `Don't look for a big, brick,
professional building.' They like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For most, the clinic has become part of the landscape, said
resident Judy Dunan. ``I don't think anybody really thinks twice
about it being here to be honest,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Even the small town of Greenland, N.H., is not immune
to what's happening everywhere else,'' said Eve Fralick, the
chairman of the board of selectmen.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the region should brace itself for the possible
spread of ``domestic terrorism,'' said Vicki Saporta, the director
of the NAF.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any terrorism, you don't know when they'll strike,
what they'll strike and where they'll strike,'' she said. ``(New
England) should be concerned. (Clinics) should increase their
security precuations.''

TV NOTEBOOK: AD-HEAVY `ALICE' THROUGH NBC'S LOOKING GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Blood feuds, mischief, misdemeanors, mayhem
and other notes of interest from the wonderful world of television,
brought to you in living ink ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Easy question: Why was NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland'' last
February so packed with commercial breaks that it was virtually
unwatchable?
</P>
<P>
   Tough to answer, though, when it was put to NBC West Coast
President Scott Sassa at his network's part of the semiannual TV
press event.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's reply was that the three-hour ``Alice in Wonderland,''
which was nearly one-third commercials and other nonprogram
material, was ``an anomaly'' because ``there was unfortunately an
issue where the show came in short.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that the producer, Robert Halmi Sr., gave NBC a program
print that wasn't long enough, and NBC filled the gap with extra
commercials and promo spots.
</P>
<P>
   But Halmi, on hand later to promote two future NBC miniseries,
insisted that he delivered exactly the show the network ordered, to
the minute.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Sassa. Buttonholed at an NBC party, he said there had
been a mistake when NBC gave Halmi its specifications. NBC
accidentally asked for a program 10 minutes shorter than intended,
and Halmi innocently complied.
</P>
<P>
   So, ``technically we're both right,'' Sassa concluded.
</P>
<P>
   And technically, NBC's big February sweeps entry was marred
because it was interrupted too many times. On that, all sides seem
to agree.
</P>
<P>
   _ What a shame that ``Will &AMP; Grace'' didn't collect a single
Emmy Award nomination. But don't get weepy about the neglected
cast.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Studios, the network production arm that co-produces the
sitcom, threw a luncheon for cast members Eric McCormack, Debra
Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally on Friday at the Parkway
Grill in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for dessert the four were told to go out and buy
themselves new Porsche Boxsters, compliments of NBC and NBC
Studios. That's about $42,000 of thanks and Emmy consolation
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So McCormack, Messing and Hayes were in fine spirits at the
press party that night. They were planning on a Porsche shopping
excursion the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Your Porscheless reporter at work: McCormack, silver with
automatic transmission; Hayes, gray with automatic transmission;
Messing, black with automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Mullally might have jumped the gun. She wasn't at the party.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give a Hero of the Proletariat button to PBS President Ervin
Duggan, who noted, strangely, that PBS types don't get new cars and
other luxurious perks.
</P>
<P>
   And he wouldn't even have known about NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace''
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan arrived ready to lament PBS' latest imbroglio, the
asinine decision by as many as 60 PBS stations to exchange their
donor lists with political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan has had his problems with the press _ reference ``Tales
of the City'' _ but this might have been his finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``no station should do anything that could call
into question its independence and impartiality.'' Yes, he said,
the scandal should and already has resulted in self-examination and
self-reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Duggan argued convincingly that the list-sharing mistakes
were about fund-raising, not politics. Also, that Republican as
well as Democratic organizations swapped lists with PBS stations.
And that the practice had no connection to PBS programming.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duggan, of course, who was hauled before the House
telecommunications subcommittee last month so that the Republican
majority members could make sport of him.
</P>
<P>
   But the blame rightfully lies with the dozens of offending
stations, which operate independently. Hereabouts, the blame falls
ultimately on KQED President Mary Bitterman.

DROUGHT WARNING ISSUED FOR NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ After one of the hottest, driest Julys on
record, Gov. Christie Whitman issued a drought warning Monday and
appealed to all state residents to use water more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said reservoirs, groundwater tables and stream flows
have fallen below normal across New Jersey, and she appealed to all
residents to cut back on watering lawns and gardens, to fix leaky
faucets and pipes, and to use dishwashers and washing machines only
when full. She also asked them not to wash cars at home, or spray
sidewalks or driveways with hoses or ``top off'' backyard swimming
pools. The measures are considered voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we do all we can now to conserve water,
so we can postpone or possibly avoid the need to impose
restrictions on water use,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   She last ordered such a ban on outdoor water use in September
1995, after the 13 reservoirs that serve about 2.3 million
residents in seven counties in northeastern New Jersey fell to
about 59 percent of their storage capacity of 76 billion gallons.
That emergency lasted until November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the reservoirs, which supply Newark, Jersey City,
Paterson and scores of smaller cities and suburban towns, continued
their monthlong decline, dropping to 71.3 percent of capacity, down
from 87.7 percent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 reservoirs, the four owned by United Water Resources,
an investor-owned company based in Harrington Park, N.J., have
suffered the most. They serve about 750,000 people in Bergen and
Hudson Counties, and traditionally have been the most vulnerable to
slack rainfall. Monday, the four reservoirs slipped to 59.8 percent
of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve their remaining water, the Bergen County
executive, William P. Schuber, is expected on Tuesday to impose
mandatory limits on outdoor use of water throughout United Water's
service area in eastern Bergen County. The controls are expected to
include limiting the watering of lawns to two three-hour windows _
between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 9 p.m._ every other day.

   New York City's three major reservoirs in the southwestern
Catskills _ the Pepacton, the Neversink and the Cannonsville _ were
72.1 percent full Monday and still about 49 billion gallons above
the drought-warning stage, according to the Delaware River Basin
Commission, a four-state agency that regulates the reservoirs.
Christopher Roberts, a commission spokesman, said that at the
current level of use and rainfall, the three would probably reach
the level for a warning in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Although storage in New Jersey's 13 reservoirs is a major
variable to the state's declaring drought warnings and emergencies,
water-supply officials in the Department of Environmental
Protection are concerned with levels in streams and aquifers this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic wells have started drying up at homes in the higher
elevations of Sussex and Passaic Counties. In addition, stream
flows have fallen well below normal throughout the state, from the
Ramapo River in Mahwah near the New York border to the Great Egg
Harbor River near Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 towns across the state have already imposed
restrictions on outdoor water use. In some, water tables are
declining; in others, heavy demands have threatened to exceed the
annual amount of water the state allows towns to take from its
wells.
</P>
<P>
   Crops have also suffered, particularly corn, soybeans and
alfalfa, according to the State Agriculture Department. On Tuesday,
Whitman and the state's Agriculture Secretary, Arthur R. Brown Jr.,
plan to tour a corn farm in Branchburg, in Somerset, as a prelude
to seeking federal disaster assistance for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable situation that's unfolding,'' said David
Robinson, the state's climatologist at Rutgers University. ``You
have to look very long and hard to find a July like we just went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said July's average temperature of 77.6 degrees in New
Jersey was the third highest for the month since 1895. The record
is 79 degrees, set in 1955, he said. July 1949 was the second
hottest, at 77.8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This July was also the second driest July since 1895, Robinson
said. Rainfall at 20 monitoring stations averaged 1.3 inches of
rain, 3.1 inches below normal. The driest July occurred in 1955,
with 1.14 inches.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed both the heat and skimpy rain to a high-pressure
system stalled over the Atlantic Ocean since Memorial Day. He said
the system is parked farther northwest than the traditional summer
high-pressure systems that stay near Bermuda. Clockwise winds from
traditional ``Bermuda highs'' bring moist, southwesterly winds to
New Jersey, he said. Winds from this summer's system are sweeping
ocean moisture into the South and Middle West. When the winds turn
toward the East, they have little moisture left to produce rain in
the Middle Atlantic states and the New York metropolitan region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air's just too dry for much rain,'' Robinson said.
``There's not enough humidity in it. Every chance we've had for a
shower, it's been miss after miss after miss.''

 &HT;    Round 1 of Hawks' trade done
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They made a commitment to run more and in order to do
that they had to become deeper and more athletic, Hawks general
manager Pete Babcock said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Painful as it was, Steve Smith had to go and that's why he was
packaged with Ed Gray and shipped to Portland for Isaiah Rider and
Jim Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Babcock conceded that the Hawks are not finished.
Over the next few days, perhaps the next few weeks, the club will
try to anchor its front line. Either Rider or Jackson will be the
bait if Atlanta can work a sign-and-trade deal for Lorenzen Wright,
a Clippers free agent center-forward who refuses to stay in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with agents for both players (Arn Tellem for Rider,
Mark Termini for Jackson) and they expressed concerns because their
clients had been traded some and wanted assurances,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said he acquired both guards to keep them, but warned
the agents that the right deal could pry any player away from his
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically about Rider, Babcock said he could be dealt
``but I don't expect that to happen.'' He said that with six
guards, the Hawks have one more than they can keep and are
exploring trades. ``We have one or two guards we could put into a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Wright, he said, ``He's only one of the guys we're
interested in.'' A pessimist about such things, Babcock said,
``It's 50-50 something will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no attempt from either Babcock or Hawks president Stan
Kasten to portray Rider as anyone other than an extremely talented
player who has had numerous run-ins with the law as well as team
rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rider's record of marijuana offenses is well-documented, but
Kasten pointed out that ``we've traded two players this summer who
also has a problem with marijuana.'' That was in reference to point
guard Mookie Blaylock who was stopped by Canadian customs who found
several ounces of marijuana in his possession three years ago and
to Gray, who was stopped last winter and charged with possession,
among misdemeanor offenses on a traffic stop in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has adopted rules prohibiting marijuana use. Kasten said
the rules would go into effect in training camp. ``Right now, we
don't know what the specifics are.''
</P>
<P>
   When the press conference concluded Babcock returned to his
office to await calls from both Rider and Jackson. He said he had
not spoken with either player. Rider was known to be in Los
Angeles. He went there to play in Magic Johnson's annual all-star
game Sunday night. In keeping with his image, he did not show up at
the Forum for the game and did not leave an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said it was painful to part with Smith, who on and off
the court embodies the kind of person he prefers to have on the
Hawks roster. However, he said he owed the fans a championship and
feels an obligation to put together the best team possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fans want you to win,'' he said. ``What they remember is
if you won and so that's what we have to try and do. Our mission
statement is to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he saw a clear delineation between levels of
unacceptable conduct. That, he said, is why he could trade for
Rider while he would not have Latrell Sprewell, who attacked P.J.
Carlesimo during a practice 18 months ago in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the gamble with Rider, an 18 ppg. career scorer,
Babcock pointed out that the 6-5 guard is on the final year of his
contract at $5.4 million. Jackson has two years remaining on the
contract he signed last winter for the middle class exception of
$1.75. He makes almost $2 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks still want to re-sign free agents Chris Crawford, a
small forward, and Grant Long, a power forward, in addition to
pursuing an additional inside player. If Long is re-signed and the
Wright deal is made, the future of rookie center-forward Cal
Bowdler is uncertain. The Hawks cannot keep five power players
unless they are content to play with two small forwards and five
guards.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Blazers officials were ebullient over the
acquisition of Smith, team president Bob Whitsitt describing him as
a team player ``who does not need individual accomplishments.''

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday
banned most uses of a pesticide applied widely for years on fruits
and vegetables and tightened restrictions on another, in the first
regulations intended specifically to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the pesticide methyl parathion may not be
used on a wide variety of crops from apples to turnips, even though
its use has already been heavily regulated for years and as a
result farmers have been the only effective users.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 4.2 million pounds methyl parathion was applied over
4.9 million acres, but 75 percent of the pounds and acreage
produced cotton, corn and wheat, which are not affected by Monday's
ban. No figures were available on use of the second chemical. But
the chemicals are widely used on such a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables that it is very difficult for consumers to know if they
are present in commercially grown food.
</P>
<P>
   While the limits go into effect next year, as a practical
matter, officials said, farmers would not use any more of the
chemical this season, because the time for using them is past. But
they have available a variety of new, less hazardous chemicals or
they can use natural predators, including bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two pesticides banned Monday are organophosphates, used to
kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses, but they have the same
effect on humans. Some organophosphates were used as nerve agents
during World War II, and some were brought into agricultural use as
a replacement for DDT, which was banned in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals have been shown to cause illness in agricultural
workers and, on the basis of animal tests, are presumed to hurt
children.
</P>
<P>
   Children may be more vulnerable because they eat proportionately
more fruits and vegetables than adults, and because their bodies
and nervous systems are still developing, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But data on children is incomplete, and Congress unanimously
passed a law in 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act, telling the
EPA to compensate by applying a margin of safety 10 times larger
than the limits it previously set on cumulative exposure to traces
of the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Organophosphates have been restricted for years and most have
names unfamiliar to consumers. However, some exterminators have
used methyl parathion indoors, where there is no sunlight to break
it down, causing major environmental problems. Such use killed two
children in Tunica, Miss., in 1984 and made two in Pascagoula,
Miss., severely ill in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The major manufacturers of methyl parathion are Cheminova, Inc.,
of Wayne, N.J., which markets its version as Novafos-M; and Elph
Atochem North America, Inc., of Philadelphia, which sells the
chemical under the name Penncap-M.
</P>
<P>
   The other chemical, azinphos methyl, was banned for use on sugar
cane, where it had been used against the sugar cane borer, and on
cotton east of the Mississippi River. It is produced by Bayer
Corp., of Kansas City, and Makhteshim-Agan, an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
   Organophosphates are the most commonly used pesticides, partly
because they kill a large variety of pests. Officials at the EPA
and the Agriculture Department said Monday, though, that foods
meeting the current standard are still safe, foods meeting the new
standards would be safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For children and adults alike, the benefits of a diet that
includes fruits and vegetables far outweigh the risks of
pesticides,'' said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner. ``When a
family gathers around the kitchen table, they should know that the
food is as safe as it can be for every family member, from the
youngest to the oldest,''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, the agency faced a deadline of Tuesday to
finish its evaluations of the first third of hundreds of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists were skeptical about the safety of food
now in markets, and some said that some children had indeed fallen
ill to food produced with the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going out of the way to saying, `eat this stuff,' even
though they're banning it next year,'' said Kenneth A. Cook,
president of the Environmental Working Group, a research and
advocacy organization based here. The reason, said Cook, is,
``because they're in a political bind,'' and should have come out
with the announcement months ago, before the chemicals were applied
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline C. Hamilton, an attorney at the Natural Resources
Defense Fund, said, ``We know that there are kids who've been made
sick by organophosphates.'' But under the Food Quality Protection
Act, she said, the burden of proof was with the manufacturers to
show that the chemicals were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to point to the bodies lying on the ground with
their tongues hanging out,'' she said. ``There is significant
evidence that much lower levels of these chemicals, at critical
levels of development, can cause lifelong deficits, potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   All four manufacturers agreed to the new limits, according to
the EPA. The agency could have enforced the rules without their
consent, but it would have taken about two years, said Ms. Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said that they were not sure that all the new
limits made much difference. For azinphos methyl, the EPA lowered
the ``tolerance,'' or maximum allowable concentration, to 1.5 parts
per million from 2.0 parts now, and 1 part per million next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said his group had reviewed 3,200 apple samples taken
by the Agriculture Department between 1992 and 1996, and found only
two over 1.5 parts per million, and 1,966 samples taken by the Food
and Drug Administration from 1992 to 1998, and found only three
over 1 part per million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like reducing the speed limit from 200 miles per hour to
150,'' he said. ``There's not much impact on safety, and not much
impact on the speeders.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay J. Vroom, president of the American Crop Protection
Association, the trade group for the pesticide manufacturers and
distributors, said that the EPA had failed to go through all the
procedural steps it had promised to, including another round of
seeking comment from affected parties. He said the manufacturers
had agreed to the new restrictions ``in part because they knew
there was the threat of a food scare,'' and that their agreement
could not really be called voluntary.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Northwest Horticultural Affairs Council, which represents
orchard owners, Hugh W. Ewart, a vice president, said that the two
chemicals were used to control codling moths in apples, but that
substitute control methods were available, including using
pheromones, which disrupt the sense of smell that the moths need to
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the EPA's actions Monday, he said, ``We survived the
first round.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only the first round; it is part of a process that is
supposed to cover nearly 10,000 uses of organophosphates and other
chemicals. The EPA said Monday that it had completed re-evaluation
of more than 3,200 of those uses, and tightened more than half of
them. Restrictions include how many pounds can be applied to
specific crops per acre, and how long before harvest such
applications must end.
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of consumer advocates and environmental groups
said that many of those uses were irrelevant, authorizing
application of chemicals that are no longer manufactured, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the re-assessed tolerances are for obsolete or minimal
uses with no impact on food safety,'' said Edward Groth, director
of technical policy and public service at Consumers Union, the
publisher of Consumers Reports magazine. ``The EPA has failed to do
its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner, however, promised Monday that her agency would be
finished with the most worrisome chemicals by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these are 1950s-era chemicals,'' said Ms. Browner.
``We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that alternative methods of pest control were available
and that farmers could continue ``to produce the variety of food
and the bountiful harvests we have come to expect from American
agriculture.''

TV NOTEBOOK: AD-HEAVY `ALICE' THROUGH NBC'S LOOKING GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Blood feuds, mischief, misdemeanors, mayhem
and other notes of interest from the wonderful world of television,
brought to you in living ink ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Easy question: Why was NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland'' last
February so packed with commercial breaks that it was virtually
unwatchable?
</P>
<P>
   Tough to answer, though, when it was put to NBC West Coast
President Scott Sassa at his network's part of the semiannual TV
press event.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's reply was that the three-hour ``Alice in Wonderland,''
which was nearly one-third commercials and other nonprogram
material, was ``an anomaly'' because ``there was unfortunately an
issue where the show came in short.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that the producer, Robert Halmi Sr., gave NBC a program
print that wasn't long enough, and NBC filled the gap with extra
commercials and promo spots.
</P>
<P>
   But Halmi, on hand later to promote two future NBC miniseries,
insisted that he delivered exactly the show the network ordered, to
the minute.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Sassa. Buttonholed at an NBC party, he said there had
been a mistake when NBC gave Halmi its specifications. NBC
accidentally asked for a program 10 minutes shorter than intended,
and Halmi innocently complied.
</P>
<P>
   So, ``technically we're both right,'' Sassa concluded.
</P>
<P>
   And technically, NBC's big February sweeps entry was marred
because it was interrupted too many times. On that, all sides seem
to agree.
</P>
<P>
   _ What a shame that ``Will &AMP; Grace'' didn't collect a single
Emmy Award nomination. But don't get weepy about the neglected
cast.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Studios, the network production arm that co-produces the
sitcom, threw a luncheon for cast members Eric McCormack, Debra
Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally on Friday at the Parkway
Grill in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for dessert the four were told to go out and buy
themselves new Porsche Boxsters, compliments of NBC and NBC
Studios. That's about $42,000 of thanks and Emmy consolation
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So McCormack, Messing and Hayes were in fine spirits at the
press party that night. They were planning on a Porsche shopping
excursion the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Your Porscheless reporter at work: McCormack, silver with
automatic transmission; Hayes, gray with automatic transmission;
Messing, black with automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Mullally might have jumped the gun. She wasn't at the party.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give a Hero of the Proletariat button to PBS President Ervin
Duggan, who noted, strangely, that PBS types don't get new cars and
other luxurious perks.
</P>
<P>
   And he wouldn't even have known about NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace''
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan arrived ready to lament PBS' latest imbroglio, the
asinine decision by as many as 60 PBS stations to exchange their
donor lists with political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan has had his problems with the press _ reference ``Tales
of the City'' _ but this might have been his finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``no station should do anything that could call
into question its independence and impartiality.'' Yes, he said,
the scandal should and already has resulted in self-examination and
self-reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Duggan argued convincingly that the list-sharing mistakes
were about fund-raising, not politics. Also, that Republican as
well as Democratic organizations swapped lists with PBS stations.
And that the practice had no connection to PBS programming.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duggan, of course, who was hauled before the House
telecommunications subcommittee last month so that the Republican
majority members could make sport of him.
</P>
<P>
   But the blame rightfully lies with the dozens of offending
stations, which operate independently. Hereabouts, the blame falls
ultimately on KQED President Mary Bitterman.

MARKET PLACE: MONSANTO AND MERCK PUSHING NEW ARTHRITIS DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with
patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from Merck and
Monsanto have also been vying to get their attention to promote new
arthritis drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis
tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug. The
company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors
this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   But Merck is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of
months on the market. And it will soon begin a big advertising push
to compete with Monsanto's.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on
the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin. Can celebrity
endorsers be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty riding on this battle. Analysts expect the
market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from $7.2 billion
worldwide this year to $13 billion by 2005. And for their own
reasons, Merck and Monsanto want not just a success but a
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap is beginning to get interesting. Even though Celebrex,
which is being co-marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, controls the
market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in May.
Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as
replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like
ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   In the week ended June 11, Vioxx had 7 percent of the Cox-2
market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry
consultant IMS Health. But by July 23, Vioxx accounted for 22
percent of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex,''
said Jack Lamberton, a managing director at HSBC Securities. ``But
this market is large enough for both drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are unusually large. In an industry where earnings
tend to rise 15 percent or more a quarter, Monsanto and Merck need
a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After its proposed merger with American Home Products fell apart
last year, Monsanto announced a $625 million reorganization. Even
though drug makers are generally suffering and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's drug index is down 14.7 percent this year, Monsanto has done
worse. Its stock has slid 17.1 percent this year, to close Monday
at $39.375, up 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock
is down only 8.6 percent this year _ but analysts say the company
can ill afford a marketing disaster. Several of Merck's drugs will
lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the
company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives
become available.
</P>
<P>
   And Merck is no longer Wall Street's darling. During the last 12
months, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have climbed 18.6 percent.
Meanwhile, Merck's shares have gained 10.7 percent. They closed
Monday at $67.375, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis
drugs. After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up
their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about $2.3
billion a year sometime around 2004, up from a peak estimate of
$1.5 billion just months earlier. Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are
expected to be about $3 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness
of the brand,'' said Wendy Dixon, a Merck vice president. ``With a
condition that involves pain, people talk to each other. A lot of
the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla.,
suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief
three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor changed several of my medications,'' Reese said.
``But I have realized a marked improvement. My right hand is almost
normal, when it was about 60 percent functional before.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers
to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest
share of a new market seldom relinquishes it. Celebrex, whose sales
began in January, had the most successful debut by a drug ever in
the United States, eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, and Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's drug for reducing
cholesterol, according to IMS Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx,'' said Joseph
Papa, president of U.S. operations for Searle, a division of
Monsanto. ``We're outperforming them on every measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block. Known for
its Marine-like marketing efficiency, Merck began shipping Vioxx to
pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the
Food and Drug Administration. Merck has also distributed the most
free samples in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they
may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other
arthritis remedies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Vioxx and Celebrex are safer on the gastrointestinal tract,''
said Dr. Steven Abramson, the chairman of Rheumatology at the
Hospital of Joint Diseases and the chairman of the FDA Advisory
Committee that reviewed both drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In comparisons between Vioxx and Celebrex, Merck would like to
focus on the two drugs' labels. Vioxx has an indication for
treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck drug is also single-dose. Celebrex can be administered
in a single or double dose.
</P>
<P>
   Merck executives contend that Vioxx's single dose gives it an
advantage over Celebrex since patients usually want to take as few
pills as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has countered that Celebrex gives patients more
options. ``About 90 percent of the people who use Celebrex for
osteoarthritis take the 200-milligram pill once a day,'' Papa said.
``If someone wants the flexibility, they can take the 100-milligram
pill twice a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with doctors and consumers, health-maintenance
organizations may hold part of the key to the drugs' acceptance.
Several HMOs have restricted the use of one or both of the drugs.
Kaiser Permanente, which has 8.6 million members nationwide, has
limited the use of the drugs to people who are at high risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dr. David Campen, who chairs Kaiser's drug formulary
committee, notes that the plan will cover any drug a doctor
prescribes, he does not believe the plan should cover Vioxx and
Celebrex. Campen has recently sent out questionnaires to some 50
doctors, and expects to render a decision in September.
</P>
<P>
   The pills' prices might play a role. Vioxx is priced comparably
with Celebrex, which has an average wholesale price of $2.42 for
its once-a-day pill. But when patients use Celebrex twice a day,
the cost swells to $2.86. Both drugs cost considerably more than
traditional generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which run
about $1.70 for a daily dose.

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tiger Management LLC, the largest investor in US
Airways, may seek to have the airline sold after recent earnings
stumbles and a stock price slide.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is the nation's sixth-largest and one of the biggest
holdings of the $13 billion Tiger, a New York based hedge fund
controlled by Julian H. Robertson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of US Airways rose 8 percent in heavy trading Monday
after Tiger, which owns 22.4 percent of the airline, disclosed in a
securities filing that it was exploring ways to bolster the
company's lagging stock price that could include a merger, sale or
recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger said in the filing that the current stock price, which hit
a 52-week low on Friday, ``does not properly reflect the intrinsic
value of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund began amassing its stake in 1996 and quickly
quadrupled its money on its early purchases. But in the last year,
the airline's shares have dropped by almost half. Tiger's stake is
now worth $635.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund said it expected to continue to hold discussions
with US Airways management on ways to lift the stock and would not
try to put new members on the company's board. It added that it
supported the management team led by Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's disclosure is ``in no way a repudiation of management,''
a spokesman for the fund said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger supports Steve Wolf and still has great faith in
management,'' he continued. ``What has obviously not been to our
liking is the price of the stock, which in Tiger's view is greatly
undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing, the Tiger spokesman said, would enable the hedge
fund to more easily discuss specific options with US Airways
executives. He added that he could not comment beyond the filing on
what those options may be.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for US Airways declined to comment on the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The news lifted the airline's shares $2.875, to $38.50. It also
helped shares of other airlines. The AMR Corp., the parent of
American Airlines, rose $1.1875, to $66.0625; Delta Air Lines rose
$1.1875, to $60.8125, and the UAL Corp., which owns United
Airlines, rose 43.75 cents, to $63.875.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts still praise Wolf, the airline's credibility with
Wall Street has suffered lately. The stock has declined about 25
percent since June 8, when US Airways said that second-quarter
earnings would fall well below analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the airline reported second-quarter profit from
operations of $1.83 a share, down from $1.95 in the comparable
quarter of 1998. Analysts attributed the decline to increased
competition and rapid expansion of the airline's low-cost Metrojet
service.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, estimates for full-year earnings per
share have dropped by more than $1, to $4.45, according to IBES
International, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing earnings came, coincidentally, just as the
proposed global alliance between American Airlines and British
Airways fell apart. And Julius Maldutis, an analyst at CIBC
Oppenheimer, said Tiger was trying to convince US Airways to form a
closer alliance, or other sort of combination, with American.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines already allow passengers to transfer
frequent-flyer miles earned on one airline to the other, and they
have other cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is ``cajoling US Airways into entering into a much
broader, expanded operating relationship with American Airlines,''
Maldutis said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger declined to comment on a closer alliance with American.
American Airlines said it was not in the cards, as any greater
combination would likely raise antitrust and labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those relationships are not unheard of, but they're not easy
to reach agreement on, either,'' said Timothy J. Doke, a spokesman
for American.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's move comes as the giant fund has continued to struggle,
even as the value style of stock picking that it favors brought big
gains. For the first six months of the year, Tiger was down about 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While many stocks it holds have done well recently, some big
holdings besides US Airways have faltered. Tricon Global
Restaurants, its third-largest equity holding as of March 31, has
fallen 41.6 percent since then, while another holding, Waste
Management, has slid 42.7 percent.

   NEW YORK _ Faced with what she claims is sexual discrimination
because she was denied a promotion to managing director, Allison
Schieffelin took her case against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She chose to stay with the
firm as a senior saleswoman as a way of ``trying to reform the
institution,'' her lawyer told a reporter last week.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ms. Schieffelin so unusual is not her belief that
Wall Street is a hard place for women to succeed. Whatever the
merits of her individual case, debate about discrimination at
various firms focuses on degree, not whether it exists. But what is
extremely rare is Ms. Schieffelin's decision to stay and fight when
most women who think they are encountering the glass ceiling simply
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a practical point of view, when I began litigation with
the firm, I was more or less perceived as a pariah in the
industry,'' said Ann Hopkins, whose sex-discrimination case against
Price Waterhouse, one of the major accounting firms, was ultimately
heard by the Supreme Court in 1989. Criticized for being ``macho''
and in need of ``a course at charm school,'' Ms. Hopkins prevailed
in her quest to become partner, the equivalent of managing director
at a Wall Street firm. She rejoined Price Waterhouse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Most women would rather go quietly. Catalyst, a nonprofit group
in New York that studies women in the workplace, has conducted more
than 500 exit interviews with women managers who left companies and
firms in the 1990s. While the vast majority of the women claimed
that they were leaving to spend more time with their families, only
15 percent were still at home six months after they left.
</P>
<P>
   So why did they leave? Nearly three quarters of the women told
Catalyst that they were greatly influenced by their belief that
there was a lack of opportunity for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are slowly recognizing the problem. Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, for example, created a committee of senior partners in 1992
to figure out why so many women were leaving. After interviewing
women who had quit and those who still worked there, the firm's
partners discovered that many women believed that Deloitte was not
flexible enough for them to successfully balance work with the rest
of their lives, and that they were concerned about their chances to
move up. Having made a push to address these issues, by offering
flexible schedules and trying to be more inclusive, Deloitte has
closed the turnover gap between men and women. The percentage of
women who leave each year has dropped from 29 percent in 1991 to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war for talent is not a myth,'' said Sheila Wellington,
the president of Catalyst. ``There is a great deal of concern for
retention.''
</P>
<P>
   But many women hesitate to speak up because they are not sure
that they are being discriminated against. Promotions, especially
at the top firms, are not guaranteed, after all, and some figure
that the powers that be passed them over because they did not
recognize their brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   One female investment professional, who spoke only on the
condition that she not be identified, said that she believed she
was denied a promotion in part because she was a woman but decided
not to bother wasting time trying to figure it out. Instead, she
simply joined another firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend 10 or 15 years hitting the glass ceiling?'' agreed
Janet Tiebout Hanson, who spent 14 years at Goldman Sachs before
founding her own investment firm, Milestone Capital Management.
``Why not go directly to Go and collect $200?''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Hanson's case, she said she believes that the decision to
take three years off for her children derailed her career. ``You
can't leave and have children and come back,'' she said. When she
returned to the firm in 1991, technology had transformed her
business, leaving her too far behind to catch up. She quit to start
Milestone, an institutional money-management firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Few women would ever want to bring a lawsuit, even if they
believed that they had the grounds. Others question whether
progress is best made by bringing a lawsuit. They say that
litigation makes life even more difficult for women by making the
workplace even less friendly. ``It was hard enough to be part of
the inner sanctum,'' Ms. Hanson said. ``I think it is going to be
much, much harder'' if women turn increasingly to the courts for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But what motivates someone to bring a lawsuit is not always
easily explained. Ms. Hopkins, for one, is quick to admit that she
was not acting ``rationally and analytically'' when she waged her
long battle against Price Waterhouse. In the preface to her book,
``So Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way,'' published in 1996 by
the University of Massachusetts Press, she describes herself as
being characterized as ``victim, villain, heroine, pioneer,
zealot'' and says that she is ``none of these.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a value-driven person,'' she said, describing a value
system that places a priority on bringing about change, when
needed. While returning to the firm was not easy, she said that she
was not without allies. ``The people who didn't like me still
didn't like me,'' she said. ``The people who liked me still liked
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins describes herself as ``very comfortable'' in her
current environment. In the Arlington, Va., office where she works
as a consultant, she said that there are enough senior women to
make her environment a good one in which to work. And people have
come to expect her to lobby on behalf of those who may be
underrepresented. ``I'm a pro-active outspoken advocate'' for the
minority, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also counsels patience for anyone trying to seek change. In
1983, the number of women who were partners in the United States at
Price Waterhouse was about 1 percent, she said. When she came back
to the firm, it was about 5 percent. Today, about 10 percent of the
partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the successor firm, are women.
Maybe in another 15 years, she said, there will be enough women to
make the issue of gender moot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins said that it never occurred to her to give up on
Price Waterhouse and move on to something else. The moment the
courts cleared the way for her to return to the job she loved, she
turned in her notice at the World Bank. And has the firm changed
for the better? One can't help but note that Ms. Hopkins' daughter,
Tela, joined PricewaterhouseCoopers last September after graduating
from college. ``I think it's a good profession,'' is all her mom
would say.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday
banned most uses of a pesticide applied widely for years on fruits
and vegetables and tightened restrictions on another, in the first
regulations intended specifically to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the pesticide methyl parathion may not be
used on a wide variety of crops from apples to turnips. The
pesticide, mainly used by farmers, has already been heavily
regulated for years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 4.2 million pounds of methyl parathion was applied
over 4.9 million acres, but 75 percent of the pounds and acreage
produced cotton, corn and wheat, which are not affected by Monday's
ban. No figures were available on use of the second chemical. But
the chemicals are widely used on such a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables that it is very difficult for consumers to know if they
are present in commercially grown food.
</P>
<P>
   While the limits go into effect next year, as a practical
matter, officials said, farmers would not use any more of the
chemical this season, because the time for using them is past. But
they have available a variety of new, less hazardous chemicals or
they can use natural predators, including bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two pesticides banned Monday are organophosphates, used to
kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses; they have the same
effect on humans. Some organophosphates were used as nerve agents
during World War II, and some were brought into agricultural use as
a replacement for DDT, which was banned in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals have been shown to cause illness in agricultural
workers and, on the basis of animal tests, are presumed to hurt
children.
</P>
<P>
   Children may be more vulnerable because they eat proportionately
more fruits and vegetables than adults, and because their bodies
and nervous systems are still developing, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But data on children is incomplete, and Congress unanimously
passed a law in 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act, telling the
EPA to compensate by applying a margin of safety 10 times larger
than the limits it previously set on cumulative exposure to traces
of the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Organophosphates have been restricted for years and most have
names unfamiliar to consumers. However, some exterminators have
used methyl parathion indoors, where there is no sunlight to break
it down, causing major environmental problems. Such use killed two
children in Tunica, Miss., in 1984 and made two in Pascagoula,
Miss., severely ill in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The major manufacturers of methyl parathion are Cheminova, Inc.,
of Wayne, N.J., which markets its version as Novafos-M; and Elph
Atochem North America, Inc., of Philadelphia, which sells the
chemical under the name Penncap-M.
</P>
<P>
   The other chemical, azinphos methyl, was banned for use on sugar
cane, where it had been used against the sugar cane borer, and on
cotton east of the Mississippi River. It is produced by Bayer
Corp., of Kansas City, and Makhteshim-Agan, an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
   Organophosphates are the most commonly used pesticides, partly
because they kill a large variety of pests. Officials at the EPA
and the Agriculture Department said Monday, though, that foods
meeting the current standard are still safe, foods meeting the new
standards would be safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For children and adults alike, the benefits of a diet that
includes fruits and vegetables far outweigh the risks of
pesticides,'' said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner. ``When a
family gathers around the kitchen table, they should know that the
food is as safe as it can be for every family member, from the
youngest to the oldest,''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, the agency faced a deadline of Tuesday to
finish its evaluations of the first third of hundreds of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists were skeptical about the safety of food
now in markets, and some said that some children had indeed fallen
ill to food produced with the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going out of the way to saying, `eat this stuff,' even
though they're banning it next year,'' said Kenneth A. Cook,
president of the Environmental Working Group, a research and
advocacy organization based here. The reason, said Cook, is,
``because they're in a political bind,'' and should have come out
with the announcement months ago, before the chemicals were applied
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline C. Hamilton, an attorney at the Natural Resources
Defense Fund, said, ``We know that there are kids who've been made
sick by organophosphates.'' But under the Food Quality Protection
Act, she said, the burden of proof was with the manufacturers to
show that the chemicals were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to point to the bodies lying on the ground with
their tongues hanging out,'' she said. ``There is significant
evidence that much lower levels of these chemicals, at critical
levels of development, can cause lifelong deficits, potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups, including the Natural Resources
Defense Fund, said they were going to file a lawsuit against the
agency on Tuesday because they think it has failed to meet the
law's requirement.
</P>
<P>
   All four manufacturers agreed to the new limits, according to
the EPA. The agency could have enforced the rules without their
consent, but it would have taken about two years, said Ms. Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said that they were not sure that all the new
limits made much difference. For azinphos methyl, the EPA lowered
the ``tolerance,'' or maximum allowable concentration, to 1.5 parts
per million from 2.0 parts now, and 1 part per million next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said his group had reviewed 3,200 apple samples taken
by the Agriculture Department between 1992 and 1996, and found only
two over 1.5 parts per million, and 1,966 samples taken by the Food
and Drug Administration from 1992 to 1998, and found only three
over 1 part per million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like reducing the speed limit from 200 miles per hour to
150,'' he said. ``There's not much impact on safety, and not much
impact on the speeders.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay J. Vroom, president of the American Crop Protection
Association, the trade group for the pesticide manufacturers and
distributors, said that the EPA had failed to go through all the
procedural steps it had promised to, including another round of
seeking comment from affected parties. He said the manufacturers
had agreed to the new restrictions ``in part because they knew
there was the threat of a food scare,'' and that their agreement
could not really be called voluntary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Northwest Horticultural Affairs Council, which represents
orchard owners, Hugh W. Ewart, a vice president, said that the two
chemicals were used to control codling moths in apples, but that
substitute control methods were available, including using
pheromones, which disrupt the sense of smell that the moths need to
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the EPA's actions Monday, he said, ``We survived the
first round.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only the first round; it is part of a process that is
supposed to cover nearly 10,000 uses of organophosphates and other
chemicals. The EPA said Monday that it had completed re-evaluation
of more than 3,200 of those uses, and tightened more than half of
them. Restrictions include how many pounds can be applied to
specific crops per acre, and how long before harvest such
applications must end.
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of consumer advocates and environmental groups
said that many of those uses were irrelevant, authorizing
application of chemicals that are no longer manufactured, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the re-assessed tolerances are for obsolete or minimal
uses with no impact on food safety,'' said Edward Groth, director
of technical policy and public service at Consumers Union, the
publisher of Consumers Reports magazine. ``The EPA has failed to do
its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner, however, promised Monday that her agency would be
finished with the most worrisome chemicals by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these are 1950s-era chemicals,'' said Ms. Browner.
``We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that alternative methods of pest control were available
and that farmers could continue ``to produce the variety of food
and the bountiful harvests we have come to expect from American
agriculture.''

 MONEYBAG/BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS  How to Avoid Capital Gains on
Residences 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My wife and I purchased and moved into a newer, more expensive
home this year, but we kept our previous home for rental. We now
are having second thoughts about being landlords. Is it too late to
sell the old house and take advantage of the new exclusion from
capital-gains taxes on sales of personal residences? I think we
should be entitled to do this because it was our one and only
residence for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Nope. You're too late, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman
Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you make a conversion to an income property or investment
property,'' he says, ``the only way you can convert the house back
to a primary residence for tax purposes would be to move back in
and re-establish it as your home.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to decide for yourself whether that is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   If you do it and keep the house as your primary residence for at
least one year and then sell it, you probably can use the
capital-gains exclusion, Weller says. The one-year guideline is not
part of the tax law, he adds, but it probably will forestall any
challenge by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The situation would have been different if you had tried to sell
your old home before converting it to a rental property and had
failed to find any buyers. That's not very likely in today's torrid
Bay Area housing market, but if it had happened, you temporarily
could have rented it out while occupying your new home. If you
found a buyer later, you would have been entitled to the
capital-gains exclusion applying to sales of primary residences.
The amount is up to $250,000 for single individuals and $500,000
for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Weller notes that ``temporarily'' is not defined by the tax law,
but the IRS and the courts have gone along with an unofficial
definition of less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Stocks in an IRA
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any tax penalty if I buy and sell stocks on a
short-term basis _ holding them for less than a year _ in my
Individual Retirement Account? I have an IRA with an online broker
and have speculated with Internet stocks, moving in and out of the
market many times.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There is no tax penalty because earnings from a traditional IRA
are taxed at ordinary income-tax rates rather than at the less
stringent capital-gains rates. I'm assuming that you have a
traditional IRA because taxes aren't an issue with Roth IRAs. They
are tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you should speculate with Internet stocks is another
question _ and another story. If you trade these volatile stocks
often enough and get caught in some major downdrafts, most of your
capital could be eaten up by commissions _ even discount
commissions. The winner will be your broker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Know Which Shares to Sell
</P>
<P>
   Q: Suppose I buy 1,000 shares of XYZ Co. at $10 per share and
then buy another 1,000 shares at $11 per share. If I sell 500
shares for $15 per share, on which shares do I declare a capital
gain for tax purposes? Am I forced to declare the shares on a
first-in, first-out basis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. If you specifically instruct your broker to
sell the shares you bought last _ the ones that cost you $11 per
share _ you can identify them as the sold shares on your tax
return. Your capital gain would amount to $4 per share, or $2,000,
as compared with $5 per share, or $2,500, if you were to declare
the first shares you bought.
</P>
<P>
   However, you should double-check the purchase dates for both
sets of shares. If the earlier shares are a long-term holding,
while the more recent shares are short-term, you would do better to
sell the long-term shares first _ assuming that you want the money
right away and can't wait for the later shares to attain long-term
status. (Stocks become a long-term holding a year and a day after
they are purchased.)
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you are in the 28 percent tax bracket, your tax
_ levied at ordinary income-tax rates on a short-term, $2,000
capital gain _ would be $560. Your tax on a $2,500 gain, levied at
the maximum 20 percent rate for long-term holdings, would be only
$500.
</P>
<P>
   If you fail to tell your broker in advance which shares to sell,
then the IRS insists that you declare them on a first-in, first-out
basis _ which means, in your case, that the cost basis would be $10
per share.
</P>
<P>
   If you trade through an online broker, you may find it
impractical or even impossible to specify which shares you are
selling. Give them a call to check on their procedure _ and lots of
luck trying to get through on the telephone!

WARNER BROS. APPOINTS TWO EXECUTIVES TO LEAD MOVIE STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Saying he wanted ``seasoned entertainment executives
with the right mix of business and creative savvy,'' Gerald M.
Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., turned to two insiders
Monday to run the Warner Bros. studio.
</P>
<P>
   Barry M. Meyer, the executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Warner Bros., was appointed chairman and chief
executive. Alan Horn, chairman of Castle Rock Entertainment, a
division of the studio, was named president and chief operating
officer. The men will replace Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, who
have run Warner Bros. for nearly two decades but announced their
retirement two weeks ago, on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments had been expected and virtually guarantee a
smooth transition at the company. But the two men will have
somewhat diminished authority compared with that of Daly and Semel,
who also oversaw Warner's floundering music division since 1996 and
operated with relative autonomy over the entertainment empire.
Levin said that Meyer and Horn would report to Richard D. Parsons,
the president of Time Warner, as will new music chiefs, who have
not yet been named.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, who reports to Levin, will increase his authority at
the entertainment conglomerate. ``What does it mean? It means more
work,'' Parsons said with a laugh, adding that top management had
been ``talking some time about getting our divisions to work more
closely, and this is an extension of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he expected to name new leaders soon for the troubled
Warner Music division. The unit has been beset by executive turmoil
since the mid-1990s, which has led to shrinking sales. Critics have
said that Warner Music, once a high flier, has been out of sync
with audience tastes for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood welcomed the appointments of Meyer, who is 55, and
Horn, who is 56 and at one time was president of 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent entertainment lawyer who works closely with Warner
Bros. paid Meyer the ultimate Hollywood compliment. ``He's quiet
and no-nonsense and not an egomaniac,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any negative comment about Meyer, it was that his
professional relationships over the years had centered on lawyers,
talent agents and business people. He seems to have few alliances
among filmmakers and actors, as Daly and Semel have. But this is
hardly expected to hamper him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Meyer, who has overseen the company's television
operations and worked on the studio's business side for 28 years,
is a well-liked, if unflamboyant, executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an executive with a long history at Warner Bros., and
his record of achievement on the television side is superb,'' Levin
said. ``He also has tremendous support and regard within the
company.'' Several top Warner Bros. executives working for Meyer
had urged Levin to name him to the top job.
</P>
<P>
   David Geffen, the entertainment executive and partner at
Dreamworks SKG, said: ``This is an easy transition. Barry's a
straight, honest guy, extremely experienced, and he's been the key
person in television and the network along with Bob Daly from the
very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen said that Horn ``is also completely experienced, and he
knows how to get along with extremely difficult people, which is
essential in this job. He's also in no way intimidated by the movie
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who is a friend and former associate of Ted Turner, Time
Warner's vice chairman, was a founder of Castle Rock, which
produced the enormously successful television series ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle Rock's film hits have included ``When Harry Met Sally,''
``City Slickers'' and ``In the Line of Fire.'' In recent years,
though, its film unit has stumbled with flops like ``My Giant,''
``Striptease,'' ``North,'' ``Ghosts of Mississippi'' and ``City
Slickers 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who will focus on the film unit, and Meyer said they
expected no executive turmoil or significant personnel changes. The
two men said they expected to pick up where Daly and Semel leave
off. ``I don't anticipate any change except continued commitment to
growth,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said, ``There's a deep bench, a wonderful management team
and there's nothing broke about this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men voiced high praise for Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the
president of production, and said they expected him to remain. Di
Bonaventura, 42, was largely responsible for ``The Matrix,'' the
studio's biggest hit so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come after Daly and Semel unexpectedly announced their
decision to step down when their contracts expire at the end of the
year, saying they wanted to work as partners and entertainment
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, speculation centered on Meyer, the onetime
television chief. In recent years, the television unit has become
Warner's most lucrative division, with hits like ``E.R.'' and
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, movies have been problematic. Hits like ``The
Matrix,'' ``Analyze This'' and ``You've Got Mail'' have been
dwarfed by big-budget mishaps like ``Wild Wild West'' and ``The
Avengers.'' Most recently, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has been a box-office
disappointment.

JUDGE DISMISSES MOST CHARGES AGAINST CHRISTIAN COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf for insert describing coalition's defense; subs for
new 7th graf with additional quote from Robertson; consolidates
story into one take) (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the beleaguered Christian
Coalition, a federal judge rejected most charges on Monday in a
lawsuit that accused the group of illegally distributing millions
of voter guides and mailings to promote Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joyce Green of Federal District Court here took issue with
the Federal Election Commission, which in filing the lawsuit three
years ago argued that the coalition's nonpartisan posture was a
sham. Judge Green dismissed accusations that the organization
sought to improperly help candidates, including former President
George Bush and Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, through its
literature, telephone banks and other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which held that its activities were covered by
free speech, was not completely vindicated. Judge Green ruled that
it must pay a civil penalty _ the amount has yet to be determined _
to the election commission for advocating the election of Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia during his drive in 1994 to become speaker of
the House. She also ruled that the coalition improperly shared its
mailing list with the Senate campaign in 1994 of Oliver L. North, a
major figure in the Iran-Contra affair who became a talk radio
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall ruling was welcome news for the coalition,
the nation's largest organization of religious conservatives, which
has been riven by deep financial problems and leadership turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the coalition acknowledged that its application to the
Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status had not been
approved and that the organization would reorganize in a move to
retain its influence. The IRS action is separate from the court
ruling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decisive victory for First Amendment freedom for all
groups that want to involve themselves in federal issues,'' Pat
Robertson, the television evangelist who founded the coalition in
1989, said in a telephone interview. ``It shows that all of those
critics who have been trying to scare the churches under the guise
of revocation of tax exemption are just not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside the group's internal troubles, Robertson, who has
reasserted control over the organization, declared that the verdict
ushers in a new era for the coalition. ``I'm back in charge,'' he
said. ``We have a new sheriff in Dodge and it's a brand new game.
The coalition, based on this ruling, becomes extremely significant
in the year 2000 race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harris, a spokesman for the election commission, said, ``We
don't normally comment on litigation matters. We're still looking
at the ruling _ it's 117 pages.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview when the suit was filed, Lee Ann Elliott, a
Republican who was the commission's chairwoman, said of the
coalition, ``There was a majority of the commission that felt they
had gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of tightening campaign finance laws argued that the
verdict would encourage other organizations _ from
environmentalists to abortion groups to unions _ to bend and
stretch the laws by trying to help candidates but not reporting
their efforts as independent expenditures or in-kind contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly another large piece of plaster which is
falling off the ceiling of campaign finance regulation,'' said
Robert F. Bauer, a Democratic lawyer who specializes in campaign
finance law. ``It's a serious setback for the commission's ability
to control unregistered organizations or issue advertising of
independent groups of all stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State and a longtime critic of the
coalition, said the ruling was ``disappointing but not surprising''
because ``the courts have been lax in enforcing federal election
law.'' He added, ``The decision still provides plenty of evidence
that the Christian Coalition is a hardball partisan political
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Green gave a detailed definition of what constitutes
improper coordination between a campaign and an outside group, but
she said the coalition did not appear to cross that line. ``A
corporation's mere announcement to the campaign that it plans to
distribute thousands of voter guides on the Sunday before Election
Day, even if that information is not yet public, is not enough to
be coordination,'' she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Green also said one reason the coalition did not act
improperly was because the Bush campaign refused its entreaties
during the 1992 campaign. She wrote that ``it appears that the
coalition avoided impermissible coordination'' of its spending on
voter guides and get-out-the-vote efforts ``although not for lack
of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``The primary reason that these expenditures were
not coordinated is that campaign staff, armed with foreknowledge of
the coalition's plans, chose not to respond to the coalition's
implicit offers to discuss or negotiate those plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit brought against the coalition took aim at one of its
most effective _ and controversial _ organizing tools: the millions
of voter guides that list candidates' records on assorted issues.
The suit asserted that while the guides distributed between 1990
and 1994 did not expressly advocate the election or defeat of
candidates, legal questions arose because the coalition coordinated
the distribution and content of the guides to favor particular
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The suit resulted from a four-year inquiry by the commission
that was prompted by complaints from the Democratic National
Committee and the Virginia Democratic Party.

TOP GORE AIDE RESIGNS IN SHIFT TOWARD 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Monday that his chief
of staff, Ron Klain, was resigning to become a partner in the
Washington office of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, a law firm based in Los
Angeles. Gore named Charles Burson, a longtime friend and counsel
in his office and former attorney general of Tennessee, his new
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Klain's departure had been expected for several weeks, since
Gore named Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, general
chairman of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of rifts between Coelho and Klain at the
time, and some Democratic operatives expected Klain to be forced
out. But by the time of Monday's announcement, Klain and others
were saying that Coelho was trying to get Klain to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was doing everything humanly possible to try to get me to
stay,'' Klain said in an interview. But, he said, he had already
decided it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point in time when you need to do something
else,'' Klain said. ``My heart said stay, but my head told me to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers said he told them in a staff meeting that he
was ``like a milk carton, and milk cartons have an expiration
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Klain had realized that ``the center of gravity had
shifted'' from the vice president's office to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Klain was criticized by some Gore allies after President Clinton
called a reporter for The New York Times in May and said Gore
needed to loosen up on the campaign trail. Klain was in the room
when the president decided to make the call. He was blamed later
for what was perceived as a public relations disaster for Gore,
although others in the room had not objected either.
</P>
<P>
   Klain said Monday that he and Coelho still thought the phone
call was a good idea. ``Tony and I may be the only people in
Washington who believe that phone call was a good idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klain, 37, will serve as a senior strategist to the campaign and
will not leave for a few months, he said. He was chief of staff for
Attorney General Janet Reno before becoming Gore's chief of staff
nearly four years ago.

AFTER CLINTON SPLASH, NEW MAGAZINE HAS A PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe New Yorkers already knew that fur was back, but
who knew that ``potted'' meat was hip, too?
</P>
<P>
   Newsstand browsers in Manhattan will be surprised to find out
that canned meat _ along with ``old money,'' central Pennsylvania,
earth tones and science _is hip, according to Talk magazine, a
title that arrives on newsstands Tuesday and is edited by Tina
Brown, the former editor of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's eclectic new magazine, which has already generated
an avalanche of publicity by publishing a profile of Hillary Rodham
Clinton in which Mrs. Clinton offered a psychological defense of
her husband's extramarital affairs, combines highbrow features with
lowbrow popular culture _ like ``The Hip List'' and a feature about
the resurgence of fur in the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, Ms. Brown was the host of a party for more than
800 guests at the Statue of Liberty to introduce the magazine,
complete with fireworks by the Grucci family, floral arrangements
by the party designer Robert Isabell, and boxed picnic dinners by
the Upper East Side catering company Glorious Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Guests, who began arriving at 8 p.m., were ferried back and
forth by private ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island, where
the party was moved after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani rejected plans
last month to hold it at the city-owned Brooklyn Navy Yard. The
mayor, who was said to have turned downed the Navy Yard plan after
learning that Mrs. Clinton would be the subject of a profile in the
magazine, was invited to Monday night's party, but did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the magazine's interview with Mrs. Clinton, conducted
by Lucinda Franks, that was the subject of conversation at the
White House briefing Monday. Ms. Franks is married to the Manhattan
district attorney, Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, was asked repeatedly
about Mrs. Clinton's statement in the interview that Clinton had
been abused as a child, and her apparent suggestion that this
explained his infidelities as an adult. Lockhart said that Clinton
had not been physically abused, and he resisted venturing into any
psychological discussion of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article speaks for itself,'' Lockhart said. ``The
president is comfortable with what was expressed in the article. I
think he and others believed that it was a generally favorable
article about the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said the magazine contained nothing new about
Clinton's upbringing, since he has talked extensively about growing
up in a sometimes violent home with an alcoholic stepfather, and
his mother had written about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing new here,'' Lockhart said. ``There are no new
revelations to be made here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Clinton's statement in the article that Clinton
would seek therapy when he left office, Lockhart said that was news
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is the president continues to deal with the
ministers that he talked about at the outset,'' he said. ``I can't
tell you about the details of that because they are private. But he
has sought to work with ministers who he is close with and friendly
with, and that's the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be published 10 times during its first year, Talk
magazine is a joint venture between Miramax Films, which is owned
by Walt Disney Co., and Hearst Magazines.

 &HT;    Reeves encouraged after chat with Anderson
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The weather cooled Monday at Falcons training
camp, and it's supposed to be even cooler the rest of the week.
Maybe it's time for Jamal Anderson to show up.
</P>
<P>
   As his holdout reached its fifth day, and his fines climbed to
around $30,000, the All-Pro running back didn't exactly give any
signs that he was about to relent.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Dan Reeves said a phone conversation he had with
Anderson offered encouragement, and one of Anderson's brothers
seemed to think a change might be afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves called Anderson over the weekend to review the back's
demands for a five-year contract worth about $30 million with an $8
million signing bonus and about $13 million in compensation the
first three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' last offer was a five-year deal worth $28 million
with a $7 million signing bonus, and about $11 million the first
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves took that deal off the table Wednesday when Anderson
failed to report, saying there would be no more negotiating until
Anderson arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he said was he'd be in here when it was 85, and I didn't
know if he was saying when it was 85 degrees or $85 million,''
Reeves said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   It was 102 degrees here Friday and Saturday. It was 92 Monday,
however, and highs are supposed to be in the 80s the rest of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's younger brother, Ali, meanwhile, was reached at the
Salt Lake City offices of his brother's business, and said he
didn't know where Jamal was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's at his other residence (in Suwanee, Ga.),''
said his brother, a pre-law student. ``I'm not sure, but I think
he's in that part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, is on a European vacation. Although
numerous attempts to reach Anderson Monday failed, he said last
week, ``I have every intention of honoring (the last year of his
current contract).''
</P>
<P>
   With the season-ending knee injury Friday of reserve running
back Gary Downs, Reeves put in a call to Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to hear from me so he'd understand where we're
coming from so it's not coming from (general manager) Harold
(Richardson) or his agent,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know where we stand, and why we stand where we
are. And it was him explaining to me why he wants what he wants.''

SCRAMBLE TO FIX COMPUTER SECURITY FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three giants of the computer industry _
Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer _ found themselves
scrambling on Monday to address a rash of serious security
vulnerabilities in software designed to interact with Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws, first made public last week, are particularly
insidious because they allow intruders to plant malicious programs
on a computer merely by sending an e-mail message or by luring a
victim to a malicious Web page that automatically plants a file on
the visitor's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the victim would receive no warning of a
potential security violation, because the flaws enable intruders to
bypass the security controls of Internet Explorer and pass
undetected through traps set by anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems in Atlanta,
said Monday that several of his client corporations had expressed
concern that ``now that this information is in the wild, their
systems are exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They worry that they are building their network on top of a
vulnerable system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Melissa virus or the Explore.exe worm, programs that
exploit these newly discovered security bugs do not require that
the victim take any action; rather, such programs can be activated
if a user merely reads a malicious piece of e-mail while online.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday evening, there had been no reports of intruders
having exploited the flaws, but Microsoft announced that the
problems had prompted plans for a major change in the security
design of its Windows operating system and the Internet Explorer
browser that it recently integrated into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, if Internet Explorer encounters online documents
created by one of the Microsoft Office suite of programs _ Word,
Excel or Powerpoint _ it assumes that they are ``safe'' and loads
them on the user's computer without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that these are very powerful documents capable of
launching executable code, whether benign or malicious. Microsoft
said future operating systems would not trust such documents.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dixon, the Microsoft Office product manager, said the
company was developing an applet, or small Java program, that would
issue a warning before opening Office documents.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem with Office is that Word or Excel
documents can relay arbitrary commands to a computer through a
flawed database component that was shipped with all but the last
boxes of Office 97.
</P>
<P>
   The Office team worked over the weekend to develop and test a
solution to this, Dixon said. But by Monday evening they still did
not feel confident enough to release a patch for the problem to the
50 million registered users of Office 97. When a patch is
available, he said, it will be posted on the Web at
http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/Articles/MDACtyp.htm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the Office flaws, security holes were found last
week in software shipped with Hewlett-Packard's Pavilion models and
Compaq's Presarios. Both models were designed to offer customers
remote support via the Internet, using Microsoft's browser. Both
computer makers configured the browser to allow powerful little
programs to run without warning the user. Unfortunately, these
applets have the ability to run any other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard planned to have a patch available soon, said a
company spokesman, Ray Aldrich. He said the fix would be posted on
the Web at http://www.hp.com/support/hppavilion.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this problem is serious and should be immediately
addressed,'' Aldrich said. ``We do so much testing but sometimes we
miss stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedy Baker, the public relations manager for Compaq's consumer
product division, said the company planned to issue an advisory on
Wednesday to Compaq support centers and expected to send out a
software update to owners of the affected Presarios by the end of
next week.

2 SMALL-ARCRAFT MAKERS TOLD TO REDUCE EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Canada)   (af)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a ruling that shook the burgeoning $55
billion market for small passenger jets, two of the world's leading
small-aircraft manufacturers, Embraer SA of Brazil and Bombardier
Inc. of Canada, were told by the World Trade Organization Monday to
scale back export subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a dispute that has taken three years to resolve,
affects Embraer the most, because the Brazilian company has an
estimated $4.5 billion of subsidies in question compared with about
$100 million of subsidies at its Canadian competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was cautiously welcomed by Embraer, Latin America's
largest aircraft maker, because the trade organization asked the
company, together with the Brazilian government, to make
adjustments to the export-subsidy program instead of scrapping it
altogether. The subsidies have helped Embraer emerge as Brazil's
most successful company in foreign markets since it was privatized
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that we will get less aid, as will Bombardier, so
it is premature to declare a winner and a loser in this dispute,''
said Antonio Luiz Pizarro Manso, Embraer's vice president for
finance. ``What is also clear is that we have the continued support
of the government, which will enable us to fulfill our previous
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pizarro Manso said the trade organization's ruling meant that
Embraer must halt the practice of using government funds to help
finance purchases of its aircraft abroad. The use of such help
allows the company to provide financing at rates in line with those
prevailing in major industrial economies, instead of the far-higher
rates in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer is studying alternatives to allow it to continue selling
planes to foreign companies. At the Paris Air Show in June, Embraer
outshined competitors, winning roughly $6.2 billion in orders for
jets that seat up to 90 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative could be to work with suppliers for its jets, so
that these companies provided part of the financing to the
purchaser. ``Embraer will certainly have to find another way to
market its aircraft because the previous way was illegal,'' Michel
Lord, Bombardier's vice president for communications, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted in a way suggesting that the ruling was a
setback for Embraer. Its shares fell more than 5 percent here
Monday, to 4.70 reais, or $2.57. In Toronto, the market was closed
for a holiday. On Friday, Bombardier shares rose 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization's ruling, which confirms an earlier
decision, could have far-reaching effects in the regional aircraft
market if Embraer's sales are hurt. Over the last five years,
Embraer has become the fastest-growing manufacturer of small jets.
</P>
<P>
   The market for such aircraft is expected to grow in a couple of
decades to 8,000 planes from 5,100 today, said Robert Booth, a
consultant with Aviation Management Services of Miami. ``Embraer is
the great success story of Latin America,'' he said. ``I would see
the Brazilian government doing what it could to keep on defending
it.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Larry Dierker became the Astros' first 20-game winner 30 years ago.
Since then, only three pitchers in club history have reached the
plateau long considered the benchmark of pitching success.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few have come close, only to fall short.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Darryl Kile had 17 victories heading into the final
month of the season. He lost three of his final five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Shane Reynolds stood at 19 wins on the next-to-last
day of the regular season. No decision, no 20 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to pitch good games that you lose. You're going
to pitch good games that you get no-decisions. You're going to
pitch bad games where you're going to win,'' Reynolds said. ``It's
hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But with two months remaining in the regular season, the Astros
have three pitchers _ Mike Hampton (14-3), Jose Lima (14-6) and
Reynolds (13-7) _ within reach of the elusive mark. History,
however, says the odds are against all three of them getting there.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1973 Oakland Athletics with Catfish Hunter (21),
Ken Holtzman (21) and Vida Blue (20) has there been one team with a
trio of 20-game winners. And since 1951, it has been done only six
times, all in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go back a lot further in the National League.
Cincinnati was the last NL team to feature three 20-game winners in
1923.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen,'' Reynolds said. ``I hope nobody
takes this negatively. I hope it happens; don't get me wrong. I
think it would be great and put our pitching on the map. I think we
are fairly young in our careers, and to have three guys with 20
wins would be really unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering the Astros haven't celebrated one 20-game
winner since Mike Scott in 1989. Joe Niekro is the only multiple
20-game winner in Astros history. He won 21 games in 1979 and 20 in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be really remarkable, especially when you consider
the fact many of our best players have been out of action this
year,'' said Dierker, who had a 2.33 ERA and pitched a club-record
305 innings in 1969. ``It certainly has an impact on the number of
runs we've scored. To be able to win that many games, on a team
that is probably in the lower half in runs scored, is really
difficult. It's difficult to win 20 games under those conditions.
It's difficult to win 20 games under any conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   A general gauge of a pitcher's chance at reaching 20 victories:
a sub-3.00 ERA, at least 200 innings pitched, 34-35 starts _ and a
lot of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that in any era, you're probably going to win 20
games,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no sure things. Scott led the majors in strikeouts
(306), ERA (2.22) and innings (275) en route to an 18-win season
and the NL Cy Young Award in 1986. Three seasons later, his ERA was
nearly a full point higher (3.10) and his strikeouts (172) and
innings (229) were down, but he won 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' starting pitchers agree there are plenty of
opportunities to pile up the innings and put themselves in position
to receive a decision in each start. Dierker takes a lenient
approach with his starters, affording them the luxury of working
out of jams. It has showed: Reynolds, Lima and Hampton combined to
average seven innings per start in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just pitch a massive quantity of innings and have a low
ERA, you're probably going to win those games,'' Dierker said.
``But if you continue to come out in the sixth or seventh inning
and don't pile up those innings, you're going to have a lot of
no-decisions. If you have a lot of no-decisions, you're not going
to win 20 games.''
</P>
<P>
   The top three pitchers in the Astros' rotation have accounted
for 41 of the club's 64 victories. During the final two months,
they figure to get at least 11 starts each.
</P>
<P>
   An eventual factor in whether a pitcher reaches 20 wins is
prolonged slumps. Dierker says a pitcher has to keep the spurts of
losses and no-decisions to a minimum while averaging three to four
wins a month.
</P>
<P>
   Lima won five times in May. He won his 11th game June 12, but
over his next four starts he went 0-2 with two no-decisions. He
finally snapped his drought 24 days later. On Sunday, he lost a
10-3 decision to the San Diego Padres that denied him the
opportunity to tie Boston's Pedro Martinez with a
major-league-leading 15 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, a lefthander, has been one of the league's most
consistent pitchers all season. He posted five victories in June
and four in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a slump,'' Dierker said. ``If the slump lasts
two weeks of playing every day, that translates into a month and a
half for a starting pitcher. If you have a slump of a month and a
half, you're not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds thought he would get 20 as he entered the final two
weeks of last season. He positioned himself to become the Astros'
first 20-game winner in nine years Sept. 26 against the Chicago
Cubs. But he left after seven innings with the game tied at 1 and
received no decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have that many guys do it. It's a major
accomplishment,'' Reynolds said. ``A lot of things have to go
right. You have to be in the right spot in the lineup where you are
not facing the other team's No. 1 pitcher, get a lot of run
support, and you have to be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Two 20-game winners on a staff might be a more realistic
possibility. The Atlanta Braves (Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux) and
San Francisco Giants (Bill Swift and John Burkett) each had two
20-game winners as recently as 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to go right,'' Reynolds said. ``Until the last
out is made, you can't take anything for granted.''

EDITORIAL: STILL HOPE FOR GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Congress that is not eager to do very much about gun control
is rapidly approaching its last chance to do anything at all. After
a long delay, the House has appointed its representatives to a
conference committee that will reconcile differences on gun-control
issues between the House and Senate. There is a huge gap between
them. The Senate has approved a slim but useful package of reforms.
The House has done nothing. The conference thus represents a final
opportunity for its members to respond positively to the public's
clear wishes for meaningful legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flicker of hope last week that the House might be
waking up. When the conferees were named on Friday _ one day after
the Atlanta shootings _ the House gave them instructions to
negotiate legislation requiring background checks to help prevent
criminals from buying guns at gun shows. But this was just the rank
and file talking. House Republican leaders said that no such
provision would emerge. More than 100 days after the shootings at
Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., and less than a week after the
carnage in Atlanta, these leaders still do not comprehend the
country's desire for reform.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue in the conference will be the background check
provision, because that was the most important feature of the
Senate's modest bill. An extension of the Brady law, it would give
all vendors at gun shows three business days to conduct mandatory
background checks on customers. When the issue came before the
House, the GOP leadership supported a truncated background check
favored by the National Rifle Association. The upshot was that the
House did not approve any gun-control measures at all.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the House conferees will listen to their
rank-and-file colleagues or to their leaders. The instructions
called for some type of gun-show regulation that would
``effectively preclude criminals and other prohibited purchasers''
from obtaining firearms. The instructions are non-binding, and some
members may not have paid close attention to the language. Even so,
the instructions cannot be dismissed. Every new public opinion poll
is telling the Republicans that the voters are going to reward
those who vote for stricter gun laws. It stands to reason that some
House Republicans are beginning to get the message.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate conferees should stand firmly behind their
version. As an article in Tuesday's Times points out, the federal
system for checking criminal histories is far from perfect. But
that is no excuse not to make checks mandatory at gun shows, an
important source of weapons for criminals and juveniles. If for
some reason the conferees abandon the gun-show provision, President
Clinton should not hesitate to veto the bill.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Clothes for a Cause
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be young, talented and idealistic. Migmar Tsering is a
22-year-old Tibetan who grew up in India, was educated in England,
trained with Katharine Hamnett and is now designing a collection
called Free Tibet. His purpose, he said on a recent trip to New
York, is to raise consciousness about the Chinese occupation of his
native land and to raise money for the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
   His first collection, for spring 1999, was sold only in England,
but his fall clothes will be available in 21 countries. Barneys New
York will have them in mid-September. They will also be at Louis
Boston and Fred Segal in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The styles are sporty, sometimes rugged, fleece jackets made
from recycled plastic bottles; hand-knit sweaters; microfiber pants
and skirts with drawstrings at waist and hem, and T-shirts printed
with Tibetan symbols. Many styles are unisex. Prices range from $55
for T-shirts to $198 for down jackets. Colors are mainly olive,
navy and white, with flashes of burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundy is very Tibetan,'' Tsering said. ``A lot of monks
wear it. The clothes are all made in Nepal. We try to employ as
many Tibetan refugees as possible. Ten percent of our sales go to
the Free Tibet Campaign. We've already raised 10,000 pounds,''
about $16,220.
</P>
<P>
   He may have a political cause, but the clothes are trendy enough
in the utility-chic vein to appeal to young people whose interests
lean more toward fashion. Free Tibet's parent company is Komodo, a
London sportswear manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Sport's New Store
</P>
<P>
   Very few people today dress head-to-toe in one designer label or
even in one price range. They'll mix a new cashmere sweater, say,
with last year's inexpensive cotton pants and maybe a 10-year-old
blazer. Designers have come to acknowledge that even their faithful
customers are more likely to buy items than a whole outfit in one
go. Now Ralph Lauren has adopted that concept for his new Polo
Sport store in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which opened Friday at 379 West Broadway, offers
clothes for men and women from various Lauren labels, plus the
kinds of vintage pieces that have traditionally inspired his
designs. The clothes and accessories are put together the way
Lauren's stylists envision a customer might do it. So a vintage
shearling coat is shown draped over one of the designer's classic
Shetland pullovers. And a denim jeans jacket is paired with a
fringed suede skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case a customer doesn't get the idea, there are
storyboards (the Lauren people call them ``inspiration boards'')
throughout the store that display groups of coordinated
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the store has a rugged, outdoorsy look with rustic wood
floors and old canoes hanging from the 15-foot ceilings, it doesn't
quite have the spontaneous feel of a country store. You know the
stylists have placed every T-shirt, every sweater, every belt, for
maximum effect. Call it eclectic with style.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes by Badgley-Mischka
</P>
<P>
   The team of Mark Badgley and James Mischka, known for glamorous
beaded evening wear and vintage-looking evening purses, has taken
the logical step of designing evening shoes. They are being
produced in Italy by a factory that makes evening shoes for
well-known upper-end shoe designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to do this because we're owned by Escada, which has
an office over there,'' Mischka said last Thursday at a cocktail
party to preview the shoes in the designers' new Seventh Avenue
showroom. ``We couldn't do this ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection of 44 spring styles ranges from flats to 4-inch
heels, all in light-looking sandals or sling-backs. Most are
adorned with delicate beadwork of tiny flowers or insects. The
sandals have very narrow straps, sometimes just one across the
instep, making perfect toes and a fresh pedicure a must.
</P>
<P>
   Mischka's favorite style, he said, is a high-heeled red sling
pump with what he called a ``necklace'' of crystals on the closed
front. Badgley's favorite is an open sandal with a crystal
butterfly on the toe strap and another on the ankle strap.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $250 to $450, not exorbitant considering the
prices of Badgley-Mischka dresses. As Mischka said, ``Even people
who can't afford $5,000 for one of our dresses will spend $300 for
shoes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   True or false: Brain research shows that playing classical music
for 2-year-olds makes them smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given the publicity blitz that has attended the so-called Mozart
effect, most people could be forgiven if they quickly answered,
``true!'' Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia is so convinced that he is
providing CDs to every new mother in the state. And in Florida, a
new law requires that toddlers in state-run schools listen to
classical music every day.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the studies behind the Mozart effect were
conducted on college students, not young children. The ``effect'' _
an increase in performance on a specific task of spatial imagery _
lasted for only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The studies involved no brain research, only tests of behavior.
And attempts to reproduce the results have failed, including a
study by Appalachian State University researchers published last
month in the journal Psychological Science.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be made of this? In ``The Myth of the First Three
Years,'' scheduled for publication next month by the Free Press,
Dr. John Bruer argues that the hype surrounding the Mozart effect _
and more generally, the overstatement and at times distortion of
what neuroscientists know about the developing brain _ has
unnecessarily sent anxious parents and educators scurrying to
insure that children receive exactly the right type of ``enriched''
stimulation before the age of 3, lest they suffer untoward
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It has also, he contends, encouraged legislators to forge
educational policy based largely on misinterpretation and
hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``What science-based policy should tell you is something about
root causes and mechanisms,'' said Bruer, who is president of the
McDonnell Foundation in St. Louis, which funds research in
neuroscience and cognition. ``If brain science doesn't support
this, we run the risk of wasting resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he asserts, neuroscience, with all its high-tech brain
scanning and molecular wizardry, still has little (Bruer actually
says ``nothing at all'') to say about how educators should teach,
or parents parent. And the brain science that does exist, he
argues, sends a message that is considerably more optimistic than
the ``it's all set by the age of 3'' that some parents and
educators have taken home.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bruer's critique will be seen by many as extreme, he is
not the only expert who objects to the imprecision with which
neuroscientific findings have been translated in the public arena.
Even some of the researchers whose work is often cited in public
presentations say their findings have been overinterpreted by eager
politicians and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   One popular notion that Bruer challenges in his book is that the
years from zero to 3 are a developmental window, or ``critical
period,'' during which certain types of learning experiences must
occur if they are to take place at all. In reality, he says, the
term ``critical period'' is correctly applied only to very specific
aspects of human functioning, most of them essential for the
organism's survival.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the ability to see normally depends on appropriate
visual stimulation during the first years of life. Many aspects of
language development also are dependent on early exposure. And
infants, as demonstrated by studies of children who have suffered
severe deprivation, and of monkeys who have been reared in
isolation, require appropriate care if they are to achieve normal
social and emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide publicity given two unpublished studies,
however, no neuroscience yet links research on the quality of early
relationships to changes in brain structure or function.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of these basic functions, Bruer argues, no
``extra'' stimulation is needed; the normal experiences and
nurturing most parents provide and that evolution intended suffice.
And when it comes to the ability to think, learn and reason, he
says, the science indicates that no such critical period exists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the brain appears able to learn and change throughout
life, and many early deficits can be remedied in later life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been totally ignored,'' he said, ``is that what the
new results seem to show is the lifelong plasticity of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruer does not hesitate to call those he believes to be
responsible to task. He places a large share of the blame, for
example, on the media, and in particular on science journalists,
who, he says, in their eagerness to mine the public's interest in
brain science, often have omitted essential caveats that limit how
far research can be generalized, have sometimes reported on studies
before they were published or peer-reviewed, and have been too
quick to apply the findings of animal research to human children.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruer has plenty of criticism to spread around. In his list
of culprits he also includes ``Starting Points,'' the Carnegie
Foundation's influential report on young children's needs, which
devoted 3 of its 132 pages to neuroscience, child advocacy
organizations like the Zero to Three and the I Am Your Child
foundations, the White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning, held in 1997, and even a few scientists,
who he claims are guilty of overselling the implications of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   And not surprisingly, ``The Myth of the First Three Years'' is
stirring controversy even before it reaches bookstores. It is not
that Bruer's critics dispute the fact that neuroscience findings
have sometimes been exaggerated or misused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that those extremes do exist, and that is
a danger,'' said Dr. David Hamburg, president emeritus of the
Carnegie Foundation, who spearheaded the ``Starting Points,''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamburg and others mentioned critically in the book said
that what irks them about Bruer's assault is that he seems to
ignore a wealth of research in areas other than neuroscience _
developmental psychology, for example _ which shows that the first
years of life are indeed critically important. Such studies, they
assert, clearly demonstrate that what parents do in the first three
years matters, and underline the need for parents to be attuned to
developmental milestones, and the value of activities like reading
and talking to young children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Neuroscience or not, we've learned a tremendous amount over
the last 30 years through scientifically valid research
mechanisms,'' said Matthew Melmed, executive director of the Zero
to Three Foundation. ``And we do have a lot to say and advice to
share with parents about the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   Melmed, Hamburg and others mentioned in Bruer's book say that
their organizations have never suggested that a window slams shut
on development at the age of 3, or that the later childhood years _
or adulthood, for that matter _ are unimportant. And they worry
that the appearance of a book titled ``The Myth of the First Three
Years,'' will send parents off to the other, equally misguided
extreme _ setting back the field 20 years, as one expert put it _
and make advocacy more difficult in a nation that, in comparison to
other countries, is not known for making the health and welfare of
its youngest citizens a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Some neuroscientists also disagree with Bruer's assertion that
neuroscience has nothing to say about early childhood. Dr. Patricia
Kuhl, professor of speech and hearing sciences at the University of
Washington whose book, ``The Scientist in the Crib'' (William
Morrow), written with two other research scientists, will be
published next month, said she thinks Bruer makes some valid
points.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings of research, she said, ``have shown us that
babies are not just cute faces but the greatest learning machines
in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies revise their views about people and things in the world
based on new information, just as scientists do,'' Dr. Kuhl said.
``A difference is that babies do it more quickly and more
profoundly than adults, because their brains are less committed _
literally less cluttered _ than ours are.''
</P>
<P>
   And while such findings ``don't provide a prescription for
revamping our educational system,'' she said, ``they do alter our
views of the mental life of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is likely that in the wake of Bruer's book,
journalists and child advocacy organizations will be more careful
about how they translate the science in the public arena,
especially because other critical voices are joining the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper, for example, to be published in the
journal Child Development, Dr. Ross A. Thompson, a developmental
psychologist at the University of Nebraska, and Dr. Charles Nelson,
a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota, make many of the
same points, stressing the importance of viewing brain development
as something that begins well before birth and continues throughout
life, and pointing out areas in which the findings of neuroscience
have been oversimplified or misstated.
</P>
<P>
   And some scientists whose work has drawn the spotlight are
voicing complaints. Dr. Francis Rauscher, for example, who was a
co-author of the original studies of the Mozart effect, said she is
uncomfortable with the way her results are mangled by the media,
and bemused by efforts like Miller's in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can hurt,'' said Dr. Rauscher, who is now
assistant professor of cognitive development at the University of
Wisconsin in Oshkosh. ``I'm all for exposing children to wonderful
cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better
spent on music education programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Dr. William Greenough, of the University of
Illinois, who studies the effects in rats of being reared in
complex or deprived environments, is sometimes put forward as
evidence that ``enrichment'' must be provided in the first years of
life, if it is to be provided at all. But Greenough, too, is less
than happy with this construction of his findings. ``I spent most
of 30 years demonstrating that that's not true,'' he said in an
interview last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question of how much of a child's life is written in
the first three years is important to every parent and educator,
and has special poignancy for parents who adopt older children, who
may have suffered intense deprivation earlier in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, many experts believe, is a sober, comprehensive
effort to consider the entire literature of early childhood,
sorting science from hyperbole, what is known from what is not. The
National Research Council has convened a committee to do just this.
Its report is scheduled to be released next year. And whatever the
report says, it will no doubt trigger a new round of debate.

HIS SUSPENSION CUT BY A WEEK, STRAWBERRY HEADS TO THE MINORS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry's 120-day suspension from Major League
Baseball was reduced by one week Monday, and he will start a
rehabilitation assignment Wednesday at Class AAA Columbus. The
Yankees are not certain how long Strawberry will rehabilitate
because they have to monitor the condition of his left knee and see
whether he can effectively play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played any games since spring training,'' General
Manager Brian Cashman said. ``All he's done is take batting
practice. Right now, it's hard to speculate on when he might be a
player up here.''
</P>
<P>
   After Commissioner Bud Selig spoke twice with Strawberry and
reviewed the aspects of his April 14 arrest for solicitation of
prostitution and possession of cocaine, he decided to switch the
reinstatement date to Wednesday from Aug. 11. In a one-sentence
news release, Selig said he was convinced that Strawberry was
committed to his continued recovery.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of Strawberry's suspension was inevitable and was
met with a chorus of positive comments from his teammates, his
future role with the Yankees remained murky. Cashman said
Strawberry would probably shift between the outfield one game and
designated hitter the next until the Yankees determine how much his
surgically repaired knee can handle and until he gets an
unspecified number of at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   When Cashman was asked whether it was definite that Strawberry
would be in the majors with the Yankees this year, he said: ``I
couldn't say that. Everybody has to work to get up here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Strawberry must be able to play left field to
assume a spot with the Yankees, especially after the acquisition of
Jim Leyritz from the Padres. With the switch-hitter Chili Davis
entrenched as the designated hitter and Leyritz as a backup from
the right side, Davis' weaker side, Manager Joe Torre admitted it
was unlikely that the 37-year-old Strawberry could secure time as a
DH.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry played outfield for the Yanks in spring training, but
he did not play the field two days in a row because he was tired
from chemotherapy treatments and because his knee was chronically
sore. Even though Strawberry has been crushing homers in the last
two weeks of batting practice in Tampa, Fla., and has shagged
flies, Cashman said the evaluations would not begin until he had
played in games. Arthur Richman, a senior adviser who has known
Strawberry for almost 20 years, will accompany him throughout his
minor league stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going to have to find out how the knee is going to
hold up because he's going to have to find out if he can play the
outfield,'' Torre said. ``I think we all know what Darryl brings to
the table, if he's healthy. He's a threat and he intimidates the
opposition. But again, let's not get too excited until we find out
how well he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry cannot play the outfield, Torre said it would be
tough to see him in any other role besides pinch-hitter. But if
George Steinbrenner is convinced that Strawberry's knee is healthy
and he can still be a serious power threat, Strawberry will be
summoned. Strawberry would have to be added to the 25-man roster
before Aug. 31 to be included on the post-season roster.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whom would Strawberry replace on the roster? The position
players who could possibly be influenced are Shane Spencer and
Ricky Ledee. And while Strawberry's mere presence in the dugout
could be important, Spencer and Ledee have more all-round value,
and one will presumably be starting in left. Torre bowed his head
and smiled when asked about squeezing Strawberry into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all hoping he's capable of playing and of helping us,''
Torre said. ``But the downside is you're going to have to make room
for him. The guy who has to leave won't leave because he can't play
here, but because we need some room. I still think this is a little
ways off. We'll see what happens.''

 &HT;    MOST OVER 45 ENJOY SEX REGULARLY, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    Embargoed by source for release Wednesday, Aug. 4.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most Americans age 45 and older are having sex at
least once a week and enjoy it, according to a survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey, conducted on behalf of the seniors group AARP
for its magazine Modern Maturity, found sharp differences in sexual
attitudes among men and women, and those with and without life
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found differences by age, with middle-aged
respondents having sex more often and enjoying it more.
</P>
<P>
   The mail survey of 1,384 adults was conducted in March with the
assistance of John McKinlay of New England Research Institutes and
NFO Research Inc. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey is unique because it looks at the attitudes,
behaviors and life circumstances starting at age 45, as compared to
studies that start at ages 59 or 60,'' said Constance Swank, AARP
research director.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are some generational differences, we found that a
majority of mid-life and older adults feel good about their lives
right now, and 67 percent of men and 57 percent of women say a
satisfying sexual relationship is important to that quality of
life,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that middle-aged and older couples have a
regular sex life, with more than 60 percent of men and women aged
45 to 59 reporting they engaged in sexual intercourse at least once
a week.
</P>
<P>
   For men and women over 75, the frequency declined to about 25
percent having intercourse once a week. Over all, more than 60
percent of respondents with partners said they had intercourse at
least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   However, the frequency dropped sharply for those without life
partners. While more than half of all men and women with partners
reported intercourse at least once a week, only 6 percent of men
and one-half of 1 percent of women without partners had intercourse
that often.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 80 percent of the men and 96 percent of
the women without partners had not had sexual intercourse in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between couples and single adults were reflected
in other forms of sexual activity, including kissing and hugging,
caressing and oral sex. The survey found that men _ with and
without partners _ engaged in self-stimulation about eight times
more frequently than women.
</P>
<P>
   Men of all ages were more likely to think about sex than women,
with 28 percent of males and 5 percent of females age 45 to 59
having sexual thoughts more than once a day. For those over 75, 18
percent of men and 57 percent of women reported not having any
sexual thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more likely to think sex was important in their lives
and was a critical part of a relationship. Women were more likely
to say they did not particularly enjoy sex or that they would be
happy never having sex again, although less than 20 percent of the
women gave such answers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the survey were:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 10 percent of men and 7 percent of women have ever used
medicines, hormones or other treatments to improve sexual function
or activity. Slightly more than half of those who have tried such
treatments are currently using them.
</P>
<P>
   Among men taking treatment, sexual activity increased from 25
percent to 33 percent having sex at least once a week. But because
of the small number of people taking treatment, the survey found
the increase was not enough to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of men and women taking such treatment said it
increased their enjoyment of sex and had a positive effect on their
partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older people found their partners both more physically
attractive and romantic than young people, but at least half of all
age groups gave their partners the highest rating for being
physically attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 men and half of the women in their 40s and 50s gave
their partners top rating as physically attractive, while 64
percent of men and 57 percent of women aged 75 and older said the
same of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older and younger women have sharply different attitudes
toward sex.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of women aged 45 to 59 said ``people should not
have a sexual relationship if they are not married,'' compared to
two-thirds of women 75 and older. Among men, 28 percent of those
aged 45 to 59 and half of those over 75 said sex should only be for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Over all, a third of the men said they were ``somewhat
satisfied'' with their sex life, while nearly a third of the women
said they were ``extremely satisfied'' with their sex life.

COMMENTARY: A MONUMENT LIVES ON IN SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ There was no way for Diana Munson to have
known that her husband's dressing stall remained in the Yankees'
clubhouse, silent and vacant, a timepiece in tribute. She was not
one to ask, too proud, too involved in her own delicate process of
balancing the past and the present back home in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canton, they don't care about the Yankee mystique,''
Thurman Munson's widow said on the 20th anniversary of the former
Yankee captain's tragic death. ``And that's been one of the nice
things about people calling lately. A reporter from New York told
me that his locker is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still there, at the far left of the room, next door to Derek
Jeter, who is right where Bobby Murcer once dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should go in there,'' Murcer told Diana Munson Monday at
the Yogi Berra Museum before she headed up to Yankee Stadium to
throw out the first pitch before Monday night's Yankees-Toronto
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never actually seen it,'' she said. ``The one time I was
in there, 1977 or 1978, they were celebrating the World Series. It
was all covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for George Steinbrenner _ he never had it in him to
reassign the stall with the No. 15 plate, after Munson died in
1979. Inside the clubhouse, the Boss created no shrines for the
Yankees' Hall of Fame legends; only for a true, blue-collar
catcher, who at 32 missed the runway while practicing landings in
Canton and died when his private plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Diana Munson kept her own shrine, her home. Ten
years ago, a reporter working on a 10th anniversary remembrance was
treated to a tour of Thurman's Munson's dutifully preserved den,
the double mahogany doors opening to a life's treasured keepsakes.
The 1976 most valuable player trophy and the haunting photos and
even the toy model of the fatal Cessna Citation jet, sitting
undisturbed upon the desk.
</P>
<P>
   And then one day, about two years ago, the first of Diana
Munson's grandchildren happened to nudge the doors open and looked
inside, as if she had discovered Atlantis. It was only then that an
imaginary shroud lifted and Diana realized that the next generation
had come, and so had the time to pack up the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want my grandchildren to see my home as a museum, a
monument,'' she said. ``I wanted it to be a place of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children stayed back in Canton Monday, in their independent
adult lives. Diana bristled when Tracy, Kelly and Michael wanted to
mourn privately, as did Caroline Kennedy. When John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane disappeared, they surely relived their personal horror,
but only Diana could recall Ethel Kennedy's condolence phone call a
month after Thurman had died. Only she could honestly span the
decades, relate to her husband's Yankee legacy in New York. Only
she could come to the conclusion that ``any time people here want
to celebrate Thurman's life, I will be here to celebrate with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   When 140 people jammed the Berra Museum for a Munson symposium
Monday, Diana's eyes welled with tears. She said she doubted there
would be a 25th anniversary ``celebration,'' or a 30th, but, then,
events such as these do benefit the living more than the dead. They
take life's inventory, measure how much it has really gone on.
</P>
<P>
   So Diana Munson had the opportunity to talk about the three
grandchildren, the fourth on the way and the recent engagement of
her son. She could show off new baby pictures to Murcer, who had
flown to Canton with Lou Piniella and sat with her on the worst
night of her life. She could hear Murcer talk about the two-run
opposite-field double he hit bailing out against Baltimore's tough
left-hander Tippy Martinez to win the emotional game the Yankees
played in New York hours after burying Munson in Canton, and tell
Murcer, yes, of course, she still had the bat he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   She could offer endearing family stories about her husband, a
gruff man who never went out of his way to cultivate good press.
``It's 20 years later,'' she said. ``What's he going to do to me?''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked if it was true that Munson had been pursuing
a trade to Cleveland before his death, she could set the record
straight, remind us that Thurman Munson had learned to fly so he
could visit his family in Canton on days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thurman had made up his mind,'' Diana Munson said, ``he was
always going to remain a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, finally, that she would not go into the Yankee
clubhouse to see for herself that he had. Some other time, perhaps.
In 5 years, or 10, when her grandchildren understand why some
shrines can be forever.

 &HT;    Critics say Bush hazy on specific ideas
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most presidential candidates have crime-fighting
ideas _ but not many have a separate slate of proposals
specifically targeting crime in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic front-runner Al Gore does. Gore also has 28 specific
ideas for improving education, including ``codes of discipline''
and a volunteer army of online tutors. He has proposals to preserve
green space and shorten commutes. He wants to double federal money
for cancer research over the next five years, and require photo
ID's for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our democracy is ill-served by an overreliance on generalities
and fuzzy rhetoric and is much better served by specific, detailed
discussions of the tough choices we have to make,'' Gore recently
told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, hasn't come
close to matching Gore's policy onslaught, and critics grouse that
Bush's large lead in the polls has more to do with his personality
and name recognition than his ideas. As a conservative who believes
in limited government, Bush doesn't intend to trade proposals with
a confirmed policy wonk like Gore. But the governor is working on
fleshing out his philosophy with concrete ideas _ and he's
assembled over a hundred of the nation's best conservative minds to
help.
</P>
<P>
   The process began in April 1998 in the Palo Alto living room of
former Secretary of State George Shultz. Shultz invited about a
half-dozen fellows of Stanford University's Hoover Institution for
tea, cookies, and a free-wheeling policy discussion with Bush, who
was in California raising money for the Republican gubernatorial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary give and take. The governor would ask
questions, the fellows would respond, and then he'd ask another
question,'' said John Cogan, an economist from the 80-year-old
think tank. ``He was very knowledgeable across a broad range of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, as Bush's presidential aspirations crystallized, he
began inviting policy experts from around the nation to Austin for
hours-long discussions on everything from welfare to missile
defense to immigration to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Adams, a veteran of President George Bush's administration
who organized a briefing on technology, said Bush opened the
session by talking about his political philosophy and his
management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Clinton and Gore, he's not a policy wonk, and he
doesn't want to be one. He believes a chief executive should set
out principles, a vision of where you want to go, and then you
surround yourself with very smart people and listen to them and
work with them,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of those initial meetings, Bush assembled more than a
hundred professors and other policy experts _ many of them veterans
of Republican administrations _ into a three-pronged advisory team.
Their mission: come up with specific proposals in the areas of
domestic policy, the economy, and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't just want back of the envelope, pie in-the-sky
proposals. He wants proposals that have been well-though out,
well-scrubbed, and that fall within budget constraints,'' said
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover fellow Martin Anderson, who was a campaign policy advisor
to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole, called Bush's team
``the most thorough, comprehensive policy shop _ at this stage _
that anyone's ever done.''

<P>
   As Bush's policy wonks have been laboring in think tanks,
universities and consultants' shops across the country, the
governor has been dominating the presidential field, crushing his
rivals in the polls and in the chase for campaign cash. Bush's
opponents say his success, which has come before most of his
proposals, is undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more damaging to the political process than a
perception that politics has become a contest about money, instead
of ideas,'' GOP candidate Orrin Hatch said Sunday in a
not-so-veiled reference to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Dallas Morning News poll showing Bush with his
customary large lead found that only 17 percent of those expressing
support for him knew a lot about his record or stands on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes insists that Bush has
already been specific. To counter the criticism, the Bush campaign
recently posted 91 specific stands on its website.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's speech two weeks ago at an Indianapolis
church, where he promised to expand government's reliance on
``faith-based'' groups, was the first in what will be a series of
major policy addresses. The timing of the rest of the speeches will
be part political and part practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he feels comfortable with a policy and is ready to
propose certain policy ideas, he decides what he wants to say, and
then we look for an appropriate venue in which to say it,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, who heads the University of New Hampshire polling
center, said Bush shouldn't be in a hurry, especially since most
voters won't focus on the presidential race until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were him, I wouldn't be specific until it absolutely got
dragged out of me,'' said Smith, noting Bush's enviable position in
the race. ``Gosh, I'd try to keep it as warm and fuzzy as possible
right now.''

 &HT;    First Dell PCs made outside Central Texas roll off line
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Less than four months after Dell Computer Corp.
announced it would relocate its consumer and small business PC
division to Tennessee, the company on Monday produced its first
Tennessee-made computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and its 725 new Tennessee workers began producing two new
Dimension models from the plant in Lebanon, 20 miles east of
Nashville. It is Round Rock-based Dell's first U.S. plant outside
Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first Dimension computer produced at Dell's
factory in Lebanon was set aside for Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist.
The second was presented to Lebanon Mayor Don Fox for his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it for symbolic reasons,'' Fox said later. ``I want to
be able to say we have a Dell computer at City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell took over a 300,000-square-foot building in Lebanon shortly
after the City of Nashville and the state agreed to a package of
economic incentives to bring Dell to Middle Tennessee in May.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to employ approximately 1,000 Tennessee
workers by the end of this year and 3,000 within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanon plant will be followed by construction next year of
two more buildings near the Nashville airport that will initially
house technical support, parts and servicing.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville area, chosen during a search of cities in several
states, gives Dell quicker access than Austin to Southeastern hubs
of overnight delivery businesses such as United Parcel Services.
That is expected to cut delivery time to customers.
</P>
<P>
   There were also financial incentives. Last month, the Nashville
Metro Council approved a $46 million package for Dell that included
property tax breaks and money for training.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the first major technology company in Middle
Tennessee, Dell won't face the kind of competition for workers that
it does in Central Texas, where it employs about 18,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dimension division is shifted to Tennessee, Dell
officials have said the estimated 3,000 employees who work on the
Dimension in Central Texas will be retrained to assemble other
types of PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokeswoman Libba Letton said Monday the date for the
complete transfer has not been set. The Lebanon operations will
produce the new Dimension XPS T600 and Dimension L500 systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension XPS T600 system, starting at $1,719 and featuring
Pentium III 600 MHz processor, is Dell's high-end performance
consumer PC for multimedia capabilities including games, Internet
design and digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension L system, starting at $1,087, is Dell's
entry-level desktop PC. It runs on Intel Corp.'s new Celeron 500MHz
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Three other lines are expected to be added later.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Vice President Paul Bell said the Middle Tennessee
operations are critical to Dell's growth because that segment has
grown by more than 50 percent for the company in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is ranked first in sales to small businesses in the United
States and No. 4 in sales to U.S. consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest growing part of Dell,'' Bell said in an
interview after the plant's opening ceremony. ``Strategically, this
is a very important move for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is not only getting the Dell operations, but also the
operations of some of its Central Texas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said suppliers that will follow it to Tennessee include
Austin Foam Plastics Inc., Capital City Container Corp., Digimedia
Inc., Copyright Printing, Ryder Integrated Logistics, IPC
Communications Services and Lone Star InfoSystems.

GOP LEADERS TRY TO AGREE ON TAX-CUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Del., Miss.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders from both houses of Congress
began settling on a common tax-cutting plan Monday but did not
resolve their differences over what kind of reduction in income tax
rates they should support.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met into the night as they pushed to reconcile a
tax-cutting bill passed by the House with one passed by the Senate,
and present a united front in their battle with President Clinton
over how to use projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, pushed for adoption of the approach in the House's
tax-cutting bill, a reduction of 10 percent in all income tax
rates, people who had been briefed on the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   But, they said, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, stuck by his approach _ a reduction of
the lowest income tax rate to 14 percent from 15 percent _ as being
more fair to low- and middle-income taxpayers and more palatable to
moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Roth is under pressure from conservatives within his party,
including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to
go along with the House approach on tax rates, and many Republicans
expect the negotiations to yield a bill closer to the House's
approach than to the Senate's.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut of $792 billion over 10 years that was approved by
the House differs in many details from the Senate measure, which
was revalued Monday at $809 billion. But both are intended to
commit Republicans to sending much of the projected federal budget
surplus back to taxpayers. That projected surplus is $2.9 trillion
over the next decade, of which $1.9 trillion is earmarked for
Social Security, leaving about $1 trillion for the two parties to
fight over.
</P>
<P>
   There is likely to be intense horse-trading among Archer, Roth
and the other Republican leaders involved in the talks, including
Lott and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, over
both arcane provisions of interest only to specific constituencies
and centerpiece provisions like the income tax cut. But Roth
suggested that they could be resolved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that unite us far exceed any differences that might
divide us,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators appeared headed toward agreement Monday on
taking the Senate's approach to dealing with the so-called marriage
penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leaves many two-income
couples paying more in taxes than they would if single, people
involved in the talks said. The Senate plan, which would allow
couples to file as if they were single but on a common tax return,
would come much closer than the House bill to eliminating the
penalty, a top goal of the Christian right and other influential
conservative constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert are pressing to finish the
negotiations in the next day and bring the final bill to the House
and Senate floor for passage by the end of this week. Clinton has
promised to veto whatever bill finally emerges from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept up his criticism of the Republican tax cuts Monday
as he unveiled new figures showing that the federal government will
pay off $87 billion of the national debt this year. The repayments,
which will bring the most important measure of the debt down to
$3.64 trillion, represent the financial benefit to the government
of running a budget surplus this year.

KOSOVAR REFUGEES PREPARE FOR RETURN FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Azem Selmani and his family lost everything when
Serbian neighbors burned down their comfortable house in Pristina.
They have no money to rebuild that house and no jobs waiting for
them.
</P>
<P>
   And for all they know, their neighbors are still there.
</P>
<P>
   But Selmani, who is 41, anxiously counts off the days _ in the
little English that he can speak _ until he sets foot again in
Kosovo. Wednesday, Selmani, his wife and five children are listed
among the 171 Kosovo refugees who are to leave the United States to
make the long journey home. Most of the refugees scheduled for this
flight are giving up their temporary shelters in New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut and elsewhere for an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions that I live in here are much better than what
I'll find back home,'' said Selmani, who was interviewed on Sunday
through a translator at the Westway Motel in Queens County. For
seven weeks, after leaving a temporary refugee center at Ft. Dix,
N.J., his family had stayed in spacious houses in Bridgeport and
Waterbury, Conn. Last week, they moved to the motel to wait for a
flight at Kennedy Airport. ``But simply, I love Kosovo more than
anything else and more than any other country,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of homesick and frustrated Kosovo refugees have
received approval to return through a program financed by the
Department of State. Flights from Kennedy Airport are being
coordinated by the International Organization for Migration, a
humanitarian group in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Many families like the Selmanis say they want to go home to
rebuild their lives in their own country _ not someone else's. And
some families left behind mothers and fathers, husbands and wives,
and sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to go back,'' said Merita Mita, 42, whose husband
flew back to Kosovo last month after scraping together enough money
from relatives for one ticket. ``It started out as an unplanned
visit. I came here _ when I didn't want to go anywhere _ and I saw
so many things, but not enough to change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mita, who went straight from Macedonia to Yonkers, N.Y.,
two months ago, said her family had visited the Empire State
Building, Coney Island and the Bronx Zoo, and even taken free
English classes at Marymount Manhattan College.
</P>
<P>
   Lum Mita, 12, enjoyed his first visit here but said it made him
all the more homesick. ``Our America is Kosovo,'' he said.
``America is the best country in the world and my America is
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But still other refugees _ especially those who cannot speak
English _ say the tiring struggle to find jobs and make ends meet
in the United States finally made the decision for them to return
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 days, I was eating food on the floor because we didn't
have a place to sit,'' said Agron Agushi, 45, who is taking his
mother, wife and two young sons back to Pristina on Wednesday after
spending a month in the Bronx. ``We heard about the return program
and we applied. We couldn't take it anymore. I could not even get a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight tomorrow will carry the second group of Kosovo
refugees from the United States to the airport in Skopje,
Macedonia. The first group of 286 refugees left on July 26 for
Skopje, where they boarded buses and minivans and crossed the
border into Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Selmani, Mita and Agushi families were among the 60 refugees
who waited for their flight this week at the Westway Motel. They
were supposed to have left on July 27 but that flight was canceled
because the plane could not get clearance to land in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the initial demand, chartered flights are
tentatively scheduled to leave every four or five days from Kennedy
Airport, said Lauren Engle, a spokeswoman for the International
Organization for Migration. The group is limited by officials in
Macedonia to eight landings a day in Skopje _ which takes in about
1,300 refugees daily.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Engle said that more flights would be added as the
organization chartered smaller jets to fly directly into Pristina,
which is normally restricted to military flights. The organization
chartered a plane carrying 167 refugees from Zurich to Pristina
Monday; she said it was the first refugee flight to land in
Pristina since the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means it will increase the pace of the program,'' Ms.
Engle said. ``People will be able to get back more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications have come in from about one-third of the more than
10,000 refugees brought over by the State Department from
Macedonia, Ms. Engle said. The organization receives about 150
calls a day from refugees seeking information.
</P>
<P>
   While living in the United States, the Kosovo refugees have been
sponsored by one of 10 national service organizations hired by the
State Department to provide food, housing, jobs and other basic
services for them. A $740 federal grant for each refugee helped
defray these costs for the first month, until the refugees became
eligible for food stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the refugees say that their frustration and
disappointment with the harder-than-expected transition to everyday
American life has made them want to return to Kosovo. Many say that
government officials promised them that they would move into their
own homes, start English lessons and be placed in jobs and schools
right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody kept their word about what they told us, and we're very
angry at what happened,'' said Minire Xhakli, 40, who has lived in
temporary housing in Elizabeth, N.J., for nearly two months with
her husband and five children.
</P>
<P>
   Several resettlement workers said the transition may have been
particularly disappointing for Kosovars who stayed initially at the
converted military base in Ft. Dix, N.J., before moving to
communities across the country. They said their organizations could
never match the largess of Ft. Dix _ unlimited meals, free phone
cards, air-conditioned barracks and children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, which coordinated the refugee program at Ft. Dix,
said that officials might have been ``somewhat effusive'' while
trying to reassure refugees about the move. ``I'm not disputing
over all that's what we said, but it could never happen right
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agushis, who did not stay at Ft. Dix, were sponsored by the
International Rescue Committee, which is based in New York, after
they came over July 1. The six family members received $975 for
food and expenses, and $1,000 for rent and a security deposit.
Agushi, a tour bus driver in Pristina, said he was unable to find
similar work here.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Bellor, director of refugee resettlement for the
International Rescue Committee, said Agushi would have been offered
job counseling and English classes if he had been willing to wait
longer. The Agushis' daughter, who is 20, has chosen not to return
to Pristina with the rest of the family and will live with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refugees come and make a living here all the time _ and some
are very successful _ but it's a difficult time for anybody when
they first come here,'' Ms. Bellor said.
</P>
<P>
   But for other refugees, even a successful life in America cannot
replace the one they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Selmani said, ``I don't know about the other families'
experiences but I'm very grateful for the way we were treated, the
kindness we were showed, but that's not good enough for us to stay
here, because we have to go back.''

 &HT;    Robber's plan gets sliced
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The armed robber asked for everything _ but got
nothing after a restaurant manager thought he was ordering a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The foiled robber was still at large Monday after his visit to
Papa John's Pizza on Wilmington Ave., early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report: The man asked for a pen and slid a
note to the manager: ``I want it all or POW.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Nathan Ayres pointed to the large deluxe pizzas on the
wall menu and asked which one he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he wanted it all.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres read off the large-pizza options.
</P>
<P>
   The man, aggravated, said, ``I want it all _ your money _ or
POW!'' Then he patted his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   Finally aware it was a robbery attempt, Ayres pushed a silent
alarm. The man fled.
</P>
<P>
   One thing might help: the suspect told the manager he had a
speech impediment, according to the police report. Ayres later told
police the man talked as if he had a speech problem.
</P>
<P>
   After writing the note on a napkin and failing to communicate,
the suspect patted the waistband of his red shorts, concealed by a
yellow sport shirt. Ayres pushed the store's panic button.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect asked Ayres what he had done. After Ayres told him
several times ``nothing,'' the suspect walked behind the counter,
saw the panic button and ran from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres told police he saw the suspect enter the passenger door of
a car parked in front of a neighboring business. The car, driven by
another man, then left the parking lot.

PORFIRIO DELGADO, 85, MAKER OF GUITARS CHERISHED BY STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mexico)  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Porfirio Delgado, a luthier whose guitars were used by several
generations of classical, Latin and pop performers, died last
Wednesday at his home in East Los Angeles. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had retired and left his Candelas Guitars shop in
the hands of two of his grandsons, Tomas and Manuel, he was still
regarded by many as the guiding spirit of the family-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado was born in 1913 in Torreon, Mexico. He began his
professional life as a cabinetmaker but he also played the guitar,
as did his older brother, Candelario. In the mid-1920s they formed
a performing duo, Los Hermanos Candelas (the Candelas Brothers),
and when they began making their own guitars in 1928 they used
Candelas as their brand name.
</P>
<P>
   The Delgado brothers continued to perform, even after they
started their guitar business. When they formed a larger band,
called Son Torreon, they made all of the group's instruments,
including some that used a cutaway design: an indentation in the
upper body of the guitar that allows the player's hand to move
easily along the higher reaches of the fretboard.
</P>
<P>
   Candelas guitars were among the first to use the cutaway design,
and some credit the innovation to the Delgados.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers ran several guitar shops in Mexico until 1946 and
had several Hispanic popular music and flamenco stars as clients,
including Mario Moreno, who was known as Cantinflas; Los Tres
Cahelleros, an ensemble that played in several Walt Disney films,
and Eduardo Ruiz, the lead guitarist for Desi Arnaz's band. They
also made inexpensive ukuleles for a client who owned a shop in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 they opened shops in El Paso and Los Angeles, eventually
making Los Angeles their headquarters. In 1955 Porfirio Delgado's
son Candelario _ called Candelitas, to distinguish him from his
uncle _ began working in the Los Angeles shop and Candelitas' son
Tomas joined the staff in 1990, followed by Manuel in 1995, the
year that Candelitas died.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado is survived by three daughters, Lupe, Herminia Hipolito
and Belia Marquez; a sister; 12 grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren, all of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Candelas guitars were favored by Hispanic musicians,
and the company has maintained its prominence in that part of the
field. When the company opened a new shop, in February, it gave a
party at which Los Lobos and Ozomatli were among the bands that
performed. Los Lobos' set at the party was apparently filmed by its
label, Hollywood Records.
</P>
<P>
   But the instruments were also taken up by folk singers like
Theodore Bikel, Burl Ives, Arlo Guthrie and the Kingston Trio, as
well as the country guitarist Hoyt Axton and crossover musicians
like Jose Feliciano and Charo.
</P>
<P>
   Candelas also made instruments for several classical guitarists,
among them Andres Segovia, Vicente Gomez and Pepe Romero.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudy Burckhardt, whose 60-year career as an artist
and a friend of artists connected several generations and disparate
aesthetic factions of the New York School, died on Sunday at his
home in Searsmont, Maine. He was 85 and also had a home in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of his New York dealer, the Tibor de Nagy
Gallery, said he committed suicide. The State of Maine Medical
Examiner's Office would confirm only that the death had been from
drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt was best known as a photographer and filmmaker whose
primary subject was the New York cityscape: its people,
architecture, fleeting detail and ceaseless vitality.
</P>
<P>
   He painted and wrote intermittently, publishing ``Mobile
Homes,'' a book of autobiographical essays, in 1979. The book's
title was an odd but fitting choice for a man who so long and so
quietly was a constant on the New York cultural scene _ the poet
John Ashbery once called him a ``subterranean monument'' _ and yet
moved easily between art forms and also collaborated with artists
of all denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt was a famously diffident man, elegant, slight and
soft-spoken with a habitual demeanor of quiet sadness. His career
unfolded in the background of the tumultuous rise of the New York
School, which was well known for its clashing egos.
</P>
<P>
   For many years his most visible profile was as a photographer
whose images of artists and their work were frequently featured in
ArtNews magazine, where he used the credit Rudolph Burckhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Even today he may be most familiar to many people interested in
American art as a name that constantly appears in other artists'
biographies: as the next-door neighbor of the young Willem de
Kooning, from whom he bought a few paintings in the late 1930s; as
a friend of Fairfield Porter, who was inspired by Burckhardt's
photographs to make paintings of New York City, and as companion
and then lifelong friend to the poet and dance critic Edwin Denby,
who wrote sonnets to accompany his photographs and who frequently
said he drew inspiration for both his poems and his writings on
dance from the movement in Burckhardt's films.
</P>
<P>
   As a mentor, with Denby, he influenced several generations of
artists, outstanding among them Alex Katz and Red Grooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Burckhardt's photographs of New York earned him a place
among the great street photographers of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   As with the work of Cartier-Bresson his images are widely
admired for their compositional poise and their ability to capture
fleeting moments of urban human life that revealed both everyday
beauty and its psychological mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   He approached films as if they were as easily made as
photographs, with a distinctive lightness of touch and a natural
grasp of the medium's different possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This understanding took him from travelogues, documentaries and
silent-type comedies to films structured by the sound of music or
poetry, from relatively straightforward narrative to fast-paced
collages of layered images.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his more than 90 films were 16-mm, under 30 minutes in
length, and since Burckhardt handled their entire production they
were relatively inexpensive to make. In many ways, Burckhardt's
approach to New York, on film, as a continuous, nearly
choreographic performance counts among the precedents for
happenings and other kinds of performance art.
</P>
<P>
   His collaborations and use of the work being made around him
were many. With Joseph Cornell he made ``What Mozart Saw on
Mulberry Street'' in 1956, and with Grooms, ``Shoot the Moon'' in
1962. He filmed such painters as Katz, Neil Welliver and Yvonne
Jacquette, whom he married in 1964 at work, and also filmed the
sculptor Charles Simonds making one of his miniature dwellings on
the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In other films he collaborated with poets of the New York School
like Ashbery, Ron Padgett and Kenneth Koch. The artists, friends
and family who over the years figured in his films included Virgil
Thomson, Grooms, Mimi Gross, Larry Rivers, Ms. Jacquette, Brooke
Alderson and Denby.
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt was born in 1914 in Basel, Switzerland, into a
well-to-do family that counted the 19th-century historian Jakob
Burckhardt among its members. He received a classical education
that included ``many years of Latin and Greek,'' he once said, and
began taking pictures while still a teen-ager, seeing the camera as
a way of exploring the world.
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York in 1935 with Denby, whom he had met in Basel
when Denby, sensing the implications of Hitler's rise in Germany,
was winding down his European career as a comic dancer. At first
the two shared a loft on West 21st Street, next door to de Kooning,
working their way through Burckhardt's $20,000 inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Burckhardt is survived by their son,
Tom; a son, Jacob, from his first marriage, to the painter Edith
Schloss; two sisters, Henriette Burckhardt and Esti Burckhardt,
both of Switzerland, and a brother, Lukas, also of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Initially intimidated by New York, Burckhardt did not begin to
photograph it seriously until 1938, after returning from a
nine-month stint in Haiti, where he made one of his first films. He
had his first exhibition of photographs at the Photoleague Gallery
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He took up painting in the 1940s, saying that he was finding
photography too fast. In his painting he concentrated on
cityscapes, and after he started to spend summers in Maine, he
painted landscapes that sometimes reflected Katz's influence.
</P>
<P>
   He exhibited his paintings for the first time at the Tanager
Gallery in 1948. His most recent exhibition was of Maine landscapes
at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery last spring. In 1987 the Museum of
Modern Art held a retrospective of his films.

PATAKI AND TOP LEGISLATORS PLAN $378 MILLION IN TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders on
Monday agreed to $378 million a year in new tax cuts as part of
this year's budget, including an expansion of the state's tax
credit for 1.1 million working poor adults, most of whom have
children.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the tax cut package is a $150 million-a-year
break for the banking and insurance industries, which were left out
of a package of business tax cuts passed last year. Those cuts are
almost certain since they are a top priority for Sen. Joseph L.
Bruno, the Republican majority leader, and for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts were the last remaining area of the $73 billion
budget to be worked out in detail. The Legislature is scheduled to
return here Tuesday to pass the bills enacting the budget, which by
law was due by April 1, the start of the 2000 fiscal year. If the
Senate and Assembly succeed in passing all the bills by midnight
Tuesday, the budget will have been passed 125 days late, one day
shy of the record set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $378 million in new tax cuts _ most of which
are small and focused on specific industries _ the budget will
reflect more than $1 billion in cuts that were enacted in 1997 and
1998 but are taking effect this year.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor and state officials say that the tax
credit for low-income families plays a significant role in an era
of welfare change. People leaving the welfare rolls who find work
usually get the kind of low-paying jobs that make them eligible for
the credit. Proponents say the credit, in turn, makes work more
attractive and makes it less likely that people will lapse back
into welfare dependency.
</P>
<P>
   But until Monday, it remained unclear whether the credit would
make the final tax package; even people close to the negotiations
were hard-pressed to explain the maneuvering involved. In the end,
the lawmakers agreed to increase the credit by 25 percent, a move
worth $125 million a year to low-income families, and not the 50
percent the advocates had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Democrats and advocates for the poor had called for
the expansion, but this year it was Bruno and the Senate
Republicans who took the lead on the issue. The assembly speaker,
Sheldon Silver, whose house had passed the expansion in the past,
declined to pass the Senate bill, frustrating some fellow
Democrats. Democrats contend that in the final negotiations, Pataki
was reluctant to expand the credit. But aides to the governor said
the problem was that Silver had raised procedural obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of nine states with such a tax credit, which is
modeled on a federal credit. With the expansion, the maximum state
credit will be worth $939 a year for a family with an income of
$10,000 and two or more children, up from $751.
</P>
<P>
   For families earning less than $14,000 a year, who pay no income
tax, the credit means that the state actually gives them money. For
those earning $14,000 to $30,000, it reduces their state tax bills.

PROSECUTOR ARGUES THAT PAROLE OFFICER LIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal prosecutor asserted Monday that a member of
the New York State Parole Board had lied to a grand jury to protect
Pataki administration officials and himself in an investigation of
possible corruption at the board.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments at the trial of the parole board member,
Sean McSherry, in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, the prosecutor,
Timothy Macht, said that McSherry should be convicted of perjury
and obstruction of justice because his ``smoke and mirrors''
testimony before the grand jury had impeded the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury sought to determine whether contributors to Gov.
George Pataki's 1994 election campaign had received or been
promised favorable parole rulings for their imprisoned relatives or
friends in exchange for their donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McSherry is not charged with improperly releasing
inmates,'' said Macht, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District of New York. ``He is charged with lying, and the truth
that he did that was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   McSherry, 47, is one of 17 members of the Parole Board, which
decides whether state prison inmates should be released before
serving their full sentences. His lawyer, Diarmuid White, said
McSherry had not lied to the grand jury when he testified before
the panel last August or to New York City police detectives who had
questioned him two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy _ McSherry _ who is not concealing anything,''
White said in his summation.
</P>
<P>
   He said the questioning by the detectives and the grand jury had
focused on a specific parole case involving John Kim, 24, who had
been convicted of three armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member Parole Board panel headed by McSherry voted in
1996 to free Kim on parole after he had served the minimum four
years of a four-to-12-year sentence. Kim's father, Nam Soo Kim, the
pastor of the Full Gospel Church in Queens, one of New York City's
largest Korean-American churches, had contributed $1,000 to the
1994 Pataki campaign, and others linked to him had contributed
several thousand dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   But White insisted to the jury that there had been no
relationship between the contributions and Kim's release, and
therefore no motive for McSherry to have lied to the detectives and
the grand jury. Nam Soo Kim has also said his contribution was not
connected to his son's parole.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Pataki and for the Parole Board have denied that
anyone received favors from the board in return for campaign
donations, and have maintained that the investigation is
politically motivated.

CITY COUNCIL'S RIPOSTE TO GIULIANI'S ARKANSAS FLAG MANEUVER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acting on its anger over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
raising of the Arkansas flag over City Hall last week, the City
Council has drafted legislation that would limit the display of
flags and other decorations at City Hall to matters of
``governmental purpose'' or for furthering ``the city's
interests,'' Council officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation does not define ``governmental purpose'' or
``the city's interests.'' So it is unclear whether the bill is
intended to prevent future flag disputes or is meant merely to
swipe at the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   If it came down to the mayor vetoing such a bill, a united
Democratic majority on the council could easily override him.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's administration declined Monday to comment on the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the mayor criticized the council as ``parochial and
close minded'' after some members complained when he ordered that
the Arkansas flag be flown at City Hall while he was on a
fund-raising trip to Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was also intended to tweak Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
potential Democratic rival for the U.S. Senate should both decide
to run next year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the flag was raised in New York to reciprocate for
the hospitality he received in Little Rock, where the New York City
flag was flying outside a hotel where he was to speak at a lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the City Council, including Speaker Peter F.
Vallone, accused the mayor of using a public government building
for a political stunt. They pointed out that the New York City flag
had been displayed in Little Rock at the Capital Hotel, across the
street from the state capitol, and not over the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the council, Bill Perkins, a Democrat from
Manhattan, said he was unsure that the draft legislation would
address his concern over the display of the Arkansas flag; what he
found offensive was a star on the flag that symbolizes the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the appropriate message that we want coming from our
buildings?'' he said Monday. ``Not only do we not want our public
buildings to be used as political campaign props, but do we really
feel it appropriate to wave flags from our buildings that embody in
them despicable ideas?''

LOUISIANA BOY DROWNS IN MOTEL POOL IN HOUSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A child who drowned in the pool at a Houston motel
Saturday has been identified as 5-year-old De-Ike Leon Holloman of
Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   Holloman's family was staying at the White House Motel in south
Houston, police said. The boy and other family members swam in the
pool about 10 a.m. Saturday. Afterward, police said De-Ike was told
to go back to the family's room.
</P>
<P>
   When the boy could not be found in the room later, police were
called. Because the water in the pool was so dirty, police said the
bottom of the pool could not be seen. The boy's body was not found
until 5:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The motel was cited Monday by city Health Department inspectors
for failure to maintain the pool, which apparently contained no
chlorine; for a faulty gate in the fence surrounding the pool; and
for not having a permit to operate a pool.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said other possible violations were noted during
their visit Monday, and the motel could face other citations.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The armed robber asked for everything _ but got
nothing after a restaurant manager thought he was ordering a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The foiled robber was still at large Monday after his visit to
Papa John's Pizza on Wilmington Ave., early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report: The man asked for a pen and slid a
note to the manager: ``I want it all or POW.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Nathan Ayres pointed to the large deluxe pizzas on the
wall menu and asked which one he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he wanted it all.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres read off the large-pizza options.
</P>
<P>
   The man, aggravated, said, ``I want it all _ your money _ or
POW!'' Then he patted his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   Finally aware it was a robbery attempt, Ayres pushed a silent
alarm. The man fled.
</P>
<P>
   One thing might help: the suspect told the manager he had a
speech impediment, according to the police report. Ayres later told
police the man talked as if he had a speech problem.
</P>
<P>
   After writing the note on a napkin and failing to communicate,
the suspect patted the waistband of his red shorts, concealed by a
yellow sport shirt. Ayres pushed the store's panic button.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect asked Ayres what he had done. After Ayres told him
several times ``nothing,'' the suspect walked behind the counter,
saw the panic button and ran from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres told police he saw the suspect enter the passenger door of
a car parked in front of a neighboring business. The car, driven by
another man, then left the parking lot.

 &HT;    COWBOYS NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   La starter
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got great competition at tight end,'' Coach Chan Gailey
said. Gailey, however, said Howard Clay and Mike Lucky will be
beaten out by last year's starter, David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur has been bothered by back and ankle injuries, but he is
expected to begin running pass routes by the end of the week. The
Cowboys believe the third-year player from LSU will be ready for
the season opener Sept. 12 at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin has proven that his sense of humor remains intact.
When a TV reporter started a question by saying, ``Michael, you're
only human,'' the outspoken wide receiver responded before the
visitor finished his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes?'' Irvin
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Safety net
</P>
<P>
   Veteran George Teague has opened a wide lead over his
challengers at free safety. The position was considered wide open
before camp, but Teague has outplayed Omar Stoutmire and Kenny
Wheaton over the last five days.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 player for the slot appears to be second-year pro
Izell Reese of Alabama-Birmingham. Reese has made more big plays
than Stoutmire and Wheaton since the vets reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Feel the heat
</P>
<P>
   The temperature has broken 100 degrees each day the Cowboys have
practiced, topped by Saturday's high of 108. Gailey, who once
coached in Georgia, said he spends much of his spare time watching
The Weather Channel on TV. He told reporters that the Cowboys
should catch a ``break'' this week, when temperatures are expected
to dip into the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled Rocket
</P>
<P>
   For reasons no one in Dallas can explain, newcomer Raghib
``Rocket'' Ismail has not granted interviews for his entire
football career. The seven-year pro apparently vowed to be silent
to the media when he was a star at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   When a TV reporter from Tulsa requested an interview with
Ismail, he was politely denied by the elusive receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Ismail said, ``but I appreciate you giving me the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said 25-30 positions have already been accounted for,
meaning about 23 are still available on the 53-man roster. . . .
Guard Mike Kiselak, hurt in practice last week, will learn today
whether he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, an
injury that would end his season. . . . Speaking of offensive
linemen, backup guard and center Earl Scott broke his foot and will
miss at least four weeks. . . . Randall Godfrey, who replaces
former Cowboy Fred Strickland at middle linebacker, has the size
and speed to be terrific at that position, Gailey said. . . .
Running back Emmitt Smith said the addition of Mark Stepnoski at
center and Flozell Adams at left tackle gives Dallas its best
offensive line in 10 years. . . . The Cowboys, who had a golf
outing Monday, practice at 8:45 a.m. and 4 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders told the Daily Oklahoman, ``That's why I was
having a remarkable year last year, because I got totally into
God's game and he totally got into mine. The football field is my
pulpit where I minister every Sunday to millions. The better I
play, the stronger my ministry is.''

LAWMAKERS URGE CASTRO TO VISIT SEATTLE DURING WTO MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dear Fidel Castro: Please come to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the invitation sent to the Cuban leader by Rep. Jim
McDermott, a majority of the Seattle City Council, and a minority
of the Metropolitan King County Council.
</P>
<P>
   The elected officials, undaunted by what Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright last week called ``growing concern about Cuba's
dismal human rights'' record, sent separate letters urging Castro
to attend the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle
beginning Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Castro needs a invitation from Seattle to
attend the meeting _ Cuba is an active member of the organization
attended a WTO meeting in Geneva last year.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott, unhappy that Castro had been snubbed by New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani when the Cuban leader attended a celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in New York in 1995,
wanted Castro to know he would be more welcome in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that our entire community would be eager to hear
from you, discuss with you, and probably debate with you about the
future of our relationship,'' McDermott, a Seattle Democrat, wrote
to Castro. ``You will be received respectfully, graciously and
warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott described himself in the letter as an opponent of the
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. McDermott also touted what he said
was Seattle's ``long history of involvement with Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was one of the most ardent supporters of the
Venceramos Brigades of the late 1960s and early 1970s,'' McDermott
wrote. ``In fact, several of Seattle's prominent political and
business leaders were Venceramos Brigade graduates or supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1970, a group of young Seattleites chartered a Greyhound bus
for Canada and then boarded a freighter for Cuba, where they spent
several months helping to harvest sugar cane. They returned
denouncing U.S. policy toward Cuba.)
</P>
<P>
   The members of the city and county councila wrote somewhat less
enthusiastic letters urging Castro to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the expectation that Cuba, as a founding and current member
of the World Trade Organization, will be sending a delegation to
Seattle ... we hope you will take this opportunity to personally
visit us,'' wrote five of the nine City Council members, including
President Sue Donaldson and members Nick Licata, Richard McIver,
Tina Podlodowski and Peter Steinbrueck. ``There is much that we
hope that you could learn from your visit to increase trade between
our region and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The County Council letter was signed by five of the 13 members,
all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should you decide to lead the Cuban delegation to this
historic event, we would be honored to have you visit with us,''
wrote council members Maggi Fimia, Larry Gossett, Greg Nickels,
Dwight Pelz and Larry Phillips. ``We think your visit here will be
a very educational and enriching experience, both for you and the
people who reside in communities throughout our region of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican county councilman, Peter von Reichbauer, said he
didn't sign the letter only because he wasn't asked, but that he
had no objection to its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be a strong believer in free trade, and I believe
that by inviting Fidel Castro to Seattle, we recognize he is the
leader of a nation in our regional sphere of influence as well as
internationally,'' von Reichbauer said. ``It would be shortsighted
not to invite him to participate in the WTO meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But two City Council members said they declined to sign the
letter because they oppose the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it's appropriate because of our (lack of)
diplomatic relations with him,'' said City Councilwoman Martha
Choe. ``I was embarrassed by the letter. I took one look at and
said, `I'm not signing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Conlin said it was inappropriate to single
out only one head of state to invite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel differently if he was a hero _ if it was Winston
Churchill after World War II,'' Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Licata said he signed as a courtesy to McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Trade Organization is open to a wide variety of
organizations, and inviting Castro would encourage a more fuller
discussion of the WTO's role,'' Licata said. ``And we might get
some business out of this. I'm concerned about improving trade
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Council on International Trade President Patricia
Davis said she believes it is up to President Clinton to decide
which world leaders to invite, because the WTO meeting is geared
for trade ministers. She said Seattle would welcome any world
leader who chose to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is so politically touchy that the United States Trade
Representative's office declined to comment on the letters to
Castro. State Department officials were not immediately available
for comment last night, and a spokesman at the Cuban government's
interest section in Washington, D.C., said he did not know whether
Castro would attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state is heavily dependent on exports, and industries
such as aerospace and agriculture have chafed under the strictures
of the United States' many economic sanctions against other
countries. The state's pea and lentil growers in particular have
mourned the loss of Cuba as a trading partner, because it had been
the largest importer of those commodities in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Castro took power in Cuba on Jan. 1, 1959, and, according to the
State Department, consolidated his power by imprisoning or
executing opponents. Castro declared Cuba a socialist state in
1961, and maintained close relations with the Soviet Union until
its demise in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says the Cuban government's human rights
record is ``abysmal'' and that ``it systematically violates
fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. The United
States has maintained an economic embargo against Cuba since 1962.

<P>
   The sales pitch promises an ``intense and unforgettable''
paradise vacation in Mexico, but some students found themselves
stranded at airports, packed like sardines into crummy motel rooms
and paying big bucks for drinks and meals they thought would be
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected a safe trip with everything planned out so I could
really get an experience that was safe and still fun,'' said Renee
Crow, 24, of Bothell, Wash., who paid $600 to a Phoenix company,
College Tours, for seven days of Mazatlan myrth.
</P>
<P>
   Crow's flight left Seattle 17 hours late. She was among six
people told to share a motel room meant for two. The room was
flooded with water from the toilet. And the ``organized events''
promised by the company, turned out to be little more than amateur
peep shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the organized activites they had really revolved
around women's chests,'' said Crow, who said she ended up spending
an extra $300 to eat and get around the city during her weeklong
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories such as Crow's are packed into a thick file at
U.S. District Court in Phoenix. The court papers, put together by
the Federal Trade Commission, ask a judge to find College Tours
guilty of deception in its advertising of tours to Mazatlan and
Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   College Tours, which caters to coeds on spring break, and
Student Tours, which pitches to graduating high-school seniors, are
run by Cerkvenik-Anderson Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Anderson, chief executive officer of Cerkvenik-Anderson
Travel, refused comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Attorney General's Office filed its case against the
travel agency in July, saying the company violated the consumer
fraud act and asking for $100,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC action is one of 47 cases in Operation Trip Trap, a law
enforcement operation that will be trumpeted today in Washington,
D.C. Authorities will describe their efforts against 25 tour
companies it has charged with misrepesentation.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the Phoenix travel agency has its roots in the
Pacfic Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration started
investigating a charter flight from Portland to Mazatlan, booked by
Student Tours, that featured a wet T-shirt contest judged by the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Walker, 18, told the details of the trip to her mother,
Vicki, who is a representative in the Oregon Legislature. Another
person the tour took a videotape of the contest, which ended up on
tabloid television.
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Samter, an attorney with the FTC in Seattle, said that
complaint was the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students are basically thrown into Mexico without very
much supervision or help,'' Samter said.
</P>
<P>
   Students' sworn testimony in court documents contrasts with the
tour company's advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancun's accommodations range from budget off-the-beach
properties to six-star `mega'-resorts that offer luxury beyond
imagination,'' reads an ad on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no running water,'' said Alicia Peters of Pownal, Vt.,
who paid $760 for a week in Cancun. ``We had to ask strangers in
the hotel to use their bathroom to shower and brush our teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel was extremely dirty and infested with bugs
everywhere,'' said Rebecca Nyberg of Grand Forkes, N.D., who paid
$673 for her Cancun experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that I had paid for a four-person room in a
nice resort, I was forced to sleep on the floor of a dingy room
with 10 people in it,'' said Joe Hall, 17, of Eugene, Ore., who
paid $596 for his Mazatlan trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Wise of Sprinfield, Penn., paid $716 to reserve the Cancun
Palace, a six-star hotel. It was overbooked and she was moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front room at the new hotel that I was placed in had no
front door, broken glass on the floor, no deck door, no shower, no
bed linens and the air-conditioning didn't work,'' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads promised students ``(p)rivate Spring Break fiestas at
Cancun's most popular night spots. . .FREE drink parties every
night (and) College Tours EXCLUSIVE dance parties at some of the
best clubs in the world!''
</P>
<P>
   ``College Tours never told us where or when the events were,''
said Lisa Hoopes, of Winona, Minn. ``We do not even know whether
they were ever held.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Website promises a ``(s)pecial orientation session
for optional activities _ snorkeling, party boat, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Student Tours orientation consisted of a staff member
saying, `Drink as much as you can and you'll have a great time,' ''
Wise said in her deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mazatlan does not disappoint any spring breaker!'' the Website
exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known before I signed up what a miserable trip I was to
experience, I never would have gone,'' said Rusty Brown of Bryan,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they asked for refunds but were denied.
Some said staff members cursed at them.
</P>
<P>
   Crow, the student from Washington state, said the company didn't
respond to her letters or phone calls until she sent her story to
the Arizona Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy called me up and cussed at me,'' Crow said, ``yelling
at me, saying I was causing trouble . . . (and) I was being stupid
and shouldn't even be asking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The state action asks the travel agency to reimburse its
victims, but Crow said that doesn't matter to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any money,'' she said. ``What I want is for my
little sister to be able to go on the trip to Mazatlan and be safe
and get what they said they're going to give her.'' &QL;

PETTITTE AND JETER LIFT YANKS OVER JAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The burden of the unknown was finally lifted one
minute past midnight on Sunday morning. Andy Pettitte was not
traded, even though the Yankees had seriously discussed it by
having conversations with 10 teams. But Pettitte was spared from
being relocated, with the Yankees clinging to the hope that he can
resurrect himself and be an influential factor this season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pettitte's revival started Monday night. Pettitte looked
relaxed and pitched that way while matching Toronto's David Wells
on a warm and entertaining evening at Yankee Stadium. Perhaps there
were more reasons for Pettitte to be calm now that his address does
not seem as if it will change in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre spoke almost pleadingly about needing to see
something substantial from Pettitte Monday night. Torre meant that
Pettitte should employ a smart game plan against the Blue Jays, he
should stay with it and he should stay composed for three hours.
Pettitte finally did everything Torre and the Yankees have waited
so long to see in a 3-1 victory at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter ended an 0-for-17 drought in style when he smacked a
two-run home run off Wells in the eighth inning that broke a 1-1
tie and catapulted Pettitte and the Yankees. Jeter's career-high
20th homer exceeded his total from 1998 by one and insured Pettitte
of being able to totally enjoy a night when he was as dominant as
he has been all season.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed one run and six hits while striking out three
and walking none in eight durable innings, but the way he stifled
the Jays was as impressive as the statistics. Using a sinker and a
cut fastball, Pettitte kept the Jays mired in the infield by
registering 19 of the 24 outs on infield popouts or groundouts. The
others were on one fly ball, one player caught stealing and the
three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pettitte's longest start and probably his best start of a
trying season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tortured through this whole thing,'' Torre said. ``He's
trying to get it back on track. Hopefully, with the trade deadline
past, he can start thinking about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who did not receive the same rousing ovation he did when
he made his first appearance at the Stadium on April 23, allowed a
bloop double to Joe Girardi to start the eighth. The Jays argued
that left fielder Shannon Stewart caught the ball, but it clearly
bounced in front of him. After Chuck Knoblauch bunted Girardi to
third, Jeter slammed a 1-2 pitch into the left field seats to put
the Yankees ahead, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The only inning when Pettitte encountered trouble was the fifth
when two singles and a fielder's choice put runners on first and
third. Jacob Brumfield, a .239 hitter, slapped a single past a
diving Knoblauch behind second to even the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays still had runners on first and third, and the Pettitte
of 1999 has wilted in such situations. This time, Pettitte soared.
He induced Mike Matheny to hit a dribbler in front of the plate and
struck out Homer Bush on three pitches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Wells tried to float a pitch over on the
outside corner and Chili Davis reached out and flicked it down the
left-field line for his 15th homer. The ball barely scaled the
fence and was fair by about 10 feet to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Davis went deep because it gave him
seven homers in 68 career at-bats off Wells. Davis, a patient
hitter, also continued to be the premier hitter in the major
leagues when he swings at the first pitch; in one of those quirky
and unexplainable statistics, Davis is 31 for 60 when he belts the
first pitch.

 &HT;    Pesticide ban may be costly
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A pesticide sprayed on 81 percent of Georgia peaches
has become the latest chemical banned by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A county Extension Service agent in Georgia's top
peach-producing region said Monday that alternative pesticides cost
three times more and will drive up Georgia peach prices.
</P>
<P>
   The methyl parathion ban came Monday, three years after the 1996
Food Quality Protection Act required the EPA to reassess safety
levels for hundreds of commonly used pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Also banned is azinphos-methyl, an insecticide used on 11
percent of the apples grown in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Some pesticides under scrutiny have been suspected of causing
nervous system damage, especially in young children.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Collier, Peach County Extension Service coordinator,
said Monday the micro-encapsulated form of methyl parathion used by
Georgia peach growers is not harmful to humans _ and is affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other insecticides, like Imidan and synthetic pyrethroids,
cost three times what the methyl parathion does,'' Collier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no scientific data on danger to humans when it's
used the way we use it, and the fruit are washed and scrubbed
before going to market,'' he said. ``We have found pesticide
residues so low that they are hardly measurable, and they're well
inside legal tolerances for a child.''
</P>
<P>
   The methyl parathion ban _ which comes after the 1999 peach crop
is in _ will hit Southern growers more than their counterparts in
California, Collier said. The pest that attacks South Carolina and
Georgia peaches, the plum curculio weevil, is not a problem out
West, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cessation date for using methyl parathion hasn't been
issued. Details of the restrictions remain scant while EPA
officials negotiate with the pesticide makers and industry.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said, however, that methyl parathion would be
banned from use on all fruit and many vegetables. Growers probably
will be required to use smaller amounts of azinphos-methyl.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial aspect of the food quality law requires the EPA
to come down hard on substances when it has incomplete scientific
data about their effects _ allowing it to err on the side of
safety. When unsure, the EPA uses an additional margin of error of
10 times the current limit for cumulative exposures.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say this year's crop of produce that has
been sprayed with the chemicals is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to worry about,'' said Allen Jennings, director
of the Agriculture Department's office of pest management policy.
``I still plan on feeding my kids as many as they will eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's peach production in 1997 was 160 million pounds from
20,000 acres of trees at a value of $35.2 million, the state's
agriculture Web site states.

ETHNIC ALBANIAN REFUGEES FIND MIXED FORTUNES IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They fled the rubble of Kosovo, eluding Yugoslav soldiers for
months before crowding into camps in Macedonia with leaky tents and
meager rations. They did not let themselves hope for something
better until May 21, the day they stepped off the last plane
carrying refugees to Fort Dix, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did the Salihi and Hajra families begin reclaiming
their lives within the safety of the converted military base,
reveling in heaping meals and the kindness of an army of
volunteers. They were among the 4,000 refugees given shelter until
they could be placed with sponsors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But a month after moving to Jersey City, N.J., Sylejman Salihi
talks about taking his wife and three teen-agers back to Kosovo
because they are barely surviving. He says he cannot buy enough
food on the family's $125 weekly allowance. They initially shared
an apartment with another refugee family, squeezing 11 people into
three bedrooms. When they could not stand that anymore, Salihi and
his wife moved to a room in still another family's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Salihis' sponsor, Catholic Community Services in Newark,
N.J., said the situation was temporary while the staff looked for a
permanent home for the family and a job for Salihi. The agency said
it also helped the family by bringing it canned and frozen foods.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Safet Hajra envisions a future in the United States
for his wife, a baby, two brothers and two nieces in a three-level
house in Trenton, N.J. Their sponsor, Lutheran Social Ministries of
New Jersey, stocked the cabinets with staples like flour and canned
beans and gave the family $900 for the month. Last week, the Hajras
spent $500 of that _ on Marlboro cigarettes, chocolate cookies and
other small luxuries _ or the same amount the Salihi family
received for the whole month.
</P>
<P>
   The two ethnic Albanian families illustrate the mixed fortunes
of the Kosovo refugees since leaving Fort Dix. Some, like the
Salihis, have slipped quietly into desperation, while others like
the Hajras have embraced new comforts. But many of the two dozen
refugees interviewed in the New York area expressed frustration
that they still had so little control over their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees cannot speak English and must depend on their
sponsors for food, doctors' visits and even the latest news about
Kosovo. ``I'm not asking for something really nice _ just something
where we can have a normal life,'' Salihi said through an
interpreter. ``We want to rely on ourselves. We feel like we're not
being treated as people here but as property.''
</P>
<P>
   For the two Kosovo families who came over on the same plane, the
resettlement process has led to what seems like different worlds.
For the Hajra family, it is the beginning of a new life, but for
the Salihis, it has become a painful decision about their future.
They can now apply to return to Kosovo through a federally financed
program, but they have not done so.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hajras' house, tall glasses of Coca-Cola and a plate of
fancy chocolate-dipped cookies sit on a worn coffee table. Hajra,
23, bought the treats for the children. ``You buy things and then
you realize how much you spend,'' he said. ``Whatever it lasts, it
lasts. I'm a little worried, but I feel the agency is going to come
through for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's caseworker checks on them daily and often drives
them to the supermarket or to the hospital to visit Hajra's
brother, who has tuberculosis. The Lutheran group has sponsored 71
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war in Kosovo, Hajra's job was to refill propane
lighters in a factory in Ferizaj. Now he wants to learn English so
he can find a better job in New Jersey. ``I like it here,'' he
said. ``I always wanted to visit America and this is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jersey City, the Salihis sit on mismatched chairs and plastic
milk crates in the back yard. They pass around photos showing
better days _ family dinners in their modern house in Stimlje and
the Salihi children with armfuls of fruit at Fort Dix. Salihi, 49,
was an electrician at what he called the ``second-largest factory
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Salihis are one of four refugee families squeezed into a
row of three beige, shingled town houses along an industrial strip
near the Holland Tunnel. The families say that their caseworker
comes once a week with an Albanian-speaking translator but that
much of the time they see no one from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Lonegro, who oversees the resettlement program for
Catholic Community Services, said that staff members or assistants
checked on the families daily. She said the agency was also
providing services to 71 Kosovo refugees, in Jersey City, Elizabeth
and Belleville.

EDITORIAL: ACCOUNTABILITY IN SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-year-old girl was killed last year by a falling brick
at a school construction site in Brooklyn, investigators declared
that the agency in charge of school building, the School
Construction Authority, had grown ``numb to mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediocrity is in some ways an improvement over the years when
school construction in New York City was an even more dangerous and
deeply corrupt enterprise. But despite reforms in 1988, the system
suffers from a chronic lack of accountability. City schools for 1.1
million students are built by a faulty, politically charged
bureaucracy that prefers finger-pointing when things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As cataloged recently in The New York Times, bureaucratic
tangles have resulted in a long list of alarming and merely
infuriating abuses. One former inspector general described the
harrowing process of building city schools as ``an airplane flying
very fast and being built while it flew.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems range from clerks who barely check the
qualifications of contractors to a haphazard planning system at the
Board of Education that schedules projects so badly that $500
million in work went out for bid in two overloaded months.
</P>
<P>
   Milo Riverso, who took over as president of the authority in
January 1998, has made some progress, although there are fears that
once he departs, the agency could sink back into its bad old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Construction Authority spends much of its time
battling with the city's Board of Education over plans for schools
and the schedules for building and renovation. The authority also
answers to three trustees who are appointed by the New York City
schools chancellor, the mayor and the governor.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation of the authority begun by Gov. George Pataki
should focus on ways to give the system accountability, shift
children away from construction sites and force better and
longer-range planning for building and renovating schools. If these
investigators find more safety problems or shabby construction,
they will simply be plowing old ground. More useful would be
proposals for ways to renovate the management of a flawed system.

EDITORIAL: AN ELUSIVE PEACE IN CONGO

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Civil war has torn the giant African nation of Congo for a year.
The fighting, which erupted shortly after the insurrection that
toppled the country's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, has
endangered Congo's people, blocked the revival of its economy and
effectively partitioned its territory between government- and
rebel-controlled areas. It has also divided much of Africa, with
five nearby nations militarily backing one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   An end to the fighting may now be possible. But to achieve it,
Rwanda and Uganda must press their rebel clients to sign a pending
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   All five nations _ Rwanda and Uganda backing the rebels, and
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supporting the Congolese government _
have signed an agreement that could lead to a cease-fire,
withdrawal of foreign troops and an eventual political settlement.
The accord would broaden the base of Congo's government by bringing
in opposition groups now excluded under the authoritarian rule of
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   One important Congolese rebel group accepted the peace plan on
Sunday. But the fighting continues because the other main rebel
group, divided between two factions supported respectively by
Rwanda and Uganda, refuses to sign. These two countries must bring
their holdout rebel clients into line.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda have backed the rebels to force the disarming
of the Hutu militias that found sanctuary in the eastern Congo
after the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Since then these militias have
staged deadly raids into the territory of both neighboring
countries. The tentative peace agreement signed by the Congolese
government and the five intervening neighbors last month calls for
disarming these Hutu militias, though it is not yet clear how this
will be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The war continues because of a disagreement between the leaders
of the Rwandan-backed and Ugandan-backed rebel factions over who
should be allowed to sign the peace agreement. By allowing this
factional bickering to prevent a rebel signature, Rwanda and Uganda
look as if they are trying to have it both ways, continuing to
exert military pressure against the Hutu militias without
themselves appearing to be an obstacle to peace. That would be a
costly deception played out at the expense of Congo's people.

EDITORIAL: RISKING NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   An irreconcilable tension seems to govern human attitudes toward
nature. We think of it both as an innocent refuge from the
corruption of human society and as the savage condition from which
civilization is an escape. These views have always orbited each
other, like twin stars, and they are reflected in most periods and
at every level of our culture, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Walt
Disney and Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Each view, in itself, is at best a half-truth, at worst a total
delusion, but each view also made a certain emotional sense when
humans lived in closer proximity to nature than most of us do now.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it scarcely matters whether you think the natural
world is benign or malevolent, as long as you also know that when
you enter it you take a more direct and intimate responsibility for
your personal safety than you ever do on the streets of the modern
world.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts are prompted by the disaster last week near
Interlaken, Switzerland, where 19 people ``canyoning'' down a
mountain brook were swept to their deaths by a flash flood caused
by a thunderstorm upstream. What makes these deaths especially
troubling is the fact that the flood that overtook them was a
predictable event, and that the people who died were being led by
paid guides, several of whom also lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism was immediately leveled at the growing popularity of
extreme sports, like canyoning, ice climbing, rafting and
paragliding, and at the pitch of boredom that apparently causes
young people _ people of all ages, in fact _ to risk their lives at
those sports.
</P>
<P>
   Those criticisms are nonsense. Trouble arises not when you
decide to risk your life in one extreme sport or another but when
you do not know that that is what you are doing _ when, in other
words, you let someone else risk your life for you.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is not extreme sports or nature itself. The danger is
our anesthetized, Disneyfied view of nature as a place where the
conventions of urban life still apply, where the burden of
self-preservation, at its most basic level, can be handed off to
the authorities, to a guide or counselor or instructor.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to teach modern, city-dwelling humans how to take a
safe walk in the woods, much less go canyoning down a mountain
stream. But one reason humans seek out nature, even at its
extremes, is that there, still, self-reliance matters. The risk is
acceptable, but only if the risk is really known.

PLAN IS SET FOR OVERHAUL OF SPECIAL ED IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature have
reached an agreement to overhaul the state's special education
program, seeking to prevent schools from engaging in the
much-maligned practice of placing disabled students in segregated
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The state's special education program has come under repeated
attacks for consigning far too many disabled children, a
disproportionate number of them black and Hispanic boys, into
separate classrooms with no prospect of getting out.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was announced Monday, was in large part spurred
by a threat from the federal government to cut off roughly $335
million in aid if the state did not end what critics have long
described as the program's discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would provide additional financial resources to
districts that want to remove children from special education and
place them in regular classrooms, where the extra funds would be
used to provide tutors, therapists and other support.
</P>
<P>
   It would take effect in the fall of 2000. Almost 400,000
students statewide are in the special education program, including
84,000 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes more than a month after negotiators for
the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly
reached a far-reaching deal to avoid sanctions from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pataki said the plan would help eliminate abuses
in the current system and prevent penalties from being imposed by
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement protects $335 million in federal funds for the
education of disabled children,'' he said, ``while taking important
steps to avert inappropriate referrals to special education and
encourage the placement of children to regular, integrated
classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal still requires the approval of state education
officials, who in turn must notify the federal government that the
state has taken actions to avert penalties. Christopher Carpenter,
a spokesman for the State Education Department, said the department
could not comment on the plan because it had not had the
opportunity to review the details.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, school districts receive additional
state aid for each child placed in special education, but critics
say the additional money has led educators to identify disabilities
in children who are simply troubled or underachieving to glean
extra funds.

MCCAIN HOPE VETERANS GO
 WITH HIM ON FINAL MISSION
 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In a state with more than 400,000 veterans,
it's no accident that Sen. John McCain sounds like a general trying
to rally the troops in his bid to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the veterans in this audience to go with me on one last
mission,'' McCain said during an appearance at a restaurant
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategists are hoping their candidate, with his military
back ground and foreign policy message, can overtake Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in South Carolina, setting the stage for a
competitive Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign will rise or fall in the state of South
Carolina,'' Mc Cain said. He called the state's Feb. 19 primary
``the gateway to the Republican nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding on a bus, McCain criss crossed South Carolina over the
weekend and spoke to scores of veterans, who admire McCain's serv
ice as a Navy pilot and Vietnam POW, as well as his reputation for
plain talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him because he served the country, which is more than
some people did,'' said Dexter Lee, a 75-year-old Marine Corps
veteran who fought on Okinawa during World War II. ``He's
definitely not a draft dodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he stands for a lot of the things we stand for. He
believes in defending this country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's South Carolina push is part of a calculated strategy.
The state's position on the primary calen dar _ after New Hampshire
and before Arizona and California _ makes it a critical jumping-off
point for McCain, who trails Bush by a large margin, in
fund-raising and in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Though South Carolina is a rela tively small state, it's the
first Southern primary and could be a bellwether for the rest of
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is partly driven by the calendar, said John Weaver,
Mc Cain's national political director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, and more importantly, Senator McCain's message
resonates here in South Carolina, with its military history and
large veteran population,'' Weaver said. ``It's a natural fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said South Carolina will play the pivotal role in
McCain's cam paign, and that's by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've chosen ground better suited for our campaign,'' Weaver
said. ``It's kind of like a military opera tion. Why would we
choose unfavor able territory?''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, South Carolina is tailor-made for candidates
watching their budgets. The state has a rela tively small media
market, so it can be swayed by grass-roots campaign ing. Expensive
media buys aren't as crucial here as they are in states with large
populations, such as California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is skipping the Aug. 14 straw poll in Iowa, saying such
events are a waste of resources. Eventually, he'll have to
determine how much time and money to spend on Iowa's caucus Feb. 7,
the first step in the Republican selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have X amount of money and X amount of time,'' McCain said.
``We have to make a decision in September or October.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush has raised about $40 million, he hasn't totally
dried up the GOP fund-raising well. In cluding matching funds,
McCain has raised about $8.1 million and has about $5 million
available to spend.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, McCain played the vet card all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One of his stops was an American Legion Post in Pickens, a
small, rural county known for having more Medal of Honor winners
per capita than any county in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a tiny, metal-sided build ing that lacked
air-conditioning, Mc Cain said the nation must provide health care
for its World War II veterans, as well as restructure the military
and get 11,000 enlisted personnel off food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   It was standing room only, and despite a record heat wave, many
crowded outside the doors to hear McCain's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Former Navy Seabee Tom Smith stood in the shade and talked about
why he supports McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a vet, beyond that . . . he shoots pretty straight
from what I've seen so far,'' said Smith, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he likes McCain's vow to rebuild the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the military is weaker today than it was,''
Smith said. ``I think they're really getting stretched pretty thin.
They're going from one hot spot to another and not getting much
down time.''
</P>
<P>
   At a stop in Anderson, McCain ran into Bill Bailey, 56, a fellow
POW who was shot down over North Vietnam a few months before Mc
Cain, in 1967. Bailey said he saw McCain dragged into the prison
camp, wearing a body cast because of an injured arm and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fellow in a world of hurt,'' said Bailey, a high
school administrator from Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, McCain has Bai ley's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man of integrity and hon esty,'' Bailey said after
greeting McCain outside the campaign bus. ``I think he's the best
man qualified to run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bus tour, dubbed the ``Straight Talk Express,'' got off
to a sputtering start, with McCain stuck in Washington voting on a
tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   At the kickoff celebration Thursday, McCain appeared live via
satellite, popping up on televisions placed around a sweltering
parking lot. A three-piece band _ tuba, trumpet and guitar _ played
a lazy tune in the stifling air.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, about 100 people showed up, cheering short
speeches by McCain and his top South Carolina backers, Reps.
Lindsey Gra ham and Mark Sanford, as well as a live presentation by
McCain's wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   The heat dogged the campaign throughout the weekend. Several
people were overcome during events, some of which were held in
swelter ing meeting halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the White House is paved with a lot of sweat, I
guess,'' joked Graham, well-known for his role during the Clinton
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning in Aiken, Cindy McCain carried the ball as the
candidate spoke to the crowd via a telephone hookup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, my husband looks like a telephone,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's people are serious about winning South Carolina.
They have hired Richard Quinn, a top political consultant who
helped Ron ald Reagan to an upset primary win in South Carolina in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn thinks he can sell McCain in the Palmetto State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like mavericks down here,'' Quinn said. ``We like rebels,
espe cially rebels with a cause, which John McCain is.''

UKRAINIAN FREIGHTER STRANDED IN NEW YORK HARBOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For three and a half months, a Ukrainian freighter
has been stranded in New York Harbor, her cargo holds and fuel
tanks empty, her master awaiting orders, her 26-member crew idle
and recently unpaid, food and supplies dwindling _ a ship dead in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Riding at anchor in Gravesend Bay off Brooklyn, a mile southeast
of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the 458-foot merchantman, Banner
of October, has repeatedly requested supplies from its owner's
American representative but has received inadequate stores of food,
water and medicine, and no shipping orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to owners, please, please, people like eating,'' the
master, Capt. Aleksandr Golub, 62, said of his requests in a
shipboard interview Monday night. A seamen's welfare organization,
alerted earlier by the Coast Guard to the ship's plight, had
brought aboard an emergency two-day supply of chicken, beef, fruits
and vegetables for the crew of 23 men and 3 women, all Ukranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' said Valery Ignatov, the seafarers' union
representative, when asked about conditions aboard the
weather-beaten black and red freighter, which had carried used cars
and trucks from New York and Miami to the Dominican Republic and
Haiti in recent years. ``No food. No water. No oil. Pay late.''
</P>
<P>
   Golub attributed the problems of his ship to the financial
troubles of its owner, the state-run Azov Shipping Co., of
Mariupol, Ukraine. He also attributed the suicide of his
predecessor as ship's master to depression over company turmoil
that had left the crew unpaid for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, which went aboard for a routine inspection on
Saturday and found provisions running out, had known of the ship
since Jan. 13, when Capt. Ivan Kozlov, the master, was found hanged
in his stateroom, off Sandy Hook, N.J., touching off an FBI
investigation that found no foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Stevenson, a lawyer for the Seamen's Church Institute
and its affiliated Center for Seafarers' Rights, nonprofit
organizations that have long sought to protect the welfare of
seafarers, went aboard Monday night to meet with the crew and said
afterward that the Banner of October was only one of a half-dozen
Azov ships that are stranded around the world, off Europe, Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He said the crews of those and many other ships had been
stranded in recent years, caught in the backwash of economic
turmoil in Ukraine, Russia and other former Soviet states, as well
as Third-World countries whose troubled economies have affected
shipping. The Coast Guard said that Azov Shipping is represented in
the United States by Azov Shipping International, based in
Secaucus, N.J. Golub identified the company's local representative
as Capt. Vladimir Shamshin, who could not be reached at the
company's offices Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's last voyage from the Caribbean ended in New York on
April 13, the captain said. Since then, he said, there have been no
more shipments and no further orders. Various requests for supplies
were made over the last three and a half months.
</P>
<P>
   One shipment _ a 22-day supply of food _ was received on July 1,
and the captain said the crew had made it last until now,
stretching it out over more than 30 days. The last pay was received
in June, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no freon, he said, for air-conditioning, and the
crew had to swelter though July's record-setting heat without
coolants. Most remained below deck during the day to escape the
heat, and slept on deck at night to catch a breeze. The crew
continued to maintain the ship, which the Coast Guard found to be
well kept in its inspections, one last spring and another on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things checked out OK, except we were concerned about the
amount of food they had on board,'' John Hillin, a civilian who is
the Coast Guard's official in charge of foreign vessels in the
port.
</P>
<P>
   He and Mr. Stevenson said the Ukrainian consul in New York had
been notified and had pledged to contact Azov officials and try to
resolve problems by getting funds to purchase supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Golub said that Shamshin, the Azov official in Secaucus, had
told him that the ship would be reprovisioned on Friday at a dock
in Red Hook, Brooklyn, but he also noted that arrangements to pick
up a cargo in the port Tuesday had fallen through and that no new
cargos had been lined up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All contracts are canceled, and they're just sitting there and
don't know what to do,'' Andreas Krenz, a port chaplain for the
Seamen's Church Institute, said after helping to deliver emergency
supplies of food and water to the ship Monday. ``The fridge is
actually empty, and they have just a little butter left and a
couple of pieces of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew had not been ashore since the ship arrived in New York
Harbor three and a half months ago, the master said. Most of its
members seemed Monday night to be glumly resigned to their becalmed
situation.  &QL;

   SEATTLE _ After grinding its way to the forefront of a
world-wide coffee renaissance, Starbucks is offering coffee
drinkers a way to escape the dark side of their habit. And we're
not talking dark roast here.
</P>
<P>
   For years, controversy has been percolating over some coffee
growers' practice of denuding tropical rainforests to establish
higher-yielding coffee plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, coffee drinkers will be offered a
limited-edition Starbucks product _ the company's first guaranteed
to be grown in the shade of rainforest plants.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.95-a-pound price is at the high end of Starbuck's wares,
and may be tough for many consumers to swallow, but the company
appears intent on sweetening its environmental image after
activists for eco-friendly coffee leaned on Starbucks to change its
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks announced the availability of the coffee yesterday.
Quicker than you can order a double non-fat latte with almond,
environmentalists and smaller coffee companies that pioneered the
forest-grown market voiced qualified support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing about Starbucks putting their toe in the
water is that it sends a signal to all the other companies,'' said
Danny O'Keefe, a Vashon Island, Wash., activist and songwriter who
promotes forest-grown coffee. ``If they pull that toe out, it tells
the other companies that they don't need to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States consumes a third of the world's coffee.
Starbucks, with more than 2,200 stores, serves 9 million customers
a week.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the world, coffee was traditionally grown in
the rainforest. Around 1970, producers in Central and South America
discovered that hybrid coffees could be grown faster and more
abundantly in the sun. They began to clear the rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the U.S. government spent some $80 million in
foreign aid to help them, said O'Keefe. The U.S. government was
trying to help Latin coffee growers profit, but the move sparked a
boom in supply that ultimately depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The sun-grown coffee leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of
environmentalists for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clear-cutting the rainforests contributes to an unstable global
climate, eradicates shelter for birds and wildlife and contributes
to erosion and silting of water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the species affected by the rainforest destruction are
migratory birds that winter in the tropics and serenade North
Americans in the summer, including warblers, vireos and orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, biologists recorded drops in the numbers of these
birds that sometimes reached 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Growing coffee in the rainforest does not leave nature
completely unscathed. Low-growing vegetation is still cleared to
make way for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these coffee forests are more eco-friendly than clear-cut
plantations. For example, while you might find a dozen kinds of
birds on a clear-cut plantation, up to 136 types of birds can live
in a forest where coffee is grown, compared to about 400 species in
virgin rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world's coffee is grown in the shade. But Starbucks'
limited-edition Mexican brand is grown by several hundred farmers
in a Chiapas cooperative whose produce has been certified as
shade-grown by Conservation International, an environmental group
that helped convince Starbucks to begin offering certified
shade-grown coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 100 percent of the coffee is shade-grown, so we
can offer it as that,'' said Mary Williams, Starbucks senior vice
president for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   So how's the coffee?
</P>
<P>
   Williams, offering sips to reporters yesterday at Starbucks
headquarters near downtown Seattle, spoke as if she were a wine
steward, saying the brew offers hints of citrus and caramel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a light, bright coffee,'' Williams said. ``I think it
would be a great coffee iced.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffee will only be available for a limited time, perhaps a
month or two. Next year, the company expects to have more. The
current order of 37,500 pounds of unroasted coffee is expected to
last about one month in 1,900 Starbucks stores.
</P>
<P>
   It is grown in areas bordering the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve,
a last stand for rare animals such as the jaguar and colorful
tropical birds. The area is one of 25 ``hot spots'' identifed by
Conservation International that, combined, are home to more than
half the world's known plant and animal types.
</P>
<P>
   Other forest-grown coffees been available for several years, but
the idea is growing more popular with consumers. That's one reason
Starbucks sought out the forest-grown coffee, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Before Starbucks' announcement, shade-grown coffee ``was sort of
a fringe issue, and this sort of mainstreams it,'' said California
coffee importer David Griswold, chairman of the environmental
committee of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. ``It
wasn't that long ago that (Starbucks) mentioned all the reasons
they couldn't go down this route.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of Starbucks, said the company has had trouble finding
large volumes of certified, forest-grown coffee good enough to be
called Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Some who pioneered forest-grown coffee question that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Starbucks and we thank them,'' said Paul Katzeff,
chief executive officer of Thanksgiving Coffee Company, which
offers a shade-tree brand called Songbird Coffee. ``But at the same
time, we remind (people) that shade-grown, environmentally
responsible coffee has been available to them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe said he dreams of a day when the United States spends
millions setting up a program to certify forest-grown coffees so
consumers know what they're buying. Someday, he says, maybe even
Folger's and Maxwell House will go forest-grown.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, though, it's important that Starbucks not ask
consumers to fork over too many beans for their forest-grown
coffee, says Griswold, the California importer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they allow consumers to vote with their dollars without
making it too painful,'' he said.

STUDIOS PROFIT FROM THEATERS' AIR CONDITIONING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The heat is on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides blessing Julia Roberts, George Lucas, Mike Myers and a
200-year-old witch, Hollywood studios should also thank the
nation's horrifically hot weather for their sizzling performance
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has become the biggest beneficiary of the monthlong,
triple-digit heat wave that has gripped most of the nation outside
of the West Coast. Industry analysts say there's more than a little
coincidence that ticket sales set box office records the last two
weekends while hot weather tormented the Midwest, South and East.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I went to movies on the weekend because it was
so miserably hot that there was nothing else to do,'' said Linda
Bannister, an entertainment analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis.
``The lines were unbelievably long even though it's an 18-plex. I
actually saw `American Pie,' even though I didn't want to, because
that was the only one we could get into.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets this hot, you get cabin fever if you stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by performances stronger than expected from ``Runaway
Bride'' and ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ticket sales Friday
through Sunday topped $150 million, breaking the all-time three-day
record of $148.7 million set last Christmas weekend and
obliterating the three-day, nonholiday record of $135.7 million set
July 23-25.
</P>
<P>
   Summer ticket sales will smash last year's record of $2.58
billion by about 20 percent. Total July box office business hit
$1.06 billion, a 9 percent gain from business in July 1998 and the
first time receipts for the month have topped $1 billion. Insiders
say it's hard to quantify just how large a boost theaters receive
from stifling heat but admit it's a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly have gotten a bump over the last month,'' said
Brian Callaghan, a spokesman for Boston-based General Cinemas.
``When it gets this hot, you can only go to the pool or sit at home
so much, and eating outdoors is no fun. It gets so hot that even
going into the pool isn't refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan native Kevin B. Skislock, an entertainment analyst
with Laguna Research Partners in Irvine, said Californians are
often unaware of how uncomfortable cities like Boston, Chicago, New
York and Philadelphia can become during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big cities in the Northeast and Midwest don't cool down
much during the evenings because they're full of concrete and
asphalt,'' Skislock said. ``People don't realize how much of an
impact a small change in temperature can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain also bumps up movie business, Callaghan noted. ``We love a
wet summer, because cabin fever takes over on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers are always the strongest season for movie attendance.
The 15 weeks between Memorial Day and Labor Day account for as much
as 40 percent of the year's box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people enter the summer, they enter it with a particular
mind-set about what they want to do,'' Skislock said. ``When they
can't get outside, they're still going to find something to break
the winter pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   So when it's steaming hot or raining, people become much more
likely to ditch summer activities like sports or outdoor dining in
favor of the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood loads its summer schedule with mass-appeal comedies
and action films _ ``popcorn'' films in industry jargon _ such as
``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Austin Powers: the
Spy Who Shagged Me,'' ``Tarzan'' and ``Big Daddy,'' a quartet that
has collectively grossed more than $900 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers say Hollywood deserves credit for releasing an
exceptionally strong list of films this summer, with appeal to a
wide variety of audiences. Nine different films have led the box
office during the last nine weekends, and only a few, such as
``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' ``Instinct'' and ``Arlington Road,'' have
been labeled out-and-out disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat doesn't help if you're showing a bunch of clinkers,
but if it's a strong schedule, there's definitely going to be an
uptake,'' said Dan Marks of Los Angeles-based ACNielsen EDI. ``When
people think about movies, they know that it's always going to be
nice and cool. If the movies are lousy, they do something else, but
it's a great option for people not to have to worry about the damn
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source forecasting, noted
that theaters have a long tradition of being a shelter from heat.
Theater owners were among the earliest to install air conditioning
in their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a big factor in markets where people can't
afford home air conditioning,'' he said. ``Since theaters are the
cheapest form of entertainment, some people will go to matinees and
sit in a multiplex all day, going from theater to theater.''

AFTER CLINTON SPLASH, NEW MAGAZINE HAS A PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new lede and rewrite of first 5 grafs with new reporting.
Picks up at But it was...)  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The party on Liberty Island Monday night was as
eclectic as the magazine it introduced: Models rubbed elbows with
politicians, movie moguls chatted with authors, and all of them
gathered at the behest of a celebrity editor.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the former editor of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair
magazines, was the host of a party for more than 800 guests at the
Statue of Liberty to introduce Talk magazine, a title that arrives
on newsstands Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine promises to define what's hip _ like ``potted''
meat, ``old money,'' central Pennsylvania, earth tones and science.
But Ms. Brown's eclectic new magazine, which has already generated
an avalanche of publicity by publishing a profile of Hillary Rodham
Clinton in which Mrs. Clinton offered a psychological defense of
her husband's extramarital affairs, combines highbrow features with
lowbrow popular culture _ like ``The Hip List'' and a feature about
the resurgence of fur in the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   And the magazine generated more publicity Monday night, as
guests like Kate Moss, Christopher Buckley, Tom Brokaw and the Rev.
Al Sharpton gathered to dine beneath 2,000 Japanese lanterns. The
party was complete with a 20-minute fireworks show by the Grucci
family, floral arrangements by the party designer Robert Isabell,
and boxed picnic dinners by the Upper East Side catering company
Glorious Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities like Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney
Co., who mingled at a private party beforehand with Ms. Brown and
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, arrived at Liberty
Island on a boat that Buckley called ``the Star Barge.'' Other
guests, who began arriving at 8 p.m., were ferried back and forth
by private ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island, where the
party was moved after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani rejected plans last
month to hold it at the city-owned Brooklyn Navy Yard. The mayor,
who was said to have turned downed the Navy Yard plan after
learning that Mrs. Clinton would be the subject of a profile in the
magazine, was invited to last night's party, but did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the magazine's interview with Mrs. Clinton, conducted
by Lucinda Franks, that was the subject of conversation at the
White House briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, was asked repeatedly
about Mrs. Clinton's statement in the interview that Clinton had
been abused as a child, and her apparent suggestion that this
explained his infidelities as an adult. Lockhart said that Clinton
had not been physically abused, and he resisted venturing into any
psychological discussion of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article speaks for itself,'' Lockhart said. ``The
president is comfortable with what was expressed in the article. I
think he and others believed that it was a generally favorable
article about the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said the magazine contained nothing new about
Clinton's upbringing, since he has talked extensively about growing
up in a sometimes violent home with an alcoholic stepfather, and
his mother had written about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing new here,'' Lockhart said. ``There are no new
revelations to be made here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Clinton's statement in the article that Clinton
would seek therapy when he left office, Lockhart said that was news
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is the president continues to deal with the
ministers that he talked about at the outset,'' he said. ``I can't
tell you about the details of that because they are private. But he
has sought to work with ministers who he is close with and friendly
with, and that's the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be published 10 times during its first year, Talk
magazine is a joint venture between Miramax Films, which is owned
by Walt Disney Co., and Hearst Magazines.

WEB SITE OWNER'S NAME PAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A savvy woman from Minnesota could soon be
hundreds of thousands of dollars richer by knowing something about
the Internet and the market for drugs before anyone else did.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage based in suburban Chatsworth, GreatDomains.com, is
in the middle of auctioning a domain name, drugs.com, for the
owner, Bonnie Neubeck of Minneapolis. According to an officer of
the brokerage, the highest verified bid to date is $260,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the price could get higher before the auction ends Friday.
Since July 15, when the name went on auction, there have been even
higher bids, but their validity hasn't been verified, said Jeffrey
Tinsley, chief executive officer of the brokerage company.
</P>
<P>
   Internet watchers say the bidding is lively for the drugs.com
name because it could be a boon to an online pharmaceuticals
retailer. After all, what Web site could be easier to remember for
surfers looking for drugs for their ailments?
</P>
<P>
   Drugs.com gets thousands of hits each month from online surfers
despite the fact that there are no advertisements pointing surfers
to the site, and there is not yet any drug information at the site,
Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a simple name. This is the core name for this
industry, and this industry is just so huge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing confidentiality agreements, Tinsley said he could not
disclose who turned in the highest bid verified so far. Neubeck did
not return telephone calls Monday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Dodd, an analyst for Jupiter Communications in New York,
said a Web site with a name so easy to remember could be popular
with medicine hunters, but only if the site itself is run well and
provides reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever owns the drugs.com site will still have to build up
consumer confidence, he said. The name itself won't guarantee
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a head start, and if they do it well it certainly
could be worth that initial investment. It could put them in the
forefront,'' Dodd said. ``If they don't do a good job of
fulfillment, that name, in and of itself, won't be the silver
bullet in terms of market leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Domain names can command a large price. In May, for example, a
former Albuquerque stockbroker named Eric Wade and two partners
sold the name wallstreet.com, which they had registered in 1994 for
$70, for $1.03million.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer was a Venezuelan company called Players Only, which
plans to use the Internet name for a site offering stock quotes,
company information, online trading and a gambling game based on
stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bids are verified by GreatDomains.com to ensure that they are
legitimate and that the bidders can indeed pay. Among the bidders
for the drugs.com name are a handful of jokers, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them aren't exactly good,'' Tinsley said. ``We've
gotten six offers from `Bill Gates.'''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the real Microsoft chairman isn't interested in the
Web site.

MONDESI HAS NO DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The trade deadline has passed for Raul Mondesi.
His anger and dismay have not.
</P>
<P>
   With two months left in the season, the question is not so much
whether the Los Angeles Dodgers can perform a miraculous turnaround
but if Mondesi can regroup emotionally from a troubling season.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't sound that way after Saturday's loss to Arizona when
Mondesi, distraught over reported trade rumors, asked manager Davey
Johnson for the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to get rid of me, that is fine,'' he said later.
``I would miss the fans and my teammates, but I would just have
another name on my shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just what he has said but what he has done. While his
average teeters in the low .240s, Mondesi obsesses about the two
years and $24 million in contract options the club has yet to
guarantee for the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Ten days ago, during a
series in Arizona, Mondesi elected not to return to the dugout in
the bottom half of an inning, preferring to sit in the Dodgers
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson attempted damage control by downplaying the incident,
but general manager Kevin Malone was livid.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi responded by saying, ``I don't care. . . . I'm not the
only problem on this team. We've got a lot of other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but when a player is leading the National League with 19
home runs, then does not hit another for 112 at-bats, his problems
belong to everyone. When he is owed $20.5 million over the next two
seasons, a prolonged slump makes many wonder if he will be earning
it in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a good guy, but this has upset him,'' said
teammate Trenidad Hubbard, whose locker is next to Mondesi's.
``It's really the first time it's happened to him. If we play
better and he's a part of that. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Putting it all back together.
</P>
<P>
   The first step begins tonight when the Dodgers open a 10-game
trip in Houston. The second is understanding what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, 28, signed with the Dodgers when he was 16. He was the
third of five consecutive Dodgers Rookies of the Year. He has had
back-to-back 30-home run seasons and won two Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But he also never carried the weight of the Dodgers high-profile
players like Mike Piazza, Hideo Nomo and Chan Ho Park, who became
international superstars. He was comfortable in the shadows,
wanting to show off his throwing arm, but not very much of himself.
</P>
<P>
   This year that changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very shy,'' said Ralph Avila, the scout who signed him.
``He was conscious of his language problems and as a proud man kept
to himself. He is a loner, he doesn't really hang out with anyone.
All of a sudden Piazza was gone, Nomo was gone, a lot of the guys
who got the attention and let him stay in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, he got off to a hot start, people were talking
about him hitting 50, 60 homers,'' he said. ``But the team was
losing. All the criticism was on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's mood actually began to sour last season after he was
arrested for drunk driving in Glendale, his in-season home.
Although the charges were dropped, Mondesi thought the fans turned
on him and the club was not supportive.
</P>
<P>
   He also was upset last winter when the club did not
automatically re-sign pitcher Ramon Martinez, who was revered by
the Latin players but was coming off reconstructive shoulder
surgery. The Dodgers did not pick up Martinez's $5.6 million option
and wanted to sign him for a much lower figure.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez later signed with the Boston Red Sox and is expected to
return this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's name later came up during trade talks with the
Cincinnati Reds at the winter meetings. Malone immediately shot
down the speculation, but the negative seeds were growing. Since
then, Mondesi had been rumored to be heading to Detroit as part of
a massive shakeup for both underachieving clubs. He also has taken
shots from his former manager Tom Lasorda. But the biggest problem
for Mondesi appears to be finding his place in the new Dodgers
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who first met Mondesi in 1990 when both were working out
at the Dodgers academy in Santo Domingo, was traded in a
blockbuster deal in May 1998 and the club has never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piazza, (Eric) Karros and Ramon were like brothers to him,''
Avila said from the Dodgers baseball academy in the Dominican
Republic. ``Brothers don't always get along, but there is always
that bond. That is gone and he feels it deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Avila, who is working his final months for the club.
Avila announced his retirement during spring training, then was at
the center of controversy when two Cuban minor-leaguers accused the
Dodgers of illegally signing them. The players were granted free
agency and Avila unofficially took the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Avila has not been back to Dodger Stadium since the first week
of the season. He has not been asked to intervene in Mondesi's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know where I am,'' Avila said. ``But no one has called.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president Bob Graziano refused to speak specifically
about Avila's involvement with the Cuban situation but said the
club is not keeping him away from Mondesi as punishment. Instead,
Graziano has decided to let Johnson, who has known Mondesi less
than a year, make the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to call Ralph on this unless Davey thinks it is
the right thing,'' Graziano said. ``Davey is with him every day and
has a good relationship with Raul. I want Davey to decide what the
best course is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson forged a reputation for nurturing young players as
manager of the Mets in the 1980s. He didn't make a fuss about
Mondesi's rest in the bullpen. Instead, he remains confident he can
build a bridge that brings Mondesi back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked a lot,'' Johnson said. ``I think it starts with
the little things. He has gotten into the habit of always thinking
home run. If he takes a few pitches the other way, he'll get on
base and do what he does. His confidence will improve and things
will be better. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, despite his struggles, is cheered more than any Dodger.
But in the past few weeks, many of the chants of !ital!Raa-ooooool
that accompany his every at-bat have been replaced by boos.

LITTON CONSOLIDATES, MOVES TO RESTRUCTURE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a series of restructuring moves, Litton
Industries Inc. on Monday said it will end its year-long foray into
the businesses of mainframe computer out-sourcing and consulting
service and close several manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The company will take a pretax charge of $116.8 million to these
and other issues. Forty-five workers at the Moorpark facility in
neighboring Ventura County and one in Agoura Hills received
termination notices Friday, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people work at the computer unit, Litton Enterprise
Solutions Inc., that is based in suburban Woodland Hills and
McLean, Va. Some of its work focused on helping companies and
organizations make their computer systems compatible with Year 2000
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The company will take a pretax charge of $88.9 million to cover
the restructuring. Nearly 150 people could lose their jobs, the
company said. Litton has 41,000 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to complete its contracts for these
businesses by the end of fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Litton still is evaluating how best to absorb what is left of
the unit into existing operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all options right now,'' said Randy Belote, a
company spokesman. ``Some of the business will transfer to existing
operations, some of it will be disbanded and some of it perhaps
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of Litton's effort to improve the information
systems group's position and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Litton found the mainframe computer and consulting business to
be a highly competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were finding it difficult to move customers away from
established relationships. The way it was being approached was
hardware intensive and it wasn't a strategic fit with the direction
the information systems group wants to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Litton was competing with well-entrenched computer companies
like Electronic Data Systems and Computer Sciences Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a case of being in the competition in a small
way with some big giants. And it's a very different modus operandi
than what the company is familiar with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Howard Rubelat of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York said
the decision to exit the business should have a long-term benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set out to undo a decision in a timely manner and they
have. The actions were well thought out and over time should have a
positive impact on the enterprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said it will consolidate some
manufacturing at the Data Systems and Applied Technology divisions
to improve operating efficiency and reduce excess capacity,
resulting in a pretax charge of $9.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Data Systems Facility in Moorpark that has 180 workers will be
closed and those operations merged into the facility in Agoura
Hills and another in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is incorporate as many people into the
Agoura Hills facility as possible,'' Belote said.
</P>
<P>
   This unit designs and develops air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Litton also will shutter an Applied Technology plant in Grants
Pass, Ore., that employs 135 people. It produces radar warning
receivers, and the work will be moved to San Jose and College Park,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter charges include $18.5million in costs
associated with settling previously announced federal fraud charges
brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office.

LITTON MARITIME MERGER COMPLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries Inc. said Monday it has
completed the $529 million acquisition of rival ship builder
Avondale Industries Inc. of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale shareholders approved the merger on July 27. Terms were
for $39.50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are planned, and the company will retain its name and
management team. Albert L. Bossier, Avondale's chairman and chief
executive officer, will continue to manage the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company will now be called Litton Avondale Industries and
become part of the new Litton Ship Systems organization, which will
also include Ingalls Shipbuilding based in Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale designs, builds and overhauls ships for the U.S. Navy,
the U.S. Coast Guard and commercial customers. Most of the military
work is for support type ships.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls concentrates on combat ships but also builds some
amphibious vessels, as does Avondale. However, there should not be
much overlap in the operations, the company said. The unit also
builds cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale had revenues of about $750 million for the year ended
last December.
</P>
<P>
   The newly created Litton maritime organization will have
combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion and 17,000
employees. It will be capable of producing any class of nonnuclear
ship for military or commercial customers.

   WEIMAR-EUROPE (Weimar, Germany) _ Always a crucible of the best
and worst in Germany, this small town has emerged a decade after
the fall of the Berlin wall as a focus of national questioning and
conflict. This year is the 250th anniversary of the birth of
Weimar's most distinguished son, Goethe. The town was selected by
European ministers as the continent's ``cultural capital'' for
1999. But the town _ home to Schiller and to Nietzche, birthplace
of the Bauhaus _ is adjacent to the Buchenwald concentration camp,
where more than 50,000 people were killed. By Roger Cohen.

   TURIN-SHROUD (St. Louis) _ An analysis of pollen on the Shroud

   JAPAN-OKINAWA (Nago, Japan) _ When Japan's prime minister
announced recently that the site of the conference of leading
industrial nations next year would be this charming little city in
Okinawa, the mayor danced a jig at City Hall. There was much to
celebrate. Okinawa, Japan's poorest prefecture, seemed a long shot

army's leaders nor the international force are doing enough to stop

   DROUGHT-FARMERS (Frederick, Md.) _ After the television
reporters finished their standups in the fields of stunted corn and
the orating politicians departed, the Harshman family still had a
farm crisis they described as the worst since the Great Depression.
``I sure don't need any more loans,'' Vaughn Harshman said as the
clutch of officials drove away towards Washington in a dry cloud of
dust. Speaking to about 40 troubled farmers gathered here for a
news conference, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman had declared
West Virginia and parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania
and Virginia a drought disaster area and promised low-interest
loans for farmers. By Francis X. Clines.

of off-shore banking and money laundering in the Cayman Islands.
After John Mathewson was caught laundering money in an FBI sting to
shut down a major player in the multi-billion dollar illegal trade
in cable black boxes, he offered the government investigative gold
in return for leniency. He was willing to turn over the computer
records of his Grand Caymans Island bank, which held itself out as
a one-stop money launderer for its U.S. clients. By Ronald

spouses like Hillary Rodham Clinton harbor great ambitions for
their husbands, Laura Bush is a throwback. She is a former
librarian with little interest in politics. She says she never
dreamed that her husband would run for office, or emerge so early
as the candidate to beat for the Republican presidential
nomination. But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has tugged his wife
into a national maelstrom. And it is only going to get worse. By

a few customers could be found wandering around ``The American

day's take at the gate: 12 people. Like countless other virtually
empty theme parks in China, ``The American Dream'' symbolizes

symbiosis, the mutual dependence of two species. But the textbook
accounts, it turns out, don't tell even half the story. From

as far more intricate than it appears, involving not two but at
least four different species, their lives knotted together in a

   SCI-MOZART-EFFECT (Undated) _ True or false: Brain research
shows that playing classical music for 2-year-olds makes them
smarter. Given the publicity blitz that has attended the so-called
Mozart effect, most people could be forgiven if they answered,
``True!'' But the truth is that the studies behind the Mozart
effect were conducted on college students, not young children. The
``effect'' _ an increase in performance on a specific task of
spatial imagery _ lasted for only a few minutes. The studies
involved no brain research, only tests of behavior. Attempts to
reproduce the results have failed. In a book coming out next month,
``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' (Free Press), Dr. John Bruer
argues that the hype and the overstatement and at times distortion
of what neuroscientists know about the developing brain has
unnecessarily sent anxious parents and educators scurrying to
insure that children receive exactly the right type of ``enriched''
stimulation before the age of 3. By Erica Goode. (ART ADV: Photo

   SCI-RABINOWITZ-ADVENTURE (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Alan
Rabinowitz. If Indiana Jones, the daredevil hero of Steven

zoologist rather than an archeologist, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz would
have made an ideal model. In 16 years with the Wildlife
Conservation Society, Rabinowitz has tracked and captured jaguars
in Belize, tigers in Thailand and clouded leopards in Borneo and
Taiwan. He has lived with Mayan Indians in Central America and
jungle tribes in Southeast Asia. Most recently he trekked on foot
for a month to reach one of the world's most isolated areas, in
northern Myanmar, crossing mountain torrents on hastily built
bamboo bridges that would have given the unflappable Jones pause.
