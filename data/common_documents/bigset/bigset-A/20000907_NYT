   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   GORE GAINS IN MISSOURI: Thanks in part to postconvention gains
among women, Vice President Al Gore has caught up with Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas in Missouri, a swing state in which he had been
trailing. The results of the poll, conducted last Thursday and
Friday for The Kansas City Star by Mason-Dixon Polling and
Research, found that 45 percent of 621 registered voters favored
Gore and 41 percent favored Bush, a spread that technically left
the race a dead heat because the margin of sampling error was plus
or minus four percentage points. Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, had 2 percent, and Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party had 1
percent. In a Mason-Dixon poll conducted July 6 to 10, before the
Republican and Democratic conventions, Gore trailed Bush by 11
points, 48 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   THE STATES
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA VOTES AS EXPECTED: There were no surprises in Tuesday's
primaries in Florida that picked Democratic and Republican
candidates to compete for the Senate seat being vacated by Connie
Mack, a Republican who is retiring. As expected, Rep. Bill McCollum
easily won the Republican primary, capturing 82 percent of the
vote, and the state's insurance commissioner, Bill Nelson, coasted
to a win in the Democratic primary, taking 77 percent of the vote.
But the fall contest is expected to be one of the most competitive
in the country. Democrats say Nelson has a real chance because
McCollum, who had been counting on riding Gov. George W. Bush's
coattails, no longer is assured of a good ride.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, in Nevada, former Rep. John Ensign easily won
the Republican primary for an open Senate seat. In the fall, he
will face Ed Bernstein, a millionaire who ran unopposed in the
Democratic primary. The incumbent, Richard Bryan, a Democrat, is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   THE SENATE
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA RACE HEATS UP: The race for the seat once held by Sen.
Paul Coverdell, the late Republican from Georgia, has been a quiet
affair, with both leading candidates spending more time raising
money than campaigning. Zell Miller, a Democrat, was appointed to
the seat, pending a special election, after Coverdell died in July,
and this week Miller, a former governor, began running the first
television advertisement of the campaign, tying himself to
Coverdell while stepping back from his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honored by Governor Barnes when he appointed me to fill
the big shoes of my good friend Senator Coverdell,'' Miller says in
the 30-second advertisement in which he courts some of the
Republican voters who twice elected Coverdell over a Democrat.
``But in November, you get to decide if I should finish the last
four years of his term. I pledge you this: As your senator, I will
serve no single party but rather seven and one-half million
Georgians.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's opponent, former Sen. Mack Mattingly, has a new
campaign mailing that includes an endorsement by Coverdell's widow,
Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER DEBATE, ANOTHER DISPUTE: As the spat over the
presidential debates plays out, House and Senate Democratic leaders
are churning up their own election year debate controversy on
Capitol Hill. Several months ago, the two leaders _ Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota _
challenged Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to a debate on ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on Oct. 15.
The Republicans declined, saying they were too busy and could not
plan that far ahead. Wednesday, Gephardt dashed off a letter to
Hastert, saying he was disappointed that Hastert would not
participate in a discussion of major campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Governor Bush's refusal to participate in the three
debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates, your
refusal raises questions about whether the leaders of the
Republican Party really want any honest discussion of the issues
this year,'' Gephardt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, Hastert's press secretary, said Hastert was busy
doing his job. ``He is a legislator, not a debater,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY'S SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Westland, Mich.; Dayton, Ohio, and Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   DICK CHENEY: Portland, Me.; Manchester, N.H., and Burlington,
Vt.

TIME WARNER AND AOL PLAN NO CONCESSIONS TO EUROPEAN REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Despite unusually sharp criticism from
European antitrust regulators, executives of Time Warner and
America Online do not plan to offer any concessions to clear their
proposed merger plans when they meet regulators behind closed doors
here on Thursday, company executives said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the companies will try to refute European arguments
that the merged company would harm competition because of its
enormous size.
</P>
<P>
   That sets the stage for what is likely to be bruising
negotiations over the next several weeks. But despite the U.S.
companies' seemingly hard line, many experts think that they will
have to modify their plan before they receive permission to operate
as a merged company in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, the administrative arm of the European
Union, has sent the two companies a 45-page statement of
objections, arguing that the merger in its current form would allow
the companies to dominate the online distribution of entertainment
and of music, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have seen the statement, it warns that
America Online and Time Warner would create a ``dominant position
in the markets for online music delivery, music software, Internet
dial-up access, broadband Internet access and integrated broadband
content.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining their concerns, European regulators here argued
that the two companies would own so many forms of entertainment and
information that America Online would be able to lock customers
into its service. That in turn would give the combined company even
more leverage in acquiring rights to music, videos and online
information services.
</P>
<P>
   European concern has been magnified in Time Warner's separate
plan to merge its music business into a joint venture with EMI
Group of Britain, the big music distributor. In an all-day hearing
Wednesday, also in private, Time Warner and EMI executives tried to
convince officials that the deal would be beneficial despite
reducing the number of major music distributors to four from five.
</P>
<P>
   The battle in Europe is parallel but somewhat different from the
one involving the companies in the United States, where regulators
are also scrutinizing the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, America Online is by far the largest
provider of Internet service. Time Warner is the nation's
second-largest cable company and therefore controls the means to
deliver high-speed Internet service to millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the companies are significantly weaker. AOL Europe
serves only about 10 percent of online subscribers and is no more
than a distant second place in any market. And despite the
Europeans' stated worries about Time Warner's potential control of
broadband Internet access, the company owns no cable television or
other high-speed networks in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy McKiernan, a spokeswoman for America Online, said
Wednesday that the European Commission's objections were nothing
more than ``a normal and predictable part of the process'' and that
AOL would not offer any compromises when it presented it case.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Time Warner and America Online will be
questioned by senior members of the European Commission's merger
task force. Antitrust regulators from each country in the European
Union and representatives of at least a few companies that are
fighting the merger will also take part.
</P>
<P>
   European arguments about the companies' grip on music are likely
to be stronger because worldwide music distribution is already
dominated by a handful of giants, and the combination of a Time
Warner music operation with EMI would concentrate the industry
more.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission has real power. It can block mergers
between companies that generate European sales of more than 250
million euros a year, currently $217 million. On many occasions,
including mergers between two U.S. companies, officials have used
their power to force companies into divestitures or changes in
their practices.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's deadline to reach a final decision on Time
Warner's deal with EMI is Oct. 16, and on its merger with America
Online, Oct. 24. The companies have to submit proposed remedies at
least one month before then.

AIR APPARENT: HOUSTON TAKES L.A. SMOG CROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With several weeks to go in the smog season,
Houston blew past Los Angeles this past weekend to once again
clinch America's Smoggiest City pennant, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas gulf city, sweltering under 100-degree temperatures
during a weeklong high pressure system, eked by its L.A. rival over
the Labor Day weekend with two more days of unhealthy levels of
ozone.
</P>
<P>
   And with the smog season ending locally in a few weeks, air
quality experts said Houston might for two years running post the
highest peak smog and most unhealthy ozone days of the year. That
is, if the weather holds out for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a fairly clean year,'' said Joe Cassmassi, senior
meteorologist for the South Coast Air Management District.
``Instead of stagnant sinks, we've had cool breezes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Houston stunned Los Angeles by stealing its long-held
Smog Cup. But late last month, Los Angeles threatened to take it
back -- with 34 days surpassing national health limits for ozone
compared with Houston's 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of last weekend, they had a higher number of unhealthy
ozone days than L.A.,'' said Sam Atwood, spokesman for the South
Coast Air Management District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 36; we had 34 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassmassi and other meteorologists attribute Houston's lead to
its high pressure system and nearby fires that have built a layer
of smog.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, by comparison, coasts toward the end of its smog
season late this month with cool breezes brought on by unstable
atmospheric conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When y'all have been up there lollygagging about with
70-degree highs and 50-degree lows, we have had highs in the
100s,'' said Gene McMullen of the Houston Bureau of Air Quality
Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks claim what we need to do is not have barbecue pits
out here, but if that will help the ozone, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Houston has led Los Angeles with a peak ozone level
day (or highest ozone level) of 206 parts per billion to L.A.'s 184
parts per billion. Levels below 200 ppb are known as ``ozone health
advisory episodes'' and call for joggers and other athletes to
cease outdoor activity.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, an industrial powerhouse that is home to 49 percent of
the nation's petrochemical industry and 25 percent of its gasoline
refining, lags 10 to 20 years behind environmental regulations
imposed by Los Angeles, smog authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, high ozone levels last generally through November.
In Los Angeles, the smog season usually ends in early October. For
that reason, Cassmassi and others predicted Houston would keep its
Smog Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we may have to claim the title again this
year,'' said Dave McCullum, spokesman for the Greater Houston
Partnership, a business advocacy group that oversees the chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's not something we're proud of -- whether you're
No. 1 or No. 2, there's no honor in being on this list at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the campaign to elect Vice President Al Gore
to the presidency were quick to jump on Houston's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has implored us to `Look at my record in Texas,' ''
said Peter Ragone, a spokesman for the Gore campaign. ``The record
on Texas is clear: Bush has been ignoring and not enforcing
environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be farther from the truth,'' said Ray Sullivan,
a Bush campaign spokesman from Austin, Texas. ``Under Gov. Bush, we
have reduced air emissions, we've reduced toxic emissions, air and
water are cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of Gov. Bush's record.''

THE AD CAMPAIGN: ATTACKING GORE OVER DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's campaign announced Wednesday that it would
begin running a new commercial attacking Vice President Al Gore's
credibility on the issue of debates. The 30-second spot is to run
in select markets in some, but not all, of the 17 closely contested
states where the Bush campaign is already running commercials. But
campaign officials declined to name the states.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Video footage of Bush seated comfortably in a
chair, looking relaxed in a blue shirt with an open collar. Cut to
shots of Gore appearing more tense as he is being interviewed on
two television shows. Closes with the words, ``If we can't trust Al
Gore on debates, why should we trust him on anything,''
superimposed on a black screen.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Female announcer: ``Labor Day weekend, Governor Bush
accepts a record five national debates. March 14, Al Gore says he'd
debate on CNN. July 16, Al Gore said he'd debate on NBC. When it
was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate `anytime,
anyplace, anywhere.' Now that Governor Bush has accepted, Gore says
`unacceptable.' Does Al Gore now mean debates depend on his meaning
of `anytime, anywhere?' If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why
should we trust him on anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The spot ignores the broader context of the debate
over debates, and in many ways distorts it. Gore has agreed to all
three of the 90-minute, prime-time debates organized by the
Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has
been running debates since 1988. Bush has agreed to appear in only
one commission debate and proposed joint appearances with Gore on
``Meet the Press'' on NBC and on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' Both of
those appearances would be 60 minutes long and, unlike the
commission debates, would not be covered by all three networks.
Gore contends that Bush is trying to reduce the number of people
who can watch the debates and says he will not appear in any of
Bush's proposed forums until the governor agrees to the three
commission debates. But Bush contends that the vice president has
backed away from his pledge to debate Bush ``anytime, anywhere.''
Both campaigns have agreed to two vice presidential debates, hence
Bush's ``record'' claim, since in the past the vice presidential
nominees have debated only once.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Bush's campaign is trying to fit the scuffle over
debates into his broader attack on Gore's character and honesty.
The line about ``his meaning of anytime, anywhere,'' is a sly
reference to President Clinton's defense regarding his relationship
with a White House intern: ``It depends on what the definition of
is is.'' But this commercial could also remind voters that Bush,
not Gore, is the one trying to sidestep the commission debates, and
in that way underscore Democratic contentions that he is afraid to
go one-on-one with the vice president before the largest possible
national audience.

   DOCUMENTS INDICATE FIRESTONE KNEW ABOUT DEFECTIVE TIRES
</P>
<P>
   Newly released documents provided additional evidence that
Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford Motor knew about a pattern
of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures came during hearings on Capitol Hill Wednesday
at which lawmakers called for a larger budget for safety regulators
and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in
which companies might be found to have knowingly sold products with

   FTC INVESTIGATES DRUG COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said that it was investigating
whether Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Bioscience colluded to
keep the lower-cost generic version of Bristol's cancer drug,
Taxol, off the market. The Food and Drug Administration gave Ivax,
a generic drug maker, tentative approval last month to sell generic
Taxol. But regulators said they could not let Ivax sell the drug
because of a complex legal agreement between Bristol-Myers and
American Bioscience. The FTC said in court papers that the terms of
the agreement ``raise potential competitive issues.'' Shares of
Ivax rose $7.81, to $39.
</P>
<P>
   NOVELL TO ELIMINATE 900 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Novell, the networking operating system maker, said that it
would eliminate 900 jobs, or about 16 percent of its worldwide work
force, to reduce costs. The company said it would take a pretax
charge of $40 million to $50 million in its fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ SLIDES AGAIN, BUT DOW RISES
</P>
<P>
   A sell-off in semiconductor stocks drove the Nasdaq composite
index down 129.84 points, or 3.1 percent, to 4,013.34. Other
markets fared better, largely because of strength in a handful of
financial stocks and in oil shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 14.83 points, or 1 percent, to 1,492.25. The Dow Jones
industrial average advanced 50.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to

   Facing an uncertain climate for Internet startups, the founders

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Suddenly thrust into the spotlight after the
starting quarterback is sidelined with a separated shoulder, UCLA's
quarterback of the future is working feverishly with the first
team, taking a crash course on running a college football team.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McCann?
</P>
<P>
   Try J.P. Losman.
</P>
<P>
   Losman, the Bruins' answer to Carson Palmer when he announced
two years ago that he would attend UCLA, will make the first start
of his college career, but it won't be Saturday against Fresno
State.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will be nine days from now when he leads Tulane, the
school for which he now plays, against East Carolina. Losman is
taking over for Patrick Ramsey, who _ like UCLA starter Cory Paus
against Alabama _ suffered a separated throwing shoulder in
Tulane's season opener, a 49-20 loss at 17th-ranked Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got all the tools,'' said Frank Scelfo, Tulane's
quarterbacks coach and the brother of head coach Chris Scelfo.
``He's got great mobility, an excellent arm and he's very
confident. The one thing he hasn't done is been in there and faced
live bullets. Until then, you never really know.''
</P>
<P>
   !ital!Until then, you never really know.
</P>
<P>
   There are no better words to sum up Losman's career.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively unheralded player at an unheralded school, Venice
High, Losman opened everyone's eyes with his arm and athletic
ability at a quarterbacks camp at UCLA the summer before his senior
year.
</P>
<P>
   He committed to UCLA shortly thereafter and as a result UCLA
never pursued one of Southern California's other highly regarded
quarterbacks, Hart's Kyle Boller, who is beginning his second
season as Cal's starting quarterback. UCLA offensive coordinator Al
Borges wanted Losman so badly that he personally recruited him _
the only Bruin quarterback for whom Borges has ever done that.
</P>
<P>
   Losman, eager to replace Cade McNown, graduated from high school
early so he could enroll at UCLA for the spring quarter and be
eligible to participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   He not only arrived on campus with the best arm among the five
quarterbacks but also with a cocksure attitude. Losman was cordial
to the others, but it wasn't hard to tell who the outsider was.
Between drills, it looked as if there were two groups _ the
quarterbacks and Losman.
</P>
<P>
   There were jokes made by the other quarterbacks and Borges at
Losman's expense. There were articles taped to his locker intended
to get under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been an attempt to bring Losman back to earth
was taken as hazing. When it became clear that Losman's inability
to absorb the UCLA playbook had him as the No. 5 quarterback just
before the start of fall camp, he walked into head coach Bob
Toledo's office and announced that he was transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of little things that added up,'' said Losman,
who is 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, about 15 pounds more than last season.
``It's nothing personal. I wish them the best of luck, but I had a
lot of questions and doubt in my mind over whether it was going to
be the right place for me. A lot of things didn't fall into place.
I didn't feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who thinks Losman got some bad advice from his former
high school coaches, tried desperately to talk him out of
transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't guarantee anybody anything,'' said Toledo, who
confirmed that Losman asked to be the No. 1 or 2 quarterback. ``He
wanted to be the guy. He wanted all this extra attention. He wanted
(Borges) to spend more time with him. Well, there's (NCAA)
restrictions (on hours of practicing) and we've got five
quarterbacks. He wanted the opportunity to compete for the starting
job; he wanted equal reps. This isn't intramurals.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges said Losman set unrealistic expectations for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened, happened,'' he said. ``But if he was
patient and let the natural order of things take place, he could
have been competing for the starting job this season. I'm
empathetic to him. For him to be in high school one day and college
the next, where there's nobody else in his situation, had to be
difficult. But to leave after 15 days of practice is
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo wasn't the only one who told Losman he was making a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to talk him out of it,'' said his mother, Tricia
Losman, who raised J.P and his sister, Amy, in Venice. ``It was a
blow to us. Jonathan has never not gotten along. I said, 'No way,
you can't leave UCLA. Are you crazy?' He said, 'Mom, if I have to
stand up to all of you, I will. Do you know how hard that is?' At
that point, I really needed to listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had committed to UCLA, Losman had taken a
recruiting visit to Tulane when Joe Dickenson, an assistant who had
recruited him for Oklahoma and a friend of his high school coach,
Angelo Gasca, was hired by the Green Wave.
</P>
<P>
   When he left UCLA, he chose Tulane over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, a school with a previously moribund football program,
was coming off a 12-0 season that showcased quarterback Shaun King,
now with Tampa Bay, and a wide-open, run-and-shoot offense. And
being in New Orleans didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with the place,'' Losman said. ``I always
remembered that trip. Something happened on that trip that was so
special for me. People say I was crazy. No one (in Los Angeles) has
a clue about Tulane. They don't know where it is, what state it's
in. But I wanted to go some place where I was going to enjoy
myself. Wherever I go, we're going to win. I don't want to make the
same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Losman has left UCLA, he hasn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Bruins fan, his bedroom at home still has a UCLA neon
light and a Bruins comforter on the bed. He says he dreams of
playing in the Rose Bowl one day, though he realizes it's not
likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved going to class there,'' said Losman, an honors student
in high school. ``For the first time in my life, I loved going to
class. I was going to the school of my dreams. I got to answer a
bunch of questions wherever I went. Cade was leaving. Hopefully,
I'd be the next Cade McNown. I thought it would be something
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in the Superdome press box during home games last
season, he couldn't help but think about what might have been had
he stayed at UCLA. The Bruins used all four quarterbacks last
season and ended the season with McCann, who was No. 4 at the end
of fall camp, in the lineup against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Losman said when asked if he followed the Bruins
last season. ``I was going to get my chance even if I didn't play.
I would have had a chance to come back this year and compete. With
the injuries, they might have put me in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to that stuff all the time (at home). People say,
'See, if you stayed, you would have started or you would have
gotten a chance.' But it's not about that. That's not why I left.
It just didn't feel like the right place. You have to go someplace
where you feel comfortable and are happy. A lot of guys who played
college football understand the situation I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Losman _ a year older, a year wiser and a year humbler
from the experience _ takes the reigns of another team. He has 31
plays under his belt, completing 5 of 10 passes for 35 yards. He
didn't throw an interception or a touchdown pass, and he was sacked
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played like someone playing in his first game,'' Scelfo
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Losman says, he couldn't be happier. His new team and
his new school feel like home. Four years from now, he'll be better
able to look back and see whether he made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, you never really know.

   PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOUT INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Policy Institute, a Washington-based independent
research organization, plans to hold eight town hall meetings
designed to gather grass-roots information on Internet policies and
will present its findings to the next president after the November
elections. The meetings are being held jointly with eight
universities across the country to get ``outside the Beltway''
views on the Internet, said James L. Barksdale, former president
and chief executive of Netscape Communications and chairman of the
institute, which is nonpartisan.

   WEB ENCRYPTION PATENT INTO PUBLIC DOMAIN
</P>
<P>
   RSA Security said it had placed the RSA public key encryption
algorithm into the public domain, permitting programmers to freely
incorporate the technology into their products. The RSA algorithm _
named after three computer scientists, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir
and Leonard Adelman _ has been widely used for more than a decade
to protect the privacy of digital commerce and communications. The
technology was originally awarded a U.S. patent on Sept. 20, 1983,
and it is due to expire later this month. Known as public key
cryptography, the technology was also pioneered independently by
researchers at Stanford University, and makes it possible for two
people who have never met to exchange information securely.

   FBI DEFENDS E-MAIL TAPPING PROGRAM

   Officials from the FBI and the Justice Department defended the
Carnivore e-mail surveillance system Wednesday, asserting that the
program is used only after all other investigative methods have
been exhausted. In remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Kevin DiGregory, deputy assistant attorney general, urged the
continued use of the program ``as criminal activity migrates to the

   Sales of personal computers in Latin America this year will
increase by 30 percent over 1999, according to International Data
Corp. Laptop sales alone will increase nearly 50 percent over last
year, IDC estimated. PC sales are rising, in part, because of
falling prices and the increasing availability of systems in local
stores, said Alexandra Martinez of IDC. She also said growing
Internet usage was helping to drive sales. America Online-Latin

this year, reported that its fourth-quarter revenues rose 55
percent over the previous quarter.

   Following is an excerpt from an e-mail message sent by Carlos
Caceres-Collazo, one of the U.N. refugee workers killed Wednesday,
shortly before his murder. The U.N. high commissioner for refugees,
Sadako Ogata, read it to the Security Council. The text was
provided by a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the office when the news came out that a wave of
violence would soon pound Atambua. We sent most of the staff home,
rushing to safety. I just heard someone on the radio saying that
they are praying for us in the office. The militias are on the way,
and I am sure they will do their best to demolish this office.
</P>
<P>
   The man killed was the head of one of the most notorious and
criminal militia groups of East Timor. These guys act without
thinking and can kill a human as easily (and painlessly) as I kill
mosquitoes in my room.
</P>
<P>
   You should see this office. Plywood on the windows, staff
peering out through openings in the curtains hastily installed a
few minutes ago. We are waiting for this enemy, we sit here like
bait, unarmed, waiting for wave to hit. I am glad to be leaving
this island for three weeks. I just hope I will be able to leave
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   As I wait for the militias to do their business, I will draft
the agenda for tomorrow's meeting in Kupang. The purpose of the
meeting: to discuss how we are to proceed with this operation. _

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate candidacy Wednesday, declaring that she would show
leadership on environmental concerns he champions and would
overcome the ``carpetbagger'' tag that also threatened his father's
bid for a Senate seat from New York in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who had considered running for
the seat Clinton is seeking, stood at her side at the 79th Street
Boat Basin in Manhattan and delivered her second endorsement on
environmental issues in two days. On Tuesday, she was endorsed by
the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy credited Clinton with exerting influence on her
husband's administration to take steps to protect the lands around
New York City's upstate drinking water supplies from development, a
battle Kennedy has waged for several years. He said that during a
``seminar'' he conducted for Clinton this year, she had
demonstrated a strong interest in that problem and in such other
issues as cleaning up chemical contamination from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy acknowledged that Clinton's Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had agreed to write a letter to the Army
Corps of Engineers urging further protection of the watershed,
Kennedy faulted him for not taking the initiative on protecting the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy adopted the favored Clinton campaign tactic of linking
Lazio to his former ally, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
Kennedy said was vehemently against the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Lazio, Kennedy said: ``You can't point _ and Rick
Lazio can't point _ to a single instance in which he has ever
demonstrated environmental leadership on any environmental issue.
He walked in lockstep with the Gingrich Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also addressed an assertion that Lazio has constantly
repeated: that Clinton is a ``carpetbagger'' who moved here in
January only to establish residency for her Senate bid. The same
charge was leveled against Robert F. Kennedy Sr., who moved from
Massachusetts to New York City in 1964 for a Senate run that he won
by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was 10 when his father ran, said: ``The passions
against my father were equal to or exceeded what I have seen. This
is the question that was asked about my father: Is somebody who is
not born in this state capable of putting in or offering leadership
to this state? And my answer to that is resoundingly, yes, they
are. New Yorkers come from everywhere. We have the most
cosmopolitan community in North America and maybe one of the most
cosmopolitan in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, dismissed Kennedy's
assertions as partisan rhetoric. He said the congressman had a
solid environmental record that included supporting the cleanup of
Long Island Sound and more closely regulating mining practices
believed threatening to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers are more impressed by Rick Lazio's real
record on the environment,'' McLagan said, ``than by Mrs. Clinton's
empty promises and partisan endorsements.''

MTA, UNIONS STILL BARGAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ MTA rail and bus operators said Wednesday that
they have no plans to strike before Friday as talks continue on
wages, work rules and the proposed Valley transit zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can rest assured they will have public
transportation up until Friday, barring nothing stupid by the MTA,
of course,'' said Tommy Elisando, financial recording secretary for
the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents more than 1,800 bus
and train mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority and ATU officials said
they hope to resume negotiations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to meet with them any time,'' MTA spokesman Marc
Littman said. ``We are anxious to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions representing most MTA workers agreed Monday to a
five-day extension in talks, but the ATU rejected the extension,
saying it would consider on a day-to-day basis whether to walk off
the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the United Transportation Union and the
Transportation Communications International Union, which represent
about 4,950 bus and train drivers and clerical workers, met with
MTA negotiators. Those talks are expected to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to meet with the UTU and the TCU and continue
to invite the ATU to meet with us,'' MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a projected $438 million operating deficit over the next
10 years, the MTA is attempting to reduce its costs and is trying
to hold the line in negotiations to achieve those savings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Norton, spokesman for the UTU, said negotiations bogged
down Wednesday over the MTA's proposal to require drivers to work
four 10-hour days spread over 12 to 13 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said the long days could fatigue drivers and endanger
passengers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our drivers have the lives of their passengers in their hands
and we believe this is a serious threat to the safety and
well-being of the schoolchildren and others who are dependent on
public transit,'' UTU General Chairman James A. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Littman said many MTA drivers already work more than 12 hours a
shift and not just four days a week, but five and six days a week,
collecting large amounts of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our operators are paid overtime to work 12-hour shifts
and if the UTU was concerned about driver fatigue and safety then
they would not permit their members to volunteer to work that
overtime,'' Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   The looming strike, which would clog freeways and shut down bus
and train service to the MTA's 450,000 passengers a day, is
worrying riders in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in wheelchairs who are absolutely terrified
of the strike,'' said Van Nuys resident Rick Rofman, a 57-year-old
disabled rider who depends on public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar resident Bart Reed, a legally blind man who is a member
of the MTA's Passenger Advisory Committee, said the mood on the
buses this week is very somber. ``Every bus was sort of like
waiting for doomsday,'' said Reed, 48.

GEORGE MUSSO, 90, A HALL OF FAME LINEMAN FOR BEARS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Musso, a Hall of Fame lineman and captain of the Chicago
Bears when they ruled professional football before and during World
War II, died Sept. 5 in Edwardsville, Ill. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Musso, called Moose, played for the Bears from 1933 to 1944,
when they were known as the Monsters of the Midway. In that span,
their record was 104-26-6 and they won four National Football
League championships and seven Western Division titles. One
championship came in 1940 in a 73-0 rout of the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   On a team with Red Grange (for Musso's first two years), Bronko
Nagurski, Sid Luckman and Bulldog Turner, Musso was often
overshadowed. He started out as a $90-a-game offensive tackle. In
his fifth season, he was switched to offensive guard, and he became
the first player to be voted All-Pro at two positions. His coach,
George Halas, called him ``the greatest guard in professional
football ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Musso was an intimidating middle guard on defense, an excellent
blocker on pass plays and a quick pulling guard on running plays.
He had a ready explanation for that quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am blocking for Nagurski, and he waits for no one,'' he
said. ``If you don't open the hole, he'll hit you in the back, and
the next time you will either open it or get out of the way
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   For Musso's last nine seasons, he was the Bears' captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players wouldn't have anyone else,'' Grange once said.
``Halas let him give the pep talk to the players before the big
games. He had great spirit, and his talks would really get the guys
fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming captain was a monumental achievement for someone who
almost did not make the team. In those days, there was little
scouting of college players. Halas saw Musso's picture in a
basketball uniform, grimaced at the mustache and said: ``This guy
will never make it. He looks like a walrus.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally gave Musso a tryout and offered him $90 a game if he
made the team. And, Musso once said, an additional $5, of which $3
was for the train ride to training camp and $2 for whatever Musso
wanted to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Musso was big for his era _ 6 feet 2 inches and 258 pounds (he
would grow to 270). But he was raw, and he barely survived his
rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   After the first game, Halas wanted to send him to a Cincinnati
farm team. Musso resisted and told Halas he wanted an outright
release instead. He also reminded Halas that Curly Lambeau, the
Green Bay Packers' coach, had promised him a job if the Bears cut
him.
</P>
<P>
   Halas then offered to keep Musso on the team at $45 a game until
he proved himself. Musso could have played for the Giants for $75 a
game, but he really wanted to play in Chicago; he had already taken
an apartment there with Nagurski and a friend. So he stayed with
the Bears, and Halas worked with him. As did Grange, despite
initial doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red came to me one day and told me I could make the club if I
just played up to my capabilities,'' Musso recalled. ``It was a
shot in the arm. The next Sunday, at Brooklyn, I played about a
half and was gaining confidence as I went along.''
</P>
<P>
   The next week, with the Bears trailing the Chicago Cardinals by
9-7, Musso blocked a punt for a safety that tied the game. The
Bears won, 12-9, and Musso went back to full salary of $90 a game.
Two weeks later, he was a starter; and soon, he was a star. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Ray Flaherty, the Redkins' coach, said, ``His size and speed
made him a difficult target, particularly on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Musso was born April 8, 1910, in Collinsville, Ill. His father
was a coal miner and wanted his son to join him after he finished
grade school. Friends persuaded the father to let him go to high
school, and the same friends later persuaded the father to let him
go to college. He earned a degree from James Millikin University in
Decatur, Ill., and 12 letters in football, baseball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   After his pro career, he went into the restaurant business in
Edwardsville. In 1958, he was elected sheriff of Madison County in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three daughters, JoAnn Knecht-Robinson of
Napa, Calif.; Toni Baughman, of Alexandria, Va.; and Linda Ruddy,
of Cape Girardeau, Mo.; a brother, Albert, of Sioux Falls, S.D.;
two sisters, Evelyn Moore and Dora Major, both of Collinsville, 12
grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Musso said he was probably the only player who lined up against
two future presidents. In 1929, he played against Eureka College's
175-pound guard, Ronald Reagan. In the 1935 College All-Star Game,
he opposed the Michigan center, Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Musso was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame
with Sam Huff, Merlin Olsen and Doug Atkins. ``After all those
years,'' Musso said, ``I thought they had forgotten about me.''  &QL;

ABDUL NASUTION, 81, INDONESIAN POLITICIAN AND GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abdul Haris Nasution, a soldier and politician who
fought for Indonesia's independence from the Netherlands and may
have missed a chance to lead his nation, died Wednesday in a
Jakarta hospital. He was 81 and had been in a coma since a recent
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   General Nasution (pronounced na-SU-tyun) was a former army chief
and cabinet minister who typified the Indonesian military's history
of deep involvement in politics and internal security as well as
defense, experts on Indonesian history said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Nasution held positions roughly analogous to the
U.S. secretary of defense, director of the FBI and chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff _ sometimes simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps the pivotal moment of Nasution's life came on
the night of Sept. 30, 1965, when six generals were slain as
renegade troops tried to overthrow President Sukarno. With bullets
flying around him, Nasution fled his Jakarta house in his pajamas,
leaping over a wall into the Iraqi ambassador's residence next
door. His 6-year-old daughter and an aide were shot to death,
however.
</P>
<P>
   That night started a blood-letting that went on for months as
hundreds of thousands of communists, suspected communists and trade
unionists were killed in reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Nasution might have been able to seize power then by playing on
sympathy, his fierce anti-communism and the prestige he enjoyed for
having been a guerrilla leader against the Dutch after World War
II, Ed Masters, a former U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't,'' Masters said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Suharto moved to take over, accusing Sukarno of leftist
sympathies. Suharto imposed an iron rule that lasted three decades.
He brought economic development and political stability to
Indonesia, making the world's fourth-largest country more
self-sufficient and increasing literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The price was suppression of personal freedom and dissent and,
many critics charged, corruption that enriched the leader and his
relatives while millions of people were still trapped in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesian history could have been different if General
Nasution had become president,'' said Masters, the No. 3 person in
the U.S. embassy in Indonesia from 1964 to 1968 and ambassador from
1978 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Masters said, authoritarian rule was necessary for a
while longer in a country that had known only that for more than
300 years under the Dutch and Japanese. But Masters, now president
of the United States Indonesia Society, said he believed that
Nasution would have relaxed the government's hold far sooner than
Suharto did.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a conversation with Nasution three years ago, Masters
said, ``He bemoaned the fact that Indonesia had such rigid
controls.'' Nasution, he said, was basically ``an honest man, an
honorable man,'' one with no taste or talent for intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   As his power was waning in 1966, Sukarno removed Nasution as
defense minister, a post he had held for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Once Suharto took over, Nasution criticized him on more than one
occasion. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, he said a similar
upheaval could occur in Indonesia if the people no longer
identified with their government.
</P>
<P>
   Even out of official power, Nasution retained enough prestige to
say things that might have been fatal for a lesser figure. But his
complaints had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Nasution was born on Sumatra of middle-class parents and
graduated from the Royal Dutch Military Academy before World War
II. He was commissioned in the Royal Netherlands Indies Army in
1941 and captured by the Japanese the next year. He later worked as
a civil administrator for the Japanese and joined a Japanese
military unit, at least partly in hope of ending Dutch colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesia proclaimed its independence after Japan was
defeated, he rose rapidly in the new Indonesian army, becoming a
major general at 28. He led guerrilla campaigns against the Dutch
and, after independence was secured, helped to put down rebellions
against the new central government.
</P>
<P>
   Nasution is survived by his wife and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   James Clad, a Georgetown University professor of Southeast Asian
studies, said Wednesday that Nasution dedicated himself to ``a
struggle for a better life'' for Indonesians, and that he was
fundamentally ``a voice of moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asian director of Human Rights Watch, said
that, courage and good intentions notwithstanding, General Nasution
helped to cement the internal political role of the military that
has haunted Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he thought the general would be remembered, Masters
mentioned again the night of the 1965 coup. ``The time came, and it
passed him by,'' he said. ``He was an Indonesian Hamlet.''

REPORT BLASTS STREET REPAIR BUREAU`S COMPLAINT HANDLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles residents routinely encounter a rough
road -- hang-ups, long waits and indifference -- when they call a
telephone hotline to report potholes to the city, according to a
biting audit released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fifth of callers got disconnected, others were put on
hold for up to 45 minutes and about one-third of the time, the
operator neglected to ask for all the information the city needed
to do the repair job, according to the audit conducted by City
Controller Rick Tuttle's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of management attention to customer service needs to
be remedied,'' wrote the report's authors, who sharply criticized
the city Street Services Bureau for failing to cooperate with the
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of the Controller ranks the cooperation given to
its audit team by Bureau management to be the worst experienced
during the Director of Auditing's last nine years of conducting
independent audits of City agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association, said the audit's findings reflect widespread community
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't do something as simple as take complaints, no
wonder the streets don't get fixed, the sidewalks don't get
fixed,'' said Close, who also is chairman of Valley VOTE, the
organization that pushed for a study of the feasibility of a Valley
city apart from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder people are clamoring for their own local city.''
</P>
<P>
   Street Services General Manager Greg Scott defended the program
and challenged the audit's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe there are inaccuracies there,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the audit was conducted when the bureau's call center
was short four of its 12 workers -- one of whom was in the hospital
while others had been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also said members of the bureau felt the auditors changed
the focus of the audit several times and even seemed to have
personal vendettas against some of his workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some issues with the auditors. We met with them; I
thought we cleared them up, but it's obvious in their report that's
not true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found 25 potholes across the city and called to
report them between June 21 and 29. The report criticized the
results in three key areas: excessive disconnected calls, excessive
time on hold and operators' failure to collect the proper
information.
</P>
<P>
   The reports states that auditors waited on hold between 1 and 45
minutes -- with an average 12.5 minutes -- to speak with an
operator.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the time, the callers waited more
than five minutes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Association,
called it unacceptable for callers to be put on hold for so long,
which he said could discourage the public from reporting potholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once somebody waits 12.5 minutes, they probably will never
call in again,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also stated that callers who waited more than 12
minutes often heard a recorded message promising the hold time to
be three to five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A canned answer with no basis in reality is a poor substitute
for good customer information,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The second area highlighted in the report -- disconnected calls
-- included the auditors' finding that 18 percent of calls were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public . . . may not be willing to repeatedly call
to get a street repair made,'' the auditors warned. ``They may
resign themselves to believing that their government is
unresponsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the audit found that one-third of the callers who got
through were not asked all of the information required by the
Street Services Department -- such as the telephone number or area
code of the caller -- to patch a pothole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to pay attention and monitor themselves more
closely,'' said Louise Lund, administrative deputy city controller.
</P>
<P>
   The hotline, (800) 996-CITY, or 996-2489, is designed to request
service from the Bureau of Street Services. The bureau receives
about 100,000 requests for services a year. Scott said the bureau
makes about 200,000 small asphalt repairs, including potholes, each
year.

COLORADO PROVIDED RICHARD SOME ADDED MOTIVATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Barnett has replaced Rick Neuheisel as coach
at Colorado, but that won't make USC cornerback Kris Richard feel
any fonder of the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is sore that Colorado, under Neuheisel, refused to
recruit him as a senior at Serra High in Gardena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I wasn't the kind of player that they needed in
their system,'' Richard said. ``I wasn't good enough to be a
Colorado Buffalo. I still remember that.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I still remember the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Antuan Simmons is out for the season following surgery to
remove a tumor, Richard has become the secondary's mainstay, firmly
entrenched at left cornerback while Darrell Rideaux and Chris Cash
split time at right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   It's a complete turnabout from last season, when Richard was
considered the weak link because of his inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of crazy,'' Richard said of his lofty new status.
``But would it be this way if Antuan was still here? I say to
myself, 'If Antuan was still here, who would they be trying to
question then?' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ McGuire out: Offensive tackle Joe McGuire said he probably
wouldn't play against Colorado. He's bothered by a compressed disc
in his back and doesn't know how long he might be out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feeling better, but I'm day to day,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   With McGuire unable to play, Jacob Rogers, Eric Torres and
Phillip Eaves are the candidates to play in USC's goal-line
offense, in which starting right tackle Faaesea Mailo moves to
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   __ MacKenzie struggles: Hackett said tailback Malaefou
MacKenzie, who has been bothered by a sore hamstring, was ``a
little iffy'' during Wednesday's practice and he might not play
against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't comfortable with how he looked,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Petros Papadakis, who was sick Tuesday, returned and could back
up starter Sultan McCullough, with freshman Chris Howard also
available. Howard's availability is limited because of his slow
recovery from offseason knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kelly theory: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly doesn't think USC
will be complacent after having a week off and offered his own
analogy for how the Trojans would remain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the hunters. We've got to go out and hunt our food,''
Kelly said. ``We're not going to take anyone lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Add Kelly: In the wake of Penn State's 24-7 loss to Toledo,
Kelly believes USC could have ruined the Nittany Lions' confidence
with their sound victory in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``By beating them, we probably threw them off and messed up
their season,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, Kelly believes, is that USC's win over the Nittany
Lions has been downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's going to think our Penn State victory was a
fluke,'' Kelly said. ``But it's up to us to change the mind of the
critics now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grootegoed update: Test results should be available today on
strong safety Matt Grootegoed, who is believed to have
mononucleosis. He is sitting out this week and will probably miss
next week's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the improved depth in the secondary, no players will
need to be shifted around to replace Grootegoed. DeShaun Hill will
continue to backup starter Troy Polamalu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Matt is not going to cripple us,'' secondary coach
Dennis Thurman said. ``Last year, it would have crippled us.''

LAZIO'S TAX PLAN UNDERGOES SOME DEDUCTIONS OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREECE, N.Y. _ With television cameras and photographers crowded
around him, Rep. Rick Lazio settled behind a green plastic picnic
table in the Caracci family back yard here to talk up what he calls
the most dramatic component of his tax cut plan: allowing taxpayers
to deduct their payroll tax from their federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had an extra twelve hundred bucks, what would you do
with it?'' the Suffolk County Republican asked four Rochester area
taxpayers recruited by his campaign for an orchestrated
conversation designed to draw attention to the tax cut that he has
presented as a cornerstone of his campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax plan Lazio promoted again Wednesday was not
precisely what he first proposed two weeks ago, his aides
acknowledge. The aides have offered some new details on the plan
since then, with the effect being to lower the plan's potential
cost. Those changes occurred as some of Lazio's economic
assumptions were challenged by some independent analysts, and after
Clinton's aides said he underestimated the plan's price tag so he
could distance himself from the $1.3 trillion tax cut proposed by
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The payroll tax deduction that Lazio has proudly highlighted in
his speeches would, in fact, be phased in over 10 years, meaning
that it would be 2011 at the earliest before the four people seated
at the table with Lazio Wednesday would get the $1,200 tax cut he
promised. What is more, in a bit of tax policy that several
independent analysts described as highly unusual and
extraordinarily complicated, the tax deduction, for Social Security
contributions, would only be permitted for taxpayers who, after
computing their gross adjusted income, found themselves in or below
the 28 percent income tax bracket. They would then proceed to
subtract the additional deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Without those provisions, the cost of making the payroll tax
deductible would be $500 billion over 10 years. With these
provisions included, its 10-year cost would be about $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making the payroll tax deductible has been
considered, but discarded, in Congress, both because it is highly
expensive and because deductions favor taxpayers in upper brackets.
And in Albany, Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy
Institute, a group that studies government finances, contended that
Lazio's proposal, even with its upper-income limit restrictions,
would still benefit wealthier taxpayers because they are
statistically far more likely to itemize deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made no mention of those restrictive provisions when he
outlined what he described as a ``bold'' idea to the Chamber of
Commerce in Amherst, N.Y., on Aug. 24, and there was no mention of
it in the detailed briefing papers his campaign provided about the
plan that day. ``I propose allowing people to deduct their payroll
taxes on our 1040 forms _ the same way we do our state income taxes
and real estate taxes,'' he said in his speech. ``This pro-family
tax cut will reduce the average two-income family's tax bill by
$1,200.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference afterward, Lazio described his tax plan in
even more generous terms, saying that with other provisions _
including the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty, and an
increase in the amounts families are allowed to contribute to IRA's
_ the average family would save close to $3,000 a year. Bryan W.
Flood, one of Lazio's senior advisers, said that these provisions
were always part of Lazio's plan, though Flood acknowledged that
the candidate did not mention them in his speech, or in appearances
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention to mislead,'' Flood said. ``We talked
about about the fact that the payroll tax deduction plan is aimed
at lower- and middle-income voters. In retrospect, I guess, we
could have been more clear about that. But certainly we're talking
about it as a middle-class tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Flood said disputes about numbers aside, Lazio had put forward
the plan as a way to draw one of the sharpest distinctions existing
between the congressman and Clinton: How much of the nation's
surplus should be used for tax cuts. The first lady has offered a
much more modest, and less detailed, tax cut plan that adheres to
the Democratic program that would provide targeted tax cuts for
specific income groups.
</P>
<P>
   Several elements of Lazio's tax cut plan are under fire from
analysts and Democrats, who contend that their costs are
significantly understated. From a political perspective, this is
more than just a bookkeeping dispute because Lazio has gone to some
lengths to distinguish his plan from the $1.3 trillion plan offered
by Bush, putting the cost of his own plan at $776 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he put the cost of eliminating the marriage penalty
at $89 billion. But analysts said that figure accounts for just the
five-year cost of the tax cut: the 10-year cost is $293 billion,
according to the bipartisan Congressional Joint Committee on
Taxation. Similarly, Lazio put the cost of repealing part of the
Social Security tax at $56 billion. Flood acknowledged, though,
that that figure was ``several years old''; the joint committee's
estimate is $117 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Flood said that his campaign stood by its estimates, suggesting
the different views represented nothing more than customary
disputes between congressional Democrats and Republicans over
numbers. If Lazio were to accept the congressional figures, the
cost of his plan would clearly jump over $1 trillion.

PITCHERS CARRY ANGELS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The box score of the Anaheim Angels-Detroit Tigers
game will show that pitcher Scott Schoeneweis threw eight scoreless
innings. But what he really provided was resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels mired in a six-game losing streak and fighting
for their playoff lives, Schoeneweis outdueled Tigers knuckleballer
Steve Sparks to lead the Angels to a 1-0 victory Wednesday night at
Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up only two hits and got ninth-inning help from
Troy Percival, who earned his first save since July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio's double in the third inning was the key hit,
setting up Mo Vaughn's RBI groundout for the only run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels picked up a game on the AL West-leading Mariners to
close within six games with 23 to play. They still have a pulse
thanks to Schoeneweis, who became the first Angels starter to win a
game since Aug. 25 (Matt Wise vs. the Indians).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted one time to pick us up, instead of them picking me
up,'' Schoeneweis (7-7) said of his teammates. ``And tonight I
picked them up. We scored one run. For us to win, I had to give up
nothing. Thank God I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up a single to Brad Ausmus in the third inning,
but he got a double play and escaped trouble. Through six innings,
he faced the minimum 18 batters. But when he walked Damion Easley
to lead off the seventh, he knew he was in for a tough inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk the leadoff guy, you've got a big job to do,''
said Schoeneweis, who walked two and struck out six. ``It always
seems to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis got one out, but Bobby Higginson followed with a
chopper over Spiezio's head at first base and into right field,
giving the Tigers runners on first and third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis walked Dean Palmer to load the bases, but he got a
huge out when he struck out Wendell Magee on a 3-2 pitch, a 90-mph
sinker. Deivi Cruz grounded into a force play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   '``I've been in jams like that all year and got out of them,''
Schoeneweis said. ``All that experience helps you in those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels couldn't do much with Sparks, their teammate of a
year ago. Troy Glaus doubled twice off him and had a third double
in the ninth off Danny Patterson. Glaus said he hit fastballs for
the doubles off Sparks, laying off the knucklers as best he could,
including one that was clocked at 49 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly looking to hit that,'' Glaus said. ``I'll take
it and do my best to hit the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus eventually reached third in every inning he doubled, but
he never scored. In the ninth, he was thrown out in a rundown
between home and third when Bengie Molina missed a squeeze-bunt
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Angels, Schoeneweis was up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a start like that,'' Glaus said. ``We scored one
run. We needed to get picked up tonight and Scott did it. It was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis argued in the dugout with manager Mike Scioscia
after being told he wouldn't pitch the ninth. But Percival came
through with his 26th save of the season. It was his first save
opportunity since Aug. 4
</P>
<P>
   Percival walked Easley leading off the inning, but he struck out
Palmer to end the game, leaving Easley stranded at third. Although
the save was his first in more than a month, Percival said it
wasn't the most satisfying aspect of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``More satisfying for me was the way I threw the fastball, how I
got it there,'' he said. ``Being able to hit the outside corner was
huge. That's the satisfaction I get.''

PEREZ FINISHED FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers fans will no longer have to
endure the frustration and sheer agony of watching left-hander
Carlos Perez pitch in 2000. His season ended Wednesday when an MRI
and CAT scan revealed a bone spur in the back of his pitching
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is scheduled to have surgery next Thursday at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center. Team physician Dr. Frank Jobe said Perez
could be ready to return to the mound for spring training, but much
of that is contingent on Perez's rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Luke Prokopec will take Perez's spot in the
rotation and make his first major-league start Tuesday in Arizona.
Prokopec, who went 7-3 with a 2.45 ERA with Double-A San Antonio,
threw three scoreless innings in his major-league debut Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prokopec was Australia's No. 1 starter for the upcoming Olympics
before being recalled by the Dodgers, and he's fine with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the minors six year waiting for this
opportunity'' said Prokopec, 22, originally signed as an
outfielder. ``It's a situation where you win either way. You
fulfill a dream of pitching here or you pitch for your country.
Either way, it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   While Prokopec's Dodger career is just beginning, there are now
questions as to whether Perez's is over.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the surgery will do is make it virtually
impossible to trade the already unwanted Perez. He's guaranteed
$7.5 million next season and the Dodgers wanted to move him because
he's been awful the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was 5-8 with a 5.56 ERA this season after going 2-10 with
a 7.43 ERA last year. Add shoulder surgery to the mix, and even if
the Dodgers pick up a portion of the $7.5 million he's owed, moving
him will be a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do the surgery and prepare myself for next spring
training,'' said Perez, who missed the 1996 season after undergoing
shoulder surgery. ``The last time I had surgery, I came back strong
and pitched (206) innings and I still believe that after this
surgery, things are going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 29, said he felt pain in his left shoulder during his
start last Thursday in Milwaukee, in which he allowed six runs in
two-plus innings. But he felt something pop in his shoulder when he
threw a slider to Pittsburgh's Brian Giles on Tuesday. It was
Perez's last pitch. He left the game having allowed six runs in 3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work hard and be ready for spring training so I
can do what I did in '97 and '98 _ throw a lot of innings and win a
lot of ballgames,'' Perez said. ``It's hard to pitch when you're
not 100 percent. I never said anything, never complained. If I was
like in Chicago and Milwaukee, I would finish my season like that.
But (Tuesday) night was unbelievable. As soon as I heard my
shoulder pop in the back, I knew something was wrong. I had to shut
it down right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to keep rushing and keep pushing to be 100
percent when I'm not supposed to. I'm going to take my time and
keep working and do my exercises and be ready for spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Craig Callan, the director of Dodgertown, was
promoted to vice president of spring- training/minor-league
facilities, the club announced. Callan has been active in working
with the Vero Beach, Fla., community to keep the Dodgers
spring-training home in Florida. A 20-year agreement is expected to
be announced soon between the Dodgers and Vero Beach. Callan also
will oversee the Dodgers' operations in the Dominican Republic. . .

   Houston raises curtain on Texans

<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a much anticipated event that received national and
statewide attention Wednesday, owner Bob McNair revealed the name,
logo and colors of his National Football League expansion team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When McNair raised the curtain to unveil Houston Texans and a
stylized silhouette of a bull with elliptical horns, the estimated
crowd of 16,000 packing the area between Bayou Place and Wortham
Center roared its approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be a Houstonian, and I'm proud to be a Texan,''
McNair said from a stage that had been erected on Texas Avenue,
which was closed to traffic from Bagby to Smith. ``The Texan name
is distinctive. When people around the country hear Texans, they're
going to know immediately that it's Houston's NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texans are calling their colors battle red, deep steel blue
and liberty white.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of a Texan, I think of someone who's powerful,
independent, courageous and hard-working,'' said McNair, who paid
$700 million to beat out Los Angeles for the 32nd franchise. ``When
people came to this part of the country, they had it tough, but
they overcame a lot of obstacles to make Texas what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Selecting Texans as the name was no surprise because there were
reports for more than a year that Texans would be McNair's choice.
But the logo was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selecting the logo and colors was a difficult process,''
McNair said. ``The bull embodies the spirit of Texas _ bold, proud,
strong, courageous, independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans were surprised by the stylized bull, but I
think from their reaction they're going to like it. We wanted
something distinctive and timeless. We think it's contemporary and
very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston Texans _ our brand of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's unveiling was the culmination of a 10-month process
among McNair, his staff and NFL Properties, the league's marketing
arm. The three finalists were Texans, Stallions and Apollos.
Ultimately, it came down to Texans and Stallions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something unique to Houston and the NFL,'' McNair
said. ``Stallions was one of my favorites because I love horses,
but the NFL already has Broncos and Colts. And the San Diego
Chargers' secondary logo is a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our fans like Texans and our bull logo. A lot of hard
work went into the selections, just as a lot of hard work went into
the development of this city and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining McNair onstage were NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
Houston Mayor Lee Brown, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels, Harris
County Commissioner El Franco Lee, Harris County-Houston Sports
Authority Chairman Billy Burge and Harris County Sports and
Convention Corp. Chairman Mike Surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle has become a reality,'' said Tagliabue, who came
to Houston with other league executives. ``This is a really
phenomenal event. What a show of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the name and logo. They make a powerful statement. They
capture the can-do spirit of Houston and the state of Texas. It's
great to see so many fans come together for something like this. It
shows that Houston still loves football.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair received several loud ovations from the fans. The
unveiling was carried live by Houston television and radio stations
as well as ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so surprised that so many people showed up,'' he said.
``When I got on stage and looked up, there were people as far as I
could see. It was so exciting to see the looks on their faces,
especially when they cheered when the name and logo were shown.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Oilers moved to Nashville, Tenn., after the 1996
season, Houston appeared destined to be without an NFL team for
years, perhaps even decades. The NFL wanted to put the 32nd
franchise in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, a 40-year Houston resident who owned Oilers season
tickets, stepped to the forefront to pursue a team to replace the
one that Bud Adams renamed the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it would take longer for Houston to get
another team,'' Tagliabue said. ``I thought the healing process and
the turnaround wouldn't happen this fast. The fact that it did is a
testimonial to Bob and the great fans in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's a visionary, and he's proven that he can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   When McNair unveiled the name, logo and colors, there were
simultaneous announcements and news conferences in San Antonio and
Austin. Today, officials from the NFL and the Texans will make
special presentations in Beaumont and Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a news conference today at the Texas Sports
Hall of Fame in Waco. The hall will have a Texans exhibit that will
get bigger as the team grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've developed a name and logo that fans throughout
the area and around the country will embrace for years to come,''
McNair said. ``It's a logo worthy of the name and the brand of
football I expect our team to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texans begin play in what will be a realigned NFL in 2002.
They will play in the new all-glass, natural-grass, 69,000-seat,
retractable-roof stadium that is being built next to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our name and logo embody the kind of pride and achievement
that help make our area special,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as McNair lifted the curtain to reveal the name and
logo, the team relaunched its Web site _ www.houstontexans.com _
and the response was so heavy the site was slowed down for several
hours. The team said the site was getting more than a million hits
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, his staff and NFL Properties are still working on
uniform designs. They won't make a decision until after football
season. The uniforms will be revealed next summer.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Documents released Wednesday provided additional
evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford Motor Co.
knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was
announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter
regulation of the auto and tire industries.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill
in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of
Bridgestone/Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan, read apologies in halting English. ``I come before you to
apologize to you, the American people and especially to the
families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover
accidents,'' Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a
reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an
excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a
tire.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike refused to accept Firestone's
apologies or each company's efforts to blame the other. One after
another, members of Congress accused both corporations of having at
least blithely ignored public safety, and perhaps of having
conspired to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make
sure that the products they sell to the American public and other
people in other countries are safe,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala. ``And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers'
and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of
lives, I am afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also called for a larger budget for safety regulators
and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in
which companies might be found to have knowingly sold products with
lethal defects.
</P>
<P>
   After Ono's statement, Ford's chief executive, jabbed back at
Firestone. Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in prepared
remarks, ``This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the central issue of the hearings was the question of what
each company know and when.
</P>
<P>
   House investigators showed reporters a Firestone financial
statement indicating that the tire maker had found a pattern of
tire problems earlier than the company has admitted in the past. In
the document, dated Jan. 19, 2000, Firestone's financial managers
calculated that $1.84 million of the $2.88 million in legal claims
against the company for tread separation problems were for tires
made at one of its 10 North American tire factories.
</P>
<P>
   The statement identified Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill.,
as making the problem tires. Previously, Firestone said it had not
noticed the problems in Decatur until early August, when Ford
conducted an analysis of Firestone quality data.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is now recalling and replacing 6.5 million light truck
tires installed mainly on Ford Explorers, including all 15-inch
Wilderness tires made in Decatur for the Explorer since 1996. The
Firestone data shows that the Decatur plant had its worst quality
problems from 1994 through 1996, when hundreds of replacement
workers were employed there during a long dispute between Firestone
and its unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   Before that statement was disclosed, Gary Crigger, Firestone's
executive vice president of business planning, told a Senate panel
that Firestone had immediately notified regulators in early August
upon becoming aware of a problem.

   `History-making day' just what McNair hoped it would be &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ For the first time since his beloved South Carolina
Gamecocks failed to win a football game last season, Bob McNair had
trouble sleeping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation and excitement building up to what would be
Wednesday's unveiling of his NFL team's name, logo and colors
caused him to spend a restless night at his River Oaks home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I watched all the television stations to see what
they were saying about today's events,'' McNair said. ``I wanted to
get a sense of how things were being conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we got to the unveiling, the more the tension
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who paid $700 million to return the NFL to Houston, was
as excited as a child on Christmas morning. He got up at 6:30 a.m.
Wednesday to prepare for what he called a ``history-making day''
for his NFL franchise _ the Houston Texans.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most important days of his life, McNair was king
for a day. Everywhere he went, he introduced himself to people, and
they thanked him for bringing the NFL back to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be perceived in a favorable light, and I
draw energy from people who treat me that way,'' he said. ``I
really appreciate the fans taking the time to thank me. Shoot, I
want to thank them for helping make all this possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at his office in the Pennzoil Building, McNair
looked over his daily schedule of events prepared by Becky Virtue,
the executive assistant who keeps track of him by the hour, and
began to feel the exhilaration of what was in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been sleeping very well, but I got more excited the closer
we got to Wednesday,'' McNair said. ``There was a little anxiety
about how the nickname, logo and colors would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this was a one-of-a-kind event, something that'll
never be repeated. A lot of people worked a lot of hours to make it
possible. I can't tell you how proud I am with the way everything
came off. I've got so many people to thank for pulling it off.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McNair and Texans general manager Charley Casserly
went to Enron Field. McNair threw three passes to Casserly to
practice throwing out Wednesday's first pitch to Astros owner
Drayton McLane Jr. McNair used a football instead of a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have Sonny Jurgensen's arm, but he throws a tighter
spiral than Billy Kilmer,'' Casserly said. ``After his third throw,
I told him this is like when you're on the driving range and you're
supposed to quit while you're ahead, so we did.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at his office Wednesday morning, McNair went
over the details of the day's activities with Virtue and Philip
Burguieres, his close friend and confidant who is the team's vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Bob for 25 years, and this is the culmination of a
childhood dream,'' Burguieres said. ``When Bob was a kid, he said
all he cared about was sports. When he was growing up in South
Carolina, he hitchhiked 20 miles to a high school where he could
play football because the one closest to him didn't have a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's wanted an NFL team for 10 years. In the world of
business and sports, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., Ryan Reichert, the team's director of security and
McNair's son-in-law, drove McNair to the Astrodome for what was
billed as ``The Big Return.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamey Rootes, the Texans' senior vice president of marketing,
sales and promotions, spearheaded the Astrodome event that featured
Raul Allegre, a former kicker for the University of Texas and
several NFL teams, including the New York Giants and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Allegre, who owns a sports marketing business in Austin, kicked
ceremonial balls to former players from Houston, Rice and Texas
Southern _ Jason Phillips (Cougars), Hunter Brown (Owls) and
Jarrett Harper (Tigers). The balls were to be used in promotions
for the Texans in Beaumont, Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving the Astrodome, McNair asked Reichert to drive
slowly past the Texans' new stadium that is under construction next
to the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, doesn't that look great?'' McNair said. ``From this
angle, it kind of looks like a battleship.''
</P>
<P>
   When McNair travels in his private jet, he takes off and lands
at Hobby Airport, and his pilots fly over the stadium site each
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get more excited every time I see it,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to his office, McNair went to the site of
Wednesday's unveiling event on Texas Avenue between Bayou Place and
Wortham Center. He got a walk-through on the stage and the football
field that had been set up on Texas Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked around, McNair introduced himself to the workers
and anyone who had come to inspect the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, this is really first-class, isn't it?'' he said. ``I
think this is going to be great. We couldn't have picked a more
beautiful spot. It's fan-friendly with a lot of wide-open space. I
can't wait for tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   After going over last-minute details with Virtue, McNair left
for the Hard Rock Cafe, where everyone scheduled to participate
would check in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be big, really big,'' he said. ``I
hope everything comes off OK. I've got to look over my speech some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything came off better than McNair and his staff expected.
When the name, logo and colors were unveiled, the crowd estimated
at 16,000 erupted into a thunderous ovation as fireworks and
confetti filled the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed by the fans' response,'' McNair said as he
received a police escort to Enron Field to throw out the ceremonial
first pitch before the Astros-Marlins game. ``When I looked out
from the stage, all I saw was a sea of humanity. The warm and
enthusiastic reception I've got all day is something I will always
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At Enron Field, McNair threw a Texans football from the
pitcher's mound to home plate, where it was caught by McLane, who
spiked the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous about the pass,'' McNair said. ``I was afraid I
might throw it at Drayton's feet. I was fortunate to get the ball
to him, and he made a great catch. We may have to consider signing
him as one of our receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane caught the ball so easily that some wondered if he found
some stickum to put on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I didn't need any stickum to catch that ball,'' McLane
said. ``I've been practicing on making that catch. Maybe Bob will
be interested in signing me.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Enron Field, McNair returned to Bayou Place, where
he hosted a private party at the Hard Rock Cafe. After the party,
he entertained team executives, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and
league executives at a dinner party at River Oaks Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly was a night to remember,'' he said. ``I know I'll
never forget it. I hope our fans won't, either.''

 WASHINGTON: a problem. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., challenged Firestone officials
Wednesday on why the tire maker's safety officials did not take
action if the company's financial staff was aware of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you looked at it from a financial point of view and not a
consumer safety point of view?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Crigger responded, ``I'm sorry to say that's the
case.'' &UR;  &LR; Firestone switched production of tires for the Explorer
from Decatur to other fac- tories last January for reasons the
company has never explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also gave House investigators Wednesday a copy of an
internal memorandum from March 1999, describing how the company
handled the replacement of problem Firestone tires on Ford
Explorers in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, congressional investigators
gave reporters a copy of the memo with one section previously
blacked out by Ford.
</P>
<P>
   That version showed that Firestone officials had been leery of
sending a letter to tire owners in Saudi Arabia for fear that it
might have to inform the U.S. Department of Transportation and that
it might be banned from the Saudi market. ``They feel that the U.S.
DOT will have to be notified of the program, since the same product
is sold in the U.S.,'' the Ford memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   But the complete memo included a section in which the memo's
author, a Ford official named Chuck Seilnacht, mentioned that a
colleague at Ford shared Firestone's worries.
</P>
<P>
   Corey MacGillivray, an official in Ford's general counsel's
office, ``was concerned about the implications,'' as well, the memo
said. ``He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get
more info.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's Crigger said that he had been aware of discussion
within the company's legal department of how to handle tire
problems in Saudi Arabia, but was not familiar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Firestone, Ford sent a letter to owners of Explorers in
Saudi Arabia several months later that they should get new tires,
Nasser pointed out in testimony Wednesday night. Ford also took out
advertisements to promote the tire replacement effort, and covered
the program's expense after Firestone refused to do so on the
grounds that the tires were failing because of customers' misuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford did not tell U.S. regulators about the recall after
Firestone officials assured the auto- maker that the tires did not
pose a problem in the United States. Both companies still take that
position: all tires replaced in Saudi Arabia were 16-inch
Wilderness tires, a size that has not been recalled in the United
States, though some plaintiffs' law- yers say they should be.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal
regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. But the two
companies and possibly their executives could face criminal charges
by state and local prosecutors, who could accuse them of
culpability in deaths that occurred after the companies clearly
became aware of problems, said Joan Claybrook, who was the
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
under President Jimmy Carter, and is now the president of Public
Citizen, an advocacy group. A local prosecutor in Indiana tried to
charge Firestone officials with criminal negligence after the
company's huge tire recall in 1978, but was unsuccessful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the public comes to perceive Ford and Firestone as culpable,
that could also help lawyers for consumers win larger punitive
damages in lawsuits against the companies. The biggest potential
damage to both companies, however, is that their images could be so
sullied that customers start shying away from their products. Ford
and Firestone both say that their August sales showed little effect
from the recall, but some independent tire dealers say that many
customers are now avoiding Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials repeated Wednesday their contention that they had
asked Firestone repeatedly over the last two years to check the
tires for defects, and had been assured every time that any
problems resulted solely from customers' abuse of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   But senators and representatives were unsympathetic, saying that
Ford had a responsibility to make sure that it put safe tires on
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford, too, when faced with hundreds of complaints of major
tire defects on the Explorer, failed to respond with the sense of
urgency that one would expect when the safety of so many people
rested on its shoulders,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser announced Thursday night that Ford would set up an
``early warn- ing'' system with the tire industry to identify tire
problems as they L emerge. He also said Ford would tell U.S.
regulators of all for- eign recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' proposals Wednesday emphasized harsher punishment for
violators of safety rules and closer government monitoring of the
auto industry, with little attention to new safety rules for tires.
A few of the proposals put forward were so far-reaching that even
safety activists spoke against them at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., proposed that the Transportation
Department assign inspectors to auto factories much as the
Agriculture Department assigns inspectors to chicken processors,
and that automakers be required to forward their quality-control
data to the government. Claybrook said that regulators did not have
the staff necessary for such an ambitious undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that he planned to introduce
legislation as early as Sept. 7 to establish federal criminal
penalties, possibly enabling a charge such as second-degree
manslaughter, for the executives of companies that knowingly sell
defective products that kill consumers. Automakers lobbied
successfully to defeat a similar measure in 1966, when the nation's
auto regulatory system was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Violations of federal auto safety rules are currently punished
with a fine on the manufacturer of no more than $925,000, plus a
mandatory recall of the defective vehicle, auto part or tire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee for transportation, which held
one of Wednesday's hearings, said that he would consider an
immediate increase in the budget of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of
Transportation. The agency's budget was cut almost in half at the
beginning of the Reagan administration, and remains one-third lower
than it was in the Carter administration, after adjusting for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Auto defects have received little attention on Capitol Hill for
many years. Sue Bailey, the safety agency's administrator, pointed
out that the agency recommended on March 24 that Congress enact
tougher laws, including an increase in the limit on civil penalties
to at least $1 million. But no member of Congress has introduced a
bill with these proposals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current session of Congress is scheduled to end Oct. 4, with
only 21 more working days. Bills and budget changes introduced this
late in a session usually have little chance of passing, but Sens.
Specter and Shelby said in interviews that Congress and the nation
were so interested in the tire issue that legislative action was
possible, and even likely.
</P>
<P>
   The tire recall appears to have had fairly little effect on
sales of sport utility vehicles. SUV sales rose 5.1 percent in
August from the level of a year earlier, while the overall auto
market was flat. But all of the growth in sport utility sales
occurred in small car-based models like the Chrysler PT Cruiser,
which the auto industry classifies as sport utilities to qualify
for more lenient regulations that cover light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of larger SUV models like the Ford Explorer, which tend to
be based on pickup truck designs, fell .9 percent in August, partly
because the Explorer itself, the nation's best-selling sport
utility, had a drop of .8 percent. Sales of pickup-based sport
utilities soared in the mid-1990s, but their growth has been
slowing since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said that he would use the Firestone and
Ford issue to seek quick passage of legislation barring companies
from sealing information relevant to public safety in court
settlements of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers contend that Ford and Firestone have
hidden many documents with such secrecy orders.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and
environmental issues, said Ford only sealed the amounts of
settlements and did not seal engineering information.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers said it does not appear that
Bridgestone/Firestone has softened its litigation stance in the
past week, despite the threat of criminal prosecution in Venezuela,
pressure from federal regulators to recall additional tires and
blistering hearings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened scrutiny ``has had no effect whatsoever,'' said
Bruce Kaster, a lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has been a leader in
suing Bridgestone/Firestone over tread separation problems.
``There's no indication of any willingness on their part to soften
their position on discovery or settlements or anything else.''
Firestone is only settling cases, he said, ``when they start
getting nervous.''

   Caminiti's future &QL; 
an uncertain one &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ The Astros still were mum on Ken Caminiti's whereabouts
Wednesday, one day after saying he had left the team for personal
reasons and would not return this season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his voluntary admission into a
substance-dependency program has turned out to be one of the most
talked-about topics in town. The biggest question _ outside those
regarding Caminiti's personal well-being _ is what will be the next
step in his baseball career?
</P>
<P>
   Even before Caminiti's personal problems came to the forefront,
the Astros already were facing a difficult decision regarding
whether to honor his $5.2 million contract for next season or buy
out of the agreement for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, opinion within the organization was split.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Caminiti is one of the most popular players in
recent franchise history, and he was having a big season _ a .303
batting average with 15 homers and 45 RBIs in 59 games _ before a
wrist injury sent him to the disabled list on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Caminiti will celebrate his 38th birthday
during the first month of the 2001 season, and injuries have
limited him to fewer than 140 games each of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, the Astros were having doubts about bringing
Caminiti back, it's reasonable to assume the personal problems
could work against him.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, Caminiti hinted at retirement following
the 2000 season. But since the injury, he repeatedly has said he
intends to play next year, even if the Astros decide to pass on the
final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   He also recently brought up the idea of playing in the American
League, where the designated-hitter rule might give his body a
better chance to make it through a full season, not to mention
prolong his career, which began with the Astros in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the Detroit Tigers in mind. Tigers general manager Randy
Smith _ son of Astros president Tal Smith _- is a big fan of
Caminiti's. The Tigers' GM offered Caminiti a three-year, $21
million contract before Caminiti signed a free-agent deal worth
$10.5 million less to return to the Astros after a four-year stint
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Neither confirming nor denying the nature of Caminiti's personal
problems, Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said the veteran third
baseman is in control of his own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Cammy gets healthy enough physically and mentally,
it's whatever he wants to do,'' Bagwell said. ``No one else will
make that decision but him. Ultimately, it's all going to come down
to Cammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros must at least prepare for the possibility
of trying to return to their winning ways without Caminiti. Manager
Larry Dierker said veteran Bill Spiers and rookie Chris Truby could
form a productive third-base tandem on what the Astros hope will be
a contending team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the makeup of the rest of the team,'' Dierker
said. ``But I think that would work. Of course, Cammy brings
something offensively that is far beyond what you're going to get
from Truby and Spiers. But defensively, you'd be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd just have to get the offensive production from somewhere
else. And to be honest, we could probably get by with less offense
because most nights we score enough runs to win. If we had to rob
Peter to pay Paul anywhere, it would probably be offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Truby, an above-average fielder, has been trying to get everyone
to notice his work at the plate. Count Wednesday's performance in a
13-5 win over Florida as another step in the right direction. The
third baseman had three RBIs and came within a double of hitting
for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way I'm going to stick around,'' Truby said.
``If you're going to play third base in the big leagues, you have
to drive in runs and hit for power.''
</P>
<P>
   As for putting a thought in management's mind for next season,
Truby said: ``I'm not the one making the decision, but I can help
the decision. To be honest, I don't really think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, the Astros have quite a bit to think
about with regard to the future at third.

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on
optimistic fiscal forecasts, Vice President Al Gore offered his
economic vision for the future Wednesday, painting an image of a
prosperous middle class that enjoys higher income, with more home
ownership, more high-tech jobs and more people going to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cause is hard-working, middle-class families,'' he asserted
at the beginning of his speech Wednesday here at Cleveland State
University.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore outlined a series of social and economic
goals that he said were attainable given the nation's current
prosperity, and he presented a mountain of supportable detail that
his campaign hopes will make Gov. George W. Bush's financial plan
pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The speech reflected a shift in language and approach for Gore,
who has supplanted the ``working families'' he courted so
assiduously during the Democratic National Convention last month
with ``middle-class'' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman economic plan has one guiding purpose: to
help the middle-class families who have always been America's
purpose and pride, the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens
and live the American dream,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, Gore used the phrase ``working
families'' nine times. In Wednesday's speech, which was less than
half as long, he used the phrase ``middle-class'' 12 times and the
phrase ``working families'' only once.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Gore's economic blueprint reignited a debate with
Bush over who would best manage the projected budget surplus over
the next decade without ruining the economy. And Bush wasted little
time Wednesday attacking Gore's plan, saying the vice president had
made so many spending promises that a Gore administration would
devour the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect such perceptions, Gore included in his 191-page plan
a pledge to set aside $300 billion as a hedge against overly
optimistic fiscal projections. Aside from the rainy day fund,
Gore's plan is largely a synthesis of many specific programs he has
described over the last several months. But Wednesday was the first
time the vice president had drawn all of these stray threads
together into a broader theme.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his 10 goals were to: eliminate the debt by 2012;
protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; double the
number of families that have more than $50,000 in savings; reduce
income taxes on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years;
raise family income by a third over the next decade; enable seven
in 10 families to own their own homes; increase the number of
people who go to college; reduce poverty to below 10 percent for
the first time since poverty statistics were kept in 1959; cut the
gap between wages earned by men and women; and create 10 million
new high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the plan beget others. For example, eliminating
the debt by 2012 would reduce interest rates and thus make school
loans more affordable so that more people could attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The economic blueprint that Gore offered Wednesday is a road map
of middle-class life. It envisions expanded income in continuing
boom times, with more people going to college and working in
well-paying, high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on the middle class is something of a turn away
from the more combative populist language that has preoccupied him
for weeks. It also reflects in part the arrival of a new pollster,
Stanley Greenberg, who has written extensively about the middle
class and helped Bill Clinton capture that broad middle swatch of
voters in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said he deliberately used the phrase ``middle
class'' in Wednesday's speech because he was also talking about
reducing the number of people in poverty and wanted to distinguish
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been using the ``middle class'' in
speeches for days now, and has been losing ``working families.''
The blueprint he released Wednesday was titled ``Prosperity for
America's Families.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who at one time advised Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker, on word choice and language,
said that Gore appeared to have moved deliberately away from
``working families'' to the ``middle class'' to broaden his reach.
He said that voters perceived ``working families'' as applying to
young couples and excluding people who were retired or about to
retire _ a huge block of voters who are especially important
because they tend to go to the polls in larger numbers than younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battleground in this election is for the 30-somethings and
the near-retirees,'' Luntz said. As a result, he said, based on his
work conducting focus groups with voters for MSNBC, the phrase
``working families'' was working against Gore, not only with its
connotations of youth but its connotations of class distinctions
that Americans are loathe to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, particularly the desire to raise family income by
one-third over the next decade, assumes an annual growth rate in
incomes of 2.9 percent _ a fairly ambitious goal, even though the
most recent figures available show that from 1997 to 1998, median
family income grew 3.3 percent, to $46,737 from $45,262. Gore
budget advisers acknowledged the country had never sustained such
growth over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience to ``read my plan,'' a pointed reference
to the infamous command by former President George Bush, father of
the Republican nominee, to ``read my lips: no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on cross-your-fingers economics that says
we can give more to the people who already have the most and then
just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,'' Gore
said, again contrasting himself with the Reagan-Bush era.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to demonstrate that his approach was fiscally
conservative, Gore said he would set aside $300 billion in a
rainy-day fund, a hedge against overly optimistic surplus
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve
fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or
health care,'' Gore said Wednesday. ``And unlike the promises made
on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering
America's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, President Clinton's former director of the
Congressional Budget Office and now an analyst with the Urban
Institute, said that the plan, especially the rainy-day fund, was
``fiscally prudent and politically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore's goals would essentially ``fall in his lap''
if the economy continued to expand, and results like that appealed
to most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people view themselves as middle class,''
he said. ``Those who are not in the middle class have aspirations
to be there and they view those aspirations as realistic, so you
don't offend anybody.''

CSUN DEFENSE MUST CONTAIN RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Same challenge, different team.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's football team will be forced to stop the
run again this week _ or at least try. CSUN plays Southwest Texas
State, a team which had two running backs top the 100-yard mark in
a 34-13 win over Midwestern State last week. And it's no secret the
Matadors failed to contain the run in their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (0-1) surrendered 583 rushing yards in a 55-6 loss to Air
Force. But the Falcons run the option, something CSUN probably
won't see the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite such an amazing offensive performance by Air Force, I
don't consider that indicative of our defense,'' CSUN coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``I really believe the offense put our defense in a
tough spot. . . . We had some bright spots, especially in the
secondary. Overall, I'm relatively pleased with the way we
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's hoping for a better output against the Bobcats, who
got stellar performances from running backs Bronso Sanders and Lee
Davis. They ran for 157 yards on 20 carries (7.6 yards-per-carry
average) and 105 yards on 16 carries (6.5 average), respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some pretty swift running backs,'' CSUN linebacker
Cos Abercrombie said. ``We understand that. Of course (after Air
Force), we have to put the emphasis on the run. That's a lot of
yards for one game. Everybody feels bad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hicks out again: Running back Matt Hicks is not expected to
play Saturday. Hicks, who was supposed to make his debut with the
Matadors since transferring from Air Force, is out with the flu. He
missed Tuesday's and Wednesday's practices and isn't expected to
travel to San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed but it happens,'' Kearin said. ``He's sick.
It'll work out OK. He's really close (to playing).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Defensive back Karalus Doyle (hip) and
defensive end Joseph Roberson (knee) will play Saturday. Defensive
back Sean Atkins (knee) hasn't practiced this week and probably
won't travel to Texas. Atkins bruised his knee against Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   __ They're back: Backup quarterback Mitch Ryerson and receiver
Jason Stone served one-game suspensions for violating school policy
and will be available Saturday. . . . Tight end Cory DiSanti
practiced for the first time Tuesday. DiSanti was waiting for a
summer-class grade to be completed and processed to earn his
Associate of Arts degree.
</P>
<P>
   __ Up in the air: Receiver Ryan Felix _ a transfer from Utah
State _ didn't play Saturday and didn't practice Wednesday. Felix
is trying to clear up academic-eligibility issues from the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turn that dial: This will be the first season fans won't be
able to listen to Matadors football games on the radio. CSUN
couldn't raise the $12,000 needed for the KCSN broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Once Matadors coach Jeff Kearin learned the money wasn't raised
through CSUN, he thought about trying to raise it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to have it, I was going to have to raise the
$12,000,'' Kearin said. ``But I had to fight other battles. I'm
sick about it, but that's life.''

MTA, UNIONS STILL BARGAINING

(New version to correct name. Disregard previous version) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ MTA rail and bus operators said Wednesday that they
have no plans to strike before Friday as talks continue on wages,
work rules and the proposed Valley transit zone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Amalgamated Transit
Union officials said they hope to resume negotiations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to meet with them any time,'' MTA spokesman Marc
Littman said. ``We are anxious to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the ATU, which represents more than 1,800 bus and
train mechanics, said public transportation should be running at
least up until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions representing most MTA workers agreed Monday to a
five-day extension in talks, but the ATU rejected the extension,
saying it would consider on a day-to-day basis whether to walk off
the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the United Transportation Union and the
Transportation Communications International Union, which represent
about 4,950 bus and train drivers and clerical workers, met with
MTA negotiators. Those talks are expected to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to meet with the UTU and the TCU and continue
to invite the ATU to meet with us,'' MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a projected $438 million operating deficit over the next
10 years, the MTA is attempting to reduce its costs and is trying
to hold the line in negotiations to achieve those savings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Norton, spokesman for the UTU, said negotiations bogged
down Wednesday over the MTA's proposal to require drivers to work
four 10-hour days spread over 12 to 13 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said the long days could fatigue drivers and endanger
passengers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our drivers have the lives of their passengers in their hands
and we believe this is a serious threat to the safety and
well-being of the schoolchildren and others who are dependent on
public transit,'' UTU General Chairman James A. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Littman said many MTA drivers already work more than 12 hours a
shift and not just four days a week, but five and six days a week,
collecting large amounts of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our operators are paid overtime to work 12-hour shifts
and if the UTU was concerned about driver fatigue and safety then
they would not permit their members to volunteer to work that
overtime,'' Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   The looming strike, which would clog freeways and shut down bus
and train service to the MTA's 450,000 passengers a day, is
worrying riders in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in wheelchairs who are absolutely terrified
of the strike,'' said Van Nuys resident Rick Rofman, a 57-year-old
disabled rider who depends on public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar resident Bart Reed, a legally blind man who is a member
of the MTA's Passenger Advisory Committee, said the mood on the
buses this week is very somber. ``Every bus was sort of like
waiting for doomsday,'' said Reed, 48.

   Texans' logo development reflects `spirit of achievement'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Selecting a name, logo and colors for an NFL franchise is
a long, difficult and multifaceted process involving dozens of
people in several states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To start from scratch and end up with the Texans name, the logo
of a bull with elliptical horns, and team colors of battle red,
deep steel blue and liberty white was a challenge for the many
designers and marketers who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a name that was distinctive and timeless and not
faddish, something contemporary and powerful,'' team owner Bob
McNair said. ``We wanted a name with a strong state association,
something that was representative of Texas and unique to Houston
and the NFL. A Texan is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the spirit of the bull reflects Texas _ bold, proud,
strong, courageous, independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red, white and blue are the colors of our state flag. Our
scheme differs from the state flag in that we're using a darker
blue and a lighter red.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before McNair was awarded his franchise in October 1999,
there were nicknames that interested him, including Texans,
Stallions and Toros. After he paid $700 million for the 32nd
franchise, McNair met with executives from NFL Properties, the
league's marketing arm, to start the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creative process began with a blank sheet of paper,''
McNair said. ``We tried to capture an image that reflects the
spirit of Texas, and that wasn't an easy task, because Texas means
so much to so many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas can mean things like the space industry, oil, energy,
rodeo and real estate. It can be urban, suburban or rural. A Texan
represents the diverse interests of our state. There was a
challenge of blending the old with the new. We wanted something
dynamic that was separate and distinct from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to build on our great heritage by blending the past
with the present and future.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is excited about the name, logo and colors and how the
process played out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire process has been driven by Mr. McNair and his
image of his team,'' said Dave Goldman, a senior director at NFL
Properties. ``He was going for something bigger than the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept telling us he didn't want a fancy design or something
hyped to sell tickets. He said he wanted something the community
could be proud of, something that represented the best parts of his
city. During the process, we also remained sensitive of NFL
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman met with McNair for the first time two weeks after
Houston got the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Mr. McNair what he wanted his team to represent,''
Goldman said. ``In November, we met with our research group and set
up our first focus group. We asked them what was their image of
Houston, the NFL and Texas and what they expect from their team.
That gave us a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our working catch phrase was spirit of achievement. We met
with focus groups in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Galveston and
Beaumont. We looked at a lot of different names.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the finalists, Stallions and Apollos
didn't really capture that spirit of achievement. A Texan is an
all-inclusive name. It's very ambiguous. A stallion is a horse. An
apollo is a spaceship. A Texan can be an awful lot of things, and
that was the challenge. We could design a Texan to be anything, but
we had to create an identity behind the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those involved in the process with Goldman were NFL
executives Marty Fitzpatrick, the design director who led the
design team; Dave Kocsis, the senior manager of research who
coordinated the focus groups; and Brian McCarthy, director of
corporate communications, as well as commissioner Paul Tagliabue
and vice presidents Joe Browne and Roger Goodell.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a process taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we looked at every conceivable possibility,'' McNair
said. ``I think we had more than 81,000 suggestions in our (name
the team) contest. We eliminated most of them because we didn't
want to consider anything that generated negative feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dealt with over 40 focus groups and had discussions with
over 500 people in those groups. We asked the focus groups for
their perceptions of Houston, the NFL and Texas. We found Houston
and the state of Texas described with words like dynamic,
forward-thinking, proud, determined, mentally tough. What's been
achieved in Texas is affirmation of that. Texans are people of
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Once McNair decided Texans was his first choice, he contacted
Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, whose team was originally the Dallas
Texans before it moved to Kansas City. McNair didn't need Hunt's
permission to use the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a courtesy, Lamar's the first person I spoke to, and he
said he'd be delighted,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oilers became the Titans last year, they used the New
York Jets' original name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what's happened in the last two years, the
history and heritage of the NFL has been born again with Titans and
Texans,'' Goldman said. ``Once Mr. McNair decided on the name, we
had to create the logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've worked with the Buccaneers, Titans and Browns,
among others, and this one was tough because there's no obvious
symbol of a Texan. What image could we design that symbolically
demonstrated the strength and energy of Texas _ that spirit of
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we met with the focus groups, we found out that Texans are
proud of their heritage and tradition, but they don't want to be
typecast. We think the logo is a stylized, modern symbol that's
unique to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Texans, the designers gave McNair some logo and
color possibilities utilizing the Stallions name, which was a
personal favorite because of his love of horses and his involvement
in the horse racing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have taken the easy road and selected Stallions,''
Goldman said. ``A horse would have been the logo. But a horse is a
horse. He said he didn't want to just put a horse on a helmet,
because this is about the Houston community.
</P>
<P>
   ``In mid-August, we rented Giants Stadium for a day for logo and
uniform testing. We wanted to see the logo and colors in daylight
with still photos and video. Mr. McNair wants something unique,
something that'll make people go, `Wow! That's the Houston Texans
uniform.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman disputes any claims that the Texans name won't sell
outside Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal is to be accepted in the Houston marketplace
and the surrounding communities,'' he said. ``If the team wins, and
fans around the country find the logo attractive, why wouldn't it
catch on? We think it's outstanding.''

U.S. URGES OPEC TO INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With oil prices surging to their highest level in a
decade, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called on oil-exporting
nations Wednesday to increase their production.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that OPEC seriously considers increasing
production,'' Richardson said, referring to the 11-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   As crude oil prices rose to $34.90 a barrel in New York
Wednesday _ the highest level since the 1990 military buildup
before the Persian Gulf War _ Richardson said that energy costs
were ``unacceptably high.'' U.S. officials voiced concerns that
home heating oil prices this winter could be 30 percent more than
they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters, Richardson said OPEC should increase
production enough to reduce prices to $20 to $25 a barrel or risk
further disrupting the world economy. OPEC ministers are scheduled
to meet in Vienna on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   World markets ``are very clearly insisting that there's not
enough oil on the market to bring stability,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is under increasing pressure to do
something about oil prices. The White House has prepared a
contingency plan to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, although it has not yet acceded to demands from some
lawmakers to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip in February to the Middle East, Richardson secured a
promise from Saudi Arabia to raise its output. The Saudi oil
minister reported today that his nation had increased production by
an additional 600,000 barrels a day since July, a 7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have so far declined to say exactly how much
additional production they are seeking from OPEC nations. &QL;

   Davenport proves she's not ready to step aside &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ It was a case study in the ephemeral nature of
self-confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams began her U.S. Open quarterfinal Wednesday night
behaving exactly as a defending champion is expected to. There was
a swagger in her step, and her cruise-missile groundstrokes were
equal parts ability and attitude. Hence, the would-be has-been, Ms.
Yesterday's News, Lindsay Davenport, seemed in trouble from the
get-go, facing this buffed, steely-eyed woman-child who exuded a
supreme certainty that she couldn't possibly be beaten by anybody
not named Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to be more specific, anybody not named after the second
planet to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, having lost her last five matches to Serena _ not to
mention her most recent one to sis in the Wimbledon final _ needed
to stave off three break points, clawing through five deuces in the
process, simply to stay level in the match through two games.
</P>
<P>
   Watching, you couldn't help thinking, ``Poor Lindsay.'' At 24,
her window of opportunity was being slammed down upon her fingers.
Serena, never mind Venus, was only going to grow stronger, smarter
and more polished. As fine a player as Davenport had become,
winning three of the four majors in a two-year period, the Williams
girls already were making her appear gawky and slow, downright
un-athletic by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   As Serena guaranteed later, before stomping out of her
post-mortem in a petulant huff, there will be a
Williams-vs.-Williams Grand Slam final in the future. But what this
evening's result reminded us was that there won't be one until
Lindsay concedes to its inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   She has perhaps played better, if only because she did struggle
with her serve a bit, but she never has played with more tenacity,
with more dogged determination to prove her day isn't done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was expecting an all-Williams final,'' Davenport
said with a twinkle in her eye, ``but I didn't want that to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Serena talk, nobody wanted it to happen. Alas, she has
yet to learn to handle defeat as gracefully as she plays, and she
showed her brat side Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Serena sniffed, ``no one would want to see an
all-Williams final because everyone doesn't really like us. That's
just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   You assume she didn't mean that exactly as it came out because,
if she did, it likely is the dumbest thing she has ever said. And,
when a reporter pressed her on the remark, it only made her angrier
than she already was about losing. Remember, she is still 18, an
age when it is practically mandated to do and say dumb things.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Serena had shown a measure of courage by surviving five
match points against her serve at the end, but she was pretty much
broken emotionally by then, having sensed the futility of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   She already had cracked a racket out of frustration, and that
was before she dropped six consecutive games, finding herself being
pummeled at every turn _ 6-4, 6-2 _ by her own grip-it-and-rip-it
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I was getting a good hit on the ball,'' Davenport
said. ``I waswasn't being jerked around. I was able to dictate
where the ball was going.''
</P>
<P>
   As we've learned, Serena much prefers to force the issue, using
her physical strength to bludgeon opponents into whimpering,
shivering submission. But Davenport turned the tables on the kid.
</P>
<P>
   She replied to power with more power. The harder the ball came,
and Serena does give it a nasty whack, that much harder it went
screaming back.
</P>
<P>
   Williams appeared to be surprised by Lindsay's tenacity, saying:
``You know, she should take that attitude toward everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent meeting in Los Angeles last month,
Davenport had collapsed at 6-5 and serving in the third set. Also,
she had definitely been overpowered by Venus at Wimbledon, although
a sore back and a cold contributed to her demise that day. She
subsequently suffered a foot injury, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to be able to play 100 percent,'' Davenport
said, ``to finally be able to play full out.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't had that much freedom on the court physically since
probably a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, pre-match family discussions, nonetheless, you
suspect Lindsay's potential for upsetting the Williams' apple cart
here was given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, in victory, maintained her humility, something Serena
and Venus frequently struggle with. (Yes, Daddy's influence.)
Venus, of course, still lurks, and even if Martina Hingis turns the
elder Williams away, that only means the top-ranked, top-seeded
woman on the WTA Tour will be at the top of her game as well.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the growing perception in many quarters _ making
Serena's paranoia all the harder to fathom _ the WTA does not yet
stand for Williams Tennis Association. Trouncing a Williams in the
quarters only earned Davenport a deserved place in the semis,
against the upstart Russian Elena Dementieva.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big match to get through,'' Lindsay said. ``It felt
like a final. But it was just a quarterfinal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just any quarterfinal, though.

   Booty trades major leagues for LSU football &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RICHARD JUSTICE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BATON ROUGE, La. _ Josh Booty has ended up right where he was
supposed to be from the moment he first stepped onto a football
field: He's LSU's starting quarterback. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as some told him he would be one of baseball's next great
players, and even as he got a huge signing bonus and a World Series
ring from the Florida Marlins, his football dream never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   While some looked at him and saw Brooks Robinson, he always
looked at himself and saw John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved it,'' he said. ``It's what I want to do with
my life. I still think I can play in the NFL _ if it's God's
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he begins an interview by mentioning that the
Marlins are playing in Houston and that his buddy, Florida first
baseman Kevin Millar, homered Tuesday night. He mentions how much
fun it has been to see so many of his minor league teammates play
in the big leagues the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met a lot of great guys,'' he said. ``I'll keep in touch
with those guys for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He just won't play with them. Instead, he'll be starting at
quarterback when LSU hosts Houston here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In his first appearance of the season, he showed athleticism and
a rocket arm in completing 12 of 15 passes for 291 yards and two
touchdowns while splitting time with Rohan Davey in a victory over
Western Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   New LSU coach Nick Saban said Davey and Booty will continue to
share the position, but Booty clearly is the fan favorite. With
almost every completion, the talk-show phone lines light up from
Lafayette to Opelousas with Tiger faithful who say they have seen a
glimpse of the next Bert Jones or the next Archie Manning.
</P>
<P>
   His life has been like that since he was a schoolboy star at
Shreveport's Evangel High. He led his team to the 1993 state
championship and set national records with 11,700 career passing
yards and 126 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Parade Magazine and USA Today chose him their national player of
the year over fellow Louisiana prep star Peyton Manning of nearby
Newman. Bill Walsh called Booty the best high school quarterback he
had ever seen, and when Booty signed with LSU in 1994, he was given
a simple label: savior.
</P>
<P>
   He still may be LSU's savior, but his path has been a strange
one.
</P>
<P>
   He was also one of the best high school baseball players in the
country and when the Marlins made him the fifth pick of the 1994
draft and offered him a $1.6-million signing bonus, Booty signed.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't hit. In five minor league seasons, he had a .198
career average with 62 homer runs and 621 strikeouts. Still, he
worked his way up the system and got a September call-up and a
World Series ring in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the 1998 season as the Marlins' starting third baseman
while Bobby Bonilla was injured. When Bonilla got well, Booty
returned to the minors with a respectable .269 career batting
average in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   But he hit just .202 at Class AA Portland and was placed on
waivers after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great kid and has a world of talent,'' said Cincinnati
Reds superscout Gary Hughes, who signed Booty for the Marlins. ``He
played third base as well as anyone I've ever seen. I've seen him
make Brooks Robinson plays. I've seen him go behind the third-base
coach's box to field a ball and throw a guy out.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I don't think he was ever totally committed to baseball,
and he'd probably tell you that now. But I'll always wonder what
would have happened if he'd been totally dedicated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Booty, now 25, apparently never came close to that kind of
dedication.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins were concerned enough about his love of football to
include a clause preventing him from playing it during the
offseason. Booty didn't play football, but he did the next best
thing. Instead of taking part in winter ball, as the organization
wanted, he returned home right after each season and went to every
high school, college and pro game he could get to.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed retiring from baseball after his second season, but
when the Marlins ordered him to repay the signing bonus, he stayed.
Finally, after the 1998 season, both sides were ready for a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minor league baseball is a real rough life,'' he said. ``I
don't see anything being any harder. You play 30 to 40 spring
training games, then 140 to 160 games in the regular season. That's
a lot of playing time. That's a lot of travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the friendships I made, but it was difficult being
away from home. I wanted to give it a good chance because I loved
baseball growing up. I loved it as much as football. I didn't want
to just give it one year and move on. I thought playing in the big
leagues might help me. The more I played, the more I missed playing
football and playing with my brother and coming to LSU and
different things. The longer I was away from football, the more I
wanted to be playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he seems happy. His brother, Abram, is a wide receiver for
the Tigers, and throughout the Bayou there's hope that Saban and
his new staff will escort Booty down the aisle of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Purple and Gold magazine, which covers LSU sports, greeted his
enrollment by calling him ``the Prodigal Son, the Golden Boy and
the Messiah all rolled into one.'' Three other publications
splashed him on their yearbook covers.
</P>
<P>
   He's not like most college students. He lives in an off-campus
apartment, drives a black Corvette and wears a World Series ring.
If the NFL seems like a distant dream to most of his teammates, he
has been close enough to glory to really believe it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought his first season back in football would be
like, Booty smiles and says: ``I envisioned coming here and setting
the world on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Booty started eight games in 1999 _ and threw a
school-record 19 interceptions _ while attempting the third-most
passes in school history. He had some moments _ like throwing three
touchdown passes against Ole Miss _ but he also threw three
interceptions in three straight games and was picked off four times
against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   He was the most visible player in a terrible season.
</P>
<P>
   LSU alums began to call for coach Gerry DiNardo's head early on,
and when the season began badly, it came undone in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   If Booty was stung by any of this, he doesn't show it. He
remains as instantly likeable and open as he was in the minor
leagues, and if he's inclined to blame someone else for his
problems, he refuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got put in a lot of hard situations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps returning to football and being an instant star after
five years in baseball was asking too much. Now, having dropped 30
pounds, to 215, he seems to be zipping the ball as well as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if last season had lowered his expectations of himself, he
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question. I feel like I can play in the NFL.
Maybe I had to go through something like that to get to where I
need to be. I was thrown into the fire last year. Everything
dominoed. We didn't know if we were going to have a new coach week
to week. We weren't healthy. I tried to do too much. I've tried
(this year) to get back to the basics. I think I've done some of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Louis Williams put it simply: ``He's a completely
different quarterback this year. He was so raw last year. He was
supposed to be all-everything, and he struggled the first year. I
think now the pressure's off a little bit, and he can keep growing
with the team.''

   Truby helps Astros punt Marlins &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ The NFL is still two years from returning to Houston, but
you wouldn't have guessed it Wednesday night at Enron Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During pre-game festivities, owner Drayton McLane Jr. caught a
ceremonial football and spiked it at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the dugout, several Astros tried on a football helmet bearing
the logo of the city's new NFL franchise, the Texans.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the Astros commemorated the occasion by putting
two touchdowns and an extra point on the scoreboard in a 13-5
victory over the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing baseball's version of the run-and-shoot, the Astros
blitzed the Marlins for seven runs in the fifth inning, and
righthander Jose Lima took over from there for his seventh victory
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game for a lot of different people when you
score that many runs,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more so if your name is Chris Truby.
</P>
<P>
   Truby, the Astros' rookie third baseman, tied a season high with
three hits. He hit a run-scoring triple in the second, a two-run
homer in the fifth, and a single in the eighth. He also was retired
on a long fly to center in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Truby hit only four home runs at Class AAA New Orleans before
his call-up in mid-June, but he has eight homers and 38 RBIs in 58
games with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I'm going to stick around and play third base in
the big leagues is to drive in runs and hit home runs,'' said
Truby, who batted .319 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-2, the Astros erupted in the fifth inning, sending 11
batters to the plate. Marlins starter Jesus Sanchez (8-10) failed
to retire any of the six batters he faced and allowed three
consecutive doubles before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros loaded the bases on a pair of walks and an infield
single before Julio Lugo lined an 0-2 pitch into the left-field
corner to tie the game at 4. Lugo has five hits in the last two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, who had three RBIs to raise his team-leading total
to 113, followed with a two-run ground-rule double that bounced
into the front row of seating at Ruggles Restaurant in center field
an estimated 410 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Truby unleashed a two-run homer off the top of the
facade in left field against reliever Manny Aybar. As the ball
cleared the Crawford Boxes, Marlins left fielder Cliff Floyd didn't
even bother looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The seven runs tied a season high; the Astros scored seven in
the 10th inning of a 14-8 victory May 7 at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing three runs in fifth, Lima (7-15) clamped down and
held the Marlins to one over his final three innings. He allowed
five runs and seven hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lima improved to 5-0 in six career starts against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitches good against us all the time,'' Marlins third
baseman Mike Lowell said. ``We hit him decent. With five runs you
would figure to be in the game. They just outslugged us. After five
innings it was no contest.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing a club-record 13 straight games, Lima has
resurrected his season, going 6-2 with four no-decisions since July
9.
</P>
<P>
   His only mistakes Wednesday were a pair of walks that prolonged
innings and allowed the Marlins to score in the fourth and fifth
innings _ and a hanging 0-2 slider that Preston Wilson sent over
the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lima also allowed a pinch homer to Chris Clapinski in the
seventh. He has allowed 42 home runs this season, a club record and
the most in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched pretty well inside,'' Lima said. ``I straightened
myself out after the first couple of innings.''
</P>
<P>
   He also helped himself at the plate, going 1-for-3 with a single
and two runs. ``A knock (hit), a walk and two runs is pretty
impressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Scott Linebrink pitched a scoreless ninth inning in his
Astros debut.
</P>
<P>
   After the Marlins tied the game at 1 in the fourth inning,
Moises Alou put the Astros back in front in the bottom half of the
inning with his 27th homer _ a solo shot that landed in the
left-center field concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Florida answered with three runs in the fifth. With two outs,
Alex Gonzalez singled to left and Lima walked Floyd before Wilson
drilled a three-run homer to right.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Astros answered _ very loudly _ with seven in the
bottom of the fifth.

 AUTOMAKERS TRY TO PULL PLUG ON ELECTRIC CAR MANDATE IN CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The world's largest automakers are pushing hard for
the state to abandon its first-in-the-nation requirement that at
least 10 percent of the new cars sold in California in 2003 be
nonpolluting.
</P>
<P>
   At a two-day hearing starting Thursday, the state Air Resources
Board will hear from more than 100 people, including the powerful
opponents of its 1990 order and environmentalists who have battled
for a decade to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say there is almost no market for electric cars,
which are expensive to make and hard to refuel. Environmentalists
counter that there would be plenty of buyers if the cars were
available.
</P>
<P>
   The action the board takes tomorrow when the hearings conclude
will be a key test of the environmental mettle of the Davis
administration, the first Democratic one in control since the
requirement was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board will not make a final decision this week, it
could relax the requirement by studying alternative ways to improve
air quality _ which would be a victory for automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a study could help carmakers make their case that there are
better ways to lower emissions than requiring them to build
expensive battery-powered or alternative-fuel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If California sticks with the mandate, it will accelerate
investments in advanced-technology cars, which will have
implications all over the world for future propulsion systems,''
said V. John White, the Sierra Club's chief lobbyist in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the board's staff on how the mandate is working says
nonpolluting cars offer `'comprehensive environmental, energy and
societal benefits'' and represent the ``gold standard'' for air
pollution control.
</P>
<P>
   But the board, which is not bound by its staff recommendations,
may make some concessions to carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mandate was all about clean air when it was adopted in
1990,'' said Steven Douglas, director of environmental affairs for
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include 13
of the world's largest automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mandate should still be about clean air and not forcing
electric vehicles on consumers,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was created 10 years ago, the mandate has been a target
for carmakers and their oil industry allies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the two teamed up, persuading the air board to abandon
requirements that 2 percent of cars sold in 1998 be nonpolluting,
increasing to 5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In return, automakers signed deals with the state committing
them to building a certain number of nonpolluting cars, depending
on their market share.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement _ coupled with existence of the mandate _ has
spurred more research into alternative-fuel cars and ``hybrids,''
which burn gasoline but use batteries to reduce pollution. Honda
and Toyota sell two hybrid models.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 2,300 zero-emission cars and light trucks _
ZEVs, as the state calls them _ operating on California streets and
highways. All have been sold during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate, the minimum number of zero-emission cars and
light trucks that would have to be sold in 2003 is 22,000 _ a
nearly tenfold increase.
</P>
<P>
   That could climb higher depending on how many nonpolluting or
low-polluting cars, such as hybrids, are on the highways by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers say there is not enough consumer demand for
20,000 more electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists counter that there are waiting lists of people
who want nonpolluting cars but that carmakers are not building
them.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the California ZEV Alliance, a group of 10
environmental and health groups backing the mandate, used an
electric U.S. Postal Service truck to deliver more than 50,000
letters to the governor, urging him to stick with the mandate.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by one of the alliance's members found that consumers
would buy between roughly 150,000 and 226,000 electric cars each
year if they were available at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   And that, auto makers argue, is the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Electric cars are not cheap. Building them is expensive, and
battery costs are prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   They are also not as convenient as gasoline-fueled cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrical vehicles cost twice as much as gas vehicles. The
refueling time is four hours compared to five minutes, and the
refueling stations are nonexistent,'' said Steven Douglas, director
of environmental affairs for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, whose members include 13 of the world's biggest
carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In its own study, the air board says freeway-capable ZEVs will
cost $20,000 more to make than conventional cars _ not counting
research and development costs borne by the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Without government subsidies, the board's study says, it will be
difficult to woo consumers into abandoning their gasoline-powered
cars for cleaner-performing vehicles that travel only 100 miles or
so before they need recharging.
</P>
<P>
   A bill awaiting action by Davis would offer $18 million in
$3,000 grants to purchasers of zero-emission vehicles, well below
the amount of subsidies needed.
</P>
<P>
   The state's funding source for subsidies to zero-emission
vehicle buyers is also drying up. The board may try to find a new
source.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and alternative energy advocates contend that
the cost argument used by carmakers is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five major automakers made $25 billion in profits in 1999,
mainly from selling gas-guzzling higher polluting sports utility
vehicles. It's time for an environmental dividend,'' said Jamie
Knapp, a spokeswoman for the ZEV alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say there are less expensive ways to improve air
quality.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the state's steady ratcheting down of
allowable emission levels for gas-powered cars has significantly
increased air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing automakers to create expensive battery-powered cars that
consumers do not want will have little effect on air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas says placing more than 20,000 more zero-emission cars on
the road will reduce pollutants by 1 to 2 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations by the air board to reduce spills and emissions from
lawn-mower gas cans will remove 26 tons of pollutants a day,
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are crystal clear,'' said Douglas. Electric vehicles
are astronomically expensive. The program is astronomically
expensive, and the benefits are next to nil.''

5 TEENS ACCUSED OF KILLING FOOD DELIVERYMAN TO AVOID PAYING
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS grafs 11-13 with progress of case, quotes)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW and SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It looked at first like a botched robbery: the owner
of a Chinese takeout place was lured late Friday night to a dark
dead-end street in Queens, where he was jumped and bludgeoned to
death. The killers left him with $600.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said Wednesday that the real motive was
heartbreakingly mundane: he had been killed by a group of
teen-agers who wanted a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   The five teen-agers, who were all under arrest Wednesday and
scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday night, had no criminal records
and were mostly from solidly middle-class families. Prosecutors
said they were hungry and wanted to eat without paying, so they
used a cell phone to call in their $60 order _ General Tso's
chicken, shrimp egg foo yong, chicken with broccoli and shrimp lo
mein _ to a vacant house on 176th Street in Springfield Gardens,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   When the deliveryman, Jin-Sheng Liu, 44, arrived shortly before
midnight, he was jumped from behind, covered with a bedsheet and
pummeled to death with repeated head blows from fists and at least
one brick. As police officers converged on the scene, the group _
four boys and a girl, none older than 17 _ fled with a bag of food
to one of the boys' homes to eat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, police, who cracked the case by tracing the
call to the restaurant on the cell phone, began zeroing in on a
group of teen-agers who lived in the neighborhood around the vacant
house at 130-19 176th St. The youngest, a skinny 14-year-old karate
enthusiast named Robert Savage, was arrested Tuesday as he was
riding his bicycle outside his parents' neatly kept home in
Springfield Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It was Savage, investigators said, who struck the most serious
blows, smashing the skull of Liu with a brick. Liu, the owner of
the Golden Wok at 192-15 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens,
was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just did something, and it turned out ugly,'' said Robert
Eilam, 20, who lives across the street from Savage. Eilam said that
on Tuesday afternoon, a few hours before Savage was arrested, the
boy had started to cry for no apparent reason. ``He was just acting
as if he were so sorry about something,'' Eilam said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage and the other teen-agers are being prosecuted as adults.
Each faces multiple charges of second-degree murder, robbery and
criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terribly tragic case,'' said Richard A. Brown, the
Queens district attorney, said at a news conference Wednesday.
``Mr. Liu was a hard-working immigrant who leaves behind a wife and
two children. He was killed without provocation and without reason.
It was a shocking crime, which leaves us all shaking our heads and
wondering why these kids would do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities identified the other teen-agers as James Stone,
16, of 176-31 130th Ave.; Jamel Murphy, 17, of 219-05 131st Ave.;
Darryl Tyson, 17, of 132-07 178th St.; and Stacy Royster, 17, of
257-52 148th Drive. Because of his age, Savage faces a maximum
sentence of nine years to life in prison, prosecutors said. The
other four face up to 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers were arraigned Wednesday night and ordered held
without bail. Later, their lawyers told reporters that detectives
obtained statements improperly, and they disputed the authorities'
account of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Savage's law- yer, Rudy Hirschheimer, disputed the
prosecution's contention that his client had acknowledged striking
Liu with a brick. ``My client said he didn't hit anyone with a
brick,'' he said, joining with other defense law- yers in
suggesting that a sixth teen-age boy may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Neville Reed, a lawyer for Tyson, said that police officers re-
peatedly assured Tyson's par- ents that their son did not need a
lawyer during questioning. ``The so- called statement they obtained
from my client was in my opinion in viola- tion of his
constitutional rights to have counsel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Savage, Stone and Tyson either would not comment or
did not respond to messages left at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family just wants their son home _ that's it,'' said a man
sitting on the front steps of James Stone's home, five doors down
from Robert Savage's home.
</P>
<P>
   A man who would not give his name but identified himself as the
father of Jamel Murphy trembled during a brief interview Wednesday
in front of his house. ``I really don't have any words to describe
how I feel right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to attend his son's arraignment, he replied:
``I'm not going to go, no. For me to go and show support for
something I don't support would be hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Royster's grandmother, Anastasia Brown, said in an interview
Wednesday that her granddaughter had struggled in recent years with
mental illness that at times made her ``aggressive and out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who raised Royster after the girl's mother died about
eight years ago, said that in recent months Royster had seemed to
get her life back on track. Only last week, Brown said, she signed
up for classes at Queensborough Community College.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators described Liu's death as the senseless outcome of
an amateurish scheme. The group had already eaten once on Friday
from another Chinese restaurant, but they decided they wanted
seconds. Only this time, they came up with a plan to avoid paying,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, officials said they told the police, was for Royster
to call the Golden Wok with her cell phone and place an order.
Then, investigators said, Royster was to wait on the front steps of
the vacant house, ideally situated for a robbery across a dead-end
street from thick woods. The teen-agers later told investigators
that they chose Royster to place the order and wait for the
delivery because they figured that she would be perceived as less
of a potential threat, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the delivery man arrived, the idea was for the boys to jump
out of hiding places in the bushes by the front door, cover him
with the sheet and then flee with the food, investigators said. But
they also were armed with a couple of bricks taken from one of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authorities, the plan unfolded as planned about
11 p.m. on Friday when Royster called the Golden Wok. Royster
barely knew most of the boys. She had become involved with the
group through her friendship with Tyson, whom she had known from
high school. She keeps a photograph of Tyson by her bedroom mirror,
not far from her posters of Snoop Doggy Dog and Mariah Carey and
her collection of stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't find a nicer guy,'' Brown said of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   According to her grandmother, Royster had been at home much of
Friday, listening to CDs _ hip hop and Spanish music _ writing
e-mail messages, watching television. About 5 p.m. she told her
grandmother she was going over to Tyson's house, in Springfield
Gardens several miles away, and said she would not be out late.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that about 9 p.m., she beeped her granddaughter, who
called her back on the cell phone Brown had bought for her a few
months ago. Brown said she told her not to stay out late, but
Royster did not come home until about 2 a.m., and she was agitated
and nervous, staying up until 3:30 a.m. and acting strange ``and
hyper'' the rest of the weekend. She told her grandmother over the
weekend that she had lost her cell phone, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Liu was already dead. Plans for a simple robbery of
food had spiraled out of control, investigators said, when Robert
Savage used one of the bricks to begin hitting Liu. An autopsy
found that he had been struck in the skull at least three times.
</P>
<P>
   Liu had operated the Golden Wok for at least 10 years. It is a
modest storefront operation. There are no tables for dining, and
Liu, a Chinese immigrant who spoke little English, made most of the
deliveries himself. He worked long days side by side with his wife,
a son and a daughter, and they lived in an apartment fashioned from
partitions and bunk beds at the rear of the restaurant, said the
former property manager for the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Golden Wok remained closed and the Liu family
remained in seclusion. ``He was an asset to the community,'' said
Morris Greene, owner of a realty company a few doors down from the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Liu's death, the teen-agers carried on as if
all were normal. They went to a nearby mall. They rode their
bicycles in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Royster went to her first day of classes at
Queensborough, and while she was at the college a detective showed
up at the house with questions about a call placed to the
restaurant from a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, she quickly admitted to calling the
restaurant and then described the attack. Several people who live
in the neighborhood said Royster also returned there and helped
point out some of her alleged accomplices to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said her granddaughter told detectives that she and Tyson
had waited on the steps, with the other boys in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stacy had nothing to do with that man being killed,'' Brown
said, beginning to cry. ``She's not involved in anything like
that.''

   Sampras rallies by Krajicek &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By SCOTT KAISER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ It was Wimbledon all over again for Pete Sampras at the
U.S. Open on Wednesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Needing a tiebreaker miracle like he had against Patrick Rafter
in the finals earlier this summer, Sampras came through again in
rallying for a 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal victory over
nemesis Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was down a set and trailing 4-1 _ with Rafter having two
serves coming up _ in the second-set tiebreaker at Wimbledon, but
battled back en route to his record 13th Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was even more precarious here as he trailed 6-2 in
the second-set tiebreaker and Krajicek possessing the biggest serve
in the game. However, Sampras answered with six straight points to
knot the match and snatch the momentum away from the Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was finished,'' Sampras admitted. ``I was a little
lucky because I don't know how I pulled (the tiebreaker) out. It's
all kind of a blur. Richard was outplaying me to that point, so it
was a carbon copy of Wimbledon.``
</P>
<P>
   In the tiebreaker, Sampras saved the first set point with a
gutsy drop volley that barely cleared the tape. Krajicek then had
two serves, but Sampras hit a forehand return winner and a backhand
passing shot down the line. Sampras saved his fourth set point with
a slicing volley that Krajicek couldn't handle, then took a 7-6
lead with a big serve. Sampras then completed the improbable rally
with a forehand passing shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really do anything wrong,'' Krajicek said. ``Those
were three great points in a row for him to get back to 6-5. I
guess it was just meant to be for him.``
</P>
<P>
   With his confidence suddenly renewed, Sampras made a break of
Krajicek in the third game of the third set stand up. In the final
set, he broke Krajicek in the third and seventh games en route to
closing out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``(After the tiebreaker) I raised my game,'' said Sampras, who
is seeking his fifth title here. ``I started slicing my returns and
making him play a few more shots, and Richard might have gotten a
bit down on himself.``
</P>
<P>
   Sampras dug himself into a hole in the first set when he missed
a forehand volley wide at break point in the ninth game of the
first set and Krajicek held his serve at love to close it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate,'' Sampras said. ``He was doing everything a
little bit better than I was and I would have had trouble battling
back from two sets down.``
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will next face young Aussie Lleyton Hewitt, who cruised
past unseeded Arnaud Clement 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. The 19-year-old Hewitt,
seeded ninth, let Clement orchestrate his own defeat as the
Frenchman _ who ousted No. 1 Andre Agassi in the second round _
sprayed shots all over the court. Clement finished the match with
42 unforced errors, 19 more than Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so bad,'' Clement said. ``I was sleeping the first two
sets. I'm not happy.``
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who patterns his game after Swede baseliner Mats
Wilander, had a relatively low 10 winners, but came up with a
surprising 18 aces. The latter was 15 more than Clement and allowed
Hewitt to be broken only once the entire match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two matches (he knocked out No. 7 Thomas Enqvist in
the fourth round) have probably been a lot more mental than
actually technical,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be mentally tough out there in the first couple of
games and try to get that early break, and get the first set under
your belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say I've definitely been hitting the ball a lot better
with each match that I've played.''

<P>
   In 1996, the two teamed up, persuading the air board to abandon
requirements that 2 percent of cars sold in 1998 be nonpolluting,
increasing to 5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In return, automakers signed deals with the state committing
them to building a certain number of nonpolluting cars, depending
on their market share.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement _ coupled with existence of the mandate _ has
spurred more research into alternative-fuel cars and ``hybrids,''
which burn gasoline but use batteries to reduce pollution. Honda
and Toyota sell two hybrid models.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 2,300 zero-emission cars and light trucks _
ZEVs, as the state calls them _ operating on California streets and
highways. All have been sold during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate, the minimum number of zero-emission cars and
light trucks that would have to be sold in 2003 is 22,000 _ a
nearly tenfold increase.
</P>
<P>
   That could climb higher depending on how many nonpolluting or
low-polluting cars, such as hybrids, are on the highways by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers say there is not enough consumer demand for
20,000 more electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists counter that there are waiting lists of people
who want nonpolluting cars but that carmakers are not building
them.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the California ZEV Alliance, a group of 10
environmental and health groups backing the mandate, used an
electric U.S. Postal Service truck to deliver more than 50,000
letters to the governor, urging him to stick with the mandate.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by one of the alliance's members found that consumers
would buy between roughly 150,000 and 226,000 electric cars each
year if they were available at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   And that, auto makers argue, is the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Electric cars are not cheap. Building them is expensive, and
battery costs are prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   They are also not as convenient as gasoline-fueled cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrical vehicles cost twice as much as gas vehicles. The
refueling time is four hours compared to five minutes, and the
refueling stations are nonexistent,'' said Steven Douglas, director
of environmental affairs for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, whose members include 13 of the world's biggest
carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In its own study, the air board says freeway-capable ZEVs will
cost $20,000 more to make than conventional cars _ not counting
research and development costs borne by the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Without government subsidies, the board's study says, it will be
difficult to woo consumers into abandoning their gasoline-powered
cars for cleaner-performing vehicles that travel only 100 miles or
so before they need recharging.
</P>
<P>
   A bill awaiting action by Davis would offer $18 million in
$3,000 grants to purchasers of zero-emission vehicles, well below
the amount of subsidies needed.
</P>
<P>
   The state's funding source for subsidies to zero-emission
vehicle buyers is also drying up. The board may try to find a new
source.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and alternative energy advocates contend that
the cost argument used by carmakers is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five major automakers made $25 billion in profits in 1999,
mainly from selling gas-guzzling higher polluting sports utility
vehicles. It's time for an environmental dividend,'' said Jamie
Knapp, a spokeswoman for the ZEV alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say there are less expensive ways to improve air
quality.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the state's steady ratcheting down of
allowable emission levels for gas-powered cars has significantly
increased air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing automakers to create expensive battery-powered cars that
consumers do not want will have little effect on air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas says placing more than 20,000 more zero-emission cars on
the road will reduce pollutants by 1 to 2 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations by the air board to reduce spills and emissions from
lawn-mower gas cans will remove 26 tons of pollutants a day,
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are crystal clear,'' said Douglas. Electric vehicles
are astronomically expensive. The program is astronomically
expensive, and the benefits are next to nil.''

CITY PUBLIC TRANSIT TURNED INTO MAGIC BUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I don't know about all the Muni workers, but at
least one unidentified driver deserves a big raise.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Friday evening and Liz Einbinder was aboard the
45-Union, heading west toward Russian Hill from North Beach, and
she reports:
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we reached Columbus, the bus was nearly full, with
tourists and locals. The driver not only greeted all the passengers
as they boarded, but he led us in a sing-along throughout the
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started with Billy Joel's `For the Longest Time,' and then
campfire songs and various popular hits. Everyone on the bus sang
along, including the two big gang-looking dudes in the back row,
who sang beautiful harmony on the Billy Joel song.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when the bus went down the steep hill after Hyde St., the
passengers put their arms in the air as if on a roller coaster, and
oohed and aahed down the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one weird city.
</P>
<P>
   STRANGERS are shooting you full of dangerous radiation as you
walk down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's nothing personal. But according to flyers circulating
in parts of the city, those little remote devices that lock and
unlock your car send out zaps of radiation that cause various aches
and pains, difficult breathing and even limping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand A Recall!'' the flyer demands.
</P>
<P>
   What about garage-door openers, TV remotes, cell phones,
microwaves, high-powered antennas and computers? We are slowly
frying our innards to a crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Is the flyer legit? Don't ask me. I don't use a garage-door
opener because I'm afraid a UFO will be hovering overhead, my
remote will drop the saucer's hatch, and green aliens will splatter
all over my driveway.
</P>
<P>
   But a recall? Never. I think we all agree it's worth a few aches
and pains and death to avoid having to actually insert a key in a
lock or get up from the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if those remote-key devices really were dangerous, Ford
would be recalling them from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   GOOF DEPT.: Chronicle headline said, ``Raiders, Local Officials
Butt Heads Once Again.''
</P>
<P>
   A typo! As Paul Quihillalt points out, ``Butt Heads'' should
have been ``Buttheads.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG CONTEST: I was in a retail shop recently and the decor
included some lovely photographs of the Golden Gate Bridge. Every
photograph of the Golden Gate Bridge is lovely, or haunting, or
poetic, or inspiring, or moody.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible there has never been an ugly photo of that bridge.
</P>
<P>
   But if you do have a bad photograph of the Golden Gate Bridge,
send it here. I'll get Stanlee Gatti to help me judge. The winner
will get something.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. Bush referred to a New York Times reporter as ``a
major-league a------.'' But as Bob Ryan notes, what does the
Bushster know about the major leagues? When he owned a baseball
team, he traded Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see the Gore ads on  &UR; that  &LR; one,'' Ryan sniffs.
</P>
<P>
   And Lou Bristol heard W deliver a stump speech in which he
declared that there is a gap in this country ``between the poor and
the nonpoor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush family compound, I believe that gap is referred to
as the moat.

Washington State when he saw a sign, ``Please don't drink and

``In memory of Terry Skidmore.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TAKE it personally if you get an information request card
from the city's Department of Elections stating that records show
you were born in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who registered before about 1972 gets that notice.
Before that time, voters were not asked to give their birth year,
so the computer was programmed to list them all as born in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't the mailed notice simply ask for a birth year, thus
avoiding possible confusion and insult? As a department
spokesperson told me, ``I guess every form could have been worded
in a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Damn right, and sooner or later I'll fix all of 'em.

   SPEAKING OF OLD: The lovely and talented Susan Prather, shining
knight of the homeless in Contra Costa Co., is about to become a

   At Pottery Barn, the clerk ignored Susan and spoke only to
Susan's 25-year-old stepdaughter-to-be. At the cake place, the
clerk asked Susan, ``Will your daughter be coming in to finalize
the plans?'' And at Crate &AMP; Barrel, the clerk said,  &UR; ``You  &LR; want to
register?''
</P>
<P>
   Susan just laughs. But I hope somebody tips off the preacher.

 TESTS SHOW CANNIBALISM AMONG ANCIENT ANASAZIS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mysterious Anasazi people, whose long-abandoned dwellings
dot the harsh desert of the American Southwest, left few remains to
make their culture clear for modern archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the strongest evidence yet that the Anasazi
practiced cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found evidence that during a period of severe
drought some 850 years ago, an unknown raiding party swept through
several Anasazi villages in southwest Colorado, killing the
inhabitants, boiling their bones and eating their flesh. In one
case, the archaeological team found ancient human feces that
contained residues of human blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the entire community was extinguished in a single
episode of violence and terroristic cannibalism during a period of
social chaos brought on by the drought,'' says Brian R. Billman, an
archaeologist at the University of North Carolina who has studied
the Anasazi for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the people who settled in the Four Corners region a
thousand or more years ago were the ancestors of today's Hopi and
Zuni tribes, any hint of cannibalism grates on the sensitivity of
those Native Americans. As a result, the findings by Billman and
his colleagues are intensely controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an archaeologist retained by the Hopi tribe has already
quarreled sharply with the report, calling it ``a supposition
rather than a demonstrated fact.'' Kurt E. Dongoske of the Hopi
Tribe's Cultural Preservation Office said the evidence ``is
provocative but as yet unconvincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dongoske, who dismisses the reports by Billman's group as ``a
smorgasbord of theoretical variables,'' maintains that the
scientists have deliberately ignored other theories suggesting that
the people whose bones were found might have been ritually executed
as witches _ a powerful taboo that still exists among people of the
Pueblos.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the bitter argument between the two rival groups of
scientists reached print recently in the respected journal
``American Antiquity.'' Thursday in the international journal
Nature, Billman's team is publishing what it claims is the first
direct biochemical evidence of cannibalism in prehistoric Anasazi
lands.
</P>
<P>
   In one site, among a small cluster of Anasazi villages on a
mountain slope called Cowboy Wash, near what is now the Colorado
town of Towaoc on the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation, Billman's
team found the remains of a community where three families had
lived centuries ago in pit houses for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 35 adults and children were systematically butchered
there when all the villages were suddenly abandoned about 1150
A.D., Billman's group said. From the bodies of at least seven men,
women and children in one dwelling, the scientists found cracked
bones where flesh had been stripped, marrow sucked, and the bones
themselves boiled and roasted.
</P>
<P>
   In one ruined dwelling, the group found more than 1,000
fragments of bone that had been smashed into small pieces after the
flesh had been removed and the joints cut.
</P>
<P>
   And in the hearth of one small pit house, the archaeologists
also found a single coprolite, the scientific term for fossil
feces. The feces contains a protein, myoglobin, whose structure is
unique to human heart and muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Marlar, a biochemist at the University of Colorado
Medical School, &LR;  who analyzed the coprolite, found that it contains
no evidence of digested vegetables like corn or beans, which he
said indicates that no other food was available to the invader who
must have defecated into the hearth.
</P>
<P>
   The Anasazi people of the Four Corners region lived a hard life
between about 700 and 1300 A.D. When the rains were good they
cultivated corn and beans and other crops, but the rains were
infrequent, forcing the Anasazi to move often, taking their meager
belongings with them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboy Wash settlement, Billman said in an interview,
shows every evidence that the people there must have fled abruptly
in terror. They left behind the posts of dwellings, the tools and
ceramic cooking pots and other belongings that they normally would
have carried with them during a search for more fertile land.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows just who raided and terrorized the inhabitants of
Cowboy Wash, nor where they came from or where they went, Billman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is most striking,'' he said, ``is that we have
captured only a single unique moment in time _ a sudden flareup
that apparently didn't last long, for we find no evidence of any
kind of cannibalism among the Anasazi or their descendants after
about 1200 A.D.''

   Davenport ousts defending U.S. Open champ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By SCOTT KAISER &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ A backhand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting one from your mom is a bad thing. Having it abandon you
on the tennis court is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for defending women's champion Serena Williams
at the U.S. Open on Wednesday night as an ineffective two-hander
proved to be her downfall in a 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal loss to 1998
champion Lindsay Davenport at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, normally lethal with groundstrokes from both sides,
committed 17 errors with her backhand and had her five-match
winning streak against Davenport snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really hit my backhand or my forehand well, and I
wasn't serving well,'' Williams said. ``You can't afford to be off
your game against (Davenport), because she has a great all-around
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport didn't serve particularly well (making only 48 percent
of her first serves), but deep returns allowed her to put pressure
on Williams' service game.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth groundstrokes _ which she admitted were the best she's
hit since the Australian Open final _ helped Davenport dictate most
of the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I did everything that I wanted to,'' said Davenport,
who lost to Williams in last year's final here. ``I'm sure she
didn't think she played well, but I thought I made her not play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was on serve in the ninth game of the first set before
Davenport broke through.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had two game points for a 5-4 lead, but Davenport came
up big with her forehand both times and then got the break when
Williams missed a pair of forehands. Williams then fought off a
pair of set points before missing a backhand _ her ninth such miss
to that point _ to give Davenport the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit to the same spot a lot of times, and a lot
of times once the first or second ball went there, I just stayed
with it and waited until the court opened up to go to her
forehand,'' said Davenport of her tendency to go to Williams'
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw she was missing a few, I'm going to stay with that
game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams then double-faulted twice and missed two backhands,
including an unwise drop-shot attempt from the baseline, as she
squandered two game points and was broken in the first game of the
second set.
</P>
<P>
   After Davenport held, Williams blew three game points in the
third game and was broken again to dig herself into a 0-3 hole.
From that point on, Davenport took care of business, facing only
two break points over the remainder of the match.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering five match points in the seventh game on
Williams' serve, Davenport had two aces to give her match point,
and Williams _ surprise _ netted a backhand return to end the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing that this was only the
quarterfinals, because it felt like a really big match,'' said
Davenport of the meeting between top-five seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Up next for Davenport in Friday's semifinals is unseeded
18-year-old Elena Dementieva, who ousted No. 10 Anke Huber 6-1,
3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Although not blessed with the same press attention as fellow
Russian Anna Kournikova, the nearly-as-good-looking Dementieva has
shown more mental toughness and desire to improve.
</P>
<P>
   She has steadily climbed in the rankings (624th in 1996, 355th
in '97, 182nd in '98 and 62nd in '99) to the point where she will
crack the top 20 after this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's just amazing, because two years ago I watched
(Williams and Davenport) on TV,'' Dementieva said. ``I didn't think
I could play like I'm playing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her idol, Martina Hingis, Dementieva is a quick, smart
player who picks her spots. That was the case against Huber when
she rallied from a 2-0 deficit in the third set, thanks mostly to
aggressive returns on Huber's weak second serve.
</P>
<P>
   Dementieva won 22 of 35 points off Huber's second serve and
broke the German six times, including three times in the final set.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dementieva) plays smart and simple, maybe not like the other
18-year-olds who just hit the ball (hard),'' Huber said. ``She's a
very good player.''

<P>
   Remarks prepared for delivery  &UR;  &LR; Wednesday at Cleveland State
University about his economic plans.
</P>
<P>
   `` I propose to take 1 out of every 6 dollars of the budget
surplus, and put it aside. So it will not be used for new spending.
It will not be used for new tax cuts. It will not be spent on
promises or proposals of any kind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So if today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve
fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or
health care. And unlike the promises made on the other side, we
won't be running deficits and endangering America's prosperity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you entrust me with the presidency, I will make sure the
resources are there to invest in our families and build a more
prosperous future. ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm fighting for a full range of targeted tax cuts for
middle-class families. To help you save for college and retirement.
To pay for health insurance and child care. To reform the estate
tax, so people can pass on a small business or a family farm. And
to end the marriage penalty _ the right way, the fair way. ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these middle-class tax cuts will bring the
typical family's tax burden to its lowest level in 50 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But let me say it plainly: I will not go along with a huge tax
cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our
good economy in the process.''  &QL;

GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY IN WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ This season _ much like the Los Angeles
Galaxy's five-year history _ has been about blown opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   You can add another to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a win to have a mathematical chance to stay in the
Western Division race with Kansas City, the Galaxy's hopes were
dashed when Dallas handed it a 1-0 defeat before a crowd of 11,744
at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Galaxy folded again, the Wiz stepped up by defeating
New England 1-0 earlier in the evening to claim the West.
</P>
<P>
   While Dallas (13-14-4, 43 points) clinched a playoff berth with
the victory, all the Galaxy has left to play for is home-field
advantage in the first-round of the playoffs _ an unlikely scenario
now.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Chicago defeated Columbus 3-1 to wrap up the
Central Division, which means the Galaxy will face Mamadou Diallo
and the Tampa Bay Mutiny in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny (16-12-3, 51 points) leads the Galaxy (14-9-8, 50
points) by a point with one game remaining. For the Galaxy to
wrestle home-field advantage from the Mutiny, it must win Friday at
Colorado and hope that Kansas City wins or draws against the Mutiny
at Tampa Bay on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the way this season has gone for Los Angeles, the chances
seem slim.
</P>
<P>
   A sluggish first half came to life when Burn striker Ariel
Graziani broke loose down the left flank, sending a cross behind
Galaxy defender Greg Vanney for Jorge Rodriguez. The Salvadoran
striker's header found the left netting, beating Galaxy goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman for the game's only goal, in the 37th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Luis Hernandez, quiet most of the night, was
heard when he called Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid and the rest of the
Galaxy subs off the bench in the 60th minute. He was protesting an
apparent trip of Hernandez by Dallas' Antonio Martinez in the
penalty area. However, referee Kevin Stott allowed play to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez nearly evened the score in the 81st minute. He took a
corner kick from Cobi Jones and tried to flick it past Dallas
goalkeeper Matt Jordan, whose quick reflexes preserved the lead.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first game without Galaxy Olympians Danny Califf,
Sasha Victorine and Peter Vagenas. They will all miss the first
round of the MLS playoffs and possibly the second if the U.S.
advances to the second round in Sydney.

DAVENPORT TAKES OUT SERENA WILLIAMS TO REACH OPEN SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-USOPEN-SAMPRAS) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere in the background of the hype, standing
well out of the swirl of attention, the unassuming Lindsay
Davenport and the mischief-making Martina Hingis were feeling a
little Williams-sister fatigue recently.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the focus has been on the charismatic sisters
with the colorful style, public appeal and two Grand Slam titles
that, at some point, went through Davenport and Hingis. So there
was an innocent conversation recently, and a little joke between
the two women hidden behind Venus and Serena Williams. One of them
had to crash the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started last year, because I played the first semifinal
against Serena,'' said Davenport, referring to last year's U.S.
Open. ``Martina played Venus. She's like, `Well, you better win.'
So I lost. I saw her in the locker room. She was shaking her head
at me right before she played. Obviously, she won. This time she
said, `You're first again.'''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Davenport who was able to creep into the
airtight confidence of Serena Williams with unsettling blasts of
patience. By repeatedly pounding her ground strokes into the same
corners of the court, by luring Williams into gimmick shots as a
way to end the point, Davenport decoded her opponent's hold on her
with a 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal victory inside a chilly Arthur Ashe
Stadium. Suddenly, the end came to Williams' chance to repeat as
the U.S. Open champion. Abruptly, the all-Williams final many
envisioned was in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way a lot of people want it,'' Serena Williams said
after her loss. ``I'm sure a lot of people never want to see an
all-Williams final. It's going to happen in the future, inevitably.
Nobody's going to be able to stop it. Unfortunately, I didn't pull
my end up this year. I'm sure in the next Grand Slam I'm going to
do my utmost to make sure it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, no one would want to see an all-Williams final
because everyone doesn't really like us.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been tension in the locker room between the Williams
sisters and some of the other players on the women's Tour. Some see
them as polite, but aloof or arrogant. Some also view the sisters
as a threat to take over the Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport proved Wednesday night that she wouldn't be
intimidated. Although she had lost to Serena Williams in their last
five meetings, Davenport didn't flinch. As a result, she will meet
the unseeded Elena Dementieva in the semifinals Friday. The other
semifinal will feature Venus Williams against Hingis. Then, it will
be Hingis' turn to see if she can pull off a victory over a
Williams sister. No doubt, Davenport will be in Hingis' corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along well,'' Davenport said of Hingis. ``She sides
with me against them. She's fun to joke with. Venus doesn't talk to
me much.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence will probably grow after Wednesday night's outcome.
Davenport was unshakable in her game plan against Serena Williams.
Davenport knew what she had to do. One short ball or mis-hit, one
passive second serve or ill-conceived drop shot, and Williams could
devour it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Williams was the one who covered the court with the
speed of ricochet while Davenport has more of jellyfish-like
languor to her movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get every ball, but if I try my hardest, and
physically I'm a hundred percent, I'm not the slowest thing out
there,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Davenport was vulnerable to the differences in
quickness. A confident Williams scampered toward every driving
ground stroke by Davenport and turned sure winners into amazing
gets. A steady Williams was also putting in her crushing first
serve at 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, Davenport looked overwhelmed, acting as if
she just wanted to stay in the point instead of dictating it. In
the second game of the match, Davenport had to fight off three
break points just to keep on serve. Williams had her chances, but
foreshadowed just how impatient she would become in this match.
</P>
<P>
   On her first break point, Williams tried to end a rally by
pulling out a backhand drop shot. After Williams whacked an
over-the-shoulder overhead well out, Davenport exhaled after
holding at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was over, and the momentum turned. Suddenly, Williams
became overeager, and began whipping forehands 2 feet beyond the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   She also started a stream of desperate spinners and drop shots
until she found herself handing Davenport her first and only break
point of the first set in the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
   That was all Davenport needed. She served out the set. Williams
never recovered. In the end, she could only hold Davenport off for
so long. By yelping as she took swipes at the ball, Williams saved
five match points in a thrilling seventh game of the second set
that contained every theatrical version of a point.
</P>
<P>
   There was Williams, flicking her wrist like a short-order cook,
cracking strokes with great angles only to see Davenport answer by
putting balls into the corner of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was, Lindsay just played better than I did,''
Williams said. ``You can't afford to be on anything but your best
game in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam.'' &QL;

<P>
   Dr. John Alexander Simpson, a nuclear physicist and
astrophysicist whose instruments have been sending data back from
space for nearly 40 years, died on Aug. 31 in Chicago. He was 83
and lived in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications after open heart surgery, said the
University of Chicago, where he was a professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who went from helping develop the atomic bomb to
exploring cosmic rays, worked at the Enrico Fermi Institute of
Nuclear Studies at the university until late last month. There, he
monitored and analyzed streams of data sent to Earth by his
instruments from space missions including the Ulysses solar orbiter
and the Stardust mission, launched last year for a 2004 rendezvous
with Comet Wild-2, a ball of ice two and one-half miles in
diameter. That vehicle carries Simpson's Dust Flux Monitor
Instrument, intended to measure the size of dust particles and map
their distribution around the comet's nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   He was a principal investigator for dozens of space missions,
ranging from satellites orbiting Earth to vessels sent into deep
space. He built the first cosmic ray detectors sent to Mercury,
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Other missions in which Simpson was involved included a fly-by
of Venus, nine planetary encounters and dust experiments on two
Soviet Vega spacecraft that investigated Halley's comet, for which
he received the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration of the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Sciences in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``With instruments almost continuously in space for the last 40
years, John Simpson was always probing the frontiers of the solar
system for new knowledge,'' said Edward C. Stone, director of the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA. ``With several generations of
graduate students, he pioneered new areas of research ranging from
outbursts of solar particle radiation to the origin and lifetime of
cosmic-ray particles from nearby regions of the Milky Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Mason, professor of physics at the University of Maryland,
called Simpson ``a towering figure in 20th-century science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In June he received the American Geophysical Union's highest
award, the William Bowie Medal,'' Mason said, ``which shows how
widely his contributions were appreciated in the science
community.''
</P>
<P>
   John Simpson was born in Portland, Ore. He graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from Reed College in 1940 and received his M.S. in 1942 and
Ph.D. in 1943 from New York University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Chicago faculty in 1943 after Enrico Fermi and his
team achieved the first controlled nuclear chain reaction there for
the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   After atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he
became an organizer of a campaign for the peaceful use of atomic
energy under civilian control. He was an adviser to Sen. Brien
McMahon of Connecticut, chairman of a special committee on atomic
energy and sponsor of the McMahon Act of 1946, which called for
civilian control of its use.
</P>
<P>
   The founding chairman in 1946 of The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, he had been its president since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's work after the Manhattan Project focused on cosmic
rays, the subatomic particles that bombard Earth from all
directions at nearly the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 he invented a device to monitor the intensity of cosmic
ray neutrons, which he deployed at stations from Chicago to the
magnetic equator in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In the physics department of the University of Chicago, he rose
from instructor in 1945 to professor at the Fermi Institute in
1964. He served as its director from 1973 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1959, and
he was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is survived by his wife of 20 years, Elizabeth Scott
Johnson Simpson; a daughter and a son by an earlier marriage, Mary
Ann Smith of Bangor, Mich., and John A. Simpson, of Nahant, Mass.;
and three grandsons. His marriage to Elizabeth Alice Hilts ended in
divorce.

SAMPRAS AWAKES TO STOP KRAJICEK
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-USOPEN)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pete Sampras was staring across the net at the one
player who has been able to defuse his atomic serves with his own,
and the one opponent who has been able to emerge from their matches
with barely a scratch over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It was the steel-coated Richard Krajicek. He had taken six of
his last eight matches against Sampras, and put together a
head-to-head record no other active player has approached.
</P>
<P>
   For so long Wednesday night, inside a nervous Arthur Ashe
Stadium, Sampras looked as if he would succumb to Krajicek's
strange hold over him again. Sampras was in trouble after
sleepwalking through the first set, and was about to fall into the
abyss when he found himself down by 2-6 in the second-set
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting outplayed,'' Sampras said. ``I thought it was
going to get away from me. I got lucky. I don't know how I won
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Sampras pulled off a great escape on his way to a 4-6,
7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal victory Wednesday night at the U.S.
Open. The fourth-seeded Sampras, who will meet ninth-seeded Lleyton
Hewitt in a semifinal match on Saturday, felt fortunate to advance.
An unflappable Krajicek, who fired 23 aces to just eight by
Sampras, was serving for the set with his gaudy lead in the tie
breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you lose that tiebreaker,'' Krajicek said.
``I didn't do anything really wrong. I think he just did a good
job. There's nothing I can blame on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras recovered, in part, because of a mis-hit off a backhand
return of serve at 3-6 in the tiebreaker that turned into a point
to keep him alive. Sampras also pulled a half-volley out of his
hat, and conjured up a couple of tremendous responses to Krajicek's
powerful serve, including one forehand return that cracked right in
the corner for a winner. Krajicek looked on helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   After a run of five straight points to take the second set,
Sampras was pumping his fists as he walked to the changeover with
new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was meant to be that he would win that set,'' Krajicek
said. ``I guess it was his tiebreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sensing a turnaround. The lethargic demeanor that Sampras
revealed early in the match vanished as the third set unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence rose,'' Sampras said. ``I knew I was back in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third set, Sampras put in 79 percent of his first serves.
In the fourth, he hit a solid 70 percent. There was little Krajicek
could do to force a break of serve when Sampras was pouring on such
force. Other than serving percentage _ and Krajicek was at 58
percent _ the statistics were almost even. Krajicek came up with 46
winners to Sampras' 49. Sampras had 19 unforced errors; Krajick had
16. But when it came to breaks of service, Sampras converted 4 of 6
opportunities while Krajicek was 2 of 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the way I played in the third and fourth set,''
Krajicek said. ``That's what's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he was revived by the second-set tiebreaker, Sampras was
dominant again, putting in 67 percent of his first serves. On match
point, Sampras whipped a service winner that bounded off the frame
of Krajicek's racket.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Sampras had finally found a way to slip by the one
player who has been his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I needed to make a statement,'' Sampras said.
``It was a big match, and the fans were great. They really got
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras needed their help, particularly in the second-set
tiebreaker. In some ways, Sampras was in a similar situation
against Patrick Rafter in the Wimbledon final. Once again, he was
down in the second-set tiebreaker, feeling the match slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Wimbledon,'' Sampras said. ``It was a matter of a
point here or there. I thought I was finished. I thought I was
gone. At Wimbledon, I thought I was just a few nails away in the
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My will is always there, especially for a big match like
today. But I needed a little luck today. I thought it was going to
be a tough battle to come back. He was making me work hard, and he
was outplaying me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been down two sets to love,'' Sampras said, ``it would
have been a tough hole to get out of.''

PROSECUTORS SAY DOCTOR KILLED TO FEEL A THRILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio, Colo.)  By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. _ Most people in the courtroom knew how the
small, skittish man had managed to murder at least four of his
patients without getting caught: He injected them with poison, he
admitted Wednesday. The question observers wanted answered was
``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   And then prosecutors offered five scrawled pages from the
killer's spiral-bound diary as the motive. It seems that Michael J.
Swango, a former doctor, killed for the pure joy of watching and
smelling death.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a notebook confiscated from Swango when he was
arrested in a Chicago airport in 1997 on his way to Saudi Arabia,
where he had a job in a hospital, prosecutors painted a portrait of
a delusional serial killer. The written passages show that Swango,
45, was a voracious reader of macabre thrillers about doctors who
thought they had the power of the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   In small, tight script, Swango transcribed a passage from what
prosecutors said was ``The Torture Doctor,'' which they described
as an obscure true-to-life novel published in 1975 about a
19th-century doctor who goes on a quiet murder spree and tries to
poison his wife with succinylcholine chloride, a powerful muscle
relaxant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could look at himself in a mirror and tell himself that he
was one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the world _ he
could feel that he was a god in disguise,'' the notebook read.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Swango's favorite books, according to prosecutors,
was ``The Traveler,'' written by John Katzenbach. One passage that
prosecutors contended offered a window into Swango's mind was:
``when I kill someone, it's because I want to. It's the only way I
have of reminding myself that I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victim's relatives weeping in the rear of the
courtroom, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary R. Brown read more excerpts
from the notebook. From what he identified as the text of ``My
Secret Life,'' Swango was inspired to copy: ``I love it. Sweet,
husky, close smell of an indoor homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, on the steps of U.S. District Court, said Wednesday:
``Basically, Dr. Swango liked to kill people. By his own admission
in his diary, he killed because it thrilled him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing prison blues and faded slippers, Swango stood in the
courtroom and admitted that he murdered three of his patients at a
Long Island hospital with lethal injections.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Judge Jacob Mishler asked Swango how he pleaded, he
answered impassively: ``Guilty, your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations, incriminations and death followed Swango wherever
he went, from the time he began medical school at Southern Illinois
University in the early 1980s to his tenure as a physician in
Zimbabwe. And although an inordinate amount of his patients died
over the years _ some officials estimate as many as 60 _ Swango
always managed to find employment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in New York could charge him only with the three
murders in their jurisdiction, committed when he worked for three
months as a resident at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Northport in 1993. His victims were Thomas Sammarco, 73; George
Siano, 60; and Aldo Serini, 62, all of Long Island. He faced
federal, rather than state, charges because those three murders
were committed at a federal institution.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, Swango acknowledged Wednesday that he
killed Cynthia McGee, 19, a student who was in his care at Ohio
State University Hospitals in 1984 when he worked there as a
resident.
</P>
<P>
   He was not charged with her murder, because it was not a federal
crime, but he pleaded guilty to lying about his role in her death,
and also to falsifying records about prison time he served in the
mid-1980s for poisoning co-workers' coffee and doughnuts with ant
poison.
</P>
<P>
   When Mishler asked for an explanation of the death of Siano,
Swango read from a prepared text. ``I intentionally killed Mr.
Siano, who was at the time a patient at the veterans' hospital in
Northport,'' he read. ``I did this by administering a toxic
substance which I knew was likely to cause death. I knew it was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Swango administer the lethal injection to Siano,
prosecutors said, he did it on his day off, a day when he was not
even on call. Prosecutors said that a nurse saw Swango sitting on a
radiator near Siano's bed watching the man die from the lethal
dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shaking my head that a madman got a plea bargain
today,'' said Siano's stepdaughter, Roselinda Conroy. ``He's worse
than an animal. Animals don't kill for pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishler sentenced Swango to three consecutive life sentences,
without the possibility of parole, in a maximum-security prison in
Colorado.

EDITORIAL: CONGRESS TAKES UP DEFECTIVE TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The precise reason that the treads on certain Firestone tires on
Ford Explorers have been peeling off with deadly consequences is
not yet clear, but evidence emerging in congressional inquiries is
making it increasingly apparent that both companies were aware of
the safety problems long before they took action to address them.
Equally worrisome is the fact that even once the companies did act
in some foreign markets, they refrained from doing so in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Ford memorandum written in March 1999 indicates that
the companies disagreed on whether they had a legal obligation to
notify U.S. regulators about a planned recall of tires in Saudi
Arabia. Ford ultimately recalled the tires but did not notify the
regulators. The Ford memo suggests that Firestone opposed the Saudi
recall out of concern that it would have to be reported in the
United States, a contention that was vigorously denied by Firestone
officials testifying before Congress on Wednesday. In Venezuela,
Ford and Firestone face a criminal investigation over the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's failure to share news of recalls overseas with U.S.
regulators is not acceptable behavior. U.S. laws should compel a
multinational company to advise U.S. regulators of a recall of an
unsafe consumer product in another country when that product is
also sold domestically.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration did
not learn about Ford's 1999 replacement of tires in Saudi Arabia
and more recent recalls in Thailand and Malaysia until last May,
after press reports and insurance company notices finally prompted
the agency to launch its own investigation into some 1,400
incidents that resulted in 88 deaths and 250 injuries in America.
At the safety agency's request, Firestone last month recalled 6.5
million tires used on Ford Explorers in the United States, but has
refused the agency's subsequent request that it recall an
additional 1.4 million tires used on other models.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Ford and Firestone have frayed under the
intense scrutiny. In their congressional testimony Wednesday, the
companies pointed the finger at each other. Ford maintained that it
had relied on Firestone's representations about the tires' safety,
and Firestone said it believed that incidents in Saudi Arabia and
elsewhere often involved under-inflated tires.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ford suggested a lower pressure for tires on its
Explorer than did Firestone. Further investigations will have to
determine whether Ford set the lower level merely to provide a more
comfortable ride, or whether it did so to compensate for a lack of
structural stability in the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The highway safety agency was sluggish in reacting to a number
of tips about this case, which may be a result of severe budgetary
cuts over the past two decades. If so, this unfolding story should
remind Congress that when it comes to safety, free markets are no
substitutes for an adequately funded federal watchdog.

<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush announced a proposal on Tuesday to provide
prescription drug benefits as an option under comprehensive
Medicare reform. But since he does not expect such reform to happen
anytime soon, he wants state governments to deal with the problem
while a new White House task force works out the details of future
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Vice President Al Gore, hopes to court elderly voters
with a plan to help pay for the escalating costs of drugs. But
unlike Gore, Bush would not create a universal drug benefit for all
retirees under Medicare. Instead he lays out a rough Medicare
reform plan, with few details, that may or may not make drug
coverage more accessible in the future. The Bush plan is inferior
because it relies on uncertain action by states and the private
sector, and would leave too many people without coverage for now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush takes a complicated two-track approach. He would first
create a four-year transitional program that places the onus on
states to provide drug coverage for the elderly while the federal
government works on comprehensive Medicare reform. He would provide
$48 billion over four years to help states pay for full drug
coverage for retirees with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty
line, or about $12,000 a year for an individual. Those earning up
to 175 percent of the poverty level, about $15,000 a year, would
get a partial subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that more than half the states currently do not
provide such assistance, and many would have to create new
bureaucracies to administer a new drug insurance program. State
participation would be voluntary, and states would be allowed to
set different premium levels and benefits. Once any retiree has
spent $6,000 a year on prescription drugs, additional costs would
be paid for by federal funds. Otherwise, people earning more than
175 percent of the poverty line would get no help under this
interim plan. This would leave a big population unprotected, since
nearly half of those without drug coverage now are middle-income
people, with incomes above the cutoff for subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is far less specific about how drug coverage would work in
the long term, leaving the details to a task force that would be
convened next year. He would not create a universal drug benefit
that would be available to all the elderly at the same cost.
Instead he would rely primarily on private insurers. Low-income
people would be heavily subsidized, as under the Gore plan. But
Bush's plan does not spell out a minimum drug benefit package or
maximum premiums for middle- and higher-income retirees. Instead,
government would help pay 25 percent of their drug coverage
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he wants to spend an additional $110 billion over 10
years to modernize Medicare by having private insurance plans
compete against traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Presumably,
many of those plans would provide drugs as an optional benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes that as more retirees choose these plans, fewer will
be left without drug coverage. But achieving that goal is
uncertain. Without a new Medicare drug program, people who stay in
fee-for-service Medicare would still have to buy separate drug
coverage on the private market. In that respect, the Bush plan
faces the same problem as the flawed bill that passed the House in
June. That plan relies on private insurers to sell prescription
drug policies. Yet many insurers have said they will not be able to
offer affordable policies even with a subsidy because only people
with high drug expenses would buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does not have this problem because his program would
offer uniform drug coverage to all the elderly at $25 a month,
without relying on private insurers to sell affordable policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reform proposal does add an interesting element to the
debate. He says he would use the $6,000 cap that would initially
apply to drug expenses for all out-of-pocket Medicare costs as part
of long-term reform. This is a positive proposal, provided he
identifies a way to pay for it.

PIRATES PILLAGE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Los Angeles Dodgers reacquired
right-hander Ismael Valdes in late July, they didn't bring him back
to be a world-beater, or even a pitcher who could provide eight or
nine wins in what they thought was a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went back to Valdes because they thought they had a
better chance to win with him starting instead of rookie Eric
Gagne. Well, the playoff race that was supposed to be heated is
frigid. And Valdes isn't having nearly the effect the Dodgers
thought he would.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed four first-inning runs, which carried Pittsburgh
to a 8-3 win against the Dodgers on Wednesday and gave the Pirates
a three-game series sweep at Dodger Stadium. The Pirates outscored
the Dodgers 28-4 in the whitewashing.
</P>
<P>
   And Pittsburgh also kept Valdes winless since his return to the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is whether Gagne would have provided better
starts, worse starts or merely similar starts to what Valdes has
done.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding five runs on eight hits and two walks in six
innings against Pittsburgh, Valdes' ERA stood at 6.08 since he
returned to the Dodgers. He's 0-3 and has reached the seventh
inning just once in eight starts. He was 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA with
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne certainly had his problems with the Dodgers, including
having his turn pushed back in the rotation almost regularly. But
he did have some quality starts and was 1-6 with a 5.85 ERA before
being sent to Triple-A Albuquerque after Valdes joined the club.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four July deals in which contending teams acquired
pitchers, Valdes has fared the worst. That says something since
neither Arizona's Curt Schilling, Philadelphia's Andy Ashby nor the
Yankees' Denny Neagle has been dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, after a quick start, is 4-4 with a 3.77 ERA. Ashby is
4-5 with a 4.70 ERA and Neagle is 5-4 with a 5.04 ERA. Of course,
the Dodgers tried to get each of them in a trade but were told
every time they didn't have enough prospects even to be considered
as viable suitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hoping Valdes would build some momentum coming
off his last start. He allowed one unearned run on three hits in
seven innings against Philadelphia, but, alas, there was no
carryover affect.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the previous night against lefty Carlos Perez, the
Pirates got to Valdes quickly. Adrian Brown led off with a single.
Jason Kendall flied out, but Brian Giles singled and John Vander
Wal made it 1-0 with a double to right. Enrique Wilson followed
with an RBI single to center field and, after Warren Morris walked,
Alex Hernandez singled to left to make it 3-0. Pat Meares'
sacrifice fly made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-shocked Dodgers, outscored 14-3 in the first two
innings of the series, saw the Pirates increase their lead to 5-0
in the second. Brown led off with a double and scored on Giles'
one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh lefty Dan Serafini, who was 1-3 with a 6.14 ERA, won
for the first time since Aug. 5. He allowed three runs on four hits
in 6 innings and was hurt by a pair of throwing errors in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers climbed to within 5-2 in the second when Gary
Sheffield scored on third baseman Wilson's wild throw to first.
Chad Kreuter's grounder, which turned into a throwing error by
Meares at shortstop, drove in the second run.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora's team-leading sixth triple set up Kevin Elster's
pinch-hit RBI single in the seventh to make it 5-3. Tom Goodwin
singled to put two runners on, but Mark Grudzielanek struck out to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh made it 8-3 in the eighth off Dodgers reliever Mike
Fetters, pitching for the first time since Friday. Brown, Kendall
and Giles each had run-scoring singles.

YANKS GIVE RIVERA A REST AND PAY THE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Boston could sweep this weekend and the New
York Yankees would still be in first place, so Manager Joe Torre
can afford to be judicious and take advantage of the growing
division lead. He began the process of reinstalling second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch into his lineup Wednesday night, and was intent on
resting the closer Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch did OK, making a couple of strong throws and going 0
for 4. But Rivera's temporary replacement bombed: Mike Stanton
emerged from the bullpen for the bottom of the ninth entrusted with
a 2-1 lead, and walked off the field disheartened minutes later, as
Kansas City players celebrated a 3-2 victory around him.
</P>
<P>
   If Knoblauch was Torre's most significant reclamation project
over the last week, he has been replaced by Stanton, whose problems
have lasted the better part of a month. ESPN silently filled the
face of a large-screen television after Wednesday night's game, and
just as Stanton was about to leave the clubhouse, he realized
highlights of the Yankees game were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton pulled out a folding chair, sat with his forearms rested
against the back, and watched the whole, horrible inning unfold
again, sipping a bottle of water in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead, on solo home runs by Jeter (in
the fourth) and Paul O'Neill (in the sixth). Orlando Hernandez had
thrown 122 pitches in eight brilliant innings, killing a Kansas
City rally in his last inning by starting a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera pitched two innings Sunday, another inning Monday, and
Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre were determined to
give him two days off, back-to-back. There's nothing wrong with
Rivera, Torre said, other than being a little tired, and he will be
available to pitch here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Torre wanted to use Stanton again, to give him a
chance to emerge from his funk; Stanton gave up home runs in four
straight outings at the end of last month, then was not used for 10
days until pitching an inning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Stanton struck out the Royals' Carlos Beltran.
Kansas City manager Tony Muser inserted the right-handed-hitting
David McCarty as a pinch-hitter, with a right-handed hitter on
deck. Torre had the option of calling on the right-hander Jeff
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   But he stuck with the left-handed Stanton, who has been more
effective against right-handers, anyway. ``Heck, he got Sweeney and
Dye out last night,'' said Torre, referring to Mike Sweeney and
Jermaine Dye, the Royals' best hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton fell behind McCarty three balls and no strikes before
McCarty singled. Nelson leaned against the bullpen wall, arms
crossed. Carlos Febles ripped a doubled into the left-center-field
gap, and the pinch-runner Luis Ordaz scored the tying run from
first.
</P>
<P>
   With the left-handed-hitting Johnny Damon at the plate, Stanton
remained in the game, and Damon singled through the middle, scoring
Febles and setting off a Royals celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get a whole lot worse,'' Stanton said. ``Joe has the
confidence to send me out there in the ninth, and I fail. There's
no excuse for me going out there and doing that. I let the team
down, I let Duque down.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch played behind Hernandez for seven innings before being
replaced for defense, and somewhere, the Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner was smiling. Most of the owner's criticisms are
calculated _ the ``fat toad'' reference to Hideki Irabu last year
being an exception _ and when he inferred last week that
Knoblauch's elbow pain was fake, his intent was to prod the second
baseman back into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said he didn't need that motivation; he just wants to
play again, and he felt good. ``It was good,'' he said. ``On the
right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was the first position player in the Yankees' lineup
to emerge from the clubhouse in the half-hour before Wednesday
night's game, stretching his legs and going through a series of
sprints to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's notorious throwing jitters, active in June, are
mostly dormant in September, the fault line faded but still in
place. With Damon running from first on a pitch in the first
inning, Rey Sanchez chopped a grounder to second. Knoblauch fielded
the ball cleanly, briefly considered a flip to second before
setting himself, tapping the ball in his glove, stepping with his
left foot and throwing, hard and straight, all in perfect rhythm.
He had a couple of other chances, as well, attempting to finish two
double plays, looking a little awkward but always throwing the ball
straight.

WAS VALDES TIPPING HIS PITCHES?
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The cold, hard facts support the case of Los
Angeles Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter and right-handed pitcher
Ismael Valdes. But their revelation that Valdes was tipping off his
pitches in the four-run first inning of Pittsburgh's 8-3 win
Wednesday at Dodger Stadium drew reactions of surprise in the
Pirates clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was better than the atmosphere of confusion in
the Dodgers clubhouse, where the realization of getting pounded in
three games _ by a cumulative 28-4 score _ brought a sense of
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of six consecutive games, Pittsburgh had the
second-worst road record in the National League entering the
series. They're now 28-43 on the road while the Dodgers are 35-33
at home.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-shocked Dodgers were outscored 14-3 in the first two
innings of the series. On Wednesday, they watched Pittsburgh score
four times in the first inning and make it 5-0 when Adrian Brown
led off the second with a double, scoring on Brian Giles' one-out
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been inconsistent in every aspect of the game,'' Dodgers
shortstop Alex Cora said. ``Sometimes it's hard (to fall behind
early), but the same way they score runs, we can do it, too. And we
know we can do it. It's not like we're going to give up because
they score four runs, but it's hard. You look up and it's like,
`Wow, here we go again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers now trail the first-place San Francisco Giants by 10
games in the National League West. The playoff race has forgotten
them.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting pummeled by the Pirates for the third straight
game, the issue of ``paranoia or problem'' was raised after the
game in regards to Valdes tipping pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew what was coming and were taking advantage of it,
especially when he was pitching from behind,'' Dodgers catcher Chad
Kreuter said. ``We were mixing, and we weren't just throwing
fastballs in fastball counts. We were throwing breaking balls and
change-ups, and they were taking good swings at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter said Valdes was manipulating his glove, which clued
which pitch was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't lie about it. I'd just say nothing,'' Pittsburgh
manager Gene Lamont said. ``I never heard anybody in the dugout say
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then how does one account for what transpired? The Pirates
scored four times in the first inning on five hits and two of the
outs recorded came on balls hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was tipping them, I didn't get it from anybody,'' said
Giles, who went 3 for 5 with two RBI. ``For the most part he
pitched OK, but the few mistakes he made we were able to put in
play and find some holes. Maybe Chad saw something that he did, but
I wasn't aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is 0-3 with a 6.08 ERA since rejoining the Dodgers
in late July, said once he stopped wiggling his glove and tipping
pitches, the Pirates were unable to do anything against him.
</P>
<P>
   After the first inning, the Pirates managed one run and three
hits. At one point, Valdes retired nine consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I was making good pitches, but at times it looked
like they knew what was coming,'' Valdes said. ``I made the
adjustment and after the first inning it was tremendous and they
didn't touch me. I felt much better and I got in a nice rhythm.
You're doing your best, but when you know what's coming, it's
easier to hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Valdes is tipping his pitches, it would be the
best explanation as to why a guy who had a 61-54 record and a 3.38
ERA entering the season is 2-7 with a 5.64 ERA.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Stamp out ``going postal''
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 10, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All along I knew that Patty the Postal Lady was not a latent
killer. Patty delivers the mail to my house. Often, we chat.
Sometimes about the rock music she has bellowing from the portable
radio in her little truck, sometimes about other things. But I
never envisioned that one troubled day she would show up back at
the post office, automatic weapon in hand, and rat-a-tat-tat a
bunch of co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did I think the same of the guy who subs for her on days
off.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved to read last week that an independent commission
has determined statistically that postal workers are no more likely
to blow each other away, to sexually harass or to verbally abuse
than do hamburger flippers at McDonald's, stock clerks at Home
Depot or National Football League players. (Wait a second; I'm not
that sure about the NFL guys.)
</P>
<P>
   The study, done by Columbia University's National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse, determined that postal workers were
``less angry, aggressive, hostile, depressed and stressed'' than
the average American worker.
</P>
<P>
   There were statistics, such as cab drivers are 150 times more
likely to be killed on the job than postal workers. Somewhat
lacking is that the study didn't say if that meant cabbies were 150
times more likely to be killed on the job by other taxi drivers,
which has been the stereotype of postal workers these days.
</P>
<P>
   Leading to this has been the growing apprehension among the
workers themselves, inasmuch as there have been a reported 26
incidents among them since 1986 in which 54 people were murdered.
It made for big headlines, tough jokes and an awful sense of
insecurity within the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The expression ``going postal'' has crept into our spoken tongue
to describe someone who has gone berserk, but the study shows that
``going postal'' means little more than slapping a stamp onto an
envelope and dropping it into the blue box.
</P>
<P>
   Will the perception evaporate with this conclusion? Likely not.
There are some observations, statistical or otherwise, that just
fail to go away.
</P>
<P>
   We media types rarely let a provocative label vanish. Possibly
because of a prior relationship, I've always been irked by
newspaper articles and headlines that exclaim that an ex-Marine has
killed someone or otherwise committed a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   You know, something like: Ex-Marine, 87, Kills Girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The guy likely was a Marine between the ages of 20 and 23, then
became a college student, maybe an insurance salesman, possibly a
school teacher, then a retiree but, for the story and headline
writers, he always will be a Marine. Why? Well, because Marines are
taught to kill; right? And there was a killing. So there always is
that editorial connection. And, besides, it makes for better
reading.
</P>
<P>
   How stimulating is the headline: Ex-insurance salesman, 87,
Kills Girlfriend?
</P>
<P>
   It is astonishing that with all the serial and other prominent
killers this nation has produced, the few unbalanced postal workers
become the model for out-of-control madmen. Why couldn't somebody
be ``going Bundy,'' as in Ted Bundy; or ``going Gacy,'' as in John
Wayne Gacy? (And will unacceptable sexual encounters ever come to
be known as ``going Clinton?'')
</P>
<P>
   Alas, and despite the statistical clearance by the independent
commission, the ``going postal'' expression likely will remain with
us for a while, to be used by stand-up comics, writers and the
young crowd as a synonym for the previous generational depiction,
``going bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time I ever used that term was in the '70s, to
describe Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. I didn't even know what
``bonkers'' meant, just that everyone was using the term. I looked
it up. The dictionary defined ``bonkers'' as being an obsolete
military slang adjective to mean ``to bomb,'' also ``crazy, mad.''
To me, that fit Khomeini, so I used it.
</P>
<P>
   Likely something will happen down the road to create another
expression that will replace ``going postal'' as a trendy
definition of a mad act but for the time being, and despite its
statistical clearance, its a painful, unfair part of the lexicon.

 &HT;    There must be a reason most Texans move in August
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   T.S. Eliot wrote that April was the cruelest month. He never
visited Texas in August.
</P>
<P>
   One joke going around is that the devil was thinking about
moving hell to Texas but decided it was too hot.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only month of the year when I entertain fantasies
about returning to New Hampshire. A fellow expatriate from New
England recently returned from several weeks in Vermont. New
England is having the coolest, wettest summer in recent memory.
High temperatures there were barely above our lows. The natives
were complaining about the cool, wet weather.
</P>
<P>
   Come to Texas in August, Yankee folks. Stay a few weeks. You'll
never complain about cool weather in August again.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit winters in New England are worse than the summers
in Texas and last longer. Besides, you can't find decent barbecue
up North. I'm staying put, but upon retirement I guarantee you'll
find me somewhere cool every summer, even if I have to get a paper
route.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the Lord August is over, though the heat wave is still
very much with us. Now that it's September, at least one can see an
end to this madness, though the high on Sept. 1 was somewhere north
of 105 degrees. But soon it will be October, and temperatures will
again be tolerable, though probably not what normal people would
call cool. There is hope, my friends.
</P>
<P>
   My little brother called me a few weeks ago and said it's
payback time. He's building a new house outside of Dallas and sold
his old one, so he had to move his family into an apartment and put
most of their stuff in storage. Call it kin karma. In my younger
years, I leaned on my father, brothers and friends to help with
many moves. Now that hopefully I'm staying put, they're calling in
their chits. Plus, I have two daughters just now entering the
young-adult moving cycle, and I can count on at least one of them
moving annually for the next 10 years or so, until they get settled
and start producing grandbabies.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of all moves made in Texas are made in August. Of
the 30 of so moves I've made, all but a handful were in the summer,
and most of those were in the dog days. It's as if Texans sit
around trying to figure out a way to make their lives even more
miserable. ``I know, let's move 10 tons of stuff while the
temperature is 104 degrees. That'll be fun!''
</P>
<P>
   There was the added dubious benefit of my brother living in
Dallas, which has gone more than two months without rain and is the
second-hottest large city in America, next to Phoenix. Think it's
hot here behind the Pine Curtain, where at least most of the land
isn't covered in concrete or asphalt? Try Dallas. The trees in
Dallas are hoping dogs mistake them for a fire hydrant. It's even
too hot for the fireants, most of whom have migrated to East Texas
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike me, my brother has never been divorced, and I hope never
will. The only good thing I can attribute to divorce is that it
definitely lightens your load of worldly possessions, especially if
you have a couple decrees under your belt. The upshot of all this
is that my brother has more stuff than several small Third-World
countries. There are boxes upon boxes of stuff, some of which has
remained unpacked for the last several moves. If there is a prize
for most stuff accumulated by one middle-class human being, he's in
the running. I was vigorously expounding the virtues of annual
garage sales to him by the time we had filled a storage unit and an
entire garage with stuff, crammed a three-bedroom apartment full
and still had a pile of possessions left in the old house by the
time darkness fell and exhaustion set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you sell some of this worthless (expletive
deleted)?'' I believe is what I screamed. Sorry. This outburst came
after I had made my fourth trip to the storage building with my
flatbed trailer full of boxes containing such valuable items as my
old slot-car racetrack and old Boy Scout uniforms. Why he has them,
I have no idea, other than my mother had failed to foist them upon
me. I am not much of a sentimentalist.
</P>
<P>
   I survived the move and actually lost a few pounds even while
drinking gallons of water and Gatorade. Now, as the sprinkler runs
at night and keeps the city flush in cash when I pay my water bill,
I doze in the recliner and pretend it's raining when the water hits
the window outside my study. Raining, cold, gray skies and a harsh
northern wind. What a pleasant thought.
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait.

 &HT;    Lakes being assaulted by airborne mercury
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a cryptic acronym. Ten years ago a research arm of
the nation's utilities established the Power Plant Integrated
System Chemical Emission Study.
</P>
<P>
   That's PISCES. The zodiac sign of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES was established to study mercury levels in coal and in
the exhaust of coal-fired plants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a lot of people are doing the same type of mercury
analysis, on fish. And the evidence is convincing. Increasingly,
fish are getting mercury poisoning, at least in part from the air.
That means mercury is going who-knows-where-else.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was skeptical two years ago when the Environmental
Protection Agency prepared to crack down on mercury pollution by
coal-fired plants. It stopped EPA from enforcing restrictions until
it had more information.
</P>
<P>
   Last month that information arrived. A panel assembled by the
National Academy of Sciences stated that the EPA was right to be
setting stringent mercury standards for power plants.
</P>
<P>
   This confirmation is set against a backdrop of mounting evidence
about the dangers of methyl mercury linked to power-plant
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time utilities dismissed this as speculation _ that
the mercury was in the water naturally or from other sources. There
are many sources of mercury pollution, some natural. But a growing
source is air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's power plants emit 50 tons of mercury every year _
one-third of all mercury introduced into our environment. While
Texas controls mercury in such emitters as waste incinerators, it
doesn't in utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems hard to grasp. It helps to get down to earth,
actually, to go under water _ to the Steinhagen Reservoir in Jasper
County, where you'd be wise to put back that large-mouth bass, and
where the freshwater drum is falsely advertised. Steinhagen is
among a growing list of lakes with mercury advisories _ also places
like Caddo Lake in Harrison and Marion Counties, and Sam Rayburn
Reservoir near Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   The link between coal-fired plants and any particular location
is hard to prove. Acidic soil, or acidity that comes from sulfur
dioxide emissions and acid rain, is said to contribute to the
creation of methyl mercury in water when airborne mercury is
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has no routine testing of waterways and aquatic life for
mercury. If it did, say environmental groups, it would probably
have far more fish advisories. Minnesota has issued hundreds of
fish advisories, not because it is more polluted but because it is
more diligent.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that diligence is in order. When ingested by a
pregnant woman, methyl mercury makes a bee-line for the womb. It
passes through the placenta and accumulates, where it can cause
brain damage or long-range development problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from mothers and fathers, fishing industries have the most
to lose from mercury poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Tuna Foundation urged Congress to get off the
dime on the issue of curbing mercury emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, this year the Public Utility Commission issued a
wide-ranging edict requiring utilities to look ahead 10 years to
what pollution controls will be required and to estimate the costs,
including the retrofitting or retiring of grandfathered power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury was among the major pollutants cited by the PUC along
with biggies like ozone and greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the EPA will come out with a mercury action plan
postponed two years by a disbelieving Congress. One wonders how
many years that action will take.

   QUAKE-FAULT (San Francisco) _ The gentle-looking hills of
Northern California may forever hide the identity of the dark force
a previously unknown earthquake fault that shook Napa County over
the weekend. Experts have yet to identify the exact location of the
fault, and may never be able to if it's buried miles beneath the
surface, said leading quake authority William Ellsworth of the U.S.
Geological Survey. The quake caused more than 70 injuries, mostly
minor, and at least $15 million in damages. By KEAY DAVIDSON.

   INSECTICIDE-HUMANS (San Francisco) _ Pesticide Action Network, a
San Francisco-based environmental group, is formally introducing
the first comprehensive online database on the health hazards of
more than 5,100 ingredients in Sevin and other home and garden
pesticides. ``Most people think that if the EPA allows a pesticide
to be sold, it must be safe to use,'' said Susan Kegley, a staff
scientist at the network. ``Unfortunately, that's not true, and
finding out whether a particular pesticide is linked to cancer,
birth defects or other problems can be extremely difficult.'' By

   PROP-209 (San Francisco) _ Civil rights groups that hoped to

minorities and women in recruitment, without promising favorable
treatment in jobs or contracts _ and showed little doubt about the
answer. By BOB EGELKO.

show nothing live. Instead, the network will present premier events
roughly 17 hours after they have ended. The network insists on

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a
peasant environmentalist and an Army colonel _ human rights group
believe are unjustly imprisoned now.

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications
and Internet provider in Russia must install a program designed by
the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good. WAN:

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an
investment that reaps priceless returns. A growing number of that
same group are beginning to question Israel's reliance on American
largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CENSUS-ADJUST _ A federal lawsuit against the state of Virginia

results instead of statistically adjusted counts to redraw
legislative districts. A dozen major U.S. cities and counties have
joined the fight against a Virginia law passed this year by the
GOP-dominated legislature. Urban areas, with large minority
populations traditionally undercounted by the census, fear the
Virginia law will set a national precedent. (Holmes, Cox News

   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given
millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world
grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways
to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one
of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20
years ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to
implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under
the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong
villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner, Atlanta

they said. Weigh before you go. Weigh after you come back. You'll
be five pounds heavier. And I thought you were supposed to leave
your cares behind on a cruise. Would this be the diary of a

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE 'PEOPLE'S GAMES' SHUT OUT CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (s) sports categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sports buffs in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin
America will soon be watching the Olympic Games live from Sydney on
their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, most fans will be fed only
tape-delayed coverage, sometimes a day after actual events occur.
Only Americans who live near the Canadian border or who own
mega-satellite dishes may escape the real-time ban.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are at work here. One is the $3.5 billion that NBC
paid for the exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the Games through
2008. The other is the 15-hour time difference between Sydney and
the Eastern time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you're thinking of jumping the bar on as-it-happens
Olympic reporting by watching via a Webcast? You don't need to live
in China to know that the Internet can leap across national
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, as they Games unfold, lots of Web sites _ including
the official one, Olympics.com _ will offer results, schedules and
background data. But they have all been shut out of video streaming
coverage of the events.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the chance that videotaping enthusiasts working
from overseas or folks who bring a digital camera into 110,000-seat
Olympic Stadium will beam unofficial Webcasts. The Internet isn't
known for bowing easily to rulemakers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that threat, International Olympic Committee, the
beneficiary of those NBC billions, will field a special team to
scan cyberspace for pirated material.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is free to use its own Web site to show the Games, in the
same way that it could forgo heartwarming ``Today'' show blather
from Australia to show some actual events as they happen in (local)
prime-time. But it has no plans to so.
</P>
<P>
   Says Gary Zenkel, who heads the marketing of NBC's Sydney
coverage: ``Right now, the Olympics garners a premium in both
rights fees and ad buys because it is able to attract and sustain
an enormous TV audience. Until that audience and those advertising
dollars are diverted to other (media) platforms, we will not in any
way compromise the value of the exclusivity of TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outright Internet ban also delays any such diversion in
favor of tightly produced Olympics, built around mostly U.S.
athletes with star potential.
</P>
<P>
   There's bound to come a time, however, when modern technology
and ancient avarice converge to let the dot-coms into the Games _
although, if the NBC brass has it way, that time may be a long time
in coming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the British Broadcasting Corp. first instituted the
idea of media rights fees for the equivalent of $3,000. (The
British organizers never cashed their check.)
</P>
<P>
   The first live TV feed came eight years later at the Winter
Games in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. On that occasion, Olympic honcho
Avery Brundage sniffed: ``We ... have done well without TV for 60
years and will do so certainly for the next 60 years, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Come December, the world's top Olympicrats will hold a summit in
their Swiss lair to figure out where ever-expanding cyberspace fits
into what they like to call the ``People's Games.'' But you won't
find a Webcast of that meeting on the Internet either.

BE AWARE OF DISTRIBUTIONS BEFORE BUYING A FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Financial Commentary)

<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can escape taxes. But mutual fund investors may be able
to sidestep them _ at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds are required to pass along dividends and net
realized capital gains to shareholders every year. Shareholders
must then pay taxes on these distributions.
</P>
<P>
   If you know a fund will be making a large taxable distribution
shortly, or if there are telltale signs that a distribution may be
in the offing, you may want to wait to buy that fund. Otherwise,
you could wind up paying taxes on the gains a fund has made for
other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to buy into a distribution if you know there's
going to be one,'' says Bryan Olson, director at Charles Schwab's
Center for Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   Most funds make these distributions toward the end of the year,
particularly in December. So, if you're looking to put some money
to
</P>
<P>
   work in a mutual fund, check to see if a distribution looms. You
may decide that the short-term tax hit doesn't bother you if you
plan to be in the fund for the long haul, but at least you won't be
blindsided.
</P>
<P>
   A BIG YEAR FOR DISTRIBUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a year to be wary,'' warns Morningstar's
Russ Kinnel.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the pace of fund distributions well exceeds
last year's, with several funds having passed along enormous
capital gains. For example, the Warburg Pincus Japan Growth fund
and the Warburg Pincus Japan Small Company fund paid out giant
gains. Generally, any distribution that's more than 15 percent of a
fund's net asset value, or NAV, is considered large. These Warburg
Pincus funds made distributions that were 22 percent and 55 percent
of their NAVs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And these are not isolated incidents, since it's a good bet that
more will be coming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, more than 150 funds produced returns of 100 percent or
higher. Now as fund managers sell some of the stocks that delivered
those triple-digit returns, they are realizing big capital gains.
And the realized gains that outweigh the realized losses get passed
on the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   THE HORSE'S MOUTH
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in finding out if a fund plans a
distribution, the first place to check is the horse's mouth. A fund
will generally make only one major distribution of capital gains a
year, typically, but not always, just after its fiscal year ends.
Sometimes those distributions are a surprise, and sometimes the
funds give notice.
</P>
<P>
   If the distribution is announced, you can probably find that
information on the fund company's Web site, or by calling the firm.
Right now, the fund companies may not be able to get into
specifics. If the company cannot tell you that a distribution is
coming, it at least should be able to tell you when in the past it
has handed out distributions and how large they have been.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find out when the distribution is coming, you'll want
to know the ever-important record date, which is used to determine
who is eligible to receive the fund's next distribution. If you own
the fund on the record date, you'll get the distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, some fund companies try to keep shareholders well
informed about coming distributions, which is just as helpful if
you're only a potential shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The managers at the Brandywine funds gave shareholders specific
distribution information in a recent letter.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-August, the Brandywine fund had realized approximately
$13.75 per share of gains to be distributed to shareholders of
record on Oct. 26. Of that amount, $8.20 will be taxable at the
lower 20 percent long-term rate.
</P>
<P>
   That's just an estimate, and the final number won't be available
until early October. But at least Brandywine is trying to keep its
investors informed.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund companies will release these estimates later in the
year, as the actual distribution dates approach.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR CLUES
</P>
<P>
   If the company hasn't given any indication that a distribution
is coming, there are other clues.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hint is performance. When a fund has racked up huge
gains in the past year, the manager may have done some selling this
year to lock in gains. That translates into distributions.
</P>
<P>
   A fund that's been experiencing heavy shareholder selling during
the year could also be poised to make a fat distribution. A manager
might be forced to sell stock to meet these redemptions, realizing
gains in the process. If you've noticed a considerable drop in a
fund's assets that doesn't correspond with its performance, you
might expect to see a big distribution around the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Another key sign that a distribution may be coming is when the
fund's management changes hands. If new managers want to tweak the
holdings to reflect their personal style, that selling often
results in distributions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how big a coming distribution might be, that
information is even tougher to find. But Morningstar calculates the
potential capital-gains exposure in a fund, which you can find on
the fund-tracking firm's Web site. (A recent story screened for
funds that could be on the cusp of making a big distribution.)
</P>
<P>
   That's helpful, but it still won't tell you the exact amount of
a fund's next distribution.
</P>
<P>
   THE FLIP SIDE
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, should you sell a fund if a distribution is
coming? That depends on a variety of conditions, the main one being
whether you plan to stay in the fund. If you do, it's worth it to
take the tax hit from the distribution, which you can offset by
selling a stock or other security at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you may want to sell if you're less than enamored of the
fund. For example, if you purchased a fund at the beginning of the
year and it has lost money, you may be better off selling it to
realize the loss than sitting on it and taking the taxable
distribution. If you sit on it, you get the double whammy of
holding a money-losing fund that is inflicting tax pain.
</P>
<P>
   The long and short of it: If you're planning to buy a fund or
two in the next few months, you should at least try to find out
when a distribution is coming and how big it might be. Or, you can
pick a fund _ such as a broad index fund or an exchange-traded fund
_ that typically doesn't pass along big taxable distributions,
which lets you sleep a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative: paying taxes that you might have been able to
avoid.

&HT;     WHAT'S UP? FOR TEENS, NIGHTS OF INSTANT CYBER CHATS

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last week, still summer's halcyon days of Britney
Spears, tennis and sleeping in, 14-year-old Caitlin Orlofsky and
her friends caught up on it all, in a conversation punctuated by
LOLs.
</P>
<P>
   The abbreviation, for Laugh Out Loud, also signifies the fun,
busy social lives of teen-agers who straddle the real world and
cyberspace, by sending instant messages in real-time computer
discussions that may make their parents reminisce about the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   IMs _ ``instant messages'' popularized by market leader America
Online _ are the stuff of enthusiastic and lengthy, late-night
on-line conversations that start with ``Hey, what's up?'' _ or SUP
_ and end several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty addicted to it,'' said Brent Ruhle, 14, of Ballston
Spa, N.Y. ``Most of my friends use it. Since they use it, it's a
lot easier to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruhle has used AOL instant messaging for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Orlofsky, alerted by a friend to instant messages about six
months ago, also has become an avid user, filling her ``Buddy
List'' to the maximum, with the screen names of 160 friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy way to stay in touch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the teen-age pastime _ these long dialogues, they say,
are about the day's events, plans for the week, playing on-line
games or just goofing around _ is Internet growth on par with the
rise of e-mail several years back, analysts have reported.
Approximately 90 million America Online subscribers, as well as
users who can download the AOL's free Instant Messenger, daily send
approximately 650 million instant messages, said AOL spokeswoman
Jane Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, according to news reports, has repeatedly blocked rival
companies, such as MSN and AT&AMP;T, from letting their customers
access the massive network, citing the privacy and security of AOL
members.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike e-mail, instant messaging allows a quick volley of
real-time conversation. Messages are heralded by dialogue boxes on
the computer screen or by customized sounds, and depending on the
computer, participants can speak through microphones.
</P>
<P>
   While instant messaging has existed since the 1980s, several
recent features have helped propel its word-of-mouth popularity.
</P>
<P>
   AOL in 1996 created the Buddy List, the prepared list of social
groups, like family members or the soccer team, that also alerts
users when the people on their personal list are on line. ``What it
really did was bring an element of community to what was a solitary
on-line experience,'' Lennon said. AOL in 1997 introduced the free
Instant Messenger. The free service is ``an extension of our brand
and it's an enormous value for our existing members,'' Lennon said,
since it widens their on-line circle to non-subscribing friends.
</P>
<P>
   In February, AOL also announced the launch of a mobile service
that will allow subscribers to access the Internet, instant
messaging and e-mail through wireless phones and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   In sending IMs, teen-agers demonstrate the computer dexterity
for which they've become famous, carrying on a chat with up to 20
people, as Orlofsky does, and at other times, doing their homework,
while exchanging messages about weekend plans or talking to their
working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some caution: Several teen-agers who use instant messaging
demonstrated caution about releasing too much information about
themselves or talking to strangers on line.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin Orlofsky simply finds it more fun to talk to her
friends. Brent Ruhle uses different screen names. He occasionally
receives messages from strangers, who presumably have found him via
a Buddy List feature that seeks out people with similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sims, 14, of Ballston Spa, said that at one site he meets
fellow enthusiasts of the on-line game Star Craft, who then gather
around their computers to message each other about results. His
profile, though, is filled with song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin's parents, Susan and Paul, are mindful of her on-line
conversations and feel the need to double-check how her friendships
are formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always asking her, `How did you meet that kid?''' Susan
Orlofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL does offer a system of controls that allows parents to limit
the sending and receiving of instant messages and e-mail, as well
as access to chats, Lennon said. The free Instant Messenger offers
built-in privacy preferences, such as blocking select messages,
though parents obviously would need to be aware that their child
had downloaded the service.
</P>
<P>
   Other young people have heard their parents' urgings to get off
of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me I spend too much time on it, but I have other
things, like football and stuff, so that I get away from the
computer,'' Brent Ruhle said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Incessant instant messaging may ease as teenagers age.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Potente, now 17, visiting the Orlofskys one afternoon at
their Ballston Spa home, recalls the hours he spent
instant-messaging with some disdain. ``This is how I used to be
talking to people _ about nothingness,'' Potente said of ``What's
up?'' banter. His computer use is now more specific, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhle sees the point. At first, he'd battle his family for
maximum computer time. ``After a while you get bored with it and
realize you've got to go out and do other things.''

CONFRONTING THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS IN THE BACKYARD
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   When Janet and Jim bought their
lovely old house in downtown Santa Rosa, Calif., they were thrilled
to be on a creek. This is an area where Santa Rosa Creek runs free,
not confined to concrete.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' says Janet. ``We were in the middle of
town and we had mallard ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   As well, down by the creek they had large twisted oak trees,
thick bushes and green hollows. Janet and Jim imagined an idyllic
picnic spot and a place for kids to skip rocks and catch pollywogs.
They didn't imagine a homeless encampment.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are strangers living along the creek, at the end of
their property, past their gardens and down the hill. If you had
nowhere to sleep and knew you'd be rousted in a park or chased off
the steps of a storefront, you might covet such a peaceful, pretty
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Janet and Jim provided a tour one afternoon when the place was
empty of people but dotted with bags of food and clothing,
mattresses, pillows, sleeping bags, magazines, an office chair, a
stack of couch cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Janet spots something propped up in a bush and pulls out a
crutch. ``Now this makes me want to cry,'' she says, which shows
how much sympathy is mixed in with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Janet says her inclination, at one time, would have been to say,
``Poor homeless people. Leave them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But now she's living the problem and worried about threats to
her child, her dog and her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a liberal,'' she says. ``But when it affects you and your
property the issue goes deeper than your politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you live in the country, like I do, and consider street
people a fact of urban life. But they're not an acceptable fact.
Occasionally street people come too close to those who live in
houses and there are confrontations. Shelters and group homes are
proposed for the homeless, the addicted, the mentally ill, and
people who live in the neighborhood protest.
</P>
<P>
   They're commonly known as NIMBYs _ people who say, ``not in my
back yard,'' regarding a facility they don't want to see move in
next door or down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Janet and Jim literally fit the label, because it is their
personal backyard which has become an unauthorized campground. It
is difficult to tell how many people sleep there, although last
week there appeared to be at least four separate sites scattered in
the trees and bushes. Of course, people don't just sleep there.
They eat there and go to the bathroom there and when the night
cools, they often make fires there.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Janet believe in taking care of the less fortunate. They
donate to the Food Bank. They've given money to people on the
street. But they feel like they've given enough. An incredulous Jim
said one cop even told him they could be liable if one of the
uninvited got hurt on their property.
</P>
<P>
   Janet says, ``I think if the city cannot provide a shelter then
maybe it has to let people sleep on public property.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked a woman who advocates for the homeless what she'd do if
people moved into her yard and she shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dilemma. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite because
where I personally live it's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet and Jim have posted ``No Trespassing'' signs, which don't
last long. They have a big dog. They're installing flood lights,
even though they doubt they'll last any longer than the signs.
They've fenced off most of their yard but can't fence all the way
to the creek because the waterline changes dramatically when it
rains.
</P>
<P>
   They call the police when they see trespassers. Officers come by
and look to see if there's any drug use or criminal activity and
usually end up telling the campers to move on. But either the same
ones sneak back or new people discover the spot. Their house has
not been broken into. Nor have they been accosted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lay there imagining all kinds of things,'' says Janet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's more the threat of what might happen that makes
them uneasy and, yes, resentful. That's gotten worse as their child
became old enough to play outside and have friends over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to train a child so early about watching out for
strangers,'' laments Janet. ``You can't let them go to public parks
or walk to school alone, but at least you consider your backyard a
safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   The creek stays pretty quiet during the day but around
dinnertime there are voices. Sometimes late at night there is
arguing and cursing. Sometimes there's the smell of marijuana and
wood smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Janet tries to be understanding. ``At first I thought, `There
but for the grace of God go I.' I know people have unforeseen
circumstances and sometimes no place to go. But I hate feeling
uncomfortable in my own home.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has been tempted to move, but there's an issue, says
Janet. If they listed their house for sale they'd have to disclose
an existing problem in the backyard.

A LEGAL MILESTONE DESTINED FOR THE DOGHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   News item: A group of lawyers has
founded the Great Apes Legal Project in hopes of extending basic
legal protections to primates and, possibly, other animals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Buster Grimes? Would you please take the stand?
</P>
<P>
   Buster: (Sneeze)
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?
</P>
<P>
   Buster: (Scratch)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Isn't it true, Buster, that your owner has forced
you to eat from a bowl on the floor for the past four years and
compelled you to perform your business in the back yard for all the
world to see without even giving you a magazine to read?
</P>
<P>
   Buster: (Snoring)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: And isn't it also true, Buster, that your owner has
called you insulting names when you bark at TV doorbells; gives you
only the toughest, gristliest remnants of his steak dinner and will
not share the pillow with you when you sleep in his bed?
</P>
<P>
   (Last accusation brings audible gasp of shock and disbelief from
jury.)
</P>
<P>
   Buster: (Wet snuffling)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Have there not also been times, Buster, when your
owner has left you alone in the house and forgotten to turn on the
classical music station you like so much to keep you company? And
that these long afternoons without Debussy and Rachmaninoff
sometimes leave you feeling detached and dislocated with subtle
shadings of ennui?
</P>
<P>
   Buster: (Licking)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Buster, would you please tell the court how your
owner addresses these unfulfilled yearnings of the soul, this pit
of existential dread in which he forces you to wallow day after
meaningless day? Does he take you in for counseling? Does he enroll
you in a 12-step program? Does he encourage you to call in to Dr.
Laura?
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it appears that Buster cannot
speak right now. Perhaps the trauma has been too great. Perhaps the
words are too painful to utter. Perhaps it is just a flea. No
matter. As his advocate and counselor, I can answer this question
for him: Buster and his owner play tug-of-war with a sock!
</P>
<P>
   (Loud sobbing from jury box. A woman faints, briefly
interrupting testimony.)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: That is right, ladies and gentlemen. The owner's
answer to all problems besetting this poor, mistreated,
emotionally-starved dog is to make him pull on a sock.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any sock, ladies and gentlemen, but a dirty sock.
One that has been on the owner's foot during a five-hour round of
golf in August or while he was mowing the lawn. He invites his dog
to put this fetid thing in his mouth and Buster, a classic
co-dependent, obeys.
</P>
<P>
   What comes next I can hardly bear to describe. The owner tugs on
the sock so hard that Buster is occasionally lifted off his feet.
Buster growls and shakes his head _ ``No! No! Please stop! You are
not addressing my needs!'' _ but Buster's owner pays no heed. The
game continues until the sock is stretched hopelessly out of shape
or Buster's owner grows tired, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Buster's soul is still crying out for help but now he has sock
threads stuck between his teeth, too.
</P>
<P>
   (Something flies out of the jury box and hits Buster's owner in
the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. It is a heavy
refrigerator-magnet with the message ``Dogs Are People, Too.'')
</P>
<P>
   (Recess.)

   NY-LATIN-MUSIC (New York) _ Turn the dial on your radio three
times these days, and chances are you will tune in to at least one
Latin artist, whether it's Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez or Carlos
Santana. New York City has long been a crucible for the
Latin-American music now known as salsa. The city also wins credit,
in many quarters, for transforming big-band mambo. And it lays
claim to Cubop, a fusion of be-bop's brass and Afro-Cuban
percussion. Some music historians even say New York is responsible
for the various dance crazes that went along with Latin music
forms, like the cha-cha in the 1950s and the pachanga a decade
later. By Nina Siegal.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sports writers who went to the Munich Olympics
in 1972 love to tell this story. They were covering the usual
favorites of the Games _ track and field, swimming, boxing. Their
editors, tuned into what the American public was watching back
home, called and ordered up features on the phenomenon of the
Games, a tiny gymnast from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The sportswriters, so close to the action, were baffled. ``Who's
Olga Korbut?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Korbut was television's baby. Before ABC, the Olympic network in
'72, put her on the air, gymnastics wasn't treated as a real sport
in the American media. But then Korbut was beamed into living rooms
around the country, and the audience was utterly smitten. Four
years later, Americans would be equally captivated by a Romanian
teen-ager, Nadia Comaneci.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of the Cold War, Americans cheered for two young
women who learned their back flips behind the Iron Curtain. ABC had
helped the Olympics accomplish their stated, but often elusive,
mission. Watching Korbut on the balance beam brought the world
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Games are still, like Korbut, television's baby. But
the network of 2000, NBC, isn't much of a parent. The Sydney Games
will be stuck in lockdown, on a rigid schedule.
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans to show nothing live. Not a dash by Marion Jones, not
a vault by Amy Chow.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of immediacy, in the Internet world, NBC will present
premier events roughly 17 hours after they have ended. The network
insists on treating this global spectacle as an extension of its
entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the time-zone difference creates a huge problem. The
marquee events in Sydney will start at about 4 a.m. in the Eastern
United States. But only one thing prevents NBC from showing the
events live and then repeating them in a prime-time broadcast
later. And it isn't concern about compounding America's
sleep-deprivation crisis. The bulk of the audience might choose to
videotape the live version and edit out the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   So even though NBC and its two cable affiliates will be putting
on countless hours of programming from Sydney, viewers will have to
follow the old ritual of covering ears and eyes to avoid news from
the Games before they can get home to see the events on television.
</P>
<P>
   America Online conducted an informal survey of its members and
learned that 75 percent did not want results from the Olympics
before NBC had shown the event. AOL will have try to keep the
results off its main screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Olympic motto of ``Faster, stronger, higher'' should
probably give way to one from the TV age: ``Don't tell me. Don't
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   My newspaper learned just how much TV controls the Olympics and
their audiences after the Nagano Games in 1998. My mailbox was full
of nasty notes, including a memorable mother-daughter missive that
said: ``CBS must want to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   My capital crime was reporting that Tara Lipinski had upset
Michelle Kwan for the women's figure skating gold.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper hit the street several hours before CBS fit the
event into its prime-time schedule, the perfect showcase for
Coca-Cola commercials, if not Lipinski's triple Lutz.
</P>
<P>
   I understood why the letter-writers were upset. In the years
when I didn't cover the Games, I avoided hearing results, too.
</P>
<P>
   But after listening for years to colleagues deride
figure-skating as a nonsport, as something that should be relegated
to the features pages, I believe that the Games must be treated as
breaking news. It's disrespectful to the contestants to do anything
less.
</P>
<P>
   It's also disrespectful to the audience. In this country,
Olympic viewing is heavily female, and the event is packaged
accordingly, with soft-focus features. The assumption seems to be
that women won't appreciate sports as sports. The show has to be
gussied up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of NBC's features end up being excellent, but the network
condescends to its viewers by making them watch the Olympic Games
strictly in that through-the-Cuisinart format.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Canadian television will offer live feeds to its
audience, an unnerving prospect for the American network. In border
states, Americans will be able to watch live, and satellite dishes
could allow another end-run around the peacock network.
</P>
<P>
   And some newspapers will have same-day coverage of events,
beating the network's presentation. If this ruins anyone's fun, I
apologize. I am sincerely sorry that NBC has the Olympics in
lockdown.

 &HT;    Frank Capra optimism, philosophic hit men and twists make 'Nurse
Betty' a hit.
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Spunky, sunny Betty Sizemore is a swell
diner waitress, but don't expect much service from her while the
hospital soap opera ``A Reason to Love'' is on the air. Betty
(Renee Zellweger) is fixated on that show and on that dashing
do-gooder, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), its leading character.
</P>
<P>
   So it is almost logical _ or as logical as the nutty, yet sweet
``Nurse Betty'' gets _ that when she witnesses the scalping and
killing of her philandering, abusive husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) by
a pair of professional hit men, Betty loses touch with reality and
tumbles down a rabbit hole into the world of soaps. Convinced that
she is Dr. David's ex-fiancee, she treks from Kansas to Los Angeles
to reunite with him, followed by the assassins (Morgan Freeman and
Chris Rock, an inspired pairing), who are after Del's drug stash.
</P>
<P>
   The joys of ``Nurse Betty'' are its yin and yang of abrupt
Quentin Tarantino violence and philosophy-spouting bad guys, mixed
with the innocent optimism of Frank Capra. The surprise is that
this audience-friendly juggling act comes from director Neil
LaBute, previously known for such nasty, misogynistic films as ``In
the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' The last
thing you would expect from him is an Oz-like odyssey with such a
radiant, albeit delusional, Dorothy Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those earlier LaBute movies were composed of inert,
talky two-character exchanges, but he demonstrates his assurance
here with complex set-ups, crowd scenes and the glossy sheen made
possible by a higher budget. While it is an easy target to spoof
soap operas, notice what carefree fun LaBute has with these
television sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, this is the first of his films that LaBute did
not write. Much of the credit goes to rookie screenwriters John C.
Richards and James Flamberg, whose frequently inspired plot twists,
tongue-in-cheek dialogue and evident affection for their characters
keep the movie from turning dour.
</P>
<P>
   Never doubt that soap operas are educational, however, for Betty
is able to fake being a nurse just from watching ``A Reason to
Love.'' She demonstrates her triage skills during a hospital
parking lot shoot-out and later caringly ministers to patients on
the sly. When she eventually meets the actor who plays Dr. David,
she relates to him in character, which he takes to be a skilled
improvisational audition. Amused and impressed, he offers her a
chance to be on the soap, which leads her to a sobering collision
with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger may well be Hollywood's millennial answer to Doris
Day, with wholesome good looks and a gentle comic flair. ``Nurse
Betty,'' a better vehicle for Zellweger than the more mean-spirited
``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' offers her a starring role with both broad
and subtle touches. We need to understand and empathize with Betty
throughout and Zellweger amiably charts those difficult waters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she almost has the movie stolen from her by Rock and
Freeman, as a hot-headed, impatient young gunslinger and his
soft-spoken mentor, whose true relationship is purposely withheld
until late in the tale. Rock projects a street punk mean streak,
while Freeman is old school philosophic. The more he tracks down
Betty, the more he begins to understand her plight and eventually
falls in love with her.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Betty runs on a bit too long and has a few false endings,
but ultimately LaBute and his writers know exactly where they want
to take us. Psychically and geographically, Betty travels far from
Kansas, and those with an affection for the quirky will enjoy
following where she leads us.
</P>
<P>

   3 -1/2 stars

</P>

<P>
   The verdict: A loopy yarn of a soap opera-addicted waitress,
played by a sunny Renee Zellweger, who leaves Kansas for the Oz of
L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In Israel, national pride comes wrapped in military
might and emblazoned on the T-shirts sold to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``America don't worry,'' quips one T-shirt with a drawing of an
F-16 fighter jet. ``Israel is behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, of course, it is the other way around. U.S. aid to
Israel has been the backbone of this country's defenses for at
least 15 years. More than one-fifth of Israel's approximately $9.3
billion defense budget, including expenditures for nearly half its
equipment each year, comes from America.
</P>
<P>
   But that aid is being criticized, just as Israelis may ask for
billions more. With the encouragement of President Clinton, they
seek money to beef up the army as they offer land in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Most favor the idea, but arms control experts deride the annual
$2 billion military aid package as fueling an arms race in an
already volatile region. And Israelis seem reluctant to pay for
large increases in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Israeli executives say the reliance on American guns
and planes stunts the growth of their own arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders of defense industries say, 'Enough to U.S. aid,'''
cried a headline in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth last month(CQ).
``We don't need its favors.''
</P>
<P>
   They are angry because under terms of the aid agreements, most
of the money must be spent in the United States. The policy, they
say, will cost them thousands of jobs over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time you are trying to help us you are doing us
terrible harm,'' says Abraham Hatzor, chief executive of an Israeli
company that makes bulletproof vests, military tents and other
textiles.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the United States gave Israel more military aid than
usual, $3.12 billion. It was more than the rest of the world
combined received for military aid in the main U.S. aid budget,
according to figures from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money, $1.2 billion, was a special grant to be given
over three years as Israel implements the 1998 Wye River peace
accords _ under which Israel agreed to give to the Palestinians
land it captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   The long-stated purpose of the military aid is to ensure that
Israel always maintains an edge over its potential enemies. Most
agree Israel has the best fighting force in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shopping list for American equipment over the last two
years is long and varied. According to a tally kept by the
Federation of American Scientists' Arms Sales Monitoring Project,
Israel has spent billions on everything from F-16 fighters to
Apache helicopters to air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Israeli officials contend that their military is woefully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to modernize our air force, modernize the navy and
modernize our vehicles. Some of them, you won't believe this, are
from World War II,'' said Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh. ``The point is that Israel faces tremendous military problems
given the environment we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israelis say U.S. aid is crucial as they try to make
peace with the Palestinians, or Syria. As they give up land, they
need extra military might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much cheaper to assist Israel to deter war than to assist
Israel when it is at war,'' Israeli Ret. Brig. Gen. Shlomo Brom
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Federation of American Scientists researchers say
increasing the military aid just fuels an arms race that makes the
region more dangerous. They say the aid antagonizes rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to a point where Israel's lead is significant enough
that you don't need to give them more,'' says Tamar Gabelnick,
director of the FAS's Arms Sales Monitoring Project. ``I don't
think it's really credible for them to say we need more weapons. I
see it as a way for them to get as much as possible from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis themselves seem to show little enthusiasm for spending
more on defense.
</P>
<P>
   A February poll by the Israeli Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies showed just 28 percent of Israelis willing to pay higher
taxes for more security. (The poll surveyed 1,201 people, and had a
3.1 percent margin of error one way or the other.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, last year, U.S. officials warned Israeli leaders
that proposed defense cuts in Israel would make it harder to ask
for more U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   But, the army is still a popular and nearly omnipresent part of
Israeli life. Service is compulsory for most men and women.
Soldiers patrol the streets with their U.S.-made M-16s, and
casually take them to the malls and restaurants while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day affords a solemn moment each spring, when sirens
bring the nation to a halt and motorists pull over to stand by
their cars in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Given that sense of pride, it's hard to find detractors of the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody asks the questions, 'Do you buy what you need, or do
you just buy because you have the money?''' said Reuven Pedatzur, a
military analyst and former pilot in the Israeli Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Pedatzur has been a lone critic of Israel's Arrow missile
defense project, which has received $820 million in U.S. aid
separate from the annual package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me, 'Why are you against it? It's American
money.''' he says. ``When you're talking about American money,
nobody wants to ask the questions.''

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Three doors from the austere facade of the
U.S. Embassy is the ``Buzz Stop,'' a beachfront bar where the
American-Israeli relationship flows as smoothly as the draught on
tap.
</P>
<P>
   A miniature Statue of Liberty stands above the entrance and
Israeli owner Eli Barel holds court on the patio overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea. Behind him there's a booming city, where cranes
hover over new malls and skyscrapers, and sport utility vehicles
clog the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the child of America. They have been with us from the
beginning. They raised us,'' Barel says in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But even Barel is not aware that the United States usually gives
his small country some $3 billion a year _ equaling about $500 for
each of the 6 million Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give that much, then God bless America,'' says the
hefty 50-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   America's blessings are likely to increase. Israel is growing
wealthy and already draws one-fifth of all U.S. foreign aid, but it
will likely be getting more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for a peace agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel _ and the Palestinians have threatened to
declare a state with, or without Israel's approval. After the
failure of July's Camp David peace talks, American mediators are
pressing for an agreement, which could cost more than $17 billion
in aid to Israel for upgrading its military over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a country smaller than Vermont, Israelis say they can only
offer land for peace if their army is stronger. And they want
America to help pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton promised to pitch in, but a few
congressional leaders have blanched. First, they were upset at
Israeli plans, over U.S. objections, to sell an advanced radar
plane to China. Israel eventually cancelled the deal. Then, some in
Congress didn't like the price Israel placed on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their sentiments echo a minority both inside and outside Israel
who say it's time for the country to get by with less help from
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider Israel a strategic ally and I want it to
succeed, but at the same time I don't want Israeli citizens to
assume this is an entitlement, like food stamps in the Middle
East,'' says Alabama Republican Rep. Sonny Callahan, who heads the
House subcommittee that writes the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
   Says Callahan, who favors eliminating economic, though not
military, aid to Israel: ``The more money we give to Israel, the
less money we have for starving children in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say aid to Israel is an investment that reaps
strategic dividends for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (in the United States) know we can always rely on Israel in
any situation,'' says Ester Kurz, director of legislative strategy
for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). ``If
Israel weren't there, if Israel were weakened, if Israel couldn't
stay strong against its enemies, we wouldn't have much of an
ally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ally that receives uniquely special treatment:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  According to the Congressional Research Service, a branch of
Congress, Israel has received more than $66 billion in grants and
$15 billion more in loans from the United States since 1949 _ far
more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The aid continues as Israel grows wealthier and better able to
stand on its own. It's economy is in a hi-tech boom and, this
summer Israeli officials cut $300 million in taxes on stereos,
refrigerators and other electric appliances, in expectation of
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aid to Israel is given on freer terms than aid to any other
country. Israel is the only country that gets the money up front
each year. It can then invest it, or lend some of it back to the
United States in bonds, earning interest until it can spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Totals for the interest were not available, but based on
estimates from Israeli and U.S. officials, it likely topped $750
million during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Long relationship
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of this year's regular U.S. assistance, $1.9
billion, is military aid. The other $949 million is economic aid.
It totals about $2.8 billion, more than what was given to Africa
and Latin America combined.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also authorized another $1.2 billion in
special military aid to be given over three years as Israel
implements the 1998 Wye River peace deal. Under the accords, Israel
agreed to hand over to the Palestinians land in the West Bank,
captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was one of the richest aid years in a solid
relationship that dates back more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman took a risk when the United States became
the first country to recognize Israel's statehood in 1948. The
surrounding Arab countries, then beginning their war against the
Jewish state, would count America among their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. aid to Israel began slowly. It rarely cracked $100
million a year _ and mostly then in loans _ through the 1950s and
1960s, even while the nation fought three wars. In the early 1970s,
the aid pace increased, especially after the surprise Arab attack
that started the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Garden signing of an historic peace agreement
with Egypt in 1978, aid to Israel and Egypt rose sharply and
eventually settled to about $3 billion and $2 billion a year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Israel's aid is required to go for purchasing military
equipment from American defense contractors. It makes for a $1.5
billion-a-year boon to federal lawmakers whose states _ including
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia _ have factories with Israeli
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Israelis, there has been growing recognition that aid
to Israel should eventually come down. Following a landmark speech
to Congress in 1996 by then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israeli and American officials agreed to reduce the overall aid 20
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will drop gradually, but the reductions made so far in the
regular aid were offset this year when President Clinton and
Congress agreed to give the extra $1.2 billion for the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that what really makes the U.S. aid relationship
with Israel special is not only the volume of aid but the leeway
Israel has in spending it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they cite the annual economic aid. Other
countries get such aid with spending overseen locally by the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the aid to Israel is meant to help the
country pay off old debts to the U.S., the money goes into the
general Israeli budget where it can be spent on everything from
welfare to roads.
</P>
<P>
   Accrued Interest
</P>
<P>
   Also, both the economic and military aid come in lump-sum
payments within 30 days after the passage of the U.S. budget.
Israel can then deposit the money in interest-bearing accounts. It
also buys U.S. bonds, in effect lending the money back to the
United States for interest, until the Israeli government needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Brig. Gen. Moti Besser estimates that the interest on
just the military aid has totaled more than $500 million since it
started coming in a lump sum in 1991. It could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Ministry of Finance says, for example, interest on
military aid reached $120 million last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lump-sum payments for economic aid started in the early
1980s at Israel's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to members of Congress and said, 'There is a way you
can help us without increasing the level of aid,' `` said Daniel
Halperin, former economic minister in the Israeli embassy to the
United States. ``The advantage was that it didn't show in the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But, economists and congressional staff contacted by Cox
Newspapers said the lump-sum payments cost American taxpayers
money. If the money stayed with the U.S. Treasury longer, under one
scenario, the U.S. government could use the money to pay off old
debt and save interest costs perhaps near what Israel earns.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, the Alabama congressman, calls the lump-sum practice
``stupid, or at least unusual, foreign policy,'' but he has not
been able to change it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress proposes letting Egypt earn interest on its
aid, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aid reaps dividends
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perks in the U.S. aid package, Israel supporters say
it has been good for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, they say, the military aid has kept the tiny state
several steps ahead of the Arab rivals who surround it. Israel's
army is small, but is recognized as the best-equipped and strongest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this position of strength that the Israelis seek to
make peace with the Palestinians, and other Arab neighbors. Israeli
officials say that if they must risk giving up land, they want
extra assurances that Israel will keep a military edge.
</P>
<P>
   During peace talks with Syria last year, Israeli officials
floated the figure of $17 billion as what they would need to hand
over the strategic Golan Heights, captured from Syria during the
1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel supporters argue that such requests are not out of line
because U.S. aid has paid off for America. First, many Americans
feel a sentimental bond to Israel, which they still see as an
underdog democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There were strategic gains. As Arab countries saw they could not
defeat Israel, they sought to make peace, helping calm a region
that sits on 60 percent of the world's crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they sought better ties with the United
States. The result: Both Israelis and Arabs were turning to America
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best investment and cheapest investment the United
States has ever made,'' said Israeli Dan Schueftan, an occasional
advisor to the Israeli ministries of defense and foreign affairs.
``You (in the U.S.) end up in a situation where both sides are
indebted to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's survival also provided a Cold War outpost for the
United States in a potentially explosive Middle East loaded with
Soviet clients. Israel did things, like destroy an Iraqi nuclear
reactor in 1981 that, in hindsight, also served American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also gave equipment to the United States in the Persian
Gulf War in 1990, and works closely with U.S. intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   Other needs exist
</P>
<P>
   But, critics say at least some of the aid to Israel could do
more good in other places. There are a host of needs, from an
HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa that activists say requires $3.3
billion-a-year to a $500 million shortfall in U.S. embassy staff
and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's economy and army are strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so vastly superior to any combination of Arab armies
it's ridiculous,'' said Stephen Zunes, a Middle East expert at the
University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Israel's role as a Middle East outpost, the U.S. now
has other allies in the region _ including a Navy base in Bahrain
and troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. On matters of peace, Zunes
says it's pressure, not aid, that leads Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give money to where it is most needed, and Israel is
pretty far down the list,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of other types of aid, to Africa for example, note
that the U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of its budget to foreign
aid, low compared to other industrial nations. Many fear that it
would be even less if Israel, backed by AIPAC, was not the main
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But even with overall increases, Colin Bradford, former chief
economist to USAID, thinks the Israel-Egypt share would be too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing enough in the broader global setting. We ought
to be doing more, but we also need to get the proportions right.
Israel and Egypt can both stand on their own feet more than they
used to,'' says Bradford, now at American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, meanwhile, is far richer than other U.S. aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Once a hard-scrabble Zionist frontier, Israel is now a regional
economic powerhouse. Western franchises, from Blockbuster Video and
Office Depot are common. American firms like Intel Corp. and Lucent
Technologies are buying technology start-ups for billions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $18,300 in
1999, according to the on-line CIA World Factbook. By comparison,
Spain's was $17,300 and Greece's $13,900. The U.S. per capita GDP
was $33,900 and the United Kingdom's $21,800.
</P>
<P>
   The economy overall nearly doubled from $53 billion in 1990 to
$101 billion in 1999, according to the Israeli Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jimmy Weinblatt has written that the Israeli economy
has developed an ``addiction'' to the U.S. aid and that it stunts
economic growth. Israel could handle a cut, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, it would cause some shortages but in the
long run it is the right thing to do,'' says Weinblatt, dean of
humanities and social studies at Israel's Ben Gurion University.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis offer different reasons for cutting the aid. Some
among Israel's political right-wing see it causing a political
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a psychological dependence,'' says Israeli
member of parliament Uzi Landau. ``There is a notion that Israel
receives so much help from the United States . . . that we have to
listen and do what we are told.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing aid despite unsure public
</P>
<P>
   Among the American public, says Steven Kull, director of the
Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of
Maryland, people tend to be skeptical of aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a 1999 Gallup Poll of 1,021 people, with a plus or
minus 3.5 percent margin for error, showed a plurality of more than
40 percent favoring a decrease in aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Kull says, though, that general public opinion does not
influence Washington as much as organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   And pro-Israel groups are well organized. They frequently
arrange to bring American politicians _ from Austin, Texas, Mayor
Kirk Watson to would-be President George W. Bush and Florida Sen.
Connie Mack _ on trips where they meet with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan says there's a local pressure, too, because, ``the
Jewish community has been very generous with contributions'' to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lasensky, research fellow at the Brookings Institution
in Washington, says support for Israel is grass-roots and
broad-based. Especially active are evangelical Christian groups who
believe Israel must be strong before Jesus Christ can return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's peace process deadline forces the region to
confront a potential new cycle of violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, even as they negotiate possible solutions that could
lead to an end to their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic breakthrough for peace, Lasensky says, Israel's
request for billions in new aid will likely be received well by
both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum drives these aid packages,'' Lasensky said. ``It's
still Washington's best bipartisan consensus: Aid to Israel.''

 &HT;    Food is fuel and must be maintained to perform well
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Want to play like the pros? Then model
your diet after theirs. Kick the caffeine, beef up the beef and
consume carbohydrates in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter whether you're a duffer on the links, or a
cyclist who regularly rides 100 miles _ food is your fuel, and it
must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the Olympic athletes competing in the Summer Games
in Sydney will have gone through nutrition training as part of
their preparations.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new emphasis on nutrition and overall fitness
throughout the sports world, according to Randy Myers, fitness
director at PGA National Resort and Spa in Palm Beach Gardens. He
helps big-name golf clients such as Michelle McGann and Bruce
Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers are just one group finally tuning in to the role food
plays on their play, Myers said. ``You'll see a lot of our players,
the ones we work with, with a cooler on the links so they can eat
every hour or so during play to keep up their performance level.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies among nutritionists and dietitians have raised awareness
among the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know more than ever,'' said Kathleen Kelly, a Palm
Beach Gardens sports dietitian. ``The guidelines for food groups
have changed, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there was an emphasis on carbohydrates and keeping a
diet really low-fat. The current guidelines call for at least 20
percent of the diet from protein, and 30 percent from fat. The
other 50 percent is carbs. That's down from 60 to 80 percent some
recommended before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not the high protein of the Atkins-type diets,
but it's more focused on adding proteins,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports bars, protein drink mixes and lean meats have replaced
huge plates of pasta for many players, who are trying to build
strength or endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Mazzolaof Palm Beach Gardens relies on supplements to
help her kids get the right nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Two are teens and run cross-country. The youngest, 7, is a
swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can scream at them, stand on your head, and they wouldn't
listen. They `don't have time' to eat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They don't eat red meat, which presents extra problems. ``We
stopped eating it for five or seven years, because my husband, who
was also a runner, developed high cholesterol. But the kids were
having problems, not getting enough iron. So we introduced it back
in the diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said ``runner's anemia'' is a common woe among those
athletes. ``Running breaks down the red blood cells and the body
can't replenish them fast enough, so the runner becomes tired,
fatigued all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestlers who are trying to lose weight to qualify for a
certain weight class also are at risk for health problems because
of their dieting. They eat poorly, taking in too few calories and
not enough essential nutrients.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes should consult their doctors or a dietitian if they're
tired or ``bonk'' _ run out of energy during a workout or game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're eating right or getting the right supplements, that
shouldn't happen,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness is a first step, but eating consistently plays a role,
too, Myers said. ``You have to force yourself to eat breakfast, but
it's important to fuel the body for the rest of the day. Especially
if you're active,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are in the habit of not eating breakfast or
grabbing something fast, then eating poorly at lunch _ maybe
grabbing some fast food. By the time dinner rolls around, we're
gorging ourselves, because we've starved ourselves all day. We eat
too much, too late.
</P>
<P>
   There's no one set diet for everyone, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Women need more zinc, which they can get from eating shellfish.
Exercise also uses up calcium _ a crucial element for all women,
but especially older ones who are beginning to lose bone mass.
Kelly recommends supplemental calcium for them, but also green
leafy vegetables and dairy products that contain high amounts of
other important nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium is a concern for all active people; green leafy
vegetables and complex carbohydrates such as whole bran and seeds
and nuts contain this element.
</P>
<P>
   But the single most important part of sports diets should be
water, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   For any athlete or amateur sports enthusiast, it's especially
important in the humid heat of South Florida. At least a quart of
water per hour is recommended; more if the heat index is peaking.
Kelly knows athletic nutrition firsthand; she also is a distance
cycler and is the nutrition coach for a number of triathletes on
Team USA.
</P>
<P>
   She's the diet consultant to Mike Rozingaro, a Jupiter cyclist
who participated in the Olympic trials. The 22-year-old didn't make
it this year, but will continue competing to prepare for turning
pro. ``I try to eat plenty of carbs, but not too close to the race
time. I want to be fueled ahead of time, but not sluggish at the
start of the race. I eat protein for recovery (after the ride), for
my muscles.''Keeping the body consistently nourished with nutrient
packed foods is the basic theory, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an analogy: Would you put low-octane gas in your car?
Of course not. Our bodies are another type of engine.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Myers puts it, if you eat poorly, you perform poorly.
``It's the old saying: Junk in, junk out.''

<P>
   FOOD FOR FUEL
</P>
<P>
   Salmon-pasta salad
</P>
<P>
   Why it's a winner: Canned salmon (along with green, leafy
vegetables and dairy products) contains calcium, which is important
for women athletes. Women also need extra zinc and vitamin D.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: The hearts of palm provide magnesium, a
nutrient lost in activity.
</P>
<P>
   Whole-grain cereal
</P>
<P>
   Why it's a winner: A quick and easy breakfast, whole-grain
cereal with low-fat milk provides several nutrients including
protein and iron.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: A banana contains potassium and extra
carbohydrates for natural energy.
</P>
<P>
   Creamy soup
</P>
<P>
   Why it's a winner: Some athletes actually try to maintain weight
_ particularly wrestlers. They are at risk for malnutrition.
Low-fat, low-calorie, but high-nutrient foods such as a ``cream of
any vegetable'' soup, is just what the sports doc ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: Made by pureeing cooked vegetables with low-fat
chicken or vegetable stock, seasonings and skim or low-fat milk,
it's a tasty way to slim down, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sunflower seeds
</P>
<P>
   Why they're winners: Seeds, nuts and beans of all varieties are
good for an active body, but sunflower seeds are better than most.
They are high not only in protein, but also in magnesium and zinc.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: They're portable. Mix shelled ones with prunes
or raisins, dry oat bran cereal and almonds for a trail mix.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Why they're winners: Cookies don't seem as though they figure
into a healthy diet for an active person, but carbohydrates are an
important fuel source. Dietitians recommend extra carbs a half hour
before beginning a workout and every half hour during prolonged
play to avoid ``bonking'' - running out of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: Figs, prunes and other dried fruits provide the
diet with fiber. And they're portable!
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   Why it's a winner: It is the single most important nutrient the
body needs during any activity. For high-activity levels in
moderate heat, 32 ounces (1 quart) per hour is recommended. Never
wait until you're thirsty to drink, because by then, it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths: Water is a natural body cooler, essential in
South Florida heat. Freeze a few bottles and wrap a wet sock around
them for insulation on the go.

   BREAKDOWN ON AID TO ISRAEL: 2000 (Fiscal Year)
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Would work well as bar or pie chart, or something more
artsy like a tank barrel divided into the different sections:

   Aid to Israel and Egypt increased in reward for signing an
historic peace deal in 1978. The two countries now receive more
than one-third of America's foreign aid, and would again in the
bill proposed for next year by the U.S. House.

   BUYING IN BULK
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $2 billion in annual U.S. military aid to Israel has
to be spent in America, with the U.S. Defense Department overseeing
the purchases. Here are some samples:

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In Israel, national pride comes wrapped in military
might and emblazoned on the T-shirts sold to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``America don't worry,'' quips one T-shirt with a drawing of an
F-16 fighter jet. ``Israel is behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, of course, it is the other way around. U.S. aid to
Israel has been the backbone of this country's defenses for at
least 15 years. More than one-fifth of Israel's approximately $9.3
billion defense budget, including expenditures for nearly half its
equipment each year, comes from America.
</P>
<P>
   But that aid is being criticized, just as Israelis may ask for
billions more. With the encouragement of President Clinton, they
seek money to beef up the army as they offer land in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Most favor the idea, but arms control experts deride the annual
$2 billion military aid package as fueling an arms race in an
already volatile region. And Israelis seem reluctant to pay for
large increases in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Israeli executives say the reliance on American guns
and planes stunts the growth of their own arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders of defense industries say, 'Enough to U.S. aid,'''
cried a headline in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth last month(CQ).
``We don't need its favors.''
</P>
<P>
   They are angry because under terms of the aid agreements, most
of the money must be spent in the United States. The policy, they
say, will cost them thousands of jobs over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time you are trying to help us you are doing us
terrible harm,'' says Abraham Hatzor, chief executive of an Israeli
company that makes bulletproof vests, military tents and other
textiles.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the United States gave Israel more military aid than
usual, $3.12 billion. It was more than the rest of the world
combined received for military aid in the main U.S. aid budget,
according to figures from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money, $1.2 billion, was a special grant to be given
over three years as Israel implements the 1998 Wye River peace
accords _ under which Israel agreed to give to the Palestinians
land it captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   The long-stated purpose of the military aid is to ensure that
Israel always maintains an edge over its potential enemies. Most
agree Israel has the best fighting force in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shopping list for American equipment over the last two
years is long and varied. According to a tally kept by the
Federation of American Scientists' Arms Sales Monitoring Project,
Israel has spent billions on everything from F-16 fighters to
Apache helicopters to air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Israeli officials contend that their military is woefully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to modernize our air force, modernize the navy and
modernize our vehicles. Some of them, you won't believe this, are
from World War II,'' said Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh. ``The point is that Israel faces tremendous military problems
given the environment we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israelis say U.S. aid is crucial as they try to make
peace with the Palestinians, or Syria. As they give up land, they
need extra military might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much cheaper to assist Israel to deter war than to assist
Israel when it is at war,'' Israeli Ret. Brig. Gen. Shlomo Brom
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Federation of American Scientists researchers say
increasing the military aid just fuels an arms race that makes the
region more dangerous. They say the aid antagonizes rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to a point where Israel's lead is significant enough
that you don't need to give them more,'' says Tamar Gabelnick,
director of the FAS's Arms Sales Monitoring Project. ``I don't
think it's really credible for them to say we need more weapons. I
see it as a way for them to get as much as possible from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis themselves seem to show little enthusiasm for spending
more on defense.
</P>
<P>
   A February poll by the Israeli Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies showed just 28 percent of Israelis willing to pay higher
taxes for more security. (The poll surveyed 1,201 people, and had a
3.1 percent margin of error one way or the other.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, last year, U.S. officials warned Israeli leaders
that proposed defense cuts in Israel would make it harder to ask
for more U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   But, the army is still a popular and nearly omnipresent part of
Israeli life. Service is compulsory for most men and women.
Soldiers patrol the streets with their U.S.-made M-16s, and
casually take them to the malls and restaurants while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day affords a solemn moment each spring, when sirens
bring the nation to a halt and motorists pull over to stand by
their cars in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Given that sense of pride, it's hard to find detractors of the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody asks the questions, 'Do you buy what you need, or do
you just buy because you have the money?''' said Reuven Pedatzur, a
military analyst and former pilot in the Israeli Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Pedatzur has been a lone critic of Israel's Arrow missile
defense project, which has received $820 million in U.S. aid
separate from the annual package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me, 'Why are you against it? It's American
money.''' he says. ``When you're talking about American money,
nobody wants to ask the questions.''

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Three doors from the austere facade of the
U.S. Embassy is the ``Buzz Stop,'' a beachfront bar where the
American-Israeli relationship flows as smoothly as the draught on
tap.
</P>
<P>
   A miniature Statue of Liberty stands above the entrance and
Israeli owner Eli Barel holds court on the patio overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea. Behind him there's a booming city, where cranes
hover over new malls and skyscrapers, and sport utility vehicles
clog the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the child of America. They have been with us from the
beginning. They raised us,'' Barel says in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But even Barel is not aware that the United States usually gives
his small country some $3 billion a year _ equaling about $500 for
each of the 6 million Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give that much, then God bless America,'' says the
hefty 50-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   America's blessings are likely to increase. Israel is growing
wealthy and already draws one-fifth of all U.S. foreign aid, but it
will likely be getting more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for a peace agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel _ and the Palestinians have threatened to
declare a state with, or without Israel's approval. After the
failure of July's Camp David peace talks, American mediators are
pressing for an agreement, which could cost more than $17 billion
in aid to Israel for upgrading its military over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a country smaller than Vermont, Israelis say they can only
offer land for peace if their army is stronger. And they want
America to help pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton promised to pitch in, but a few
congressional leaders have blanched. First, they were upset at
Israeli plans, over U.S. objections, to sell an advanced radar
plane to China. Israel eventually cancelled the deal. Then, some in
Congress didn't like the price Israel placed on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their sentiments echo a minority both inside and outside Israel
who say it's time for the country to get by with less help from
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider Israel a strategic ally and I want it to
succeed, but at the same time I don't want Israeli citizens to
assume this is an entitlement, like food stamps in the Middle
East,'' says Alabama Republican Rep. Sonny Callahan, who heads the
House subcommittee that writes the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
   Says Callahan, who favors eliminating economic, though not
military, aid to Israel: ``The more money we give to Israel, the
less money we have for starving children in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say aid to Israel is an investment that reaps
strategic dividends for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (in the United States) know we can always rely on Israel in
any situation,'' says Ester Kurz, director of legislative strategy
for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). ``If
Israel weren't there, if Israel were weakened, if Israel couldn't
stay strong against its enemies, we wouldn't have much of an
ally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ally that receives uniquely special treatment:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  According to the Congressional Research Service, a branch of
Congress, Israel has received more than $66 billion in grants and
$15 billion more in loans from the United States since 1949 _ far
more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The aid continues as Israel grows wealthier and better able to
stand on its own. It's economy is in a hi-tech boom and, this
summer Israeli officials cut $300 million in taxes on stereos,
refrigerators and other electric appliances, in expectation of
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aid to Israel is given on freer terms than aid to any other
country. Israel is the only country that gets the money up front
each year. It can then invest it, or lend some of it back to the
United States in bonds, earning interest until it can spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Totals for the interest were not available, but based on
estimates from Israeli and U.S. officials, it likely topped $750
million during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Long relationship
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of this year's regular U.S. assistance, $1.9
billion, is military aid . The other $949 million is economic aid.
It totals about $2.8 billion, more than what was given to Africa
and Latin America combined.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also authorized another $1.2 billion in
special military aid to be given over three years as Israel
implements the 1998 Wye River peace deal. Under the accords, Israel
agreed to hand over to the Palestinians land in the West Bank,
captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was one of the richest aid years in a solid
relationship that dates back more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman took a risk when the United States became
the first country to recognize Israel's statehood in 1948. The
surrounding Arab countries, then beginning their war against the
Jewish state, would count America among their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. aid to Israel began slowly. It rarely cracked $100
million a year _ and mostly then in loans _ through the 1950s and
1960s, even while the nation fought three wars. In the early 1970s,
the aid pace increased, especially after the surprise Arab attack
that started the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Garden signing of an historic peace agreement
with Egypt in 1978, aid to Israel and Egypt rose sharply and
eventually settled to about $3 billion and $2 billion a year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Israel's aid is required to go for purchasing military
equipment from American defense contractors. It makes for a $1.5
billion-a-year boon to federal lawmakers whose states _ including
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia _ have factories with Israeli
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Israelis, there has been growing recognition that aid
to Israel should eventually come down. Following a landmark speech
to Congress in 1996 by then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israeli and American officials agreed to reduce the overall aid 20
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will drop gradually, but the reductions made so far in the
regular aid were offset this year when President Clinton and
Congress agreed to give the extra $1.2 billion for the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that what really makes the U.S. aid relationship
with Israel special is not only the volume of aid but the leeway
Israel has in spending it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they cite the annual economic aid. Other
countries get such aid with spending overseen locally by the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the aid to Israel is meant to help the
country pay off old debts to the U.S., the money goes into the
general Israeli budget where it can be spent on everything from
welfare to roads.
</P>
<P>
   Accrued Interest
</P>
<P>
   Also, both the economic and military aid come in lump-sum
payments within 30 days after the passage of the U.S. budget.
Israel can then deposit the money in interest-bearing accounts. It
also buys U.S. bonds, in effect lending the money back to the
United States for interest, until the Israeli government needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Brig. Gen. Moti Besser estimates that the interest on
just the military aid has totaled more than $500 million since it
started coming in a lump sum in 1991. It could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Ministry of Finance says, for example, interest on
military aid reached $120 million last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lump-sum payments for economic aid started in the early
1980s at Israel's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to members of Congress and said, 'There is a way you
can help us without increasing the level of aid,' `` said Daniel
Halperin, former economic minister in the Israeli embassy to the
United States. ``The advantage was that it didn't show in the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But, economists and congressional staff contacted by Cox
Newspapers said the lump-sum payments cost American taxpayers
money. If the money stayed with the U.S. Treasury longer, under one
scenario, the U.S. government could use the money to pay off old
debt and save interest costs perhaps near what Israel earns.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, the Alabama congressman, calls the lump-sum practice
``stupid, or at least unusual, foreign policy,'' but he has not
been able to change it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress proposes letting Egypt earn interest on its
aid, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aid reaps dividends
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perks in the U.S. aid package, Israel supporters say
it has been good for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, they say, the military aid has kept the tiny state
several steps ahead of the Arab rivals who surround it. Israel's
army is small, but is recognized as the best-equipped and strongest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this position of strength that the Israelis seek to
make peace with the Palestinians, and other Arab neighbors. Israeli
officials say that if they must risk giving up land, they want
extra assurances that Israel will keep a military edge.
</P>
<P>
   During peace talks with Syria last year, Israeli officials
floated the figure of $17 billion as what they would need to hand
over the strategic Golan Heights, captured from Syria during the
1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel supporters argue that such requests are not out of line
because U.S. aid has paid off for America. First, many Americans
feel a sentimental bond to Israel, which they still see as an
underdog democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There were strategic gains. As Arab countries saw they could not
defeat Israel, they sought to make peace, helping calm a region
that sits on 60 percent of the world's crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they sought better ties with the United
States. The result: Both Israelis and Arabs were turning to America
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best investment and cheapest investment the United
States has ever made,'' said Israeli Dan Schueftan, an occasional
advisor to the Israeli ministries of defense and foreign affairs.
``You (in the U.S.) end up in a situation where both sides are
indebted to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's survival also provided a Cold War outpost for the
United States in a potentially explosive Middle East loaded with
Soviet clients. Israel did things, like destroy an Iraqi nuclear
reactor in 1981 that, in hindsight, also served American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also gave equipment to the United States in the Persian
Gulf War in 1990, and works closely with U.S. intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   Other needs exist
</P>
<P>
   But, critics say at least some of the aid to Israel could do
more good in other places. There are a host of needs, from an
HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa that activists say requires $3.3
billion-a-year to a $500 million shortfall in U.S. embassy staff
and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's economy and army are strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so vastly superior to any combination of Arab armies
it's ridiculous,'' said Stephen Zunes, a Middle East expert at the
University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Israel's role as a Middle East outpost, the U.S. now
has other allies in the region _ including a Navy base in Bahrain
and troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. On matters of peace, Zunes
says it's pressure, not aid, that leads Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give money to where it is most needed, and Israel is
pretty far down the list,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of other types of aid, to Africa for example, note
that the U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of its budget to foreign
aid, low compared to other industrial nations. Many fear that it
would be even less if Israel, backed by AIPAC, was not the main
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But even with overall increases, Colin Bradford, former chief
economist to USAID, thinks the Israel-Egypt share would be too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing enough in the broader global setting. We ought
to be doing more, but we also need to get the proportions right.
Israel and Egypt can both stand on their own feet more than they
used to,'' says Bradford, now at American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, meanwhile, is far richer than other U.S. aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Once a hard-scrabble Zionist frontier, Israel is now a regional
economic powerhouse. Western franchises, from Blockbuster Video and
Office Depot are common. American firms like Intel Corp. and Lucent
Technologies are buying technology start-ups for billions.
</P>

   Israel's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $18,300 in
1999, according to the on-line CIA World Factbook. By comparison,
Spain's was $17,300 and Greece's $13,900. The U.S. per capita GDP
was $33,900 and the United Kingdom's $21,800.
</P>
<P>
   The economy overall nearly doubled from $53 billion in 1990 to
$101 billion in 1999, according to the Israeli Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jimmy Weinblatt has written that the Israeli economy
has developed an ``addiction'' to the U.S. aid and that it stunts
economic growth. Israel could handle a cut, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, it would cause some shortages but in the
long run it is the right thing to do,'' says Weinblatt, dean of
humanities and social studies at Israel's Ben Gurion University.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis offer different reasons for cutting the aid. Some
among Israel's political right-wing see it causing a political
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a psychological dependence,'' says Israeli
member of parliament Uzi Landau. ``There is a notion that Israel
receives so much help from the United States . . . that we have to
listen and do what we are told.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing aid despite unsure public
</P>
<P>
   Among the American public, says Steven Kull, director of the
Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of
Maryland, people tend to be skeptical of aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a 1999 Gallup Poll of 1,021 people, with a plus or
minus 3.5 percent margin for error, showed a plurality of more than
40 percent favoring a decrease in aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Kull says, though, that general public opinion does not
influence Washington as much as organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   And pro-Israel groups are well organized. They frequently
arrange to bring American politicians _ from Austin, Texas, Mayor
Kirk Watson to would-be President George W. Bush and Florida Sen.
Connie Mack _ on trips where they meet with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan says there's a local pressure, too, because, ``the
Jewish community has been very generous with contributions'' to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lasensky, research fellow at the Brookings Institution
in Washington, says support for Israel is grass-roots and
broad-based. Especially active are evangelical Christian groups who
believe Israel must be strong before Jesus Christ can return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's peace process deadline forces the region to
confront a potential new cycle of violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, even as they negotiate possible solutions that could
lead to an end to their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic breakthrough for peace, Lasensky says, Israel's
request for billions in new aid will likely be received well by
both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum drives these aid packages,'' Lasensky said. ``It's
still Washington's best bipartisan consensus: Aid to Israel.''

TOO MANY FLAVORS, TOO MANY INGREDIENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dwayne, the hero of this ultra-indie movie, is suffering a bit
of an identity crisis. A Vietnamese-American raised by
African-American adoptive parents, Dwayne (originally named Sap)
struggles with typical familial communication gaps, talks
'hood-speak to his white roommate, acts the professional
businessman at the small bank he manages, and nervously tries to be
himself with his African-American fiancee. And then Dwayne's sister
has to go and track down their birth mother, confusing the poor guy
even more.
</P>
<P>
   As you might be able to tell from the preceding paragraph,
writer-producer-director Chi Muoi Lo, who plays Dwayne/Sap, wants
to say a lot in ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce.'' He winds up trying
to say too much, and the movie lurches from tone to tone _ family
soap opera one minute, oddball comedy the next _ without ever
settling down. It's not without merit, but at times it feels like
the world's weirdest Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hindered by a modest budget, ``Catfish'' features a cast whose
work could charitably be called uneven. It still manages to snag a
couple of good performances, from Paul Winfield as Dwayne's
live-and-let-live adoptive father and ``Love and Basketball's''
Sanaa Lathan as his fiancee, whose confusion grows along with
Dwayne's. But it's hard to embrace because, well, Dwayne is such an
idiot. Sure, the guy's mixed up, but he's unnecessarily callous to
his birth mother, his adoptive parents, his sister and his fiancee,
his roommate (who's confused in a different way) and his roommate's
girlfriend. None of his reactions seems motivated by anything in
Chi's overstuffed screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was a labor of love for Chi, who escaped from Vietnam
at age 6 in 1975 and went on to play small roles in movies such as
``The Relic'' and ``Indecent Proposal.'' The problem with labors of
love, however, is that too often, their creators get too close to
them. A few steps back, and Chi might have been able to untangle
some of snarled story lines; as it is, ``Catfish'' is a watchable
enough first effort, with hints that more solid work is to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Valerie Breiman's lighthearted look at the perils of modern
romance has all the familiar trappings of a Julia Roberts comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing is, Julia Roberts isn't in it. Apparently, the
script wasn't funny enough to attract the ``real'' pretty woman,
and, sadly, Famke Janssen is no Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen stars as Kate, an unwillingly single writer for a
women's magazine whose disastrous track record with relationships
leaves her ill-equipped to tackle a story on landing the perfect
man.
</P>
<P>
   Her past flings are told in flashbacks: her creepy high school
French teacher, the married guy she fooled around with in college,
and then the real love of her life, a wiseacre artist named Adam
(Jon Favreau).
</P>
<P>
   The relationship blossoms, gets serious, then wilts, leading to
the inevitable string of mutual attempts at making the other person
jealous. But it's not until Kate starts dating an air-headed
action-film star that Adam realizes what he's been missing, by
which point it may be too late. Too bad that, by this point, you
also couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   Favreau manages to breathe some life into the picture, recalling
some of the irrepressible anti-charm he showed off in ``Swingers,''
but it's all in vain. Janssen rarely does anything to merit his
attention (or ours), and you find yourself hoping to see more of
insignificant side characters such as Cheri Oteri as Kate's
conniving co-worker or Ann Magnuson as her surly editor.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the film's screamingly obvious conclusion, ``Love
and Sex'' still manages to blow any hope of an entertaining
denouement, opting instead to give the impression that filmmakers
simply ran out of celluloid.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some people who are aghast at bigotry put their
righteous indignation on hold when it comes to dot-commers.
</P>
<P>
   In the land of political correctness, it seems to be all right
to say that dot-commers clog the streets and drive up housing
prices and ruin it for people in the San Francisco area and the
Silicon Valley, even though you would be labeled a racist if you
made the same comments about any ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening is the same sort of thing that can get older
workers into serious career trouble. If you cling to the way things
were instead of the way things are, you will be overcome with
jealousy and bitterness instead of initiative and adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Think of yourself as a professional golfer who had a pretty good
career going until that Tiger Woods fellow came along. Now you find
yourself playing for second place most of the time. Where do you go
from here?
</P>
<P>
   It might help if you focus on three things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't underestimate the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for golfers to whine about how tough it is to compete
with Woods, but the smart ones also realize how much better he has
made it for them. Golf is now a hot sport, with bigger prize money,
more endorsement opportunities and greater public attention _
thanks mostly to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the San Francisco area goes through a wave of cost
increases, there is also a current of opportunity. Economic
Darwinism kicks in, and the people who remain are economically
stronger than those who depart.
</P>
<P>
   That means they pay higher taxes, which can lead to better
schools and nicer parks and safer cities. The wealth attracts
high-level entrepreneurs, which is why some of the world's best
businesses, universities and even restaurants are located here.

   Diversity has made life here into a rich tapestry, but it also
has a computer-generated flavor to it. A few clicks and keystrokes
and the tapestry changes. But it's never gone; it's just different.
Don't be so preoccupied with the missing parts of the picture that
you overlook everything fresh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lift up your game.
</P>
<P>
   The economic changes invariably offer opportunities for talented
people, but they can lead to disaster for those stuck in the land
of the mental status quo. Just like a lazy golfer, if all you do is
sit and complain, your future will look a lot like Tiger chow.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh challenge can bring out the best _ or the worst _ in
you. It's pretty much up to you to decide.
</P>
<P>
   What do you need to work on? It's probably not as clear-cut as
learning to putt better, but it's not as hard as hitting a 350-yard
drive, either. Think about how you need to grow as a worker so you
can stay in the game. Who is getting ahead and who is getting left
behind?
</P>
<P>
   Talent and adaptability get rewarded. That is true now, and it
was true long before there were opposable thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   _ You have to sacrifice to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for anyone who has grabbed a 9-iron to fantasize about
being like Woods, with all the talent in the world. But those
fantasies probably don't include the loss of privacy that comes
from being famous, or the long hours of drills and exercises that
make those Sunday afternoons look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-commers who have struck it rich usually had to sacrifice
a lot of friendships and personal time to get their financial
reward, and their jobs often aren't as emotionally satisfying as
other people's might be. No job is wonderful all the time. Ask
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You could well make a perfectly rational decision that the
rewards aren't worth the pain. Maybe it's best to pick up your
clubs and go home.

&HT;     NEW BOOK SAYS CHILDREN OF DIVORCED COUPLES FACE MORE TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Baby boomers have grown up mocking their parents
for staying together ``for the sake of the children,'' but that may
be the healthier alternative to divorce, according to a study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by psychologist Judith Wallerstein of Marin County,
Calif., is detailed in the book ``The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce:
A 25-year Landmark Study.'' The researcher followed 93 children of
failed marriages over a 25-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Co-written by San Francisco State Professor Julia Lewis and New
York Times science correspondent Sandra Blakeslee, the book details
findings showing that adult children of divorced parents had far
more trouble establishing intimate relationships in adult years,
were less likely to go to college and more likely to get into
trouble with drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, where divorce was once believed to have the
strongest impact on children at the time of the break-up, the
authors are now saying it has implications that last long into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The study of the 93 predominantly white children _ whose fathers
were doctors, lawyers and executives _ came from 60 families. They
were compared with 44 children from similar families whose parents
remained married.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in the study is that most of the children of
divorced parents had successful careers, knew how to handle money
and even emerged as adults with character and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But their love lives left a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their first thought in a quarrel was, `I'm out of here.' This
is the nightmare I was waiting for, and here it comes. I might as
well get out,'' Wallerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are plenty of family crises that affect a child _
including the death of a parent at a young age, or alcoholism or
drug abuse _ none has the impact of divorce, Wallerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Children know that parents do not choose to die and believe that
a dysfunctional parent on drugs or alcohol may be ill.
</P>
<P>
   But the divorce is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``With death it's final,'' Blakeslee said. ``But with divorce
he's around, and she's around. With every birthday or graduation,
it's an open wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who choose divorce ``should know what their children
need and how to put them first, and what they're going to need two,
five and 15 years down the line,'' Blakeslee said. ``It's the long
haul that shapes their experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein said many children of divorce eventually found
personal happiness but not without a lot of pain and many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Children of divorce were far likely to marry before age 25 _
50 percent, compared with 11 percent for the comparison group.
Nearly 60 percent of the young marriages among children of divorced
parents failed, compared with 25 percent among their peers whose
parents stayed married.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 25 percent of children of divorce used drugs and alcohol
before they were 14, compared with 9 percent in the comparison
group.
</P>
<P>
   One specialist in families questioned the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein ``has always viewed divorce through a pretty gloomy
glass,'' said E. Mavis Hetherington, a professor emeritus at the
University of Virginia. ``It's almost as though they have a
terminal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington said other research had shown that about 25 percent
of children of divorce had long-term problems with relationships.
That means the other three-fourths are doing well or surviving as
well as anybody can be expected in a nation with a 50 percent
divorce rate.
</P>
<P>
   She did agree, however, that government funding should be spent
on couples having trouble with marriage rather than focusing on
healing wounds after divorce had occurred.

CANADA PUTS CHICKENS BETWEEN IT AND NILE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Along Canada's border with the United States, the
chickens stand on guard, a thin feathered line newly pressed into
duty against a viral foe.
</P>
<P>
   These ``sentinel'' chickens are the front rank of defense
deployed by Canadian health authorities to sound the alarm, should
the mosquito-borne West Nile virus cross the world's longest
undefended international boundary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chickens serve as one of our surveillance systems,'' said
Harvey Artsob, chief of zoonotic, or animal-borne, diseases at
Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. ``The hope is, blood tests on the chickens will provide
us early warning if the disease spreads to Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of vigilant platoons of chickens, arrayed at
strategic sites along thousands of miles of border might seem
comical. For Canada it is part of a serious high alert. The country
is girding for what health specialists see as the inevitable surge
north of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus, carried by birds and transmitted to humans
by mosquito bites, claimed its first North American victims in New
York City last year. This summer, the virus reached New England and
spread as far west as Buffalo, just across the Niagara River from
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus crossed the Atlantic to the US,'' said Gordon
Surgeoner, an entomologist at Ontario's University of Guelph. ``To
think it won't cross a river to Canada is dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus, named after the district in Uganda where it
was isolated in 1937, has killed eight people in New York, has sent
at least 65 others to hospitals , and has infected thousands in the
city, which recently canceled a Central Park concert for fear of
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are tough New Yorkers running scared,'' said Marie
Douville, a public health physician in Quebec. ``So it's no wonder
we Canadians are nervous behind our chickens. We're already warning
elderly people to stay indoors in the early mornings and early
evenings, when mosquitoes are most active.''
</P>
<P>
   Most humans infected by the virus suffer only minor flu-like
symptoms, such as fever, headache, and muscle stiffness. More
serious cases, which usually occur in the elderly or those with
weakened immune systems, can produce stupor, convulsions, and
paralysis. Death would come from encephalitis, or severe swelling
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which since the 1950s has caused epidemics in Israel,
South Africa, and Romania, has made it to Massachusetts and
Connecticut, although so far it has not made the leap from birds to
humans in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's ``chicken line'' stretches from New Brunswick's St.
Croix River valley, which forms its border with Maine, to the
Saskatchewan grasslands, opposite Montana. Public health officials
say that there is almost no chance that the virus could travel
farther west, at least this season.
</P>
<P>
   Military-like secrecy surrounds the 360 chickens, stationed in
mesh wire cages at critical junctures near the border, along
migratory bird routes, or near habitats notorious for mosquito
infestations.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities will not allow US journalists to view the chickens.
They say _ saying the media might ``contaminate'' the fowl or
compromise the guard sites. However there is suspicion that Canada,
hypersensitive about its image south of the border, really just
wants to avoid pictures of its wattle-beaked, dirt-scratching,
swivel-necked sentries from appearing on front pages of US
newspapers or, worse, CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people only want to know about the sentinel chickens, not
other steps we're doing,'' a Health Canada official said of the US
media.
</P>
<P>
   Chickens make good soldiers against the West Nile virus because,
unlike hawks or humans, they do not succumb to the enemy. Instead,
their bodies manufacture antibodies, which can be detected in
weekly blood tests undergone by every guard fowl. Presence of the
antibody is proof that disease has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has a 25-year tradition of using chickens as sentinels
against certain disease,'' said Randy Gadawski, chief entomologist
for the department of Insect Control in mosquito-ridden Winnipeg.
He noted that chickens were succesfully put on guard against
invasions of two other exotic diseases, western equine encephalitis
and St. Louis encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is carried by birds, but spread from bird to
human by the bite of mosquitoes. There are 73 species of mosquitoes
in Canada, and 126 in the United states, but, so far, only Culex
pipiens, or the northern house mosquito, has been found
transmitting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has already suffered a West Nile casualty _ one of those
fatally stricken in New York last year was a 75-year-old Toronto
man.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, health authorities in Canada are
scouring urban parks and the countryside for dead birds. The West
Nile virus is wreaking havoc among many North American bird
species, including crows, sparrows, bluejays, mallards, robins, and
red-tailed hawks. Other species, like pigeons, are immune.

   That flocking birds carry the virus represents short-term good
news for Canada, but probably guarantees that the virus will jump
the border later. Right now, many birds are beginning the autumn
migration south. But come spring, millions of birds migrate along
the eastern flyways, spreading west, north, and northeast upon
reaching Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a dead crow found in Tonawanda, N.Y., made headlines
in Ontario and Quebec. The crow had been felled by West Nile virus,
and the Buffalo suburb lies just a few miles from Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Some public health authorities say Canadians are deluding
themselves with the anxious watch on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is the virus is already in Canada, but just hasn't
been recognized,'' said Ward Stone, a physician with New York's
Department of Environmental Conservation. ``It's obviously
spreading and has shown it can survive the severe Northeastern
winters. West Nile is going to be an unhappy reality for both
countries.''

SHARK RESEARCHER GOES TO EXTREMEMS FOR SOME ANSWERS

<P>
   GORDON'S GULLY, ATLANTIC OCEAN _ Greg Skomal, Massachusetts'
shark biologist, was 20 miles south of Martha's Vineyard and 20
feet deep the other day, and he was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   There were not enough sharks milling about.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hours of throwing morsels of bloody fish overboard to
create a mile-long chum road leading to his submerged cage, all
Skomal had attracted were two toothy, somewhat bored-looking blue
sharks to a neighborhood also known to be carved up by makos,
hammerheads, and a great white or two.
</P>
<P>
   Skomal studies shark behavior, often in scuba gear, often from
inside his homebuilt cage.
</P>
<P>
   It is what he did next that perhaps best illustrates Skomal's
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the safety of his cage, the researcher swam to the
nearby boat to retrieve the meaty remains of a yellowfin tuna
caught and cleaned the day before. Then he descended, swam past the
cage, and disappeared into the murky green world beyond, waving the
large tuna carcass like someone might wave a slab of prime rib to
attract a pack of pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's hard to tell who is the more aggressive,'' said
Paul Diodati, director of the state Division of Marine Fisheries,
``Greg or the sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's peak season for the half-dozen sport fish biologists
assigned to monitor and safeguard the state's recreational fish
stocks. With the warmer water of late summer come the bluefin tuna,
marlin, and mako _ and close behind them, a host of hopeful anglers
in pursuit. State officials estimate these anglers are generating
approximately $1 billion annually in economic activity (such as
boats, fuel, hotel rooms, and meals) in their quest to land the big
fish or the big story.
</P>
<P>
   Skomal, 39, who is based in Vineyard Haven, has monitored shark
populations for the past dozen years, entering the profession
during an era when ``Jaws,'' the 1975 Hollywood shark thriller, was
still casting a deadly shadow over sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time when people continued to think the only good
shark was a dead shark,'' said Skomal, whose sharp, handsome
features and wavy blond hair suggest he is the lad the Beach Boys
left behind. He is single _ or, rather, married to a job that
recently took him to Greenland diving with sharks for the Discovery
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   One of Skomal's duties is touring the docks collecting fish
stories during any of the half-dozen shark-fishing tournaments held
in Massachusetts every year. Competitors used to kill all the
sharks they caught. Now, partly because of Skomal's dockside chats,
competitors voluntarily return all but the largest sharks to the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Skomal measures the health of a species by the catch per boat
hour of fishing effort. Blue and mako shark _ the state's most
abundant game sharks _ posted steady increases in population during
the first half of the 1990s. More recently, the landings have
flattened out, and may even be in decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early to tell what's going on. There are so
many variables,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear precisely where Skomal developed his passion
for sharks. But it came early, according to his sister Lenore, who
lives in Skomal's hometown of Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only one in the family who insisted on having an
aquarium in his room. And the designs on the wallpaper? Sharks.
Drawn by Greg with crayons, much to our parents' dismay,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   His affection for the fish led him to earn a bachelor's degree
in zoology at the University of Rhode Island, then onto oceangoing
fishing boats studying the sharks caught by commercial fishermen.
When he was working for the National Marine Fisheries Service, Jack
Casey, now retired and a resident of Narragansett, R.I., was his
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy would be out on deck in storms, green water up to his
neck, looking at sharks,'' Casey said. ``He wasn't just interested,
he was obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Chase, another sport fish biologist who sometimes works
side by side with Skomal, had a similar observation. For example,
during one research trip, Chase was assisting Skomal as he tried to
determine if blue sharks fought to the point of near-fatal
exhaustion when they were caught by rod and reel. The answer lay in
the bloodwork of the fish. Extracting blood from a caught fish was
simple; the problem was comparing the blood to that of an uncaught
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Skomal's solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed one of the animals by the tail as it lunged for
bait hung from the boat. Then he figured out where he needed to
hold the thing so it couldn't bend around to bite him as he
withdrew blood,'' Chase said. Actually, that wasn't quite accurate,
Skomal added. It was Chase who worked the needle, once pinning
Skomal's hand to the fish.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work. The men determined a fight does not
jeopardize the health of a blue shark. One question answered, but
there are thousands to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know so little about sharks. If I could be granted but one
wish, I would ask: Show me the details in the daily life of a
shark,'' Skomal said.
</P>
<P>
   And so several times a summer, he goes offshore with his shark
cage just to watch sharks, his trip last Monday aboard the No
Doubt, a Hyannis-based sport fishing boat captained by his friend
Chris Gallagher. Loading the cage in the Oak Bluffs harbor was
something of a dockside conversation piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, but I thought there were no sharks on Martha's
Vineyard,'' Mary Moore of Rye, N.Y., shouted to Skomal as he and
crew members muscled the cage aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on the Vineyard,'' Skomal answered.
</P>
<P>
   This did little to appease Moore, who said her three children,
now grown, have not gone swimming hereabouts since they watched
``Jaws'' filmed 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there have been only three unprovoked fatal shark
attacks recorded in Massachusetts since 1670, according to the
Florida Museum of Natural History, keeper of shark-attack
statistics nationwide. The last Massachusetts fatality occurred in
1936.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, sharks don't like people, Skomal explained hours
later, dressed in scuba gear before jumping into the ocean to
observe sharks, a reporter in pursuit to observe Skomal.
</P>
<P>
   His cage is about the size of a ski-lift gondola. It floats 20
feet below the surface, suspended from three large buoys and
loosely tethered to the boat to keep it from drifting away.
</P>
<P>
   His sister had said that Skomal was not mechanically inclined,
that he had built go-carts in elementary school, shark cages in
college, and there had been nothing in between. Indeed, his cage
this day had several large openings in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were made by film crews. Don't worry. If a shark tries
to get in, just bop it on the nose. Lightly,'' Skomal had said. No
doubt where his priorities lay.
</P>
<P>
   An adult shark brain is roughly the size of half a banana,
devoted entirely to sensory reception and instinct, able to detect
a drop of blood a mile away. But despite all of Skomal's efforts to
bring the animals in, the only large visitor would be a
10-foot-long blue shark. It circled the cage an arm's length away,
its back a striking fluorescent indigo, its eyes the size of silver
dollars, its temperament curious if somewhat bored, its mouth
closed.
</P>
<P>
   No need to bop the shark, although one began to wonder about
Skomal as he swam off after the shark, leaving behind an oily trail
of flayed tuna.

BULBS FOR SHADE ABOUND 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If bulbs could plant themselves (and don't we wish they could),
most would select a sunny site with good drainage and alkaline soil
that reminded them of their mountain homeland in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But what if they're stuck with a shady lot? There are still
possibilities, but it depends . . .
</P>
<P>
   If your shade comes from deciduous trees, your choices are many.
If you have dense, unyielding shade from buildings and evergreens,
on the other hand, your options are fewer. In either case, look at
it as a challenge to explore some of the most interesting
connoisseur bulbs that have recently entered the mainstream of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While most daffodils will tolerate some shade, (the new
apricot-pink daffodils are better planted in light shade because it
keeps their color from washing out), the large tulips we're all
familiar with will have a hissy fit if they get less than four
hours of full sun a day. Even if you're hooked on tulips, though,
there's a solution. Try the small delicate species tulips such as
chrysantha, clusiana, sylvestris, the sturdy little yellow and
white tarda, and the lovely bronze and yellow batalinii for partial
shade. Many people come to like them better than the big hybrids,
partly because they're longer-lived as well as charming.
</P>
<P>
   If your shade comes from trees, says Jo-Anne Ohms of John
Scheepers, one of the country's most respected bulb companies, test
the soil. ``If you have pine or oak trees, they may help make the
soil acid. Flower bulbs prefer a neutral pH level, so test your
soil and sprinkle lime on top if it's acidic.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the right pH, you have two tactics for selecting
bulbs. One is to pick species that are native to shady woodlands,
not sunny mountain meadows as tulips are. The other is to buy bulbs
that bloom so early that they're almost ready to go dormant by the
time your trees leaf out and cut off the sunshine. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Early bloomers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even sun-loving bulbs that bloom in February, March, and early
April can be planted under non-evergreen trees and shrubs. These
early bulbs include crocus, winter aconite (eranthus), snowdrop
(galanthus), pushkinia, and Siberian squill. All are small, ranging
from 3 to 12 inches tall, and should be planted by the dozens to
get an effect.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier bulbs bloom in the spring, the earlier they should
be planted in the fall, so plant these March bulbs as soon as you
can, says Peter de Jager, a fifth-generation bulb dealer in South
Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to buy your bulbs early, says Keith Hutchins of
Wilson Farms in Lexington, Mass., is that the supply will be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulb production was down about 40 percent because of bad
weather,'' he says. ``The quality of bulbs I saw this year in the
Netherlands was exceptional, except there's not a lot of them. The
Dutch perennial crop is spectactular because it got warm early and
then it got wet. So you'll be seeing few specials on bulbs and a
lot of specials on perennials.''
</P>
<P>
   If you buy your bulbs before you're ready to plant them, store
them in a cool, dry place (but not the fridge). Prolonged
temperatures over 75 decrease can affect their blooming ability. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Crocus family &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocuses are the best-known early bulb, a down payment on
spring. The first to bloom here in late February is the lavender
Crocus tommasinianus, which is a great investment because it's a
true species from Bosnia and Croatia rather than a hybrid, and will
seed itself around. Even better, squirrels don't seem to like the
taste. There are several named selections, including Barr's Purple,
Whitewell Purple, and Albus, which is white.
</P>
<P>
   The second crocus to bloom is golden bunch (Crocus ancyrensis),
a traffic-stopping, orange-gold species from Turkey. Don't plant it
with ``tommys.'' Colorwise, it would be like mixing lilacs with
black-eyed Susans.
</P>
<P>
   March brings the snow crocuses. If nature dumps an inch of snow
on these flowers, they just laugh, and continue blooming when it
melts. These are smaller, earlier, and better increasers than the
later Dutch crocuses. There are also dozens of varieties in
interesting color combinations. Dutch crocuses are the largest
crocuses and last to bloom. They're somewhat out of favor now, but
it's interesting to know that common Giant Yellow is one of the
oldest hybrid plants still in commerce, dating back to 1600.
</P>
<P>
   Winter aconite looks like golden buttercups and often blooms in
February. Two kinds are sold. Eranthis hyemalis is the best for
shady or damp sites as it is native to moist woods in Europe, says
Peter Messelaar of the Messelaar Bulbs Co. of Ipswich, Mass. The
rarer Eranthis cilicica likes drier, sunnier sites. It's a good
idea to soak the corms for several hours before planting. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shade-loving squill &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the best bulbs for shade is Siberian squill (Scilla
siberica), which blooms in late March. Eight inches tall, it
produces clusters of downward-facing bells of the most intense blue
and will quickly spread. This is one bulb that prefers shade and
will thrive under trees and bushes. It's quite a sight to see a
blue carpet of Siberian squills under spreading beach trees in
March, as at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Pushkinia scilloides has the same size and bloom time, but its
flowers are white with stripes of aqua, the rarest of all garden
colors. It, too, will self-seed, though not as densely as Siberian
squill. Pair pushkinia with larger, early, pink or apricot bulbs
such as hyacinths.
</P>
<P>
   Glory-of-the-snow (chionodoxa) blooms in April, well after the
snowstorms of March, so the name is a misnomer, but this is another
bulb that prefers the summer shade of deciduous shrubs and trees to
flat-out sun and which will self-seed. Chionodoxa sardensis has
intense blue flowers while Chionodoxa luciliae has larger paler
blue stars with white centers. There's also a taller pink version
called Pink Giant, which is too close to the color of dead leaves
to be effective in the early garden.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet-smelling hyacinths of April are surprisingly tolerant
of light shade and will linger for years before they gradually
dwindle away. Though many people don't like their squat appearance,
they are worth planting near a doorway or window for their powerful
scent.
</P>
<P>
   For later-blooming flowers, choose woodland bulbs that are used
to coexisting with trees. Most of these like a spot with good
drainage and rich soil that gets some irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fritillaria imperialis is the best-known member of its family
because it has the tallest flowers of any early-April-blooming
bulb. It will tolerate light shade, but there are several smaller
relatives that are even more shade-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   While most spring bulbs are bright and charming, no one would
call fritillaries cheerful. These are bulbs Edward Gorey would have
loved, with pendulous bells in smokey colors and odd patterns. The
guinea hen flower (Fritillaria meleagris), which has checkered
flowers in shades of maroon and cream, is fascinating and easy to
grow. British garden writer Vita Sackville-West proclaimed it
``sinister in its mournful colours of decay.'' Fritillaria
pyrenaica also has checkered bells in shades of brown and red. Even
more gothic is Fritillaria camschatcensis, whose almost black
flowers are native to China, Japan, and Alaska, providing yet more
evidence of an ancient land bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the wood hyacinth (Scilla campanulata) nor the grape
hyacinth (Muscari) are true hyacinths, though the second has a
faint fragrance. Both tolerate a fair amount of deciduous shade.
</P>
<P>
   Other later bulbs to try in dappled light include Allium
aflatunense, golden onion (Allium flavum), golden garlic (Allium
molly), our native Anemone canadensis, Camassia quamash, and
Anemonella thalictriodes. Lilies will tolerate partial shade, too,
but don't plant them because they'll be devastated by lily-leaf
beetles. &QL;

<P>
   So much for light, deciduous shade. Suppose your shade is
lovely, dark and deep?
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. This is where real ingenuity comes in. Some of
the less-common but most-prized bulbs can handle considerable shade
if you plant them in rich soil and keep them watered with average
garden irrigation. You don't want them to be in wet soil. They like
a raised bed, a slight slope, or to be under trees and shrubs that
will suck up excess moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) from our native woodlands has
beautiful leaves and graceful white daisy flowers in April that
will self-seed. Even better is the double form, which looks like
miniature white waterlilies and is considered one of the most
beautiful of all plants, says Baldasarre Mineo, owner of Siskiyou
Rare Plant Nursery in Medford, Ore.: ``It's expensive but
unkillable and will gradually multiply.''
</P>
<P>
   The wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) is another beautiful daisy.
It likes well-drained shade. ``Try to get one of the blue forms,''
advises Mineo.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice bulb for shade is the dog's-tooth violet
(erythronium), which likes to grow under trees and shrubs.
Erythroniums are miniature lilies, not violets. The unfortunate
name comes from an imagined resemblance of the bulbs to a dog's
tooth. Erythronium americanum grows wild in our local woods and
goes by the pleasanter name trout lily because its beautiful leaves
are mottled like a trout. However, it sends up few flowers, so is
not a great garden subject.
</P>
<P>
   Other erythroniums have been hybridized to create heavier
bloomers with pink, lavender, white, or yellow flowers that often
retain the handsome leaf patterns. ``Pagoda, which is yellow, and
the cream and orange White Beauty are the easiest and most
robust,'' says Mineo.
</P>
<P>
   You could also try Arum italicum. This is a wonderful, underused
plant that is slow to mature. If you give it a few years, though,
it will reward you with white hooded flowers like calla lilies each
spring and brilliant spikes of red berries each fall that have
earned it the common name lords and ladies. (Presumably the fragile
flowers are the ladies and the assertive red berry spikes are the
lords.) The tropical-looking foliage is evergreen and in the
variety ``Pictum'' is fretted with intricate white markings.
</P>
<P>
   Arum is related to our great native Jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema
triphyllum), which is also a fine bulb for deeper shade. There are
many other arisaemas that have recently been embraced by
adventurous shade gardeners, including the native green dragon
(Arisaema dracontium), and the prized, hard-to-find Arisaema
candidissimum from the woods of western China, and Arisaema
sikokianum from Japan. This plant looks like a small
Jack-in-the-pulpit that's gone to heaven. The exterior of the
``pulpit' is exquisitely marked brown while the ``jack'' and the
entire inside of the pulpit are a luminous white. If you have
success with it, no gardener will pity you for growing bulbs in
shade.

 UNDATED: ... much fun.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after Nixon's resignation in 1974, Garment returned to New
York. He resumed practicing law, only to return to public service,
this time as right-hand man at the United Nations to then-US
Ambassador Moynihan. Soon enough, he saw the wisdom of what Fortas
had told him and by 1980 was back inside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Garment specializes in ``political litigation'' (his term). His
clients have included Fiat, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and
former national security adviser Robert McFarlane. He used to play
in a monthly poker game whose other regulars included two members
of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice
Antonin Scalia. Garment almost made it a Supreme Court trifecta,
becoming an unofficial campaign manager for Robert Bork during the
judge's unsuccessful confirmation fight in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Garment has slowed down some since then but remains a fixture in
the permanent-Washington firmament. Garment still has ``that
slightly edgy, funny, perspicacious nature,'' says McPherson,
``skillful in all the arts of lawyering.'' At Verner Liipfert, he
rubs shoulders with the likes of former US senators Bob Dole,
George Mitchell, and Lloyd Bentsen. His current big project, one
that's close to fruition, is setting up a national museum of jazz
to be built in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great strength,'' Garment says, ``is putting things
together and taking chances. So it's sort of, splat, and then the
next three months represents an effort to organize splat into a
coherent statement. The story of this book was a long couple of
years of splat here, splat there.''
</P>
<P>
   Much though Sears may not like having been splattered, Garment
is happy with his book and the debate it's stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-seven years later, it's time . . . (to) discuss the
obvious fact that what was journalism is now history,'' Garment
argues. ``They can tell us who it is so we can determine the
contours of this legendary figure who has helped significantly in
shaping modern American history, and modern American journalism,
and modern American politics. . . . (Concealing the identity of
Deep Throat) has the deliberate quality of `If the secret is kept
long enough it will go away.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Garment gives a vigorous nod of his head, secure in the
knowledge that _ so long as he's around, anyway _ the secret of
Deep Throat isn't about to go away.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
DEEP THROAT ROLLCALL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to identify Deep Throat, Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein's celebrated source during Watergate, has been a favorite
inside-the-Beltway sport for more than 25 years _ even for those
who contend that Deep Throat was either a composite or outright
fiction (contentions Woodward and Bernstein stoutly deny).
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``In Search of Deep Throat,'' former Nixon aide
Leonard Garment points to John P. Sears, who after serving in the
1968 Nixon campaign and briefly as a White House aide went on to be
Ronald Reagan's campaign manager in 1976 and the early part of
1980. Sears has denied being Deep Throat _ as has Garment, when
it's been suggested he was the source for Woodward and Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who has said Deep Throat's name will not be revealed
until the latter's death, cleared two candidates of the charge when
they were being considered for posts in the Reagan administration:
Nixon chief of staff Alexander M. Haig Jr. and White House deputy
counsel Fred F. Fielding.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading contenders, all of whom have denied being Deep
Throat, include Nixon speechwriter David Gergen; acting FBI head L.
Patrick Gray; FBI official W. Mark Felt Jr.; US Senator Robert F.
Bennett (R-Utah), who employed Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt at
his public relations firm; CIA director Richard M. Helms; deputy
CIA director Vernon A. Walters; and White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one person whom everyone can agree on as Deep
Throat: Hal Holbrook, who memorably played him in the 1976 film
adaptation of Woodward and Bernstein's book ``All the President's
Men.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MARK FEENEY &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
A POP CULTURE ICON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep Throat, journalism's most famous unidentified source, got
his name not from Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein but the paper's managing editor, Howard Simons. The
inspiration was the Linda Lovelace-starring pornographic movie of
the same name, which was then playing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie version of Woodward and Bernstein's book ``All the
President's Men,'' Deep Throat (played by Hal Holbrook) urges
Woodward (Robert Redford) to ``follow the money.'' It was the most
famous line in the movie, simultaneously defining the Watergate
scandal and _ it turned out _ offering a road map to the future of
US electoral politics. Yet it appears in neither Woodward and
Bernstein's book nor any of their Post articles. It was the
invention of screenwriter William Goldman and helped earn him the
1976 Academy Award for best adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Throat's pop-cultural legacy lives on, most notably on
television's ``The X-Files.'' The series's creator, Chris Carter,
has said Watergate ``ruined me forever as far as my belief in
institutions and in authority of agendas of government.'' The
recurring character known only as Cigarette Smoking Man (William B.
Davis) is an updated, far more sinister version of Deep Throat:
another tobacco addict with dark secrets to tell (or withhold) most
comfortable lurking in the shadows.

shortages of gasoline and rationing in some areas of France on
Tuesday, and the unrest over the high cost of diesel fuel appeared
set to spread to Belgium and Spain. Gasoline has exceeded $6.50 a
gallon across Europe and people are really angry. Additionally, the
French strikes are screwing up life on this side of the channel.

   SENATE-STURGEON _ WASHINGTON _The Senate votes Thursday in a
showdown between the recreational and barge industries over the
pallid sturgeon. The outcome could foreshadow the fate of more than
40 disputes between environmental and business interests over
``riders'' in the 11 unfinished appropriation bills. Pallid
sturgeons are primitive, shovel-nosed, toothless, six-foot-long
bottom-suckers that have lived in the Missouri River since the
Jurassic age of the dinosaurs, but began disappearing after dams
tamed most of the river. Upriver forces led by Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., want to let the Corps of Engineers allow spring floods in
the Missouri in order to make it easier for the endangered fish, as
well as two rare shorebirds (the piping plover and the internal
least tern) to reproduce. Downriver forces led by Sen. Christopher
(Kit) Bond, R-Mo., say the spring floods would endanger jobs in
businesses dependent on barge traffic. (Mollison,, Cox News

   BUSHAIR _ George Bush is fighting to keep Austin, San Antonio
and the Tyler-Longview area from being designated in violation of
the EPA's new smog standard. Environmentalists say Bush's actions
are motivated by the prospect for embarrassment. They say that he
cannot afford to have these metropolitan areas added to a list that
already includes Dallas and Houston, especially in the midst of a
campaign in which he asserts things are getting better. But
monitoring in those cities clearly show that ozone levels there
exceed the tougher new standard. Bush, and several other Republican
governors, counter that EPA's new standards have been struck down
by an appeals court and now await Supreme Court review, and EPA
action should await that ruling. (Sherman, Atlanta

Chambers, who owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, will host a

Georgia Sept. 8. An early financial backer of Gore's, Chambers
stopped supporting Gore earlier in the 1990s because of his support
of cable regulation. She backed rival Bill Bradley in the primary,
hosting a fundraiser that netted Bradley $225,000. But in April,
Chambers donated $100,000 to the Democratic Party, one of the two
largest individual contributions to the Democrats of anyone in
Georgia. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

$500,000 to $1 million for the Democratic Party. The scheduling of
the fundraiser is another example of how the quest for money often

party nominating conventions. (Foskett, Atlanta

 LEONARD GARMENT SAYS HE'S IDENTIFIED DEEP THROAT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the great mystery man of political scandal, the shadowiest
figure in the annals of journalism, the most famous informant of
the Information Age (not to mention the patron saint of parking
garages): Deep Throat, the secret source who helped lead Washington
Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein to the truth about
Watergate in 1972 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Only four people know his identity: Woodward, Bernstein, retired
Post executive editor Ben Bradlee, and, of course, Deep Throat
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Garment thinks he can make it five.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``In Search of Deep Throat,'' Garment names
John P. Sears as his man. Sears, a onetime aide to Richard Nixon,
went on to manage two of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns.
Currently practicing law in Washington, he has denied he is Deep
Throat. So have Woodward and Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't faze Garment, nor does the fact Sears has
threatened to sue. ``I'm not holding my breath, waiting nervously
for the process server,'' Garment chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than the threat of a libel suit to make him blink.
As the liberal conscience of the Nixon White House, Garment was
himself long ago accused of being Deep Throat (it was quickly
agreed that no one that gregarious ever could have kept such a
thing secret). He succeeded John Dean as White House counsel, and
some have credited his opposition to destroying the White House
tapes for Nixon's deciding to preserve them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as notable as the fact of having stood up both for and to
Nixon during Watergate is his having played tenor saxophone behind
Billie Holiday (albeit for only two weeks) in the early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Leonard Garment is no stranger to great events or
larger-than-life characters. In fact, he cuts a fairly sizable
figure himself. ``I regard him with a measure of awe,'' says
Garment's friend and former colleague US Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.). ``You wouldn't understand Washington for the
last 30 years if you didn't know about Len Garment.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not so much formidable as irrepressible, a force of rich
and risible nature. Garment is ``the funniest man I know,''
declares Moynihan. ``The puns and jokes just keep coming.'' At the
same time, the senator adds, Garment is ``a man of profound
seriousness leavened with a sense of the irony of life.'' So
striking a blend of amiability and gravitas has helped make him (in
the words of The American Lawyer magazine) ``the consummate
Washington lawyer, as successful, well-connected, and sought-after
as any in town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pulled off the always difficult trick of making people
from all sorts of political factions all like him,'' says author
and former US News &AMP; World Report editor James Fallows, a friend
and onetime neighbor of Garment's. ``It's a combination of inherent
affability and the fact he very obviously has a life outside of
partisan politics: his writing, his music, and a very ill-concealed
sense of humor about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Len is sui generis, a very special kind of character: very,
very politically savvy, yet very irreverent,'' adds David Levy,
director of Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art and another
Garment friend. ``He has a certain latitude: He's only responsible
to history now, not some administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Garment is 76 (``rounding second and heading for home,'' he
laughs). He has three children: Paul, a musician, and Sara, a
writer, from his first marriage; and Annie, an incoming freshman at
Yale. Garment's first wife, Grace, was a writer who suffered for
many years from depression. She committed suicide in 1976. His
current wife, Suzanne Garment, is an author, former Wall Street
Journal political columnist, and the only 53-year-old in last
spring's graduating class at Georgetown Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Garment has a soft, slightly gravelly voice. In it, one can
still detect the muscular intonations of Flatbush. A self-described
``verbal manic-digressive,'' Garment talks as naturally _ as
inevitably _ as most people breathe. He thrives on the back and
forth, the give and take, of good gab _ and gives as good as he
gets.
</P>
<P>
   With his blocky build and thinning white hair, he bears a strong
resemble to Sparky Anderson, the Hall of Fame baseball manager. Yet
there's also the raffishness of Anderson's most famous player, Pete
Rose. Garment is part authority figure, part authority flouter.
It's easy to imagine him as, say, a high school principal _ solid,
distinguished, learned _ who just for the hell of it runs a bookie
joint on the side. (One can almost hear the student body: ``Yes,
Mr. Garment. No, Mr. Garment. Mr. Garment!'')
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of three boys, he was born on a kitchen table in a
three-room tenement in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
Garment's father owned a (what else?) garment factory but went
bankrupt during the Depression. His youngest son developed a taste
for jazz soon thereafter. Father objected. Not mother, though: She
had babysat the young George Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   A clarinetist, Garment idolized Benny Goodman (four decades
later he would find himself doing legal work for the King of
Swing). He soon graduated to tenor saxophone. Besides backing
Holiday, he briefly held a chair in Woody Herman's orchestra. He
was drafted, got a medical discharge, and picked up his horn again.
Soon he was playing with the likes of Al Cohn, Terry Gibbs, and
another aspiring reed man, one Alan Greenspan. Twenty years later,
Garment bumped into his old saxophone-section mate, now an
economist, and urged him on Nixon. ``Irrational exuberance'' might
be how Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan describes the bull market
of the '90s. But one wonders if he didn't get the phrase from
watching his old pal in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz was a lot of energy and imagination but it was somewhat
disorganized,'' Garment says of his relationship to the music he
still loves. ``I assumed I could put things together, hold them
together, harmonically. But when the harmonic aspect of jazz became
more complicated, with bop, I knew, playing with musicians who were
first-rate, `Get out of town before it's too late and get another
profession.' Then I became a lawyer, of all constricted
professions!''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz had taught Garment how to improvise, a talent he's yet to
lose. It stood him in good stead as an ``ethnic icebreaker,''
making the leap from Brooklyn Law School to a white-shoe Wall
Street firm with the vaguely Dickensian name of Mudge, Rose,
Guthrie, and Alexander. Garment eventually headed the litigation
department and was looking for new worlds to conquer when who
should join the firm in 1963 but Richard Milhous Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Garment was a jokey Jewish extrovert, a Democrat who'd voted for
John F. Kennedy. Nixon was, well, Nixon. Yet it was love at first
sight. In a very real sense, Garment's life has been lived in
Nixon's shadow ever since. (Certainly, few people have written as
acutely about him as Garment has in his 1997 memoir, ``Crazy
Rhythm.'') Can he imagine what his life would have been like had he
never met Nixon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've avoided thinking about that the way one avoids
thinking about death,'' Garment sighs. ``I was very bored, then he
providentially dropped into 20 Broad St. and became my law partner.
First, it was hilarious . . . then I found myself involved in
politics at the top, organizing a presidential campaign for a very
talented, strange man.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the White House, Nixon gave Garment the catchall title
of special consultant to the president. This made for more
improvisation, assembling a job portfolio from what Garment once
described as ``the distant swamplands of Republican politics'':
arts funding, Native American issues, Southern school
desegregation. It's no coincidence that some of the
administration's most lasting domestic achievements fell in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Watergate. In ``Crazy Rhythm,'' Garment explains his
appointment as acting White House counsel this way, ``I was the
last senior White House staffer who (a) had a license to practice
law and (b) was not a potential indictee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the worst patch any president and his staff
ever went through,'' says Harry C. McPherson, a name partner at
Garment's current firm, Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson and
Hand. McPherson speaks with some authority on the subject of
embattled presidents: He was special counsel to Lyndon Johnson.
Watergate left Garment eager to leave the nation's capital _ though
former Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas told him, ``You'll be back.
Washington is just too much fun.''

OVERWEIGHT GIRL SPARKS CUSTODY FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ A half-hour after being told Tuesday that his
3-year-old daughter would remain in foster care, Miguel Regino
somberly watered the lawn in front of his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard,'' said Regino, whose 3-foot-tall, 120-pound
daughter was taken into state custody last month because of her
weight. ``We were just waiting for the baby to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Regino and his wife, Adela Martinez, have been accused by the
state of neglect and failing to follow a prescribed diet for their
daughter. Some doctors have reportedly said the girl ``would surely
die'' if she does not lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   The couple went Children's Court Thursday to seek their
daughter's return. While Regino and his wife still hold out hope,
officials say it is unusual for the state to give full custody so
soon to a family accused of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Tommy Jewell, frustrated with the media frenzy the case
has caused, closed Tuesday's hearing and barred the family and the
lawyers from speaking to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the courtroom, the case of young Anamarie
Martinez-Regino has been monitored by people as far away as
Germany. The case has become the talk of Anamarie's neighborhood,
on radio shows, television news, and the front page of local
newspapers. Nationally, it has stirred debate on ``fat prejudice,''
whether child-neglect cases should remain confidential, and when
the government should forcibly take away a child because of medical
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, candlelight vigils for the family were held in
Albuquerque, Chicago, and San Diego, and a local parent group has
collected hundreds of signatures asking for a federal investigation
into how the state handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hartz, who heads the state's Children, Youth and
Families Department, emphasized last week that the state was acting
in the best interest of the child. The state says the parents have
not followed a strict diet and have not been able to keep
Anamarie's weight down.
</P>
<P>
   The parents contend the state overstepped its authority when it
took custody of the toddler. The couple say they have done all they
can to help their child overcome a medical problem that doctors
can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely frightening case,'' said Leslie Di
Maggio, who chairs the National Association to Advance Fat
Acceptance, which contributed to the family's legal costs.
``Parents of fat children are ashamed, they feel like it's
something they have done. Now, there is the fear on top of it that
their children can be taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the national media attention, Anamarie had quietly
caused a stir in her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the family was friendly and often had friends or
relatives over to visit, but rarely spoke with neighbors since
moving into this lower-middle-class area about six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anamarie could be seen sitting in a wooden chair in the family's
small, tan, adobe-style home. Sometimes her parents carried her in
a wheelchair. Until recently, she had to use a walker to get
around. Neighbors watched as she played with other children, but
none of them ever thought Anamarie was so young.
</P>
<P>
   From her porch down the street, Carmen Casaus would see the
couple pulling someone out of a car or Regino's truck and placing
the person into a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize she was a child. I thought she was
(Martinez's) mother,'' she said. ``My neighbor said she heard a
baby crying, but I told her that there is no baby over there.''
</P>
<P>
   James Zingelman, who lives a few doors down from the family,
said the couple always waved to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought (Anamarie) was an overweight 8-year-old,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, doctors and social workers have also been curious
and worried about the child.
</P>
<P>
   Anamarie has spent her life in and out of hospitals. Martinez,
an employee at Mesa Airlines, told reporters that 10 to 15 doctors
have treated her daughter and each one has given different advice.
The child has seen nutritionists and pulmonary specialists, and no
one really knows why she is three times heavier than most children
her age.
</P>
<P>
   While the family has said her weight stems from a medical
problem rather than overfeeding, doctors testing the child have
said they found no signs of glandular problems, according to the
Albuquerque Journal, which retrieved an affidavit in the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, doctors worried the excess weight
could cause heart damage or death and ordered the parents to keep
Anamarie on a liquid diet. But officials said the parents continued
to feed her solid food. The affidavit suggests that the child's
weight may be the result of Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome, a form of
child abuse in which caregivers make a child sick to gain attention
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 25, the state of New Mexico, which believed the family
wasn't capable of caring for the child, took Anamarie into custody
while she was being examined at Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the parents) love the child and they are trying hard to
get her back,'' said Diane Whiting, a cousin of Martinez. ``She is
a beautiful child. She gets around fast, but right now she needs
her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Perci C. De Baca, who lives several doors down from Anamarie's
family, shook her head as she watched Regino watering the grass in
the cool evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will keep them in my prayer. I think they need help. The
state should have never taken the child away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Casaus has become far more skeptical of the family down the
street. She looked at her 8-year-old grandson _ thin and full of
energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want my grandson to grow that big,'' she said,
shaking her head. ``If it was me, I would let the state take her,
knowing it's for the betterment of the child.''

 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is an old man now, says the daughter, old and deaf as granite
and more cut off from the world than ever, even from his own
children. Holden Caulfield, his most enduring fictional creation,
fantasized about being a deaf-mute and living in a cabin by the
edge of a forest, passing notes to his deaf-mute spouse. Be careful
what you wish for, the daughter suggests. When fiction becomes your
reality and reality a squalid inconvenience, the line between what
is imagined and what is experienced grows paper-thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I wrestled with in writing this book,'' says
Margaret Salinger, ``was knowing that if I disobeyed him in this
kind of way, there was a good chance he would cut me off like he
cut off everybody else who committed a misdemeanor in his eyes. And
this was not going to be any misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says Salinger, ``I also realized pretty early on
that this was the death of a wish, not a reality. I'm never going
to have the mommy and daddy I wished for. What I really had to lose
wasn't a whole lot. Even on good terms with him, I never saw my
father much. I miss him, but _ and I don't mean this in a cute way
at all _ I miss my daddy, not my father. There's not a lot there to
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   He, of course, is Jerome David Salinger, now 81, the Howard
Hughes of American letters, who settled in tiny Cornish, N.H.,
nearly 50 years ago and who, having written ``The Catcher in the
Rye,'' the definitive postwar American novel about adolescence and
alienation, plus having also produced a handful of the truly
classic short stories of his literary generation, pulled up the
ladder into the treehouse and vanished inside.
</P>
<P>
   J. D. Salinger has published no new work since 1965. He has
granted almost no interviews in half a century. He has visited
legal punishment upon at least one biographer and has threatened
others with lawsuits or worse. His relationships with a succession
of women much younger than he, including the writer Joyce Maynard,
have raised questions about his Humbert-like obsession with
feminine youth and vulnerability. He has been portrayed by Maynard
and others as an eccentric recluse whose interests include Zen
Buddhism, orgone boxes, Christian Science dogma, Scientology,
homeopathic medicine, speaking in tongues, and drinking urine.
</P>
<P>
   He may have 20 unpublished novels sitting in his desk drawer
somewhere. He may have none. He might set fire to every one of them
before he departs this planet. He might not. Nobody knows, although
a lot of people still purport to care.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Peggy Salinger, 44, a first-time author and hospital
chaplain living in the Boston area, with the most intimate portrait
yet of her father's cloistered _ and apparently not altogether
happy _ existence. ``Dream Catcher: A Memoir'' (Pocket Books) is
not a full-scale Salinger biography, by any means. It is not an
exercise in literary criticism, either, although she draws many
explicit connections between her father's work and what she knows,
directly or indirectly, about his life. Nor is it, as she says with
wrinkled nose, a ``smutty tell-all,'' a veiled reference to
Maynard's kiss-and-tell memoir about life inside the Salinger
boudoir.
</P>
<P>
   It is instead what the book advertises itself to be, an often
brutally honest, first-person account of Life With Father (and
Mother). A reckoning of his life before moving to Cornish and of
the author's life after she grew up and moved away. And yes, Peggy
Salinger is well aware that she will be accused _ as Jonathan
Yardley did in a scalding review in last week's Washington Post _
of invading her father's ``cherished privacy to the point of
disloyalty and exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Salinger, arching her eyebrows, ``Disloyalty? There was no
loyalty toward us. Only loyalty toward him, always. To the point of
my having taken a bunch of pills once and wanting to go to the
hospital, but calling ahead so that his name _ his name _ would not
get into the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploitation?'' she continues, her angular cheekbones frozen
in an expression strikingly similar to early photos of her father.
``That's in the eye of the beholder, really. I certainly do not
labor under the illusion that if I were Peggy MacDonald and had
written a book of similar quality, I'd be getting the same
attention. A lot of people write terrific books no one hears about.
But as my brother'' _ Matt Salinger, a Hollywood actor and producer
_ ``once said, `The name may get you in the door, but boy, you had
better come through.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Let one thing be clear, Salinger goes on to say with convincing
passion. There is a difference between privacy and secrecy, as
there is a difference between parental authority and child abuse.
Between the right to worship freely and to operate a religious
cult, its members walled off like POWs from the rest of society.
Had her father practiced what he preached in his fiction, she
maintains, railing against ``phonies'' and cultural narcissists,
she would not have written this book _ not the same book,
certainly. In that sense, however, J. D. Salinger was a hypocrite.
The ultimate phony. What goes around, come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had less of a sense of boundaries and privacy, of what you
do or do not say in front of children, than almost anyone I've ever
met,'' says Salinger, with a mixture of resentment and genuine
wonder. What pushed her over the edge, she avers, what drove her to
risk violating his ``cherished privacy'' _ and thus permanently
alienate the father she still claims to love _ was a search for a
level of understanding that she might pass along to her own son. A
search that was touched off, like a brushfire, with a pair of
conversations she had with her parents when she was 37 and
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   During one of those conversations, Salinger writes, her father
advised her to have an abortion. She was stunned, she says. She was
not, after all, some hapless unwed teenager. She was working on her
second postgraduate degree. She had a career going. She had already
been through years of therapy. His solipsism amazed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not make sense of this father I had loved and
worshiped, and who I thought loved me, treating me the way I
wouldn't treat my own worst enemy,'' recalls Salinger, a faraway
look in her eyes. ``So I called my mother and said, `Has he lost
his mind? Has Daddy gone crazy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not the first time that question has been raised, Salinger is
reminded during a recent interview in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I came to it a little late!'' she giggles in reponse.
``Anyway, I called my mother, and there was this long pause on the
other end of the phone. `Peggy,' she said, `he's done this before.
He did it when I was pregnant. With you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her blue eyes light up with sparks. ``In a sense, it was so
outrageous,'' the daughter says, almost hissing now, ``that it gave
me permission to question everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a world nearly devoid of living people.'' So
begins the 436-page book that is being released this week, after a
campaign of extraordinary secrecy to keep it out of the hands of J.
D. Salinger and his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into three sections. Part 1 covers the years
from 1900 to 1955 and includes previously unreported details about
her parents' family histories. Part 2 focuses on life in Cornish
through 1968, when Peggy was dispatched to boarding school around
the time her parents divorced. Part 3, while providing tantalizing
glimpses of her father's monkish existence, mostly follows the
author on her own troublesome path into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The first section will likely interest Salinger scholars the
most. Drawing on interviews with family members, including Doris
Salinger, J. D.'s sister, it delves into Salinger's childhood in
Manhattan, where he grew up the son of a prosperous Jewish food
merchant and Irish-Catholic mother who often passed herself off as
being Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   (Salinger's issues with being half-Jewish, and with
anti-Semitism in general, not only are marbled throughout his
fiction but are distinguishing parts of his psyche, this book and
others about him amply document.)
</P>
<P>
   After military school, he served with the 12th Infantry Regiment
during World War II, landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day with the rest
of the Allied forces. He later suffered an episode of battle
fatigue that put him in the hospital and out of the Army,
eventually. His wartime experiences traumatized Salinger to a
degree that has perhaps been underappreciated up until now, the
book suggests. Saving Private Salinger?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally read his earlier stories,'' says the daughter,
who did not even pick up ``The Catcher In The Rye'' until she was
in her mid-20s, ``I first recognized the daddy I know and loved.
The soldier I knew, not the writer I didn't know.''

   EUROPE-GASPRICES _ LONDON _ A stranglehold on refineries and
oil-storage areas by truck drivers and farmers led to widespread
shortages of gasoline and rationing in some areas of France on
Tuesday, and the unrest over the high cost of diesel fuel appeared
set to spread to Belgium and Spain. Gasoline has exceeded $6.50 a
gallon across Europe and people are really angry. Additionally, the
French strikes are screwing up life on this side of the channel.

   SENATE-STURGEON _ WASHINGTON _The Senate votes Thursday in a
showdown between the recreational and barge industries over the
pallid sturgeon. The outcome could foreshadow the fate of more than
40 disputes between environmental and business interests over
``riders'' in the 11 unfinished appropriation bills. Pallid
sturgeons are primitive, shovel-nosed, toothless, six-foot-long
bottom-suckers that have lived in the Missouri River since the
Jurassic age of the dinosaurs, but began disappearing after dams
tamed most of the river. Upriver forces led by Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., want to let the Corps of Engineers allow spring floods in
the Missouri in order to make it easier for the endangered fish, as
well as two rare shorebirds (the piping plover and the internal
least tern) to reproduce. Downriver forces led by Sen. Christopher
(Kit) Bond, R-Mo., say the spring floods would endanger jobs in
businesses dependent on barge traffic. (Mollison,, Cox News

Republican_are trying to ``out-education'' each other. Easley is

   BUSHAIR _ George Bush is fighting to keep Austin, San Antonio
and the Tyler-Longview area from being designated in violation of
the EPA's new smog standard. Environmentalists say Bush's actions
are motivated by the prospect for embarrassment. They say that he
cannot afford to have these metropolitan areas added to a list that
already includes Dallas and Houston, especially in the midst of a
campaign in which he asserts things are getting better. But
monitoring in those cities clearly show that ozone levels there
exceed the tougher new standard. Bush, and several other Republican
governors, counter that EPA's new standards have been struck down
by an appeals court and now await Supreme Court review, and EPA
action should await that ruling. (Sherman, Atlanta

   CHAMBERS-GORE _ Publishing and cable magnate Anne Cox Chambers,
a big Democratic donor, has mended fences with Vice President Gore.
Chambers, who owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, will host a
private dinner at her Buckhead mansion for Gore when he visits
Georgia Sept. 8. An early financial backer of Gore's, Chambers
stopped supporting Gore earlier in the 1990s because of his support
of cable regulation. She backed rival Bill Bradley in the primary,
hosting a fundraiser that netted Bradley $225,000. But in April,
Chambers donated $100,000 to the Democratic Party, one of the two
largest individual contributions to the Democrats of anyone in
Georgia. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GORE-GEORGIA _ Vice President Gore campaigns in Georgia

$500,000 to $1 million for the Democratic Party. The scheduling of
the fundraiser is another example of how the quest for money often
drives the quest for votes in the presidential race, even after the
party nominating conventions. (Foskett, Atlanta

   FEDEX _ United Parcel Service Corp.'s top two rivals _ FedEx

business alliance. Such a move could dramatically alter the
competitive landscape in the air and ground delivery industry and
put enormous pressure on Sandy Springs-based UPS. Details are
scarce, but industry experts say FedEx wants to turn over many of
its ground deliveries to the Postal Service. In return, FedEx
planes would carry Postal Service next-day shipments. FedEx could
also gain access to 38,000 U.S. post offices. The deal raises legal
questions and UPS can be relied on to fight it vigorously.

arrested her. Sylvia was, according to Peggy, someone who ``hated
Jews as much as he hated Nazis,'' an interesting dynamic, to say
the least. The marriage lasted less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Douglas, wife number two, was 16 when Salinger met her
(he was 31). The daughter of upper-class Brits, Douglas had been
shipped off to America during the war and survived a trans-Atlantic
passage that included witnessing another shipful of children being
sunk by German torpedoes. She was 5 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping out of Radcliffe her senior year to wed Salinger _
Douglas had also been briefly married once before _ she exhibited
symptoms of severe depression as a young bride and mother living in
extreme rural isolation. Her daughter likens Douglas to a college
student who has been recruited for cult membership, and in one
instance to Lady Macbeth. At one point, her mother may have
deliberately set fire to the Cornish house. Earlier, before seeking
psychiatric help, Douglas had flirted with the notion of killing
her daughter and then herself, Salinger writes. At her husband's
urging, she did burn all her personal papers, along with most
bridges to the outside world. Together the couple began exploring
yoga, Eastern religions, and ``alternate realities.'' The most
alternate of these realities, the daughter maintains, was the one
Salinger created for himself and those around him.
</P>
<P>
   While sympathetic to her mother's situation _ a Jungian
therapist, Douglas, who never remarried, lives in California _
Salinger says they are not particularly close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost better to stay crazy, I think,'' she says, ``than
to realize how much you've damaged your kids. But you also can't
make up for what's lost. And I'm not owed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The book's middle section likewise deepens what is known about
Salinger, particularly during his still-productive years as an
author. Margaret Salinger (not Phoebe, as her father wanted to name
her, after Holden Caulfield's younger sister) was born in December
1955. On the one hand, she writes, her father was a doting parent
who made up enchanting bedtime stories and played ball out back
with his kids. During trips to Manhattan, he took her to the Plaza
Hotel (they traveled under assumed names, like CIA operatives) and
to lunch at the Algonquin with Peggy's godfather, New Yorker editor
William Shawn. It was a childhood ``lush with make-believe,'' she
writes, ``a world that dangled between dream and nightmare on a
gossamer thread my parents wove.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says the daughter, the nightmares frequently
blotted out the sunny days. There were bitter fights waged in front
of the kids. A miscarried fetus that young Peggy found and
innocently flushed down a toilet. Secrets that were kept from
Daddy, support that was bitterly withheld from Mom. A sense early
on, as Salinger describes it, that ``I was the only grown-up in the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The third section may reveal more than most readers care to know
about Peggy Salinger's later life _ though she says she can handle
that criticism, too. The bare-bones facts are these: that after
surviving (no other word seems apt) a harrowing experience at an
Adirondacks boarding school, she graduated from the Cambridge
School of Weston and Brandeis University, received an Oxford
degree, and is currently one internship shy of a Harvard Divinity
School degree. An accomplished skier and onetime college basketball
team captain at Oxford, she also worked as a Boston Edison garage
mechanic for five years, among a variety of jobs she has held. She
sings with the Tanglewood chorus. Like her mother, she has married
twice _ once to her then karate instructor, briefly, and then to
her current husband, Larry, a former Boston Opera Company singer
who does voice-overs for commercials. Unlike her father, Peggy
Salinger did not marry someone 50 years her junior. She says that
his third wife, a nurse, has shown kindness toward his children and
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Maynard, who was roundly condemned for having
spilled secrets about her father in her 1998 memoir, then
auctioning off a batch of letters from him for a princely sum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a parent changes your view of a lot of things,'' says
Salinger. ``Say you have an 18-year-old daughter at Yale, and she
meets a 53-year-old man. He seduces her into going up to live with
him. How many parents do you know who would dress her up for the
sacrifice? Or would you go ask the guy, `How attached to your knees
are you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have little sympathy for older guys, be they Clinton or my
father, who get involved with younger girls who are supposed to
keep their secrets,'' the daughter says. ``If you don't want it
told, keep it zipped. That's how I feel. Joyce has a right to her
story, even if I didn't want to read the icky stuff. But `How dare
she violate his privacy?' That's a bunch of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to those who question her own motives for publishing
``Dream Catcher,'' Salinger says that without the discipline of
having to meet a publisher's deadline _ and without the financial
support provided by a book contract _ she might never have seen the
project through. The price she has to pay? A father's (so far)
deafening silence. A painful interruption in her relationship with
her brother. And yes, she could have withheld publication until
after her father dies, but ``something felt sneaky about waiting.
It felt like shooting someone in the back. Maybe God or whoever
will judge me, but it felt less wrong somehow _ or more right _ to
do this while he was still alive and able to take the punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   When J. D. Salinger does pass away, says the daughter, she has
no idea what will happen to the stories and novels millions of his
fans await reading. ``The Catcher in the Rye'' continues to sell
thousands of copies a year. Reporters, schoolkids, and middle-aged
adolescents still crouch in the trees outside the Cornish house,
hoping for a glimpse of the famous recluse. There will be an
explosion _ no, a re-explosion _ of interest in all he has written.
Or not written.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Salinger insists her father hasn't figured out that final
chapter of his biography yet, at least as far as she knows. But in
all likelihood, she concedes, it will not be herself and her
brother put in charge of his literary estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I wouldn't be a bad choice, actually,'' she says,
unable to suppress a smile. ``I don't cheat. I don't have this
great anger people imagine I have toward my father. I don't blame
him for anything. I'd probably do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she adds with emphasis, ``It's not a job I want.''

THERE GOES THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like everyone else, I sometimes have trouble getting through
to a favorite online destination. Usually that's cause for
annoyance, weary resignation, or even anger. When it happened to me
the other night, I felt rather sad.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't logged onto the venerable CompuServe online service
since May. During my absence, the credit card that paid for my
subscription had expired, and so I had to phone in and get my
account reinstated. But as I recited the digits on my new card, a
sour, sorry thought came to me: What's the point?
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a younger, poorer edition of me would
sometimes be cut off from CompuServe for being late about the bill.
In those days it was nearly as bad as having the electricity
switched off. Back then, CompuServe was as close as ordinary people
could get to the Internet. With its teeming, bawdy chatrooms and
sophisticated, orderly discussion forums, a night on CompuServe was
like a walking tour of an unusually exciting city.
</P>
<P>
   These days there are many such towns online, and no longer is
CompuServe anywhere near the best of them. CompuServe's parent
company, America Online Inc., is its toughest competitor. Back when
CompuServe was still an independent company, its officials and
customers would mock the housewives and tow-truck drivers that AOL
signed up by the tens of thousands. They all knew that CompuServe
users were the smart ones _ doctors, lawyers, airline pilots, and,
of course, computer people. These brainy, stable people weren't the
sort who'd drop out after using up their hundred free hours.
Instead, they'd kept coming back year after year, establishing
CompuServe's network of congenial communities.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the CompuServe loyalists remain. Unfortunately, few
newcomers are joining them. In 1998, when it was acquired by AOL,
Compuserve boasted 2 million members. Over three years later,
Compuserve now boasts a staggering . . . 2.8 million members. The
flagship AOL service grew from 11 million to 24 million in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe general manager Audrey Weil prefers to look at the
sunny side, calling her service's growth ``a huge turnaround.''
Weil credits a $400 rebate to computer buyers who sign up for three
years of CompuServe for roping in 1.3 million new subscribers in
the past fiscal year, though she won't say much about the
half-million subscribers who must have fallen away in that period.
And she notes that CompuServe turns a profit for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no getting around the fact that CompuServe just
doesn't matter any more. If you want chat rooms, the Internet's
awash in them. Free e-mail service is almost as commonplace as
spam. As for the superb forums where CompuServers go for expert
information on hundreds of topics, there are plenty more like them
at every Web portal, not to mention 50,000 or so on the Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe has tried to enliven its forums by opening them up to
nonmembers. Anyone can now go to forums.compuserve.com, get a free
screen name, and sign on. It's a welcome feature, but it won't give
the newbies much of an incentive to become paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe has even abandoned the elite swagger of old. Weil now
says that the company is targeting ``the new consumer.'' She admits
that new subscribers will spend little time debating the best hard
drive; they'll be too busy reading the latest celebrity gossip.
``We're taking a tack where we see the most growth,'' Weil said.
``The customer that we're getting through rebates is a little bit
different than the traditional, serious CompuServe customer.'' As a
matter of fact, they're targeting AOL customers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've already got an AOL account. Far from despising that
plebeian service, I think it's earned a place in history as the
company that democratized the Internet. Besides, it provides a
basic set of online services that are accessible from pretty much
any city on earth. I wouldn't dream of letting my AOL account
lapse. But as for CompuServe, I've pretty much abandoned the old
neighborhood, and only 15 years of loyalty keeps me paying the
rent.

   NY-LATIN-MUSIC (New York) _ Turn the dial on your radio three
times these days, and chances are you will tune in to at least one
Latin artist, whether it's Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez or Carlos
Santana. New York City has long been a crucible for the
Latin-American music now known as salsa. The city also wins credit,
in many quarters, for transforming big-band mambo. And it lays
claim to Cubop, a fusion of be-bop's brass and Afro-Cuban
percussion. Some music historians even say New York is responsible
for the various dance crazes that went along with Latin music
forms, like the cha-cha in the 1950s and the pachanga a decade
later. By Nina Siegal.

18th-century town built on a late 17th-century Baroque street plan.
To history buffs, it has been the capital of Maryland for 300 years
and was briefly the capital of the United States. To recreational
boaters, it is among the premier sailing centers on the Eastern
Seaboard. And to just about anyone, it is a perfect place to savor
Maryland's singular contribution to Western civilization, the

it into an irresistibly heady mixture of sadness and hilarity. At
its giddiest peaks the movie, directed by Neil LaBute, produces
that shivery feeling when your heart melts but at the same moment
you want to burst out laughing. This whimsical rose-colored fairy
tale with tragic undercurrents suggests a contemporary ``Wizard of

David O. Russell's ``Flirting With Disaster,'' another road movie

   Bugs that eat oil, breaking 150 miles per hour on a two-lane
road at night, and who was Rat Fink's daddy? More of your mail,
more of my answers:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 82-year-old father, who lives on Cape Cod, bought a brand
new 2000 Volkswagen Golf several months ago. It seems to be burning
an excessive amount of oil. The dealer says it is normal for these
modern cars with ``high tolerance'' engines. The car burned a quart
of oil in the first 1,000 miles. He was told this would continue
and he should put a quart in every 1,000 and at intervals of 6,000
and 20,000 miles it will improve. Does this sound right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Question for the dealer: Where's the oil going? The folks at
Volkswagen tell me the first oil that should go into a new VW is at
the 5,000-mile oil change. High tolerance engines are everywhere
and they don't burn oil like that. Is your father's car smoking?
And what was that dealer smoking? Call me and give me the dealer's
name.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You automotive journalists kill me. You'd think you perceive
yourselves as gods descended to Earth. You drive a Porsche at more
than 175 miles per hour (back in June) at a known speed trials test
site and you get a plaque for doing it. Big deal! Try going over
150 miles per hour in a stone-stock 1988 5.0 Mustang on a two-lane
road at night . . . I could have gone faster but my windows were
open.
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir, are a doofus. You say I have a god-complex because
I drive fast on a desert where I endanger only myself, yet you take
into your hands not only your own life but the lives of anyone you
may encounter by driving probably three times the speed limit on a
back road. And why were your windows open? So you could toss the
empty long-neck beer bottles out as you whizzed along?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm on a hunt for information about a redesigned Ford
Explorer for model year 2002. They are keeping it all very
hush-hush. We aren't necessarily looking for a significantly larger
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not really all that hush-hush. The Explorer and Mercury
Mountaineer will share a larger platform, offer three rows of seats
and independent rear suspension. For smaller versions of the
Explorer, consider the Sport Trac and the Explorer Sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the prize for letting you know that the nickname ``Big
Daddy'' referred to the drag racer Don Garlits, not Ed Roth, the
artist and auto designer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Garlits gave us Swamp Rats, Roth gave us Rat Fink, a host of
other characters, and great, radical cars. Countless hours were
spent by countless young boys trying to recreate the drawings of Ed
``Big Daddy'' Roth as they whiled away time in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've ordered a Toyota Tundra V8 Access Cab 4WD but I can't
seem to get a commitment on having one delivered with ABS. I get
the feeling Toyota does not want to provide the ABS option. I am
moving to Vermont and my new home will be located three miles up a
dirt road and has a very steep driveway.
</P>
<P>
   A. Toyota says there should not be a problem getting ABS for
your Tundra. Let me know if this problem persists _ you may have a
dealer playing games with you. One question, though: You mention
tough sledding where you are going to live. ABS is a brake system
and is not going to help you with traction the way a traction
control system would help. It will help you stop, but won't help
you go. And the Tundra does not come with traction control.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think you transposed numbers in your story about the Dual
Ghia with the Chrysler hemi engine. The 1957-58 hemi was 392 cubic
inches, not 329.
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir, are no doofus. You are correct and I'll try to type
better in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is wrong? Column after column dwells on pretensions . .
. trips by you to silly racing strips courtesy of advertisers . . .
absence of emphasis on autos with sound engineering and real
mechanical class. Have you ever heard of principles of parsimony
and minimalism?
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir . . . . Ah yes, parsimony and minimalism. I found
those once _ in the Yugo. You've probably got one of those babies
parked in your yard in Maine right now and have time to write hate
mail to me because your car won't start. But to the point: I do not
travel anywhere on the tab of advertisers or auto manufacturers. If
I do, I get fired. And no emphasis on sound engineering? Buddy,
there are hundreds of models of great autos being built these days
and if I have failed to review the one you admire, then keep
watching _ I'll get to the Tucker yet.

<P>
   Q. It is my belief that if you encouraged a single driver to buy
a (more powerful, tuned suspension) Roush Ford Expedition by raving
about how nimble and free of dangerous pitch it is, you have done a
great disservice.
</P>
<P>
   A. The point of the Roush review, from the opening sentence, was
that all those folks who drive their SUVs as if they were in a
Roush are jerks. These are the people you need to watch out for _
not the handful who drive the Roush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does Ford plan to offer power seats in the popular Focus?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ford says no. There just isn't enough demand for power seats
in a car in that price range and of that size. They looked at it,
but it ended up way down the list of potential improvements.

AN ECONOMY PRESSED TO THE LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unemployment rate ticked up a bit in August. Consumers
aren't spending as freely as they once did. The economy as a whole
seems to be slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you explain the fact that big chunks of the economy
appear to be bursting at the seams, with demand outrunning supply
and prices climbing at a scary rate?
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   --The price of oil hit $34 dollars a barrel Wednesday on fears
that oil-producing nations will not pump enough oil this winter.
The current price represents a 10-year high. A year ago oil sold
for $18 a barrel; in January 1999 the price was $11.
</P>
<P>
   --Natural gas prices are twice as high as they were a year and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Parts of the country have experienced sharp spikes in the
price of electricity as utilities scramble to come up with enough
power. In California some customers have seen their bills triple.
Locally, the electric utilities are asking for rate hikes of up to
12 percent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   --The price of air travel has climbed 9.5 percent over the past
year. Planes are full, the skies are congested, and the number of
late flights is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   --In Boston, the cost of renting an apartment has increased 9
percent in the past year and for two-bedroom apartments, more than
80 percent over the past five years. According to one account,
there were only 150 apartments available for rent this September
citywide, about one-third the usual number. In the regular housing
market the story is much the same: lots of demand, little supply,
and rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressing against the limits is the story of this economy,''
said Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why we have come to this point. The
American economy has been growing since 1991, the longest expansion
in the nation's history. More than that, the economy has been
growing much faster than anticipated. The result has been a surge
in demand, which in many cases, has caught people unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economy, keeping up with growth is not that
difficult. You hire more people; add some servers, routers, and
computers; and bingo, you can handle the increased load.
</P>
<P>
   But in parts of the old economy, life isn't that simple. Supply
doesn't automatically come on line when you snap your fingers. In
fact, it can take years to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the energy business. Because prices were low for so
long, oil and gas companies didn't invest much in finding or
producing new supplies. Inventories for both fuels are at the
lowest level in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   With prices soaring, those companies today have a big incentive
to find more. But it could be several years before supply meets
demand again. In the meantime we can all expect to pay more to
drive our cars and heat our homes.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is even worse in other fields. In California, no
major electric power plants have been built in the past 10 years.
Because of the long lead times involved, no new plants are expected
to come on line before 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On the air travel front, only three new runways were put into
service at the nation's major airports between 1995 and 1999. In
Boston, new apartment buildings, especially ones that cater to the
middle-class, are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the barrier to building new supply is cost. Sometimes
it is lack of space. And sometimes it is a case of ``Not In My Back
Yard.'' Who wants to live next door to an electric power plant or a
new runway? Just ask the residents of East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and investors, all of these imbalances raise a
critical question: Are these isolated examples or are they
forerunners of a more general inflation problem that comes when you
push an economy beyond its limits?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are isolated,'' said Nicholas Perna, an
economic consultant based in Connecticut. Perna isn't forecasting a
big rise in prices, but he suggests that most economists and
investors may be overly optimistic in their inflation projections
for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more upbeat. Mark Zandi, chief economist at
Economy.com, a forecasting firm, points out that big productivity
gains in manufacturing and service have allowed the economy to grow
without creating an inflation problem. Wednesday the government
reported that productivity grew at a whopping 5.7 percent pace in
the second quarter. When productivity is rising, companies can pay
higher wages while keeping their prices flat.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi still worries about the tight labor market, but even
there, there is no evidence yet that a lack of workers is pushing
wages up at a worrisome rate.
</P>
<P>
   We don't pretend to have the answer to the inflation question,
but the bottlenecks in the economy suggest an important and humbing
lesson:
</P>
<P>
   That while we all love to talk about the magic of the new
economy, we all spend a good chunk of our time and money in the old
economy where the rules of the game haven't changed very much.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind when you pay your fuel bill this winter.

EXCITEMENT UNDER THE LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a night-time town, a town of saloon singers
(`` . . . gimme one more for the road . . . '') and heavy swingers.
Since 1975, when the US Open discovered Edison, the most stirring
conflicts usually havebeen staged after dark, under floodlights.
</P>
<P>
   Whether filling the venerable concrete horseshoe at Forest Hills
or the more modern Flushing Meadows canyon lined with blue seats
and called Arthur Ashe Stadium, the crowds are a throwback to the
old days of ballpark title fights at Yankee Stadium and the Polo
Grounds, when the customers were hyped-up with anticipation of
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was that kind of night at the US Open. You could
feel the excitement. Joe Louis and Max Schmeling weren't going to
reappear, and neither were Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson,
Carmen Basilio, or Billy Conn. But it's the same idea in tennis,
man against man _ or woman against woman _ probing for a knockout.
The patrons were primed for heavy-fisted swinging of rackets. Which
they got.
</P>
<P>
   On the card were four nifty bangers, each a major champ: Serena
Williams against Lindsay Davenport and Pete Sampras against Richard
Krajicek in quarterfinal matches. Their credentials were in order:
knockout punchers all.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras may have been afraid of the dark as a child, but no
more. He's a nocturnal werewolf at Flushing Meadows, a perfect 15-0
once the sun goes down, shooting the moon as he did while eclipsing
his leading rival for the title, Richard Krajicek, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6),
6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Counterpunching furiously as he rose from the floor in the
second set at 2-6 down in the tie-breaker, Sampras pushed his
greatness button and soared through six successive points, five of
them winners. That left Krajicek, the Frying Dutchman, burnt out
and ready for the kill that came with one final overhead right from
Sampras _ a service winner _ liberating the witnesses at 1:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying as heavyweights in their own division, Williams and
Davenport, a pair of US Open champions, slugged at each other as
though the world was at stake. Their world was, even though it
won't really be decided until the final Saturday. But Williams, who
came in as the reigning champ, won't be there, even if her sister,
Venus, might be.
</P>
<P>
   With a weak backhand poke of a second serve into the net,
Williams yielded. The queen of 1999 was dead, 6-4, 6-2, and the
queen of 1998, Davenport, was standing and beaming and ready to
chase an 18-year-old Russian beauty, Elena Dementieva, out of the
semifinals and out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Was the half moon crowning the crisp, clear evening an omen the
Williams kids' assault on the Open might not be the full-blown
dream of Papa Richard: both Venus and Serena in the title bout? Now
it's up to the Wimbledon titleholder, Venus, to hold up her half
Friday against yet another champ, Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and Davenport went at each other immediately,
although they were 18 minutes late in starting _ upholding a US
Open tradition of tardiness. Wimbledon administrators, in their
punctuality, often wonder whether clocks have reached the Colonies
yet.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a late crowd, too, knowing there wouldn't be a
knockout in the first minutes such as Muhammad Ali delivered to
Charles (Sonny) Liston at Lewiston, Maine, in 1965. By the time the
Lilac Lady _ Williams in purple shoes and skirt _ and Long Lindsay
were heated up, the audience had expanded to 23,137, and the fans
had forgotten the chill of the evening amid the warmth of the
torrid shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   It took Davenport 89 minutes to reverse her semifinal loss to
Little Sister Serena of a year ago. Davenport overcame an immediate
crisis the first time she served, ducking three break points, and
was on her way. Despite Williams's superior speed, Davenport had
the edge in footwork, ever in position to drive forehands and
double-barreled backhands to the corners that kept Williams
constantly commuting.
</P>
<P>
   This felt good to the tallest woman ever to hold a major
championship, and 6-foot-3-inch Davenport kept doling out the
punishment. Why not? After all, Williams had pushed her around five
straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport knifed through Williams's serve for a 5-4 lead, and
she was off on a six-game procession that took her to 4-0 in the
second set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was staggering, missing too many shots, but her
fighting spirit never diminished. Davenport was wary. She could
recall their most recent meeting, a final three weeks ago at
Manhattan Beach, Calif. Davenport had served for that title at 6-5
in the third _ and Williams had permitted her just one more point,
winning in a conclusive tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the 18-year-old Williams fought like a tigress
protecting kittens as she trailed, 1-5. The championship belt was
slipping. But that seventh game _ a 10 minute ordeal _ seemed like
``a title game'' to Davenport. She had Williams on the ropes,
pummeling her, and five times was on the verge of a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Five match points. But Williams bobbed and weaved, escaping each
of them, twice with aces, jabbing and whacking desperately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a game. Seemed like it meant everything,'' Davenport
said. ``But when I lost it, I looked up at the scoreboard and it
was 5-2. Two breaks. I was comfortable.'' And she served it out
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Davenport crowd roared delightedly, and the Williams crowd
sighed mournfully at their girl's last shriek as her last shot
stung the net. It was time to go out for a beer and wait for two
more heavyweights: Sampras, shaking the cobwebs of four set points
in his tie-breaker resurrection to flatten Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   You could hear from the ozone the tribute of the bygone Boston
boxing promoter, Sam Silverman: ``That Sampras is the iron, a
double-tough Greek. He takes it on the lug but gets up from the
dead. Let's go eat Chinese and drink some stingers.''

REVEALING THE KNOW-NOTHINGS' DARK MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ The spidery scrawl is faded by the passage of a
century and a half, but there is no mistaking the fearful and
bigoted message. A slogan atop the first page reads, ``Put none but
Americans on Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows in a document just acquired by Boston College is
the oath taken by Boston members of a secretive political
organization known popularly as the Know-Nothing Party. Five pages
of light blue paper, dated Oct. 13, 1854, outline the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``To defend our Republic Institutions against the encroachments
of the Church of Rome . . . and its ignorant and deluded
followers,'' it reads, ``we are associated on a secret Military
Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospective members were then directed to ``raise your right
hand up before the floating flag of your country (and) place your
right foot on the emblem of the Church of Rome,'' then pledge to
``carry out the objects of this Institution,'' including going to
the assistance of ``a comrade attacked by foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, said Boston College historian Thomas H. O'Connor,
``confirms the anti-Catholic nature of the Know-Nothing movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Know-Nothing document was purchased from Stuart Lutz, a
historical document dealer in New Jersey, who brought it to Boston
College's notice earlier this year. He had acquired it in what he
described as ``a big pile of random paper,'' including letters and
other 19th-century documents.
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Connor and Robert K. O'Neill, director of the Burns
rare-book library at Boston College, said their research has failed
to uncover any similar document dealing with the inner affairs of
the Know-Nothing movement.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill described it as a major addition to the Burns Library's
collection of documents relating to the history of the Irish in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While now rating little more than a footnote, when mentioned at
all, the Know-Nothing Party dominated politics in Massachusetts for
a brief period. In 1854, on the heels of victories in Boston and
other cities, it swept the governorship and other state offices,
all congressional seats, and all state Senate seats, and won all
but one state House seat _ and seemed poised to strongly contest
the presidential election of 1856.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a revisionist tendency in recent years, said
O'Connor, to downplay the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic bias of
the Know-Nothing Party and instead portray it as a progressive
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you read this,'' O'Connor said, referring to the
oath, ``the blatancy of the anti-Catholicism is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Know-Nothing movement developed in the early 1850s, presaged
by locally based nativist movements that triggered such events as
the burning of the Ursuline convent in Charlestown (now Somerville)
in 1834 and the riot on Broad Street between Yankee firefighters
returning from a fire and Irish mourners in a funeral procession.
But the national movement was fueled by the huge wave of Irish
immigration following the famines of the 1840s. Its leaders,
O'Connor said, realized that control of immigration could happen
only on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   Organized officially as the American Party, it acquired its
popular name because members were instructed to answer with a
``don't know'' when asked about its leaders, membership, funds, or
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people wanted to get off the mark quickly,'' O'Connor
said. ``They didn't want to get bogged down by questions about
their membership or finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Know-Nothing members, writes Babson history professor
John R. Mulkern in his 1990 book, ``The Know-Nothing Party in
Massachusetts,'' were ``Yankee mechanics, factory workers, common
laborers, clerks, small jobbers, tradesmen and struggling
entrepreneurs in the cities and larger towns (who) had to live
cheek by jowl with impoverished foreigners and face daily the
challenge that Irish Catholics posed to the neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there was a political vacuum in the state,
caused by the failure of antislavery Democrats and Whigs to
coalesce into the new Republican Party, as they had in other
states. Despite its political success in Massachusetts, Maryland,
and several other northern states, the Know-Nothing movement
collapsed as quickly as it had arisen.
</P>
<P>
   During the spring of 1856, even as the Know-Nothings were
confidently gearing up for the presidential election, O'Connor
said, ``the slavery issue blew up.'' In May, John Brown and several
of his followers murdered five pro-slavery settlers in Kansas in
retaliation for a raid on Lawrence, Kan., known as the ``Boston
abolition town.'' Then, Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner was
attacked and beaten on the Senate floor by an outraged Southern
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The slavery issue clearly had the power to destroy the Union,
O'Connor said, and ``divided people along slavery lines, rather
than religious lines.'' The importance of the issue led to the
formation of the Republican Party. The Know-Nothings ran former
president Millard Fillmore for president, but carried only
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Know-Nothing members, O'Connor said, most went into
the Republican Party _ even though its future leader, Abraham
Lincoln, had explicitly refused to join the Know- Nothing Party
when invited to do so.

OAKLAND EARNING ALL A'S FOR EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A playoff team may very well have been in action at
Fenway Park Wednesday night, but it's probably not the one people
around here think.
</P>
<P>
   With their 6-4 victory over the Red Sox nicely coupled with
Seattle's loss to the Blue Jays, the Oakland Athletics are just a
game and a half behind the Mariners in the American League West. No
one has a sweeter stretch run schedule. These guys aren't even
discussing the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I talk to the press I tell them we're just focusing
on one thing, and that's the division,'' says manager Art Howe.
``The other thing, people are coming behind you, or alongside you.
They come from all directions. We're not worried about that. This
was a big game for us. Cleveland, who knows? We don't even look at
their scores any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one happy bunch of A's who jumped on that plane for the
long ride into the night. They closed out a 4-2 road trip and now
head back home to play Tampa Bay for four. And, as far as we know,
their general manager hasn't said anything lately to rile up the
last-place Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those four games, the A's will also play 15 more
games against teams with losing records. They've already dealt with
the iron. The only games they have left with anyone on the plus
side of the standings are the four with Seattle, and those are four
games they really want to play, since they currently fear nobody.
</P>
<P>
   They're certainly as lovable as any team in the league. They've
got that slow-pitch softball look with the likes of Jason Giambi
and Matt Stairs, who said he fulfilled a long-standing ambition by
curling a third-inning home run around Pesky Pole. They've got some
nice young positional talent in the form of shortstop Miguel
Tejada, third baseman Eric Chavez, and center fielder Terrence
Long, who made the defensive play of the game by leaning into the
Oakland bullpen to take a sure game-tying two-run homer away from
Jason Varitek in the seventh. They have some superb young arms with
pitchers like Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Wednesday night's starter
(and winner) Mark Mulder. They have quality veterans like Gil
Heredia, Kevin Appier, and Mike Stanley. They even have the oldest
currently active player in the league (now that Jesse Orosco is on
the disabled list) in 43-year-old reliever Doug Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting mix, but the public image sees them more in
terms of the kids than anything else. Stanley hasn't been with the
team very long, but it's long enough to arrive at the conclusion
that in this case youth is not being wasted on the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts out here with just plain desire,'' he maintains.
``People keep talking about the youth here, and every time
something goes wrong people say, `Oh, they're too young,' but
nobody's more experienced than Seattle and look at the problems
they've had. These pitchers may be young, but there are some great
arms, like that kid tonight. And Barry Zito. And Tim Hudson.
There's a lot of poise on that mound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to face them,'' decided Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The kid in question was Mulder, a primo prospect who was the
second player chosen in the 1998 draft. The lefthander has had good
days and bad days in this rookie season (he's 8-10, 5.57), but he
clearly has the raw talent, and this was a quality six innings of
work in a pennant race game. Afterward he stood around and talked
as if he had just won a game in the Pioneer League, or even the
Cape League, where he once performed for the Bourne Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to know what you're doing,'' he shrugged.
``You've got to go after guys, and you've got to be aggressive. It
might be my first year, but that's the way I approach it. I know I
can pitch like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is 15-6 in his second year. There's no doubt that he can
pitch. And though Zito has only made nine big league starts (3-3,
3.12), he has managers and pitching coaches salivating all over the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Mix these kids in with outstanding young players like Giambi,
Tejada, Chavez, and Long, and you have a very intriguing club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some excellent young pitchers and some excellent
young position players,'' confirms Oakland coach Ken Macha, who
managed in the Red Sox system. ``Tejada is a good player. He's
going to join those other couple or three (shortstops) at the head
of the class pretty soon. Chavez is coming along at third. Terrence
Long has a chance to hit 20 homers and score 100 runs. There are a
lot of good young players here. We have a chance to make the
playoffs this year, and we should do nothing but get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect of all this is general manager Billy Beane, who
has done a sensational job of managing his limited resources.
Whatever kind of market a $32 million payroll makes you, that's
what the Oakland A's are. And if that isn't enough to make you root
for the A's, consider that are essentially unloved in their own
backyard. The payroll and the attendance (12th in the league) go
hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Howe basically issued a plea for people to come out and back
them down the stretch. ``It would be nice,'' he sighs. ``It would
show that the fans appreciate the effort these guys have given.
Some fan support would be greatly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it would be fun to play in a sold-out stadium every
night,'' says Mulder. ``But it's something we've accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Something always seems to get in the way of public acceptance
out there. The fact is that as worthy as the A's are, nothing they
can do will distract people from what's happening across the Bay,
where the first place Giants play before sellout crowds in
everybody's new favorite ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   So that leads us to the ultimate possibility _ a second Bay Area
World Series. Nobody's talking about it, but as you look around
baseball in the year 2000, is it that ludicrous an idea? Who's so
great that the A's and Giants can't dream?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the A's have positioned themslves perfectly to decide
their own fate. ``I see it in everybody's eyes, every day,''
contends Long. Whatever that ``it'' is, one thing it most
definitely isn't is fear. These guys are dangerous.

 &HT;    LEGAL FIGHT OVER CENSUS DATA COULD SHAPE POLITICS FOR A DECADE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle brewing in a federal courthouse here
could shape America's political landscape for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court's review of a Virginia election law has emerged
as an all-important test case in the politically charged issue of
whether states should redraw their legislative districts next year
using raw census results or statistically adjusted data.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen major U.S. cities and counties, including Miami, Houston
and Los Angeles, have sought to join the legal fight against the
law, passed earlier this year by the Republican-dominated
legislature in the capital, Richmond. The law mandates the use of
raw population numbers on which to base Virginia's political
mapmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas, with large minority populations traditionally
undercounted by the census, fear the Virginia law will set a
national precedent as states prepare to redraw legislative
boundaries based on the results of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states with GOP-controlled legislatures _ Alaska,
Arizona, Colorado and Kansas _ have approved similar laws barring
the use of adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that the method, known as sampling, is necessary
to correct the undercount and ensure that federal spending based on
the census reaches the poorer areas that need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say sampling is merely a means of boosting the
census numbers _ and political clout in urban Democratic
strongholds _ with people who may or may not be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sampling is really no more than educated guesswork,'' said
David Botkins, spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley.
``Census means count, it does not mean guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Virginia law claim it will discriminate against
minorities, who are traditionally undercounted by the census and
thus will be underrepresented by skewed political boundaries based
on unadjusted population figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This undermines the principle of 'one person, one vote' by
virtually assuring us that voting districts will not be the same
size, and it practically guarantees an undercount of racial
minorities,'' said Kent Willis, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, which has joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in Washington
will hear preliminary arguments in the Virginia case on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year upheld a Republican claim that
unadjusted census figures should be used in apportioning the 435
seats in the House of Representatives among the states. But the
ruling seemed to suggest that it was up to the states to determine
whether to use adjusted data or the actual count for redrawing
congressional, state and local district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Census Bureau plans to release two sets of
numbers next year _ the raw count and the adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia case is being widely viewed by state officials and
legal scholars as a legal fight that eventually will make its way
to the Supreme Court, giving the high court an opportunity to
clarify its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. Control of redistricting can determine the
partisan balance in state legislatures and the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   And most experts believe the season of lawsuits regarding
redistricting and the census has only begun. Redistricting
following the 1990 census generated litigation in 41 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming there is no perfectly clear Supreme Court decision,
no booming voice telling states that this is the way to do it, all
the states are vulnerable, no matter what set of data they use,''
said Tim Storey, a redistricting specialist with the Denver-based
National Association of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question isn't if, but when _ will the decision come
early next year before states must do their redistricting, or will
it come afterward when everyone is stuck trying to decide if they
have done the wrong thing or the right thing?'' said Dale Oldham, a
lawyer and redistricting specialist for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 2000 census of America's 120 million households,
the Census Bureau is gathering demographic statistics from 314,000
households to adjust population counts in areas as small as city
blocks. The method, known as sampling, is based on a mathematical
formula regarded by demographers as a reliable way to fine-tune the
census to account for millions of people missed in the traditional
count.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census failed to count about 4 million people, and was
more likely to miss minorities, the poor and children, according to
Census Bureau estimates. About 4.4 percent of all blacks were not
counted and nearly 5 percent of Hispanics were missed, according to
the post-census review.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, Census Bureau officials will hold a hearing at the
National Academy of Sciences to review the process their experts
will use to adjust the count. If the Census Bureau and the National
Academy of Sciences find no fault with the scientific methods being
used, the adjusted numbers will be released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good numbers are critical to a good democracy,'' said Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, which is not a party in the
Virginia lawsuit. ``It starts with the assumption that it is
impossible to count everyone. The census is an estimate of a true
count, and we believe we should do everything possible to make the
census a better estimate, a better count.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is one of 16 states which must submit changes in its
electoral laws to the Department of Justice for review under the
1965 Voting Rights Act. In effect, the state sued the Justice
Department seeking a federal review of the law barring adjusted
census numbers in an attempt to clarify the issue before the state
lawmakers must begin redrawing boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Virginia and Virginians to have swift,
timely elections and that they not be delayed by litigation,''
Botkins said.

A DOOR DILEMMA: THEY'RE TOO LOOSE OR TOO TIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a frustrating summer, all right _ muggy and humid
and musty one day, dry as a bone the next, and never really
pleasantly hot for summer living.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, doors began to stick. Sometimes interior doors
stick, sometimes exterior doors stick, sometimes they stick at the
same time, making them hard to open or close.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Why did those doors, which worked well enough
last winter, stick in the summer? It's the humidity that did it.
The wood doors absorbed moisture and expanded, making them too big
for their openings.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity and expansion of the wood is the biggest cause of
sticking doors, but before you start trimming them to fit, check to
make sure the hinges are tight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes hinges work loose, from constant use of the door.
Check the screws; you might have only to tighten them. If they
tighten, you're all set. If they keep turning without tightening,
replace them with larger and longer screws that will tighten.
</P>
<P>
   Or, fill screw holes with wood matches or slivers of wood and
drive in the original screws. Or, buy Mr. Grip _ little barbed
strips of aluminum _ and slip them into the holes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shimming will fix it &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a door will stick only on part of a side, usually the
top or bottom third of the door. To fix this, determine where the
door is sticking. If the top third is sticking, and the hinges are
tight, you can shim behind the bottom hinge, which will bring the
bottom of the door out a little so it won't stick.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrew the hinge leaf on the jamb, not the door, and cut a
piece of cardboard, poster board or mat board to the size of the
hinge leaf and insert it behind the leaf. Drive in the screws and
see what happens. You may have to put a double thickness of
cardboard behind the leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricating with soap, wax or WD-40 will help, but only
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've done everything and still the doors stick. If they
have swollen due to moisture, wait. In winter, the doors will lose
moisture shrink back to normal, and swing free again without
sticking. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trim as needed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you can't wait 'til the doors shrink, or if they don't shrink
enough, surgery is needed. Trim off the offending edge; it could be
the latch edge, the top or bottom edge or all three. Rarely does
the hinge edge need trimming.
</P>
<P>
   Trim with a plane or Surform plane, a tool with a lot of little
teeth that does a pretty good job. In severe cases, you might have
to saw off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with trimming is that you might take off too much,
and when the door dries out and shrinks, it will be way too small
for its opening. If it is, you can nail on an extra side and top
stop, wood trim that the door butts up against when it is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming of sides and tops can be done with the door in place.
Put a wedge under it so it will hold steady when you are working on
it. To saw an edge, it's best to take the door off its hinges and
put it on a flat surface. The door must be removed to trim the
bottom edge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seal out the moisture &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We mentioned that a wood door takes on moisture. Once you have
trimmed it, paint all edges and possibly both faces to seal the
door at its dryest, against invasion of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Use an oil primer and finish with latex finish paint.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the door's finish _ too many coats of paint _ will
make it too big for its opening. Remove the paint by sanding or
stripping. Then refinish.
</P>
<P>
   All this information applies to interior doors, exterior doors,
and wood storms.
</P>
<P>
   If your aluminum or steel storm doors stick, it isn't the doors
that have swollen from moisture, but the frame. You can't trim the
doors, but you can rebuild the frame they sit in.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the handyman's back wood storm door has
been sticking on and off all summer.
</P>
<P>
   I'll fix it _ some day. At least the front wood storm door is
nice and loose. Too loose? Maybe, but it doesn't stick.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've solved the problem of sticking doors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
This door won't stay open &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what about a door that is not tight at all, but is too
loose, and won't stay open when it is supposed to? You open it, and
the darned thing closes all by itsef.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a reader wrote about his door. ``I put WD-40 on the
hinges of the door,'' he wrote, ``and now it won't stay open. Any
suggestions you might have would be appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   First, check the hinges to make sure they are tight. They are
likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   OK. The WD-40 made the door run more smoothly on its hinges,
which is good because it can stop squeaks. A down-and-dirty cure is
to remove the hinge pin, place it on a hard surface and whack it
with a hammer. This will bend it slightly so that it will be
tighter in the pin holder when you re-insert it, thus holding the
door open. The trouble with this is that the squeak is likely to
recur.
</P>
<P>
   What happened is this: The door is not vertical; it leans
slightly in its frame. When the door is open, the slant causes it
to close by itself because it is off balance.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate this, open the door to your freezer or
refrigerator; let it go, and it will close by itself. This slanting
is done on purpose so you won't leave the door open longer than
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The slanting of your regular door is not on purpose. But you can
fix it. Shim the top hinge by placing a piece of cardboard under
the leaf of the hinge on the jamb. This will bring the door to
vertical, and presto! It will stay open.
</P>
<P>
   At least it should.

EXACTLY HOW MUCH TOE IS TOO MUCH TOE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if we don't already have enough to worry about, now there's
the issue of toe cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never thought much about toe cleavage until I saw it
mentioned in a story in Sunday's New York Times Style section. In
fact, I don't recall hearing the phrase before, although it did set
off a very faint bell. Toe cleavage? Did it come up during the Dick
Morris foot-fetish affair?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the ins and outs of toe cleavage loom large in the
life of Manolo Blahnik, and the lives of his devotees. I may not
have heard of toe cleavage but I've heard of Manolo Blahnik. Who
hasn't?
</P>
<P>
   For years Blahnik's shoes have been the apotheosis of footwear
fashion. Lately you can hardly turn on the TV or pick up a magazine
without finding some celebrity or other singing the praises of
Blahnik's designs. Manolomania is everywhere. The ``Sex and the
City'' girls teeter about Manhattan on his spikes. Jennifer
Anniston wore 4-inch Manolos at her wedding. Joan Rivers, Queen
Latifah, Diana Ross, and Kathie Lee Gifford, among many others, are
on record testifying to the fabulousness of Manolo Blahnik shoes.
Madonna once said that her Manolos are ``as good as sex, and they
last longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to toe cleavage. In the New York Times
story, Blahnik is quoted as saying that toe cleavage is ``a very
important part of the sexuality of the shoe,'' and that the secret
is in showing only ``the first two cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   This pronouncement was taken from a book, ``Manolo Blahnik'' by
Colin McDowell, published this month by Harper Collins and, at $50,
a bargain compared to the price of a pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes,
which start at around $500 and price-wise ascend into the shopping
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book to see what other
secrets of toe cleavage it might reveal. Is there, perhaps, a
language of toe cleavage, understood only by shoe connoisseurs and
shoe fetishists? Why are two toe cracks sexier than one? Why draw
the line at two? Why not three?
</P>
<P>
   Blahnik is no ordinary shoe designer and, appropriately,
``Manolo Blahnik'' is no ordinary biography, but what its author
describes as ``a thing of fits, starts and enthusiasms.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what McDowell writes in the introduction, it was no
simple task to capture the elusive Blahnik persona, although I
can't help wondering if it might have gone more smoothly if the
biographer had assumed a slightly less worshipful posture as he
went about his work. It can't be easy researching and writing an
entire book while on your knees.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell's book is a peculiar treasure, but it doesn't shed any
more light on the toe cleavage issue. I called an expert, Valerie
Steele, chief curator of the museum of the Fashion Institute of
Technology and author of ``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style,'' and
``Fetish: Fashion, Sex and Power.'' Feet, she said, are commonly
seen as analogous to body parts. Toe cleavage evokes breast
cleavage. ``Showing off toe cleavage is way more common than it
used to be,'' she said. ``Shoes that you used to see only on
strippers you now see at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said she found it ``interesting'' that Blahnik focused
his attention on the first two toe-cracks, since many other shoe
designers are showing off all the toes. ``It's kind of a `this
little piggy went to market' look,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through the drawings and photographs of Manolo Blahnik
shoes in the book I noticed that many of the master's own designs
flouted the two toe-crack cleavage dictum and flaunted multiple toe
cleavage, as many as four toe-cracks. What can this mean? The toe
cleavage issue remains unresolved.

VINEGAR WILL BANISH GRASS FROM WALKWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Grass is always growing through the joints of my concrete
walk. Is there a way to keep it from growing back, once it is
removed?
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN GREEN, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Be happy that you have just a few joints in the concrete
walkway. Pity those who have a brick walk in the sun. Grass and
other weeds really grow between the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   You can pull out the grass and other weeds bodily. To hasten the
removal, kill the greenery with vinegar. Just pour it on each
joint. Vinegar is essentially acid rain, and we know what acid rain
does. It is the least toxic of the treatments available. Bleach,
salt water, and Roundup are three others, much less environmentally
friendly than vinegar, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Treat the joints in mid-spring and again in mid-summer.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's brick walk is plagued with lots and lots of weeds,
here is one cure and preventative: Pick up the bricks, lay down
agricultural cloth or perforated black plastic, and replace the
bricks. This will keep weeds from growing. It will work for a
while, but eventually the weeds will win out, and you will be back
to the vinegar patrol.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A large part of my walls is covered with Z-Brick, which I
like very much. A small area has to be redone. I have the Z-Brick
to put up, but I don't have any of the mortar-like filler material
used between the bricks. What can I use?
</P>
<P>
   JO HANEGAN, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since the Z-Brick is real clay, and the filler material is
cement-based, use Mortar Mix by Sakrete, sold in hardware and
building stores. How you put it between the bricks is important.
You can put up the Z-Brikck itself with a tile adhesive or a
thin-set mortar. Then, to install the Mortar Mix, mix a small
amount with water to make a crumbly, not soupy, mix. Press it in
the joints with a pointing tool (a steel bar made for this
purpose). Compact the mortar and smooth off. And more important,
avoid getting mortar on the face of the brick. If you do, do not
wipe it or smear it, but scrape it off with a trowel, and let the
rest set. Then any time in the future, days or years later, treat
the spilled mortar with muriatic acid. Mix it half-and-half with
water, and always pour the acid into water. The mortar will fizz up
and can be scraped off with a wire brush. Then rinse.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned making up a small batch of mortar. The reason for
this is that being an amateur, you will be slow in your work, and
since mortar sets up in 15 mintues, a larger batch will begin to
harden before you can use it all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new roof is three years old, and there is a leak. The
roofer admits that it is in a valley, where two sloping roofs come
together. He wants to redo the area of about 150 square feet, and
to install an Ice &AMP; Water Shield (a rubberized membrane) before
putting on new shingles. Will that cause problems such as ice dams,
or anything else, that I should be concerned with?
</P>
<P>
   SIDNEY HARRIS, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The rubberized membrane will help avoid problems such as ice
dams. And be happy that the roofer is willing to do something,
particularly if the leak occurred after three years. Even if he
charges for the work he will do, it should not be that much, and in
my opinion will cure the leak.
</P>
<P>

   Quarry tile makes a very nice floor, for kitchen, patio,
sunroom, or mudroom. But it has one drawback: It is unglazed and is
susceptible to stains. People try to varnish it to make it stain
resistant and to give it a gloss, but this is not always
satifactory; the varnish usually peels.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman has suggested using Future, the acrylic designed
for sheet-vinyl floors, but this may not be the best way to go,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Burkhart of Wichita, Kan., found a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' she wrote, ``I tried numerous products to make it
(quarry tile) shine, including Future, which you suggested using.
It does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally called a janitorial supply company, and purchased a
product called Plaza, sold by S.C. Johnson Professional (Johnson
wax). I have used it for four or five years. I wax once a year, and
usually put two coats on. My floor stays shiny the entire year. It
is easy to use, dries to a hard finish, and doesn't scratch easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The directions state, `The product can also be used on
terrazzo, brick, slate, unglazed ceramic, and Mexican tile.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not work for Johnson wax. I am a housekeeper who likes
shiny floors. I found something that works. I thought you might be
interested since it's cheaper than having quarry tile glazed or
having the tile removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Sheryl. I certainly am interested, and so are a lot
of other owners of quarry tile floors who want to keep them shiny.

BUSHNELL'S IRRESISTIBLE `4 BLONDES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALYSSA HAYWOODE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
``4 Blondes'' 
By Candace Bushnell 
Atlantic Monthly Press, 246 pp., $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Candace Bushnell is back in fine, blunt form. The author of the
book-turned-hip-television-show ``Sex and the City'' has a new book
out enticingly titled ``4 Blondes.'' Fans, in other words, will get
what they love, the literary dirt on characters who are so
maniacally self-absorbed they're appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The September release seems an odd choice for this book since
it's perfect summer reading _ especially for those who like their
summers to be complicated and catty.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four blondes gets a story of her own that between
them cover sex, drugs (prescription and otherwise), summer homes in
the Hamptons, bad marriages, odd affairs, and raw ambition (sexual
and otherwise). Expensive clothes get plenty of attention: there's
a beaded ivory bustier; a Dolce &AMP; Gabanna coat with a cranberry fur
collar; and shoe shopping at Barney's, Bergdorf's, and Saks, a hunt
that ends with the purchase of a $500 pair of Manolo Blahnik
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   In the first story, ``Nice N' Easy,'' Janey Wilcox, ``enough of
a model to become a lukewarm celebrity,'' knows the secret of
dating rich men, two-thirds of which has to do with being
entertaining company and having no hopes of marriage. True to its
ribald spirit, the book graphically describes the sexual
requirements of the other third.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with the glitzy surfaces is impressive depth. Situations
and images softly echo F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby.''
Parties and desires are both glimmering and raucous. Social status
is as brutally important as oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   There are also wisps of Edith Wharton's ``The House of Mirth.''
If Wharton's single, financially strapped character, Lily Bart,
stepped into the year 2000, Bushnell seems to be whispering between
the lines of this book, she could easily be facing the same
pressing need to find a husband of means fast. One man advises
Janey to go to London and find a ``titled Englishman'' to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lily, Janey is no victim. She plays the game with her
cynical eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart and a model. What could be better?'' one man asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumb and a model. The way most men like them,'' Janey says.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no thinly veiled treatises on gender relations
here. What makes the book good is that it's all about the messy
clash of bad ideas, greedy expectations, and power. While readers
love some characters for their nobility, these characters are
attractive because of their huge, human flaws. They know about such
practical alternatives as law school or accounting, but they're in
blind pursuit of glamour _ no matter how misguided this may be.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly striking is the third story, ``Snow Angels,'' which
announces itself as a fictional spin on Princess Diana. A friend of
Cecelia Kelly, princess by marriage of Luxembourg, wants to turn
her into ``America's very own Princess Di,'' blithely brushing
aside the tragic end of Diana's story.
</P>
<P>
   This princess goes through her own version of hell, upset by,
among many things, her distant husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really did believe, when we first got married, that we would
talk about everything honestly but the opposite has occurred: We're
like two people on separate islands with only tin cans and string
as a means of communication.'' And there's ``that photograph in
STAR and the accompanying article that accuses me of being an
anorexic, which I'm NOT, but what I am is so complicated that I
can't begin to explain it to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bushnell mercifully and compelling gives Cecelia is a
``best friend,'' Dianna Moon, who may have killed her husband, and
a narrative that ultimately pulls free, taking a different road
than Princess Diana's story.
</P>
<P>
   To match the frenetic nature of its characters, the book is also
relentlessly up to date. Parties are thrown for Internet sites.
Frank Sinatra is dead. Someone is going to be the next Brad Pitt.
There is a reference to the recent Bruce Willis movie, ``The Sixth
Sense.'' The details create a sharp sense of fragility. They are an
indirect reminder that one day there will be readers wondering who
Sinatra was. It may be that these stories will come to seem
old-fashioned _ except for the realization of how some plots keep
repeating themselves _ much to our delight and consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Life could be a breeze, this book seductively whispers, only in
entertaining fiction it never is.

CH. 5 AND DR. LAURA; A BUSH DIVIDEND? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the deadline for Dr. Laura Schlessinger's national TV debut
at T minus four days and counting, WCVB-TV's refusal thus far to
commit to the program has thrust the Boston station into a national
controversy that is testing the political and economic clout of the
gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in a conference call with journalists, a group of
gay-rights activists _ citing the pullout of a number of major
advertisers from her radio show _ claimed the talk-show host's
attitude toward homosexuality is affecting the bottom line. (The
activists acknowledge they don't have much information about
advertisers for the TV show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She has really lost millions of dollars in ad revenue because
of her antigay statements,'' said Rhona Berenstein, vice president
of Online Partners/gay.com. ``Being associated with Dr. Laura is
just bad business.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Schubert, the chairman of gfn.com (Gay Financial Network
Inc.), asserted that gay-community protests against Schlessinger
are having an economic impact on companies ``because they don't
want to alienate a market that is clearly very attractive to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, protests are now planned in 27 cities to coincide
with the Monday rollout of Schlessinger's syndicated show.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves WCVB (Channel 5) perched conspicuously on
the fence. Station officials have been waiting to view a tape they
requested from the show's producer, Paramount, before making up
their minds. But it's safe to say that a decision not to air the
show would not only be a loud political statement, it would
surprise the anti-Schlessinger activists.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Tyler, a national protest leader and cofounder of the
StopDrLaura.com Web site, said Wednesday that she was under the
impression that Channel 5 had ``decided to air'' the program,
adding that stations are ``fairly scared to break ranks'' on the
issue. ``We're not naive about this,'' added Cathy Renna, a
spokeswoman for the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
``We're working on the assumption that all the stations are going
to air the show on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, however, Channel 5 officials said they'd made
no decision on the fate of ``Dr. Laura.'' They are expected to
announce one this week.

   Like running for president, George W. Bush's unflattering
anatomical reference to The New York Times's Adam Clymer is part of
a family heritage. It was at a memorable 1988 campaign rally in
Indiana that the George Bush-Dan Quayle ticket turned the tables on
journalists who were aggressively questioning Quayle about his
military record. When the crowd heard the questions through the PA
system, they loudly and angrily turned on the reporters,
particularly Ellen Hume of The Wall Street Journal. And in the 1992
campaign, Bush actually adopted the slogan ``Annoy the media,
reelect George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Former network newsman and media analyst Marvin Kalb thinks
George W.'s remarks will find some receptive ears. ``For those
people who don't like the press, who don't like The New York Times,
who don't like reporters whose first name is Adam, it's probably a
good thing he said it,'' says Kalb.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings Institution analyst Stephen Hess goes further,
suggesting Bush's insulting Clymer may even be popular among the
media. ``It does a couple of things,'' he says. ``It's the elitist
press. It's The New York Times. This is something that's probably
cheered in newsrooms across the country.''
</P>
<P>

   Is subtle and not so subtle racism still a way of life on
television news? Yes, according to a new guidebook on TV journalism
written by former ABC News vice president Av Westin, funded by the
Freedom Forum, and based on the observations of nearly 200
electronic journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In a jarring chapter labeled ``Bias'' Westin quotes some of
those journalists, anonymously, confessing to some damning
realities. ``My bosses have essentially made it clear: `We do not
feature black people,' '' says one. ``A story involving blacks
takes longer to get approved,'' says another. ``And if it is
approved, chances are that it will sit on the shelf a long time
before it gets on the air. No one ever says anything. The message
gets through.'' Another admits that in a lot of his network's file
footage showing arrests, ``all the `perps' are black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was most disheartening,'' Westin added in an
interview. ``I hadn't realized the degree to which race was an
issue in not scheduling stories or making them sit on the shelves.
It's a dirty little secret.''
</P>
<P>

   Metro columnist Leonard Greene's return to the Boston Herald was
brief. After only a few weeks in his old post, Greene _ one of a
handful of African-Americans at the tabloid _ departed in late
August. Managing editor Andrew Gully says Greene, who'd been living
in New York, had problems with lifestyle logistics, and that ``it
was difficult in the end to juggle his home life in New York and
his job up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who could not be reached for comment, signed on to write
twice-monthly op-ed columns for the Herald; his exit poses another
diversity problem for the paper. ``It's pretty darn hard to walk
out there and just decide you're going to find a minority
columnist,'' says Gully. ``Are we looking? Yeah. Do we have an
answer? No.''

CORVETTE C5: SPEED, STABILITY WITHOUT THE SHAKE OR STIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The family names Ford, Harley, and Davidson are familiar to all
of us. After all, they are linked to enduring symbols of American
auto culture: the Model T (and the method of its production) and
the Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say Zora-Arkus Duntov? Designer of the Duntov? No. Try
performance-schooled engineer with a bent for racing. He gave us
none other than the Corvette, back in 1955 _ a true American sports
car with the fabled short-block engine.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Vette stands with the ``T'' and the Harley because of its
seamless lineage as a sports car. The Thunderbird might have made
this list had it not become long, bloated, and four-doored in ugly
times of transition. Ford is bringing back the Thunderbird, looking
much like it did in its glory days, and that is a wonderful and
anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corvette needs no bringing back. It has rocked steady
down the decades.
</P>
<P>
   So with the promise of soon getting behind the wheel of the 2001
Z06 Corvette _ a beast of a coupe with nearly 400 horsepower _ we
took the latest generation, a 2000 C5 roadster out for a week of
testing for pre-comparison.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the shuddering, hold-on-in-the-corners Corvette of
old. Powered by a 5.7-liter V8 that cranks out 345 horsepower and a
whopping 350 lb.-ft. of torque, its got a rigid construction and a
suspension that withstands what all that power can do to a hurtling
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   But first you need to be securely anchored inside. The long,
low, narrow seats hold you like you are Velcroed to them. They are
so firm at the thigh, with great lateral support on the outside of
the legs and up from waist to shoulders, you feel as if you are
wearing your seat. You may feel as if you've worked a bit to crawl
into them, but once there, the whole inside of the car feels
spacious.
</P>
<P>
   It's got an airplane cockpit feel that is enhanced by the
electronic digital display that pops onto the windshield just above
the dashboard behind the wheel. Roaring straight ahead, it is easy
to keep track of RPMs, speed, and your fuel level.
</P>
<P>
   The C5, introduced in 1997, is the stiffest 'Vette yet. It's got
a strong perimeter frame but its key is a molded center spine
running cockpit to rear that is literally the car's backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Damping this stiffness so you don't get shaken and stirred on
bumps and in corners is a double wishbone suspension system mated
with really big stabilizer bars. The result is minimal lean in
corners, straight ahead acceleration stability, and a sense that
your spine is being pushed firmly back into the seat during hard
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you pay a bit of a price for stiff stability: there
is a slight corner-to-corner vibration noticeable when you
accelerate through sharp turns on less-than-smooth roads, and even
creased highways give the car a slight tremble. But it's also a
price worth paying for the overall stability in a car with this
much power.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the suspension in keeping it all under control are ABS,
traction control, and an active handling system. In addition, the
power steering is a variable assist unit that changes touch as it
senses speed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's a very stable package (turn it off and you're on
your own in this rear-wheel-drive rocket and that's another
adventure), though I found the active handling system, which cuts
power to wheels when it senses trouble, a bit disconcerting at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Though I almost always prefer standard transmissions, especially
in performance cars, the 4-speed automatic in this test model did a
fine job of popping from gear to gear even as it let the engine do
what I wanted it to do.
</P>
<P>
   And the torque the C5 produces is something you feel from gas
pedal (when you depress it) to the back of your head (as it gets
pushed against the seat during acceleration).
</P>
<P>
   I got 20.7 miles per gallon _ a remarkable figure, I thought _
in a week of less-than-gentle driving.
</P>
<P>
   With its big engine, calculated rumble, and convertible top, the
Corvette is not a quiet car. You can't conduct cell phone business
in it while whisking down the road, but you shouldn't be on the
phone when you're driving this car anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The only ojectionable noise, and I found the body and
appointments to be remarkably squeak-free for a rigid convertible,
came from the hinges in the convertible top when the top was down.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of that top, it may be the easiest-to-use manual
convertible I've encountered. It takes seconds of easy effort to
lower and raise.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Corvette, with optional heads-up display, those great
power leather seats, dual-zone air conditioning, and other
performance goodies, breaks the $50,000 mark, but that puts it in a
unique niche. It's more powerful than almost any other car at that
price _ picking between the 'Vette and a Boxster S, say, is really
a choice of style rather than function.
</P>
<P>
   To match its oomph, you'd have to jump up into the $70,000
range, a jump that may send lots of folks scampering to their Chevy
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The slots behind the seats that extend all the way back into
the high-floored trunk. Great, accessible storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --No one else is building an American competitor as yet, and I
love comparison shopping.

&HT;     GEOLOGISTS SAY FAULT BEHIND NAPA QUAKE MAY NEVER BE FOUND

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The gentle-looking hills of Northern California
may forever hide the identity the previously unknown earthquake
fault that shook Napa County last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have yet to identify the exact location of the fault,
and may never be able to if it is buried miles beneath the surface,
William Ellsworth, of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
told an earthquake conference at Stanford University on Wednesday.
``The fault may not come to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 5.2-magnitude quake, which struck near Yountville,
caused more than 70 injuries, mostly minor, and at least $15
million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of those shaken awake was geologist David Jackson, who was
visiting Napa County at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the strongest shaking I felt in my life,'' said
Jackson, science director of the Southern California Earthquake
Center in Los Angeles. He spoke during an interview on the opening
day of the three-day ``Third Conference on Tectonic Problems of the
San Andreas Fault System.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, which was scheduled before Sunday's quake,
attracted about 50 seismic authorities. They reported their latest
findings and ideas about how the San Andreas Fault generates
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Across California, ``there are so many little faults that we
don't know about,'' including the buried ones, Jackson said.
``There will never be a time when we will have a complete catalog
of faults.''
</P>
<P>
   California is like a pane of cracked glass, a state rippling
with seismic faults. Some are visible on the surface in the form of
long gashes or deformed terrain, such as valleys or elongated
ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Other faults are buried miles underground. These include both
the ``buried thrust'' faults that move up and down, like the
previously unknown one that triggered the damaging Northridge quake
of 1994, and the ``strike-slip'' fault beneath Napa County hit
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A strike-slip fault is one in which two slabs of crust move
horizontally past each other. The nation's most famous strike-slip
fault is the San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   The San Andreas, which stretches from the Southern California
desert to far Northern California, separates two giant, slow-moving
slabs of terrestrial crust called the Pacific and North American
plates.

FUEL TANKER SUIT PROMPTS CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As an immigrant from El Salvador, Rodolfo Arevalo
learned English, raised three children with his childhood
sweetheart, and landed a succession of jobs in sweatshops, textile
mills, and a shoe factory before deciding that trucking would offer
him the best chance at a good living.
</P>
<P>
   His family threw a small celebration the day he earned his
trucking license. But after a short time driving, he found a
better-paying, steadier job as a technician at the Exxon
fuel-loading facility in Everett, just outside Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, 12 days before Christmas in 1993, that Arevalo's
American dream ended. While loading a tanker truck with heating
oil, a bubble of compressed air exploded out of the nozzle. The
recoil effect sent the loading arm crashing into his chest,
catapulting Arevalo off the tanker onto a concrete floor 12 feet
below. The fall fractured his skull and caused massive brain
trauma. He died a few days later at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the family settled with the company that insured the
Boston engineering firm that had repaired the fuel-loading system
the day of the accident. The $7 million settlement is believed to
be one of the largest ever in a workplace accident in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The case also prompted the oil giant to install safety equipment
for the first time in hundreds of similar facilities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this case shows that the civil justice system can do a
whole lot better job policing big business than the public sector
does,'' the family's lawyer, Douglas Sheff of Boston, said last
week. ``In a way, it's kind of a David and Goliath story. To some
folks, they may seem powerless. But this shows that an Arevalo
family can be on the same playing field with large entities like
Exxon.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, protected from a large-damage award by the state's
workers' compensation laws, was not a party in the suit. Instead,
Sheff said, the family sued Boston-based Fraser Engineering, the
company that had made repairs to the fuel-loading system earlier on
the day that Arevalo was fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser engineers had failed to close a key valve in the system
before repairing it, allowing air to get inside, an expert hired by
the Arevalo family said. Once repressurized, the fuel system
compressed the bubble like air in a scuba tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds of
force,'' said William Dobson, a mechanical and materials engineer
with Binary Engineering Associates, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Dore Hunter, an attorney for Fraser Engineering, said the
accident was the ``unfortunate'' result of miscommunication between
the Fraser and Exxon engineers, but one that resulted in positive
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing,''
Hunter said. ``But they (Exxon) got off their duff and did
something and they did so long before litigation was filed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheff said his research found that it was not uncommon for air
to leak into pressurized systems used to top-load liquids into
tanker trucks. He said similar incidents elsewhere had resulted in
injuries and at least one death.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper safety equipment, however, the compressed air
bubbles are usually not a major problem, Sheff said. Companies can
install ``high-point vents'' that automatically release the air
when it reaches the highest pipe in the system, ``t-diffusers'' at
the nozzle to vent the explosive force sideways, and tie-downs that
anchor the fuel-loading arm to the truck and keep it from recoiling
back toward the operator.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have also installed fall-protection grates to
ensure that if workers get knocked off trucks they don't fall all
the way to the ground, Sheff said. The grates are one of several
safety measures that have now been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment,
but in a deposition filed in the case, a company operations
supervisor said similar changes had been ordered throughout Exxon's
US facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be credited for it,'' Sheff said. ``I am not
trying to slam Exxon. Sometimes it takes a lawsuit to get them
moving on something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the family's engineering expert called it surprising that
safety measures weren't installed earlier, particularly given their
low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking less than $100 for a t-fitting on a pipe. There
is no reason that I can see why it isn't done more often,'' Dobson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such safety equipment is not required by law and the federal
government does not keep statistics on accidents specifically
related to fuel-loading arms, trucking safety experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the US Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said they track the number of ``falls'' at the
thousands of fuel-loading facilities across the country, but no
distinction is made between a worker knocked off a truck and one
who slips on a stray patch of oil on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Transportation, meanwhile, stopped
collecting data on trucking-related falls and accidents in the
1990s during a government-wide drive to reduce paperwork, said
Cliff Harvison, president of the National Tank Truck Carriers
Association in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In general, experts say, tanker truck drivers and loaders do not
face above-average danger on the job compared to other workers,
although accidents are more common in the Northeast because the
region has a higher proportion of homes heated with oil and
operators have to work on top of snow- and ice-covered trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Harvison said, fuel-truck loading is becoming generally
less hazardous due to advances in technology. Many newer trucks are
now loaded from a pipe located on the bottom of the tank, rather
than through a hatch on the top, allowing the operator to stand
safely on the ground.

PATRIOTS CHECK BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If the Patriots win the Super Bowl this
season, it certainly won't be because they bought their title.
</P>
<P>
   According to union and NFL sources, the Patriots have the
second-lowest payroll, behind only the traditionally cheap Arizona
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, like all NFL teams, are relatively close to the
$62.7 million salary cap. But the dollars spent on payroll are
actual dollars the Patriots are putting toward salaries this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' outlay of $54.29 million is 3.8 percent less than
last season. But they are competing in a division with the Bills
(seventh, $70.657 million), Dolphins (eighth, $70.29 million), Jets
(10th, $69.08 million); the Colts are 16th. Their payrolls have
jumped dramatically: Colts (42 percent), Jets (39.4), Dolphins
(33.2), and Bills (32.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins lead the league, spending more than $87
million on payroll.
</P>
<P>
   On the Patriots, low-priced players are starting at running
back, tight end, defensive back, and on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you of this, the Krafts do everything they can to
put the best possible talent on the field,'' said Patriots chief
operating officer Andy Wasynczuk. ``You have to understand that we
did some of our bigger deals last year and the year before, where
some teams like Washington spent a lot of money on their big deals
this year. That drives the cost of the payroll figure up. We have
those deals in place, but we're still paying the prorated signing
bonus on those deals against the salary cap. Four years ago, we had
young players who weren't making a lot of money. They were
successful and suddenly we have to pay out free agent dollars to
keep them here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who are expecting to play at CMGI Field by 2002 (a
deal that puts almost $8 million a year in their vaults), may also
be gearing up for big deals for Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn, both
of whom will enter the final years of their contracts next season.
Contract talks are ongoing with both players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say something is imminent with Drew, but we
intend to keep him here for many years to come,'' said Wasynczuk.
``We've been having ongoing discussions and at some point we'll
reach fruition with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Terry's agent (Jim Gould) a few times and Terry
still has another year left. We're aware of the impact player he is
and our need to tie him up as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offseason was strangely quiet this year, with new
head man Bill Belichick signing mostly minimum-salaried veteran
free agents. The Patriots did have salary-cap considerations
because of huge signing bonuses given to core players, forcing them
to part with a few veterans who would have improved their depth.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe carries a salary-cap number of $8.6 million, one of the
largest in the league. As a result, the team dumped four of its
draft picks and issued incentive-laden contracts whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   When it came down to paring the roster, Belichick cut veterans
Vincent Brisby and Chris Carter and kept lower-salaried players in
their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to model the San Francisco 49ers where you have
to go in the tank for a few years after years of overspending,''
said Wasynczuk. ``We want to assure our fans that we'll be a
competitive team year after year. What we need to do is develop our
young players so they can complement our older, higher-salaried
players. That's the model we're trying to build here.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to strengthen the offensive line, the Patriots
signed Grant Williams (two years, $2.1 million with a $975,000
signing bonus) and Lance Scott (on injured reserve). They also
drafted Adrian Klemm, who hasn't played a down after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   They also dumped Ben Coates and his $2.5 million salary in favor
of Eric Bjornson (and his minimum salary) and former draft pick Rod
Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots went to the Super Bowl in 1996, they didn't
have a lot of high-priced players, except for Bledsoe. In the years
that followed, Chris Slade, Willie McGinest, Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy,
Ted Johnson, Max Lane, Todd Rucci, Bruce Armstrong, and Coates all
became wealthy men while driving up the cap numbers. Two years ago,
the Patriots had the third-highest payroll, spending more than $72
million between signing bonuses and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year is going to be difficult in terms of staying under
the cap, but I think we're going to be in a positive position to do
things in free agency next year,'' said Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   There's 15 games to go before any of those decisions have to be
made. The Patriots are not a cheap organization, rather one that is
paying a steep price for not developing draft picks who can play at
a high level. The organization is trying to do that now, but the
price may be a rebuilding year or two.

   WASHINGTON _ Sports buffs in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin
America will soon be watching the Olympic Games live from Sydney on
their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, most fans will be fed only
tape-delayed coverage, sometimes a day after actual events occur.
Only Americans who live near the Canadian border or who own
mega-satellite dishes may escape the real-time ban.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are at work here. One is the $3.5 billion that NBC
paid for the exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the Games through
2008. The other is the 15-hour time difference between Sydney and
the Eastern time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you're thinking of jumping the bar on as-it-happens
Olympic reporting by watching via a Webcast? You don't need to live
in China to know that the Internet can leap across national
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, as the Games unfold, lots of Web sites _ including
the official one, Olympics.com _ will offer results, schedules and
background data. But they have all been shut out of video streaming
coverage of the events.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the chance that videotaping enthusiasts working
from overseas or folks who bring a digital camera into
the110,000-seat Olympic Stadium will beam unofficial Webcasts. The
Internet isn't known for bowing easily to rulemakers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that threat, International Olympic Committee, the
beneficiary of those NBC billions, will field a special team to
scan cyberspace for pirated material.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is free to use its own Web site to show the Games, in the
same way that it could forgo heartwarming ``Today'' show blather
from Australia to show some actual events as they happen in (local)
prime-time. But it has no plans to so.
</P>
<P>
   Says Gary Zenkel, who heads the marketing of NBC's Sydney
coverage: ``Right now, the Olympics garners a premium in both
rights fees and ad buys because it is able to attract and sustain
an enormous TV audience. Until that audience and those advertising
dollars are diverted to other (media) platforms, we will not in any
way compromise the value of the exclusivity of TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outright Internet ban also delays any such diversion in
favor of tightly produced Olympics, built around mostly U.S.
athletes with star potential.
</P>
<P>
   There's bound to come a time, however, when modern technology
and ancient avarice converge to let the dot-coms into the Games _
although, if the NBC brass has it way, that time may be a long time
in coming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the British Broadcasting Corp. first instituted the
idea of media rights fees for the equivalent of $3,000. (The
British organizers never cashed their check.)
</P>
<P>
   The first live TV feed came eight years later at the Winter
Games in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. On that occasion, Olympic honcho
Avery Brundage sniffed: ``We ... have done well without TV for 60
years and will do so certainly for the next 60 years, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Come December, the world's top Olympicrats will hold a summit in
their Swiss lair to figure out where ever-expanding cyberspace fits
into what they like to call the ``People's Games.'' But you won't
find a Webcast of that meeting on the Internet either.

favor of tightly produced Olympics, built around mostly U.S.
athletes with star potential.
</P>
<P>
   There's bound to come a time, however, when modern technology
and ancient avarice converge to let the dot-coms into the Games _
although, if the NBC brass has it way, that time may be a long time
in coming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the British Broadcasting Corp. first instituted the
idea of media rights fees for the equivalent of $3,000. (The
British organizers never cashed their check.)
</P>
<P>
   The first live TV feed came eight years later at the Winter
Games in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. On that occasion, Olympic honcho
Avery Brundage sniffed: ``We ... have done well without TV for 60
years and will do so certainly for the next 60 years, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Come December, the world's top Olympicrats will hold a summit in
their Swiss lair to figure out where ever-expanding cyberspace fits
into what they like to call the ``People's Games.'' But you won't
find a Webcast of that meeting on the Internet either.

 &HT;    REFORM GROUP CALLS FOR TOUGHER PIPELINE SAFETY LAWS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing the fate of 12 New Mexico campers who died
last month in a natural gas pipeline explosion, a grassroots
coalition of environmentalists, safety advocates and local
officials pressed Congress on Thursday to pass stalled pipeline
safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of interstate pipeline releases are preventable
because they are caused by such factors as corrosion, material
defects or employee errors,'' said Lois Epstein, a member of the
National Pipeline Reform Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipeline tragedies like the one last month in New Mexico are
inevitable unless Congress ensures that the deficiencies in
standards and enforcement are immediately remedied,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition contends that the approximately 1.2 million miles
of pipelines through which natural gas and such hazardous liquids
as gasoline and crude oil are transported are inadequately
maintained. They accuse the federal Office of Pipeline Safety of
following a pro-industry bias in its regulatory activity.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in front of the Capitol,
representatives of the coalition said the deaths of 12 members of
three New Mexico families on a camping trip Aug. 19 could have been
prevented by more rigorous federal regulation of the pipeline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The campers, including five children, died when a natural gas
pipeline operated by El Paso Natural Gas Co. broke and exploded
near Carlsbad, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, an engineer with the national environmental
organization, Environmental Defense, also released copies of a new
coalition booklet, ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind No More ...,''
containing pipeline safety statistics and accounts of recent
failures.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, the Senate was considering a
pipeline safety act that was introduced following the deaths of two
10-year-old boys and a teenager in a gasoline pipeline explosion in
Bellingham, Wash., last year.
</P>
<P>
   But to Frank King, father of one of the boys, the Senate bill
does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that is going to protect your safety in that
bill,'' King declared. ``I give it a 2 on a scale of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Millyn(cq) Dolphin, a burns nurse, described in gruesome detail
the death of a 5-year-old girl for whom she cared during a futile,
55-minute flight from the New Mexico blast site to the University
Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this did not have to happen,'' Dolphin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline safety advocates want a law passed that would increase
penalties for pipeline failures, allow citizens to file suits to
force regulatory action, require safety devices and improved
inspection procedures and strengthen the authority of states to
regulate pipelines.

   RODMAN'S WORLD: The Worm is turning again, this time to the
Internet in a ``Big Brother-''like way. Former NBA great Dennis
Rodman has launched RodmanTV.com, a subscription-based portal (you
pay the $29.95 a month, not Rodman) offering 24/7 looks into his
Newport Beach home thanks to eight cameras offering ``live,
unedited and uncensored'' takes. (It sounds like ``Big Brother''
and Rodman changes his hair color as often as just-banished BB'er
Brittany). Another reality-TV twist: planned coverage of ``Rodman's
Road Rage,'' an MTV ``Road Rules'' knockoff?

 &HT;    INTERNET COMING OF AGE IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican strategists concur that
in the not-so-distant future presidential debates will be staged on
the World Wide Web, perhaps with online voters posing questions to
the White House contestants.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 race, Al Gore and George Bush have yet to agree
on ground rules for the traditional televised debates, let alone
deal with the uncharted risks of political combat in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vice president and the Texas governor have
fully integrated the Internet into their campaigns. Each side has
thoroughly revamped its Web site for the general election contest,
with results that are far removed from the novelty items of the
not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Internet assumes a dynamic role in their quest for
the presidency, their divergent Internet strategies have sparked a
lively debate on which of them makes the best use of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struck by the way the two redesigns reflect what each of
the campaigns chooses to emphasize,'' Tucker Eskew, senior
communications adviser for the Bush campaign, said in a telephone
interview from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site,'' he added, ``allows for much more intense
personalization, while the Gore site emphasizes the ability to
create (linked) interest group Web sites. Philosophically, Bush
focuses on the individual while the vice president's approach is
mired more in an interest-group style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our Internet site to rally our supporters and get
our message out aggressively. They don't do that,'' countered Ben
Green, a veteran political webmaster who has served as Gore's
director of Internet operations since last February.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Nashville, where he sometimes
appears on an always-on office webcam, Green asserted that ``one of
the clearest differences between our site and their site is that on
ours ... you can see the campaign actually as it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web address for Gore is: www.algore.com. The Web address for
Bush is: www.georgewbush.com
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims credit for having scored some notable firsts in
their online duel. Still, visitors to the Gore and Bush sites are
more likely to be struck by how similar they are in their basic
purpose, if not in their individual personality.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns make extensive use of powerful search engines
that are able to find archived issues papers, campaign speeches and
press releases on virtually every topic that has been in the news _
and quite a few that have not.
</P>
<P>
   They also let users customize the Web sites to reflect their
home state, their choice of English or Spanish, and a long laundry
list of specific interests. Both sites adhere to a rigorous privacy
code. Gore and Bush send a ``personalized'' electronic thank you
note to anyone who signs up.
</P>
<P>
   Each site also pushes the digital envelope into the broadband
future by offering extensive audio and video materials. Bush posts
all his campaign ads, including a 30-second spot a supposed
``first'' devoted exclusively to plugging his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush response to the unique Gore webcam is a ``daily trivia
contest.'' If they answer correctly, visitors can win a Bush coffee
mug.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: The Bush campaign shuns online donations while
the Gore site actively solicits contributions for a ``General
Election Legal &AMP; Accounting Compliance Fund.'' That reflects a
legal loophole in the campaign laws. Otherwise, the campaigns are
now limited to spending $68 million apiece in taxpayer subsidies
which must also cover the cost of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have so far posted only one of their campaign ads.
But they seem to be ahead in the video streaming race by featuring
frequent ``live'' appearances of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joe Lieberman, on the campaign trail. The Bush site counters with a
link to CNN.com, where viewers can watch ``live'' Bush coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps license vendors to sell campaign-related materials
online, beyond the usual buttons and balloons. Goregear.com, for
example, offers $55 rolls of ``Gay &AMP; Lesbian Outreach Lapel
Stickers,'' an item not to be found at georgewbushstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP outlet advertises, at $32.40 a case, 16-ounce plastic
bottles of ``George W. Bush Drinking Water,'' which is said to
``come naturally from underground springs in the heart of
Kentucky's famous Blue Grass region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a leading Web site traffic tracking
service, for the week that ended Aug. 19, the official Bush site
attracted 193,000 unique visitors while Gore's attracted 175,000.
Each campaign also currently sends targeted e-mail updates to more
than 200,000 people who have signed up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns continue to devise more strategies to lure even
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eskew and Green envision the day when the Internet will
assume a leading role in interactive presidential debates. One
possibility: Users could review an extensive list of issues and
rank those that concern them the most. The candidates would then be
obliged to respond according to these ``votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   Green, Gore's cyberspace guru, noted that ``when Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are on the campaign trail, the Web site address is on the
podium. So it gets into the local news shots ... and on the
politics page of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers accuse the Gore camp of copying its new supersite,
which went up first. Said Eskew: ``They followed our lead. We can
cite many examples of Gore following Bush's lead with pale
imitations, such as Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush site is still in seeming need of some tweaks. A
recent ``personalized'' request on ``MyGeorgeW'' for Bush's views
turned up an apologetic ``sorry, we found nothing'' on Bush's own
list of topics for such subjects as antitrust, biotechnology,
defense modernization, uninsured health care, e-commerce, Medicare,
prescription drugs, the Vietnam war and the Balkans. On the other
hand, ``your interest in Social Security'' yielded links to 98 Bush
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor clearly has extensive views on all those
(unreferenced) matters,'' Eskew said. ``We're going to have to fix
that.''

 &HT;    VH1.com, MTV.com worth the wait _ plus, they're legal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In some twisted way, we all have Napster to thank for
a new spate of music Web sites from a variety of major media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Napster, a peer-to-peer music file sharing program, may
have raised many legitimate questions regarding copyrights and fair
use of music on the Net, the 20 million-plus user base has shown
there is an appetite for online music, news and concert information
from the tiniest teenybopper to the baldest boomer.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, this interesting bit of information was not lost on
MTV and VH1, two of the most popular music brands online or
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago we were bashing MTV for being five minutes late
to the party when it came to having a coherent Web strategy, and up
until very, very recently, that's been true. But somewhere at MTV,
the interactive light bulb finally went on. In fact, enough light
bulbs seem to have gone on over at MTV and VH1 to light up Times
Square, site of the company's corporate headquarters. The new VH1
Web site and the new site for MTV's white-hot hit ``Total Request
Live'' make listening to online music legally fun again.
</P>
<P>
   The new VH1 Web site (www.VH1.com) is a special treat for music
lovers of all ages _ and especially for that strange group in the
middle recently dubbed ``aging GenXers'' by Rolling Stone magazine.
(Memo to Douglas Coupland, author of the book that gave this group
its moniker: Where's our midlife crisis novel? It's clearly
overdue.)
</P>
<P>
   These aging GenXers, who range in age from about 25 to 39, have
been a forgotten group when it comes to online music, yet we are
out there in great numbers. The same Rolling Stone article that
declared Xers officially over the hill also complained they are
``clogging up'' Napster, presumably with all those REM, Talking
Heads, Barenaked Ladies and Sonic Youth files.
</P>
<P>
   So it's especially nice that VH1 has decided to target the GenX
demographic with its new Web site. Go directly to the ``Sound and
Vision,'' and you'll be treated to a variety of audio and video
clips from artists you've heard of (Madonna, the Clash and, yes,
even Spinal Tap) and a few you may have heard of (Shelby Lynne,
Kenny Wayne Shepard, Julianna Hatfield).
</P>
<P>
   There are also picks of the day from spoken-word artists and
comedy albums. The news section features interviews and articles on
artists as diverse as Brit Pop sensations Elastica to a new book
about John Lennon. VH1.com is a well-edited collection of new and
familiar music that should appeal to music lovers who want to
expand their horizons but also keep up with old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   While aging Xers clog up VH1.com, younger fans will want to
bookmark MTV's new site, which is miles ahead of anything they've
tried to do in the past. MTV.com may be able to take home the
trophy for most unsuccessful redesigns, but this time it looks like
they just about got it right.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the site would be pretty close to perfect if it were
easier to get to the extensive Web site for ``Total Request Live.''
For now, fans of this 21st century of ``American Bandstand'' will
have to head over to the pull-down menu for ``shows'' and click on
``TRL.'' But it's worth the journey.
</P>
<P>
   MTV makes it easy for fans to vote for their favorite videos and
possibly win a trip for you and a friend to go to a ``TRL'' taping
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as popular as the videos is show host Carson Daly. For
those of you unfamiliar with the show, Daly is well on his way to
becoming this generation's hipper, cuter and just as overexposed
version of Dick Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can check out ``Carson's Corner'' and read his bio, or
click on a variety of pictures that will make excellent wallpaper
on any teen's computer monitor. And if pictures are your thing,
check out the ``TRL'' photo booth with new pictures of frequent
guests of the show including Jennifer Lopez, Method Man, Alanis
Morisette and Beck. The 'N Sync photos are pretty cute, too.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of ``Total Request Live'' also know their viewers
on and offline like to interact with the celebrities and rock stars
on the show as well as pick their favorite videos. There are plenty
of opportunities to do that here, from chat rooms to a place to ask
questions about MTV and ``TRL'' that are answered in an FAQ
section.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, if you'd like to download music from the MTV site,
you need to go to the ``Xtra section'' _ again more work than we'd
like. The selection is short but worth it, if you're into new
music.
</P>
<P>
   The only complaint we have with VH1.com and MTV.com is that the
navigation of each site is kind of clunky, but the content you'll
find here is worth the minor inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   What vaudeville comic Will Rogers once said about New England
weather also seems to apply to the Web sites from MTV and VH1: ``If
you don't like it, just wait a minute.'' For music fans, these two
sites were definitely worth the wait.

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ This summer, Microsoft executives have been
coyly popping a videotape into a VCR here and showing visitors the
Computer Age equivalent of the blinding power of a race car
dragster on nitro fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The tape reveals a photo-realistic schoolroom where an invisible
hand is poised to drop a table-tennis ball with an X on it. As it
falls, the viewer sees that it is about to land in a sea of 1,024
similar balls, each perched on a hair-trigger mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball hits, mayhem ensues; table-tennis balls _ each one
accurately shaded and shadowed _ explode in all directions,
bouncing and ricocheting in concert and then slowly coming to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Rendering such an image in what the digerati call ``real time,''
with all the computing done as the balls collide so that each
collision can be altered on the fly, is today beyond the ability of
all but the most powerful supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if all goes according to plan, Microsoft hopes to begin
selling a game computer with this kind of computing power for
around $300 in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, called Xbox, is both a technical tour de force by
the world's largest software publisher and a shot fired across the
bow of the giant Sony Corp., which now dominates the $20 billion
videogame industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is serving notice that it is intent upon extending its
reach from the office into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an immense gamble by a company that has vowed to
commit $500 million to elbow its way into a consumer electronics
market governed today by a business model that is anathema to most
of the strategies Microsoft has, until now, pursued in the personal
computer software business. Unlike the PC software business, which
allows some independence, the game industry is based on a model
that requires the payment of royalties by software developers to
device makers, a model that would require Microsoft to depend on
other companies to ensure the success of its product.
</P>
<P>
   Will Microsoft be able to move with impunity into one of the
world's most lucrative consumer electronics markets, or is this an
act of hubris, evidence that the software titan, in its desperate
push for growth, has finally overreached?
</P>
<P>
   While the company's specmanship has been greeted
enthusiastically by those involved with videogames, some analysts
are far from convinced that Microsoft will have an easy road in a
marketplace that is unfamiliar and that is already dominated by
Japanese consumer powerhouses like Sony, Nintendo and Sega
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about Sony's crown jewels,'' said Peter Sealey,
a professor of marketing at the Haas School of Business of the
University of California at Berkeley, where he also serves as
co-director of the Center for Marketing and Technology. ``Their
installed base is enormous and the kids are with them, and
Microsoft's greatest danger is in spreading itself too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand and demographics may well conspire against Microsoft.
Since July 1998, the penetration of videogame consoles in the
nation's homes has begun to decline, to 35 percent from 37 percent.
The reason, according to the San Francisco-based market research
firm Odyssey, is that the home PC is also increasingly a game
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Microsoft has largely eschewed hardware manufacturing,
preferring to let its hundreds of business partners take the risks
in a market that is known for razor-thin margins and brutal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Microsoft has long prided itself as being what it calls an
``open systems'' software developer. No licenses are required to
write software that is compatible with Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, in the videogame industry, software developers pay
fees to have their programs run on the manufacturer's game systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has little expertise in the world of the ``razors and
razor blades'' business model, in which game machines are sold
below cost and losses are made up from the profits on hit software
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the videogame business Microsoft will be
confronted by a hurdle its rivals know well, the same
``applications barrier to entry'' that the judge in the federal
antitrust case against Microsoft cited as being at the core of the
company's software monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables are turned. When Xbox is shipped next fall,
Microsoft is likely to have only a handful of programs to sell with
its machine _ perhaps 12 to 20 _ while Sony will have hundreds of
titles for it Playstation 2 machine, as well as the thousands of
older Playstation games that will also run on its second-generation
machine.
</P>
<P>
   All of those obstacles are things Microsoft says it has
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the games,'' said Robert Bach, the Microsoft
executive who is leading the development program. ``If you have
great games, you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach, who was previously the head of the company's Microsoft
Office business, now heads the company's game division. In a recent
interview on Microsoft's campus here, he said that in practical
terms his focus had increasingly been on making sure Xbox reaches
the market successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is counting on the fact that there is nothing
sacrosanct about Sony's lead in the videogame business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bach pointed out that the dominant videogame
manufacturer had shifted with each new generation going back as far
as the Atari Corp. two decades ago. As the videogame approaches the
next generation this year and next, there is no reason the lead
should not shift again.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more obstacle just over the horizon: Microsoft
is betting that unlike the personal computer, the videogame-player
market will remain a stable one. While PCs have increased in power
every year, the game platform market has generally remained
unchanged for as long as five years, giving consumer electronics
companies time to recoup their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sony, which has sold more than 73 million Playstations
worldwide and has more than 51 percent of the U.S. market, is
preparing to change the rules of the videogame business, according
to people familiar with the company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft is making its flashy demonstrations and
releasing specification sheets showing supercomputer performance
next year, Sony has been preparing its own multimillion-dollar
campaign for the October rollout of the Playstation 2, which will
sell for about the same price as Microsoft's entry.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the most powerful videogame player ever introduced,
yet it is also a harbinger that the pace of technological change in
the videogame business is likely to accelerate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft will take the performance lead in 2001, it will
be with a powerful machine and little software.
</P>
<P>
   Sony could then trump Microsoft with a faster machine in a year
or two that could spell trouble for the software publisher: If the
videogame business becomes more like the PC hardware industry,
Microsoft may find itself locked in a bitter war over profit
margins in which it lacks the comfortable software cushion it
enjoys in the PC business. Sony has not publicly acknowledged that
it plans to speed up the pace but it has quietly sent signals to
its developers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Sony has been engaging in its own game of
specmanship. This summer, what is almost certainly the world's
fastest graphics supercomputer could be found in a faded one-story
office building on a side street in Mountain View, Calif.,
birthplace of the semiconductor chip.
</P>
<P>
   The site's anonymity underscores the special significance of the
GS-Cube, a prototype Sony videogame computer that is being used by
a low-profile group of Silicon Valley programmers to aid a future
generation of game designers in creating software that is far more
lifelike than today's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sony used the new machine to offer demonstrations on par with
Microsoft's this year at the annual Siggraph computer graphics
exhibition in New Orleans. One had impact similar to the Xbox
table-tennis ball demonstration: a real-time rendition taken from
the Hollywood movie ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The GS-Cube is composed of 16 enhanced Sony Playstation 2
computers. When harnessed together they are capable of drawing more
than 200 million polygons a second. That speed is more than 16
times faster than today's Playstation and more than twice as fast
as a Silicon Graphics Reality Engine, a supercomputer that is the
most powerful commercial graphics machine.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly Sony will say only that the system is intended to blur
the line between the videogame world and digital entertainment in
Hollywood. Some developers, however, believe the machine could
become a commercial product as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is going for rapid change of the platform, while
Microsoft is new to the old world of the stable platform,'' said
Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bach acknowledges the difference in strategy. The PC business
has historically been a marketplace of incremental change, he said,
while the &QL; 
videogame has followed a more stable ``stair step'' evolution.
</P>
<P>
   It may also signify that Microsoft, which until now has been one
of the principal beneficiaries of Moore's Law _ the observation
about the exponential pace of change in the chip industry _ could
find that it has become the principal victim.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Microsoft will have to lose money on each Xbox it
makes, Michael Jones, the chief executive of Intrinsic Graphics, a
maker of videogame-developer tools in Mountain View, Calif., asked:
``How many Xbox's can Microsoft afford to sell?''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (EDS: Because of transmission limitations, note spelling of
E(asterisk)Offering in graf 7; it is the company's name and uses a
character symbol) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Labor Day
signals the start of the peak season for sports fans, who can
finally supplement their baseball-only diets with smatterings of
professional football, basketball and hockey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web sites like Viacom's CBSSportsline.com, Disney's ESPN.com and
the News  &UR; Corp. &LR; 's FoxSports.com cheer the coming of autumn, as
well, as fans increasingly flock to their PCs to trade gossip,
scores and injury reports.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many of those sites also promoted new online stores,
as they figured fans would snap up jerseys, caps and other sporting
goods while checking up on their teams. Forget the fact that those
media companies had almost no experience in retailing: this was
during the high-water mark for e-commerce, when the mere mention of
the term was enough to send an Internet company's stock soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, these so-called ``sports content'' sites
are putting as much distance as they can between themselves and
their e-commerce experiments. They have seen the misery visited on
electronic retailers by investors, and they have seen, first hand,
the reasons Wall Street turned a cold shoulder to Web merchants. It
is costly, difficult work, offering few prospects for profit in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the sports sites are eschewing e-commerce
altogether. Rather, many of them are taking a new approach to
selling goods online, one that gives content sites a way to glean
the benefits of e-commerce while avoiding the headaches such an
effort can cause.
</P>
<P>
   The newest strategy is to place the site's store in the hands of
an outside company. This approach has not only given sports sites a
reliable source of revenue and a way to keep fans on their sites,
but it has also given rise to a new category of behind-the-scenes
e-commerce companies, who, analysts said, may be better positioned
for long-term success than some of the more well-known online
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives the sports content guys an easy way to monetize
their traffic,'' said Shawn Milne, e-commerce analyst for
E(asterisk)Offering, an online investment firm. ``And it lets them
get back to what they do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne said the leading company providing such services to
sports-related sites was Global Sports Interactive, which created
and runs the online stores of the Sports Authority and Group
Rallye's Athlete's Foot, among other retailers. More recently, it
has begun to do the same for FoxSports.com, with other sites to
follow, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, the chief executive at Global Sports, says the
company handles all aspects of the store for the clients, including
customer service, order fulfillment and returns. In exchange, it
keeps roughly 92 percent of the site's revenue. ``All of my
partners are making money on e-commerce, while everybody else is
out there spending their brains out on marketing and building the
infrastructure,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the company's success, Rubin said, is that it
operates in a highly fragmented market. ``This is a $50-billion
market, and the biggest retailer is Sports Authority, which has
$1.5 billion in sales,'' he said. ``So there's really no one with
the critical mass to do e-commerce successfully on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, sporting goods stores sell 85 percent
to 90 percent of the same inventory. So instead of many companies
building Web sites, call centers and warehouses filled with the
same 90,000 items, Global Sports operates a central warehouse
carrying those items. It also has a single call center in which
representatives handle each store's customers separately. And the
fact that Global Sports operates anonymously _ customers have no
idea that they are not actually buying from the Web site they are
on _ means that it can avoid the marketing costs that have sunk
other e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   But such anonymity also carries a degree of risk for the Web
sites, analysts said. If their customers have problems, the Web
site's reputation suffers, rather than that of Global Sports. Jon
Richmond, who oversees FoxSports.com as president of News Corp.'s
digital media group, said that risk was small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty vigorous about testing and checking their
approach so they maintain quality standards for us,'' Richmond
said. He added that Fox Sports just rolled out its online store
with Global Sports last week, ``so it's a little early still.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the two companies shared information on
customer satisfaction, ``so we'll know what's happening there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Global Sports isn't doing this just for us,'' Richmond
said. ``They're doing it for Kmart, Sports Authority and others
who'll demand that they stay vigilant about things like customer
service and fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other behind-the-scenes e-commerce companies have found
increasing demand among sports content sites, as well.
EFanShop.com, for one, recently created a store for MSNBCsports.com
featuring licensed sports goods with the logos of professional and
college teams. Marc Andres, eFanShop's chief executive, said sports
content sites were ideally suited to such impulse purchases as team
jerseys and caps, ``because no one really wakes up in the morning
to say, `I think I'll buy a Chipper Jones jersey,''' he said.
``They do it while they're checking scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Andres said eFanShop relied on distributors or vendors to ship
75 percent of its products directly to consumers, and kept the
other 25 percent in a fulfillment center that is run by SameDay, a
company that specializes in shipping and handling e-commerce
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy White, MSNBC's vice president for business development,
said she was approaching the company's Fan Shop, as it is called,
as an experiment that could lead to stores in other areas of the
site. ``If there's a context for it _ say, a book review, and we
want to give someone the opportunity to buy the book _ we could do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports section of the site is an obvious place to start, she
said. About 20 percent of MSNBC.com's visitors head to the sports
section of the site, and sports merchandise lends itself well to
contextual selling, in which sites offer goods related to the
stories on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The two most-visited sports content sites, CBSSportsline.com and
ESPN.com, have also abandoned their in-house electronic commerce
strategies, but they have taken different paths. In December,
CBSSportsline sold its e-commerce business to MVP.com, which
operates its own online sporting goods store, in addition to stores
of corporate partners. For the right to operate the CBSSportsline
store, MVP.com agreed to pay $120 million in cash over 10 years,
said Michael Levy, CBSSportsline's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com shut down its store in August, and will reopen it in
mid-December. But unlike other sports sites, it will create an
online sports mall where different sporting goods stores will sell
their goods to customers. The general manager of ESPN.com, John
Skipper, would not name the stores that will participate in the
mall, but if the stores include all the leading sporting-goods
stores, that is likely to mean that Global Sports will essentially
be selling goods on ESPN.com's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Skipper said he was relieved to be free of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good at creating sports content, aggregating a large
audience and working with marketers to sell goods to those
people,'' he said. ``We don't have expertise in figuring out what
jerseys or caps to buy. Retailing is a high-risk business anyway.
You exacerbate that risk by not being good at it.''

NEW ECONOMY: WHOSE NAME IS IT ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a little-noticed decision in July, the World Intellectual
Property Organization forced an American woman, Virginia Comito, to
hand over the Internet address www.tonsil.com to Sued-Chemie, a
German chemicals company that had held a trademark on the word
since 1952. The address was deemed ``identical or confusingly
similar'' to a bleaching product called Tonsil.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, an arbitration panel of the organization ruled
that David Sallen, a Boston entrepreneur, would have to turn over
the domain name corinthians.com to the Corinthians, a Brazilian
soccer team. The panel decided that Sallen, whose site published a
handful of biblical quotations, had acted in bad faith, determining
that, among other things, he had hoped to profit from selling the
name to the Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the trademark holder prevailed. In the continuing
battles between the owners of trademarks and individuals with
Internet domain addresses identical to them or nearly so, the
trademark owners appear to be far ahead. Of 1,000 cases that have
gone before four approved arbitration boards (of which the World
Intellectual Property Organization is one), three quarters have
been won by trademark owners.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gurry, the organization's assistant director-general,
points out that it would only make sense that trademark holders
prevail, as only companies that are fairly sure that domain holders
are acting in bad faith take their cases to arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure is not for cases where you have some rights and
I have some rights,'' Gurry said in an interview from his office in
Geneva. ``These are supposed to be black-and-white cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McLaughlin, president of the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, the international nonprofit group that
administers the domain-name system, which is also known as ICANN,
defended the arbitration process, which started last December as a
way of giving trademark holders an easy way to resolve the growing
number of battles over names. He says ICANN plans a formal review
of the process later this year.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin pointed out that the statistics on domain name
arbitration are skewed because many domain name holders do not even
bother to defend their positions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of ICANN's domain name arbitration system is the
Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, a set of rules for determining
if a domain name holder is acting in bad faith or is out to hijack
a trademarked name. Only trademark holders can take their case to
one of the arbitration and mediation centers. The decision of the
arbitrators is not binding; companies and individuals can still
take the case to court. And in November, the Clinton administration
passed the federal Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,
giving trademark holders the right to take speculators to court and
to collect damages. But the arbitrators' decisions are enforced by
domain-name registrars, who carry them out by transferring domain
names, or canceling them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four arbitration and mediation centers approved by ICANN,
the World Intellectual Property Organization hears most of the
cases, followed by the National Arbitration Forum in Minneapolis;
Disputes.org/eResolutions Consortium in Amherst, Mass., and
Montreal; and C.P.R Institute for Dispute Resolutions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual property organization has come under scrutiny
lately by critics who say it is biased in favor of trademark
holders.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a
consumer advocacy group based in Washington, says the
organization's decisions de-emphasize free speech in favor of
protecting commercial interests. ``The ability to call attention to
your information is important,'' Love said. ``To say that big
companies can do that and individuals can't is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, sorting out domain name rights is no easy job. Take the
case surrounding corinthians.com, which Sallen has not taken down
despite the ruling. For starters, there is the fact that the Web
site operated by Sallen contains little more than a few biblical
quotations and a missive stating ``This website is about to be
pirated by a huge corporation in Brazil.'' (Lawyers for the
Brazilian team argue that the biblical quotations appeared after
the complaint was filed, presumably to make it appear the domain
name was being actively used when it was not.)
</P>
<P>
   Sallen had earlier sent the Brazilian team an e-mail offer to
sell it the address, raising a red flag for arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the organization's litmus test of ``confusingly
similar'' is, well, confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Yahoo, which has just successfully argued that
several dozen domain names registered by the Data Art Corp. and
others, including ayhoo.com, eeeyahoo.com and yafoo.com, are too
easily confused with yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   A related question arises from the abundance of parody and
protest sites, some of which attach a disparaging or crude word
onto the trademarked name, as in the case of the London-based
electronics chain Dixons and a parody site with a similar and
suggestive name. Is anybody really likely to confuse one address
with the other? According to the intellectual property
organization, they could. The ``adoption'' of the Dixons name in
the address ``is inherently likely to lead some people to believe
that the complainant is connected with it,'' the panel wrote in its
ruling, which favored the electronics store and forced the parody
site to give up the address.
</P>
<P>
   Another case heard by the board was that of the World Wrestling
Federation, which argued that a California man was trying to profit
from reselling the domain name www.worldwrestlingfederation.com.
The federation, which has long maintained a site at www.wwf.com,
dating back to when domain names were limited to only 22
characters, took the case to the intellectual property
organization, which ruled that the address holder had acted in bad
faith, hoping only to profit from reselling the name, and gave the
name to the federation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates like Love argue that the rulings lack
balance and create precedents that may have far-reaching effects.
The domain name problem, he says, stems from the scarcity of domain
names, much of which will be alleviated when ICANN next year
approves new domain names to supplement .com, .gov, .org and .net.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a rash of celebrity domain name cases should
help keep the arbitrators busy. A case brought by the entertainer
Madonna against a California pornographer who until last year
published a site at www.madonna.com is pending. Madonna, who has
her own site at Madonnafanclub.com, is widely expected to win. But
the singer Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, lost his battle
for the address www.sting.com after arbitrators ruled that the word
sting is generic and that Sumner had not trademarked it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to registering the domain names of
famous celebrities, it may take more than arbitration to solve some
cases. In May, the organization ordered the operator of a parody
site about Julia Roberts to hand over the domain name
juliaroberts.com to the actress. The operator, Russell Boyd, is
fighting back and has sued Roberts. But he confesses on his site
that what he really wants is a phone call from her.

<P>
   DELTA, Colo. _ From the thickly forested top of the Uncompahgre
Plateau, you can see the promise of a different way of dealing with
the public land conflicts that have endlessly embroiled the West, a
path that emphasizes collaboration instead of confrontation,
cooperation rather than political conquest.
</P>
<P>
   But if you squint just right, you can also see the threat posed
to that promise by 30 years of warfare over logging, mining,
grazing and endangered species and refusal by combatants on both
sides to believe that there might be a better way than litigation,
legislation and presidential fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Threat and promise dance across the plateau and the valley below
like sunlight and cloud shadow.
</P>
<P>
   To the northeast, in the shade of Grand Mesa, is the site of a
conflict between miners and environmentalists over a massively
expanded coal lease on federal land. It could have been as bitter
as any public land dispute the West has ever seen. Just barely, it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, city and county officials, state bureaucrats and
railroad representatives watch a long coal train lumber through
Delta while talking about the best way to spend a mix of state and
mining company money to mitigate the impact of twice as many trains
because of that expanded coal lease.
</P>
<P>
   And on the plateau itself, a state wildlife biologist expresses
surprise and shock that a grass-roots group of citizen activists is
offering him money and manpower to restore elk and mule deer
habitat, instead of castigating him for not catering to its special
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, we're just being told what to do by these groups,''
said Bruce Watkins, a terrestrial biologist with the Colorado
Division of Wildlife. ``For once, we're being asked `What can we
do?' by a group, `How can we help?' That's unheard of. ... It's a
totally different relationship with the public than we're used to
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' praise is directed at a loose-knit outfit of locals
known as the Public Lands Partnership, who have ginned up $700,000
in Ford Foundation money for a pilot restoration project on the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of ranchers and environmentalists, businessmen and
public officials, the Partnership has been in business since the
mid-1990s and represents a growing movement across the West. Groups
like this are searching for a ``third way'' of negotiating the
region's thorny issues, one that strikes a balance between
preserving nature and supporting the people who live in the small
towns and rural communities that flank the region's vast swaths of
public land.
</P>
<P>
   By offering Watkins a hand of aid instead of a slap of special
interest or scorn, the Partnership has earned the trust and praise
of state and federal land and wildlife managers, a rarity given the
polarized nature of Western land issues. The group also helped
defuse the face-off between miners and greens before it became
another bitter land war. It smoothed the way for public and
railroad officials to start talking about how to solve the coal
train problem with a pot of money, some of it provided by the mines
themselves, instead of blasting each other with blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good for the environment and what's good for
communities, that's what we're about,'' said Steve Schrock, a
former city manager and current business consultant who helped
found the Partnership. ``The notion that people who live in these
communities are Neanderthals and against the environment is just
crazy. This is no longer the days of 100 years ago when,
admittedly, people came in and overgrazed and cut too much timber
and devastated places with mining.''
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership is part of a loosely linked network of community
groups dubbed the collaborative movement. Sporting a mixed record
of success, they include the Quincy Library Group in California,
the Canyon Country Partnership in Utah, Oregon's Applegate
Partnership and the Henry's Fork Watershed Council in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a million acres of forest ablaze in the
intermountain West this summer, the type of public lands
breakthrough promised by this movement seems more urgent than ever.
This is particularly true on issues like forest restoration, the
need to thin more than 40 million acres of federal timberland
dangerously choked with brush and trees, a prime reason the
wildfires of this ultra-hot and ultra-dry season were so big and
destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But urgency has been offset by suspicion, skepticism and fierce
counterattack from the veterans of Western warfare. Critics are
quick to damn conciliation and compromise as a traitorous sellout,
revealing a deep divide between pragmatists willing to step into
what one activist calls ``the radical center'' and purists tied to
the dynamic of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to get people to realize there's another way to
do this,'' said Roger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of
Wildlife, a national preservation group involved in reintroduction
programs for grizzly bears and gray wolves. ``They're so used to
slugging it out head-to-head, no quarter asked or given, that they
view anything else with a great deal of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   And though politicians have paid lip service to the
collaborative movement, much of this rhetoric is contradicted by
government action.
</P>
<P>
   The current bone of contention is President Clinton's roadless
initiative, which seeks to close off millions of acres of Forest
Service land from roads built for logging but used for recreation.
It is the very type of top-down fiat for which the movement is
supposed to provide an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust is a horrible thing to waste,'' said Greg Schildwachter,
head of the Missoula, Mont., office of the Intermountain Forest
Association, a timber industry group, and a participant in a
lengthy and fractured negotiation to close roads in the Flathead
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some Westerners see collaboration as a chance to regain
sovereignty in a policy debate previously dominated by federal land
agencies, national environmental groups and the powerful
associations representing the region's extractive industries _
ranching, logging, mining and farming.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the West has swapped its historic identity as an
economic colony of Eastern corporate interests for one in which
environmental goals predominate. And they think the environmental
movement has an obligation to help salvage the region's small
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a social concern,'' said Ed Marston, publisher of High
Country News, an environmentally oriented newspaper based in
Paonia. ``You don't destabilize the society. You don't do conquest.
We're about protecting the Earth, not subjugating a rural
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners believe that common ground can be found between
traditional enemies, that ranchers and miners can strike a deal
with mountain bikers and environmentalists, that an armistice can
be signed to end the West's war of culture clash and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business of every victory being temporary and every loss
being permanent just has to change,'' said Stuart Krebs, former
president of the Western Colorado Congress, veteran of the region's
environmental struggles, and now a member of the Public Land
Partnership. ``If you can get the other side to share in the
victory, maybe you'll make it a little more permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who walk this ground have found that it can be a no
man's land of recrimination. Consider the experience of Hank
Fischer, director of the Defenders of Wildlife's Northern Rockies
office.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is a veteran of the wolf wars and two controversial
sitdowns _ a plan to reintroduce grizzly bears into the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness near the Idaho-Montana border and the
proposal to close several Forest Service roads in northwest
Montana's Flathead National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   On the grizzly project, Fischer and another professional
preservationist, Tom France of the Wilderness Foundation, joined
loggers, timber companies and federal land and wildlife managers to
hammer out a deal to get animals on the ground and still allow some
logging.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of these negotiations was a citizens' management
committee that would make decisions on grizzly bear management. It
was unheard-of power-sharing, answering Westerners' call for a
bigger role in these issues, but it didn't keep Fischer, France and
their partners in the timber industry from being branded sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   On the second collaborative effort, Fischer sat down with timber
interests, hunters, outfitters, campers and recreational vehicle
groups for an agreement that would close 116 miles of Forest
Service roads on two large hunks of the Flathead, protecting
grizzly bear habitat while allowing logging and other forest use.
</P>
<P>
   But after five years, the Forest Service has issued a favorable
decision on only one of the land parcels. The deal also drew fire
from a local preservationist, Keith Hammer of the Swan View
Coalition, who wrote to Fischer's superiors and board members
seeking his removal from his post.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's like to be in the radical center,'' said
Fischer. ``They fight dirty. If you're not with us, you're against
us and animosity develops because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, whose group earlier obtained a more sweeping court order
requiring the Forest Service to close roads in the Flathead over
the next 10 years to protect grizzly bear habitat, denies trying to
get Fischer fired, but castigates him for flying false colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who brought this thing together were pretty
well-heeled environmental groups and regional timber outfits _ not
folks just down the road from the forest,'' Hammer said. ``This was
a political deal gone bad _ `We'll help you get road closure for
grizzlies if you help us get some timber out of there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer rejects this characterization. The coalition was no
back-room deal, but an attempt to break the logjam that slows
decisions on public land and endangered species policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got is neither side getting what they want,'' he
said. ``It's a system that serves no one.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Although Hammer's criticism rankles Fischer and other
participants, the fatal blow to the Flathead coalition came from
within, when two of the collaborative partners, Montanans for
Multiple Use _ representing motorized campers, hunters and other
recreational users _ and the preservationist Montana Wilderness
Association, appealed the agreement to which they were parties.
</P>
<P>
   But Schildwachter, a timber industry participant in Flathead
Common Ground, says it was the Clinton administration's roadless
initiative and the opposition of environmentalists like Hammer that
unraveled the collaborative effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we see our honest effort to negotiate a solution left to
die on the vine while a national roadless initiative is getting the
fast track,'' he said. ``Our guys said, `We're done. We're going
back to the bunkers and we're going to fight this thing out.'''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The chief complaint of environmentalists opposed to the
collaborative movement is that national support for species
preservation and wilderness protection isn't fully represented by
grass-roots groups of locals. They also worry that such groups can
be easily co-opted, and might undercut the hard-won gains of the
past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have been little more than a grab at local control and a
guise for the industry,'' said Bruce Hamilton, national
conservation directorof the Sierra Club. ``If we're talking about a
natural resource, we don't feel it's appropriate to set up a group
of local stakeholders and give them all the power.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a hint of elitism and jealous turf-guarding to
these arguments, some collaboration advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd had big, wide vision going into this, we'd probably
realize there are a lot of interests and organizations that benefit
from ongoing and unresolvable controversy,'' said Krebs of the
Public Lands Partnership. ``As long as they can keep those flames
fanned, they can keep dollars rolling in and offices open.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the notion that some environmentalists would
rather maintain ideological purity than strike a deal beneficial to
critters, humans and the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this argument long enough to know that this is a
theological argument, that anything that has borne the mark of the
hand of man has been fouled and must be left to return to nature,''
said Mary Chapman, Schrock's wife and a fellow at the Center for
the New West, a Denver-based think tank on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
   But zealotry and myth-making aren't limited to
environmentalists, said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to tell you that environmentalism is seen as a
kind of pantheism as much as anything else, but the rancher also
embraces a mythology, a tradition, and he's just as passionate
about making a living on the land,'' he said. ``Both sides of the
argument have their own vision of what grizzly bears symbolize. It
can be a symbol of government interference in their lives under the
guise of species preservation or it can be a symbol of nature's
wildness.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism and mythology make it difficult for combatants to step
down from the battlements. But Fischer and others readily risk the
heretic's brand.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer sees nothing wrong with development of a timber industry
geared toward forest restoration and other ecological goals, making
a living off smaller-diameter timber. Schrock aims to demonstrate
the benefit of selective logging and grazing in his group's pilot
project on the Uncompahgre. Still others have tumbled to the notion
that a ranch or a farm is better for the West than another
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest heretic of the bunch is Michael Jackson of
the Quincy Logging Group. A firebrand environmental lawyer who took
on the loggers of his Northern California hometown, he is a
principal architect of an agreement that protects 1.2 million acres
of old-growth forest and fragile streamside land in two national
forests while launching a five-year project to thin 2.5 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson dares to utter the ultimate blasphemy: that the
cherished natural landscape of the West isn't all that natural,
that it's been so manipulated by man that it needs the hand of man
to restore it to pristine condition.
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration is the only way out of the West's public land
policy quagmire, Jackson and Fischer say. Nothing less than the
future is at stake _ of the region's land, its people and the
environmental movement itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being the brake on the car, we've got to be the
driver,'' said Fischer. ``Instead of just stopping things, we need
to be proactive and put solutions on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``Who shot the dog is no longer important. It's
how do we fix it.''

<P>
   DELTA, Colo. _ From the thickly forested top of the Uncompahgre
Plateau, you can see the promise of a different way of dealing with
the public land conflicts that have endlessly embroiled the West, a
path that emphasizes collaboration instead of confrontation,
cooperation rather than political conquest.
</P>
<P>
   But if you squint just right, you can also see the threat posed
to that promise by 30 years of warfare over logging, mining,
grazing and endangered species and refusal by combatants on both
sides to believe that there might be a better way than litigation,
legislation and presidential fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Threat and promise dance across the plateau and the valley below
like sunlight and cloud shadow.
</P>
<P>
   To the northeast, in the shade of Grand Mesa, is the site of a
conflict between miners and environmentalists over a massively
expanded coal lease on federal land. It could have been as bitter
as any public land dispute the West has ever seen. Just barely, it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, city and county officials, state bureaucrats and
railroad representatives watch a long coal train lumber through
Delta while talking about the best way to spend a mix of state and
mining company money to mitigate the impact of twice as many trains
because of that expanded coal lease.
</P>
<P>
   And on the plateau itself, a state wildlife biologist expresses
surprise and shock that a grass-roots group of citizen activists is
offering him money and manpower to restore elk and mule deer
habitat, instead of castigating him for not catering to its special
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, we're just being told what to do by these groups,''
said Bruce Watkins, a terrestrial biologist with the Colorado
Division of Wildlife. ``For once, we're being asked `What can we
do?' by a group, `How can we help?' That's unheard of. ... It's a
totally different relationship with the public than we're used to
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' praise is directed at a loose-knit outfit of locals
known as the Public Lands Partnership, who have ginned up $700,000
in Ford Foundation money for a pilot restoration project on the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of ranchers and environmentalists, businessmen and
public officials, the Partnership has been in business since the
mid-1990s and represents a growing movement across the West. Groups
like this are searching for a ``third way'' of negotiating the
region's thorny issues, one that strikes a balance between
preserving nature and supporting the people who live in the small
towns and rural communities that flank the region's vast swaths of
public land.
</P>
<P>
   By offering Watkins a hand of aid instead of a slap of special
interest or scorn, the Partnership has earned the trust and praise
of state and federal land and wildlife managers, a rarity given the
polarized nature of Western land issues. The group also helped
defuse the face-off between miners and greens before it became
another bitter land war. It smoothed the way for public and
railroad officials to start talking about how to solve the coal
train problem with a pot of money, some of it provided by the mines
themselves, instead of blasting each other with blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good for the environment and what's good for
communities, that's what we're about,'' said Steve Schrock, a
former city manager and current business consultant who helped
found the Partnership. ``The notion that people who live in these
communities are Neanderthals and against the environment is just
crazy. This is no longer the days of 100 years ago when,
admittedly, people came in and overgrazed and cut too much timber
and devastated places with mining.''
</P>

RADIO STATION LEAVES EARTH AND ENTERS CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JORDAN RAPHAEL  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Shortly before 9 a.m. last Monday,
the disc jockeys on Channel 103.1-FM, Nicole Sandler and Andy
Chanley, ended the station's run of nearly two years by playing
``Come A Long Way'' by the pop-folk singer Michelle Shocked.
``We'll see you on the other side,'' Sandler told listeners, and
moments later, the adult-alternative-format station, in Santa
Monica, Calif., ceased on-air transmission and began broadcasting
exclusively on the Web.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hardly the first radio station to discover the Internet.
There are currently thousands of traditional radio outlets
streaming audio online, as well as several hundred more Web-only
radio operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 103.1 was the first American broadcaster to depart
the FM dial and continue on the Internet without an interruption in
programming, according to the National Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web-only entity, available at Channel1031.com and
WorldClassRock.com, is an experiment by its parent company, Clear
Channel Communications, which sold the station's two frequencies,
along with 83 others, to allay Justice Department concerns about
its recently completed $23.8 billion purchase of AMFM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet provides us another means for people to consume
our programming content,'' said Charlie Rahilly, senior vice
president for sales for Clear Channel in Los Angeles. ``We're
trying to see if we can make this migration from over-the-air to
over-the-Web work, if we can monetize it and produce positive
operating results.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the station was not exactly a powerhouse in the Los
Angeles market; its weak signal did not provide full-market
coverage, and only 400,000 listeners tuned in during an average
week, giving it lower ratings than at least one local National
Public Radio station.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 103.1 was an ideal candidate for a Web-only trial
run, Rahilly said, because its listeners were loyal _ more than
24,000 of them filled out an online petition supporting the
Internet move _ and composed mainly of affluent, well-educated
people aged 25 to 54, a demographic group highly prized by
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   By switching to the Web, the station no longer has to deal with
reception problems. Its digital stream of programming _ an eclectic
blend of techno-pop, reggae, new wave and folk _ is available, like
all Internet radio, from Kentucky to Kazakhstan, using free audio
player software like RealAudio's RealPlayer or Microsoft's Media
Player.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda O'Brien, 42, an administrator at an Internet start-up in
Boulder, Colo., has listened to Channel 103.1 online since she
discovered the station last year while on a business trip to Los
Angeles. Although O'Brien can tune her radio to KBCO, a broadcast
station with a similar format, she logs on at Channel1031.com 10 to
12 hours a day. ``I like the DJs in L.A. better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite listeners like O'Brien and the station's slogan,
``Worldwide on WorldClassRock.com,'' Channel1031.com is still
aiming at Los Angeles listeners, limiting its global marketing to
hyperlinks on the Web sites of other stations owned by Clear
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Regional advertisers do not have much use for a worldwide
audience, Rahilly said. ``If we were to attract too many streamers
from around the world and not be able to monetize all that
bandwidth, that would be the biggest sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel executives are also sticking to radio's
traditional financial model: selling spot audio advertisements
rather than interactive ad banners. To bring Channel 103.1's
advertisers on board, ad rates have been cut in half, Rahilly said,
adding that the station has already converted more than one-third
of its clients.
</P>
<P>
   The universe of potential listeners for online radio outfits
like Channel1031.com is expanding rapidly. According to a
soon-to-be-released study by Arbitron/Edison Media Research,
roughly 57 million people listened to radio stations online in July
2000. A recent survey by Forrester Research found that 56 percent
of Internet users receive audio on their PC's at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a lot of competition for those listeners,
and not just from other land-transmitted radio stations. Streaming
audio is available from a number of Internet outfits, ranging from
the software download site Tucows.com; to niche independent sites
like Dublab.com, which plays only formats like electronica and drum
and bass; to Webcasters like Live365.com, where aspiring DJs can
start their own online radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   BRS Media, an Internet company that tracks Web radio, found
nearly 4,500 online stations as of August 2000, compared with only
56 in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The way to pierce the dense digital clutter, said Sandler, who
is also Channel-1031.com's program director, is to run a
professional radio studio and give users a reason to seek it out
online. That, she added, means scrutinizing the music list even
harder, delving deeper into albums and increasing the percentage of
new music. ``I think people will come to us over, say, a SonicNet,
where you create your own jukebox,'' she said, referring to one of
MTV's online music services. ``They trust us to filter out the good
from the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest obstacles facing Internet radio are
technological. Listening to online audio is so far a very PC-based
experience; that could change soon with the advent of wireless
Internet technologies and devices like Kima from Akoo.com, which
transmits signals from a PC to a stereo. And, despite improvements
in compression and streaming technologies, Webcasts can still be
painful for users without broadband connections, punctuated by
breaks in the music.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Nelson, 30, a city prosecutor in Los Angeles, experienced
some problems when he tried to follow Channel 103.1 online. It took
him 20 minutes to download the audio software with his 56-kilobyte
modem, and another 10 minutes to make it work. The broadcast also
stops every 15 minutes or so because of Internet congestion, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it were still on the radio,'' he added. ``My wife and I
went out Monday night and spent $150 on CDs so we would have
something to listen to in the car. There's not much else to listen
to in L.A.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bloodshed on a distant patch of soil, not for the
first time, trampled the best-laid plans of U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had not meant to open the Millennium Summit with talk of
tragedy. Just hours after the murder of three U.N. staff workers in
West Timor, a rosy evocation of peace and light for mankind would
have been tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for any secretary general not to take loss of life
amidst the U.N. family personally. The emotion felt by Annan was
visible in his face as he stood at the podium of the General
Assembly and asked a solemn favor of a hall filled with all the
world's most powerful people _ to rise with him and to observe a
minute of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Those 60 seconds of quiet among so querulous a group was an
exceptional tribute. The prime ministers and the presidents and
other sundry leaders all bowed their heads together. Near the front
of the hall, U.S. President Bill Clinton adopted the pose of
mourning, beside his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Some way behind, Fidel Castro, similarly looked to his toes, the
grey tangle of his beard resting on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in West Timor did more than just puncture the mood.
Tony Blair, the British prime minister, was one of those to make
explicit what many in the corridors were already observing _ that
what happened overnight on Indonesian territory was one more vivid
reminder of the inadequacy of the current arrangements for U.N.
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Blair or any of the other leaders had needed this
latest atrocity to drive the point home.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping activities in the last weeks, months and years have
supplied Annan and his organization with enough humiliation and
catastrophe already.
</P>
<P>
   The worst has been in Sierra Leone, where 500 U.N. blue helmets
were taken hostage in July and where even now six British soldiers
are being held in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Reform is always a sluggish business at the United Nations _
expansion of the Security Council has been on the agenda for years
_ but the will to make peacekeeping work better seems suddenly to
be congealing.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Annan published a report written by a panel of
experts that called for more money, more troops and coherent
planning as part of an overhaul of U.N. peacekeeping missions
around the world for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, the panel also stressed that the world
body has to drop its neutrality and distinguish between aggressor
and victim. It failed to do this before the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
and the massacre of Moslems in Srebrenica a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson seems clear: if humans are being abused inside a
state's borders, then sensitivities about sovereignty should be
ignored. The United Nations should hesitate less to interfere and
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer good enough to organize blue-helmet operations
as if they were still largely geared to marking and agreed
cease-fire lines between two states that have conceded to a U.N.
presence,'' Blair said Wednesday, taking up the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical case now is fast-moving and volatile. The
appalling attack on U.N. staff in West Timor is demonstrating this
vividly.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, making what was effectively a farewell
appearance before his world peers, was similarly candid saying that
it was time for the United Nations in future cases to ``take a
side, not merely to stand between the sides or on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   It was thus also time, the president said, to give peacekeeping
operations new methods and new muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, the United Nations has been called into
situations where brave people seek reconciliation but where the
enemies seek to undermine it,'' Clinton said, citing U.N.
peacekeeping operations in East Timor and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in both cases, the U.N. did not have the tools to finish
the job. We must provide those tools, with peacekeepers who can be
rapidly deployed with the right training and equipment, missions
well-defined and well-led, with the necessary civilian police.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair went further. In a burst of enthusiasm _ many in the room
might consider it impractical idealism _ the prime minister urged
fellow leaders to implement the findings of the August report
within twelve months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a new contract between the U.N. and its members,''
he explained. ``The U.N. must alter radically its planning,
intelligence and analysis, and develop a far more substantial
professional military staff. When the moment comes, a field
headquarters must be ready to move, with an operational
communications system up and running immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has already offered to establish a training
school for U.N. blue helmets somewhere in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, has always found it easier to offer
encouragement to the United Nations _ and there is no reason to
doubt his personal commitment to the U.N. ideal _ than to deliver
any material help, thanks to hostility to the body among
Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   No delegates here can listen to a U.S. president without
recalling the $1.7 billion that Washington owes the U.N. in back
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in our country or elsewhere who think we can do without
the U.N. misread history or misunderstand the future,'' Clinton
noted wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   His administration, however, is increasing pressure on other
U.N. members to accept that currently the U.S. is expected to
shoulder too much of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things come with a price tag, and all nations,
including the United States, must pay it,'' Clinton said. But he
went on: ``These prices must be fairly apportioned and the U.N.
structure of finances must be fairly reformed so the organization
can do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   t was left to Annan to remind these most powerful of individuals
on the planet that the responsibility that they and the U.N. share
together was the upholding of the welfare of all the world's
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look to you to protect them from the great dangers of our
time,'' he said. ``Let us not disappoint them.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the height of the Internet land rush in 1998, an
unusual story stood out from the rest: the tiny nation of Tuvalu
sold, for $50 million, the rights to its chunk of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia
with a population of just 10,600, had rarely made world headlines.
But the multimillion-dollar sale, to an ambitious Web entrepreneur
in Canada, changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   The story really began when Tuvalu, along with dozens of other
nations and territories, was assigned its own two-letter suffix
that signifies an Internet domain. Under the assignment, Britain
received .uk, France received .fr, and Tuvalu received .tv.
</P>
<P>
   Into this picture came Jason Chapnik, a 28-year-old entrepreneur
from Toronto. Chapnik says he came up with the idea of registering
names within the .tv domain as early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started brainstorming,'' Chapnik recalled in a telephone
interview from his home. ``If we could have dot-anything, what
would we want? We made lists _ dot-info, dot-law. Once we hit on
dot-tv as a concept, we knew we had it.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting the rights to the .tv domain from Tuvalu would not
be easy. Chapnik sent written proposals and spent months
researching and making contacts with the Tuvalu government. By
1997, other people had come up with the same idea. By 1998, the
Tuvalu government had narrowed the prospects down to three
companies. So Chapnik and his wife, Jodi, took a vacation and went
to the islands to make their pitch. In the fall of 1998, after
months of negotiation, Tuvalu made its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my wife won it for us,'' Chapnik said. ``Family is
very important to them. Coming down with my wife and not business
partners spoke volumes to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Chapnik secured millions of dollars in
backing from a leading Internet incubator, Idealab, which provided
expertise and the capital needed to pay Tuvalu and build the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Tuvalu is to receive the $50 million over the
next 12 years. Already, the company has paid the country $18
million. The payments so far have increased the country's gross
domestic product by 50 percent and allowed the government to put
electricity on the outer islands and create scholarships for its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chapnik had succeeded at turning his idea into a viable Internet
business company, dotTV, which is now 50 percent owned by Idealab.
</P>
<P>
   The company's business plan is simple. It wants to be the next
Network Solutions. As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com,
.net and .org, Network Solutions made millions of dollars
registering Internet addresses, largely because of the aura of the
popular .com domain.
</P>
<P>
   DotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its
domain, which it says is made up of the most recognizable two
letters on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has its own site at www.tv, registers
addresses on its Web site and through third parties like Dotster
and GreatDomains.com. Most prices start at $100. Words and letter
combinations with higher perceived value, like call letters of a
television station, are auctioned off, starting at $1,000. Three
names _ free.tv, china.tv and net.tv _ have each sold for $100,000,
the company said last month.
</P>
<P>
   DotTV also has tried to sell domains in more unconventional
ways. In July, it partnered with the Internet auctioneer Ibidlive
to sell domains in an auction shown on television. The auction,
which ran during a commercial break of a Seinfeld episode in Santa
Barbara, Calif., made three domain names available and encouraged
viewers to bid online. One, beach.tv, sold for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent success involved the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, which agreed to relocate from
emmys.org and emmycast.com to emmys.tv. It also sold .tv domains to
the Pax broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that is exploding,'' said Craig Francis,
dotTV's chief operating officer. ``Even at $100 a pop, which is
what most names go for,'' he added, ``this has the potential to be
very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis would not say how many names had been sold so far, only
that it was in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To sell more names, dotTV is trying to make the .tv domain
synonymous with ``rich'' media on the Web, singling out
organizations that will use video, audio and interactive features
on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is this fundamental shift in the Internet from
static text to rich and engaging information that is much more
television-like,'' Francis said. ``We want the .tv domain to tell
people that this is what a site is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But achieving .com-like status for the new domain could still
prove a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Shirky, a partner at Accelerator Group, a consulting firm
that works with Web start-ups, says the company's plan is based on
the scarcity of commercially available domain names _ a scarcity
that he says is not going to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that most of the `good' .com names have been
taken,'' Shirky said. ``But the crash of the Internet market has
cooled people's desire to pay buckets of cash for an
easy-to-remember domain name.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to dotTV's hurdles, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names
and Numbers, the international group charged with administering the
domain-name system, plans to release a set of new domains, which
might include suffixes like .web, .store and .sex, early next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only clear winner is Tuvalu. With some of the money
it earned in the dotTV deal, it has financed the process to join
the United Nations. On Tuesday at the United Nations, the
organization will have a flag-raising ceremony for Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Koloa Talake, chairman of the nation's public sector reform
program and a member of the board of dotTV, is quick to see a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's recognition of Tuvalu as an independent country
has been made possible by the relationship with dotTV,'' he said,
adding that the company was helping Tuvalu ``get into the 21st
century.''

side, not merely to stand between the sides or on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   It was thus also time, the president said, to give peacekeeping
operations new methods and new muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, the United Nations has been called into
situations where brave people seek reconciliation but where the
enemies seek to undermine it,'' Clinton said, citing U.N.
peacekeeping operations in East Timor and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in both cases, the U.N. did not have the tools to finish
the job. We must provide those tools, with peacekeepers who can be
rapidly deployed with the right training and equipment, missions
well-defined and well-led, with the necessary civilian police.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair went further. In a burst of enthusiasm _ many in the room
might consider it impractical idealism _ the prime minister urged
fellow leaders to implement the findings of the August report
within twelve months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a new contract between the U.N. and its members,''
he explained. ``The U.N. must alter radically its planning,
intelligence and analysis, and develop a far more substantial
professional military staff. When the moment comes, a field
headquarters must be ready to move, with an operational
communications system up and running immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has already offered to establish a training
school for U.N. blue helmets somewhere in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, has always found it easier to offer
encouragement to the United Nations _ and there is no reason to
doubt his personal commitment to the U.N. ideal _ than to deliver
any material help, thanks to hostility to the body among
Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   No delegates here can listen to a U.S. president without
recalling the $1.7 billion that Washington owes the U.N. in back
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in our country or elsewhere who think we can do without
the U.N. misread history or misunderstand the future,'' Clinton
noted wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   His administration, however, is increasing pressure on other
U.N. members to accept that currently the U.S. is expected to
shoulder too much of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things come with a price tag, and all nations,
including the United States, must pay it,'' Clinton said. But he
went on: ``These prices must be fairly apportioned and the U.N.
structure of finances must be fairly reformed so the organization
can do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   t was left to Annan to remind these most powerful of individuals
on the planet that the responsibility that they and the U.N. share
together was the upholding of the welfare of all the world's
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look to you to protect them from the great dangers of our
time,'' he said. ``Let us not disappoint them.'' &QL;

BIG WEB PORTALS LOSE INFLUENCE TO SITES WITH GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Internet companies try to find more efficient ways to acquire
customers, a subtle shift is taking place in the balance of power
between retailers and the major Web portals they have relied on to
send them business.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas portals like Yahoo, AOL.com and the Microsoft Network
once held almost singular sway over where their users went to buy
flowers, music or other goods, recent data indicate that this
influence _ though still significant _ is being challenged by
shifting Internet traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A study to be released this week by the Internet audience
measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings confirms this trend, finding
that the portals are losing their dominant position as the source
of traffic for e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the portals were the top source of referrals for 54
percent of all e-commerce sites, the study found, compared with 46
percent of e-commerce sites today. The leading referral site,
Yahoo, was the top source of traffic for 30 percent of e-commerce
sites last July, but only 18 percent of Internet retailers this
summer. The data for the survey was based on 809 sites tracked by
Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kaldor, vice president for e-commerce for
Nielsen/NetRatings, said retailers were seeking out partnerships
with types of Internet companies other than portals. Moreover, the
study found a new category of sites is gaining influence in the
referral arena: sweepstakes and lottery sites, like Iwon.com,
Freelotto.com and Gamesville.com, in part because those sites offer
partners an alternative business model.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, less than 1 percent of referral traffic
to e-commerce sites came from sweepstakes or game sites in July
1999, but by July 2000, that figure was nearly 8 percent. Kaldor
said these sites were gaining influence partly because they
generally offered partners a ``pay per click'' advertising model,
in which a retailer pays the referring site only for customers who
click on a link to the retailer's site, at a rate of about 40 cents
a referral.
</P>
<P>
   Kaldor acknowledged that there were drawbacks to relying on
sweepstakes sites to refer customers. Users of lottery sites tend
be in lower income brackets, and it is not clear whether visitors
referred from these sites _ who sometimes earn points for clicking
on retailers' links _ ever become long-term customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kaldor said the sweepstakes sites bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trend continues,'' he said, ``they do pose a serious
threat to the traditional portals.''

   Personal Online Advice on Selecting a College
</P>
<P>
   Live, one-on-one college advisory services, offered until now
primarily offline, became available on the Internet last Friday
through a new Web site, PureAdvice.com. It is offering tools and
services to help high school students identify and apply to
colleges appropriate for them and apply for and obtain financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some information, like extensive data on all the colleges in the
United States, and a calculator that estimates the total expense of
going to college, is free.
</P>
<P>
   But live, one-on-one counseling sessions with experienced
guidance counselors, financial aid experts and former college
admissions officials involve fees that start at $75 for a 45-minute
session. Included in this fee is a written report summarizing the
session, which is sent to the student and to the student's guidance
counselor, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   PureAdvice.com's president, Steven Ehrlich, said 140 advisers
from across the country, each with a minimum of five years'
experience, conduct the online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-school guidance counselors are often overburdened.
PureAdvice will help change that, giving students, their parents
and guidance counselors the tools and personalized attention they
deserve,'' Ehrlich said.
</P>
<P>
   PureAdvice also receives fees for referring visitors to vendors
_ like student loan providers _ that are listed on its site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has formed a partnership with U.S. News
&AMP; World Report to provide its counseling services on the portion of
the magazine's Web site that carries its annual college survey.
Ehrlich said U.S. News &AMP; World Report would receive a fee for each
referral to PureAdvice.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Achieva.com, a three-year-old, San Mateo, Calif.,
company that also helps high school students with the college
admissions process, appeared undaunted by the East Coast start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Feuling, Achieva.com's vice president for marketing, said
his company's $295 online college program ``takes you through
everything, not just college selection and the financial aid
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We help you with test preparation, developing an
extra-curricular resume, with an application strategy.'' The
company also offers live counseling, but not online. He said more
than half Achieva's income was derived from sales directly to
school systems.

   NEW YORK _ As if the U.N. Millennium summit were not enough, New
York is also trying to accommodate the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament,
happening across the East River in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top players are finding the convergence most
unfortunate. None are more aggravated than Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer, who has advanced to the quarterfinals, arrived at
Flushing Meadow on Monday complaining of fatigue after an almost
sleepless weekend at the United Nations Plaza Hotel, just across
from U.N. headquarters itself.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was one Sunday night, when twice the entire hotel was
awakened by security alarms and bomb threats. How was he to know
that Yasser Arafat and Iran's Mohammad Khatami were to be his
fellow guests?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking more serene surroundings, Kiefer decamped to the Waldorf
Astoria a few blocks away. In all likelihood, this was a bad
decision. Arafat decided to do exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you could argue that the Waldorf is seeing more
diplomatic activity during the Millennium Summit than the meeting
chambers at the United Nations itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is because another guest in the august hostelry, right
there on Park Avenue, is Ehud Barak, prime minister of Israel. On
Wednesday, President Bill Clinton spent hours shuttling between the
suites of the two gentlemen in one more vain effort to coax a peace
treaty out of them. British Prime Minister Tony Blair stopped by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For observers down in the lobby, watching the back and forth
might be much like watching the journey of the ball at a Flushing
Meadow tennis court, but in very slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, of course, has reason to feel disgruntled with the
endless disruption that the summit is bringing to New York.
</P>
<P>
   At least once you have conquered the street closures,
circumnavigated the different crowds of protestors without taking a
single of their leaflets and made it through the metal detectors
into the building itself, you can expect then to go about your
business unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   Not so if you are a journalist whose office is anywhere near the
Trusteeship Council, where portraits of all the leaders are being
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get in. I can't answer my phone. I can't even get my
computer,'' raged one American reporter Thursday, who has been a
resident correspondent inside the U.N. building for years.
</P>
<P>
   Without so much as a by-your-leave, security agents inside the
building had rushed about on Tuesday night, changing the locks on
the doors to the offices just above the Council hall.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind _ they have promised to restore the old locks when
the summit is all over. And when my colleague will have no need to
open his computer. &QL;

HUMBLED IN ATLANTA, IBM ENTERS ITS FINAL OLYMPIC GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the computer system IBM built to report results at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta malfunctioned, the proud computing giant
learned the hard way what it was like to stumble with the whole
world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Summer Olympics set to begin this month in Sydney,
Australia, and IBM's 40-year run as a technology supplier for the
Olympics set to end in December, Big Blue is pushing hard to make
sure it brings home some public relations gold.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which decided two years ago to end its involvement in the
Games, intends to use television and the Internet to widely
advertise its role as the 2000 Olympics' chief provider and
integrator of information technology. The centerpiece of the
campaign will be the official Olympic Games site it has set up to
handle a projected 6 billion user visits during the games, 10 times
the traffic during the 1998 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also setting up Internet stations called Surf Shacks in
Sydney. Athletes in the Olympic Village will be able to go online
with more than 60 IBM personal computers; the public's Surf Shack,
on a barge docked in Sydney's harbor, will also show off IBM's
voice-recognition technology.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial audience, though, may be the 1,000 or so major
customers IBM will entertain in Sydney. The visitors, including
executives from telecommunications, transportation, finance, health
care and computer services companies, will be shown the full range
of IBM's Olympics products and services at an executive briefing
center. The hoped-for payoff is the chance to discuss problems in
their businesses that IBM might solve for them. ``It's very
strategic marketing,'' said Elizabeth Primrose-Smith, the IBM vice
president in charge of sports sponsorships. ``We've found it's very
helpful for them to see us in action.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology challenge in Sydney is akin to creating a huge,
transitory multinational business almost from scratch under the
pressure of immovable deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said that the Sydney Olympic Committee would
spend more than $100 million on information technology and
communications and receive donated goods and services from IBM and
others worth several times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building the official Web site and systems that
handle scoring, link results to background data about the athletes
and the events, and distribute results, IBM is involved in such
diverse activities as accreditation, accommodations and management
of the athletes' medical records.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is not doing all the work itself. The accreditation system,
for example, has been subcontracted to the Sema Group, a
British-French technology services company. But IBM is the overall
systems integrator, and its Tivoli products will manage the entire
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The company has deployed about 850 computer technicians, who,
among other things, have written 12.4 million lines of code, and
who weeded out 4,000 bugs in the first six months of the year.
On-site equipment testing began last September.
</P>
<P>
   The work is winning praise from some technology managers who had
a front-row seat on the Atlanta problems. ``It's my impression
they've got everything right this time,'' said Klaus Sprick, vice
president for technology at Deutsche Press-Agentur, a German news
agency that found IBM's data feeds ``totally unreliable'' in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Atlanta humiliation was magnified because the system that
failed was the one delivering scores, times and other results to
the news media, so the problem was widely reported. The news
agencies and newspapers that had paid for the data service were
furious. Ridicule was heaped atop the anger when reports spread
that some information passed along included nonsense like tied
final scores in basketball and boxers listed as 2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Though IBM's corporate pride suffered, the company's quarterly
earnings, issued during the Games, beat expectations and IBM's
shares jumped.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its market researchers found that potential customers
did not seem put off, either.
</P>
<P>
   Both IBM and the International Olympic Committee say that the
problems in Atlanta had nothing to do with IBM's decision to end
its association after the Sydney games. IBM had been an Olympic
sponsor and technology supplier since 1960, but its role had
steadily expanded since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, when it came time to negotiate life after Sydney, IBM
was basking in praise for its successful role in the 1998 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan, and wondering how much longer it wanted to
spend ever-increasing amounts on the Games. Though IBM issues no
accounting of its Olympics spending, analysts estimated that it
invested about $100 million in Nagano. Because the Summer Games are
bigger, it was certain to end up with much higher expenses for
Sydney _ perhaps double, the analysts said. If it was to continue,
it wanted more cash from the local organizing committees to offset
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC felt that putting so much of the technology in IBM's
hands was leading to needlessly expensive technical solutions. It
also wanted to handle sponsorship of Internet-related products and
services separately from the rest of information technology so that
it could raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them the Internet isn't available exclusively at any
price,'' said Michael R. Payne, the committee's marketing director,
adding that the two sides disagreed over whether the Internet was a
medium or a product category that should be covered by the
information technology contract. ``We would love to have IBM
involved in some aspects as part of a consortium, as in Barcelona''
in 1992, he added, ``but they're saying that's not in their
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on the spot in Sydney is Thomas E. Furey, who has worked
at IBM for 37 years and who got his first Olympics challenge soon
after Atlanta when he was assigned to investigate why things had
gone so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was that the Atlanta Operating Committee's
technology staff had run the project, making it hard for IBM and
other technology vendors to deal directly with the sports
organizations and other end users. It did not help that IBM's own
services group, which did much of the project management work for
the Atlanta committee, was at the time independent from the rest of
IBM, Furey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Games also came as the industry was moving from mainframe to
PC-based computing and lacked many of the tools, like Tivoli, that
were later developed to manage distributed computing systems where
processing jobs are spread over many smaller computers supported by
larger servers.
</P>
<P>
   Given the job of overseeing Nagano and then Sydney, Furey
insisted that IBM get more control over the deployment of
technology and more time for testing. ``We also lowered the
threshold of risk,'' he said. ``We didn't use any bleeding-edge
technology.''

   Rather than trumpeting new products, IBM marketers are
emphasizing that many of the Internet applications being deployed
at Sydney are already being used by customers in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After IBM announced its withdrawal from Olympic sponsorship, the
IOC signed up Sema to take on, through 2008, the bulk of the
software and systems work IBM is doing in Sydney. Gateway will
replace IBM as hardware vendor for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens will not be
parceled out until after an IOC meeting in December, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we read and hear about the IOC's future
direction, our role probably will prove unique,'' Craig A. Lowder,
an IBM spokesman, said. ``No single company has ever been
responsible for as much technology as we have at Sydney, and it
doesn't look like any one will be again soon.''

MP3 AWAITS DAMAGES RULING AND RAISES A THORNY ISSUE IN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet music start-up MP3.com has been on the losing side
of a legal battle with the record industry ever since a federal
judge decided in April that it had violated the copyrights of the
major record companies by creating a central database of CDs to
allow users to listen to music from their own collections on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is set to rule this week on
whether MP3.com willfully broke the law or started the service in
good faith. Based on that decision, the damages he awards Universal
Music Group _ the only one of the five major companies that has not
reached a settlement with the company _ could range from $200 to
$750,000 a compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens in this round, MP3.com hopes to turn
the tables on Universal, a unit of the Seagram Co., in the final
phase of the trial, which will determine how many of the 4,740 of
Universal's copyrights in question the company will actually pay
damages on.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief that centers on perhaps the touchiest copyright issue
in the music industry today, one that has nothing to do with the
Internet, MP3.com's lawyers dispute the validity of nearly all of
Universal's sound recording copyright registrations because the
company designated them ``works for hire,'' a concept that, they
argue, has no legal basis, and that remains a subject of contention
between artists and record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright experts said that the argument could fail to have an
impact on how much MP3.com has to pay. But even so, the music
industry might be the worse for having aired in court a question to
which it has so far preferred to avoid obtaining a clear yes-or-no
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view at the end of the day most sound recordings don't
qualify as work-for-hire,'' said Peter Jaszi, a law professor at
American University. ``And that's something that recording
companies would like to avoid having too many courts say too
authoritatively. I don't know that this is a knock-out argument for
MP3, but from a tactical standpoint it raises the stakes in an
interesting way.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``work-for-hire'' terminology is the subject of a storied
battle between music artists and record labels dating to 1978, when
the federal copyright law was revised to set the term of a
copyright grant at 35 years, after which the rights revert back to
their original author. The legislation also identified nine
categories of works, including audio-visual works and ``works for
hire,'' for which the authors would never recapture the copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies, which would like to control their
copyrights for as long as possible, have argued that sound
recordings fall under the work-for-hire category. But musicians
contend that they are not ``hired'' by a record label, and that
they are more like book authors, whose right to regain the rights
to their works is not disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy reached its highest pitch late last year, when
the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group
representing the major record companies, succeeded in lobbying
Congress to add sound recordings to the categories of works whose
original authors could never reclaim their copyright. The group
argued that it was merely a technical correction to the existing
work-for-hire provision, and it was passed without hearings as part
of a budget bill on Nov. 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But after a surge of protest from outraged artists, Congress is
expected in the next few weeks to pass legislation rolling back the
statute to its original form, with language agreed on by the
recording industry trade group and several groups representing
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming this legislation passes, and I have to think it will
pass, we're back to the argument of whether sound recordings are
works made for hire,'' said Jay Cooper, a Los Angeles music lawyer
who represents a large group of artists. ``And I don't think they
want that decision out there.''

TECH 21: EBOOKS NOT YET A GOOD READ &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   I didn't get to spend a lot of time at last week's Seybold San
Francisco publishing trade show, but you didn't have to be there
long to realize that the event marked the ascent of e-books into
the high-tech world's ever-expanding pantheon of Next Big Things.
</P>
<P>
   As my colleague Kelly Zito reported, the show produced a flurry
of e-book-related announcements, with Microsoft and Adobe cutting
deals right and left to line up support for their rival formats.
Meanwhile, scores of smaller players tiptoed warily across the
stage, hoping to position themselves to share in the expected
bonanza _ and avoid getting crushed as the giants wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   Even book publishers finally seem to be taking the technology
seriously, in the wake of Stephen King's success with ``Riding the
Bullet,'' a 66-page e-book that racked up half a million orders
when it was offered online for $2.50 back in March.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the buzz, though, I had to wonder how many of the people
touting this technology have actually read a book of any
substantial length in electronic form. My guess: not many.
</P>
<P>
   E-FANTASIES: Actually, I'm a big believer in e-books. As my
family can testify, for years one of my favorite fantasies has been
of a world where people will have only one or two ``newspapers,'' a
couple of ``magazines'' and perhaps three or four ``books'' of
different sizes and shapes _ in the course of their whole
lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   These of course would be permanent electronic devices. Only the
content would change: Every morning _ or every hour _ the day's
news from our favorite source would appear in our permanent
newspaper, and we could load up the books and magazines at will
with any title we wanted to check out.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine the advantages of phasing out dead-tree
publication: Millions of acres of forest would be spared. Landfills
would get a new lease on life. (Paper of one sort or another
reportedly constitutes 35 or 40 percent of what we put there now;
I'm not saying all that would disappear, but publications have to
be a big chunk of it.) The flow of deadly dioxins from paper mills
and other poisons from toxic inks would diminish. Colleges could
pack more kids into their dorms, and crowded apartments would
suddenly seem roomy, as bookshelves become superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all that with the benefits e-books already offer, like
instant searching and hypertext navigation, and it certainly does
add up to a Big Thing. I'm convinced it will happen, and the world
will be a better place for it. And I don't doubt that it will
create vast opportunities _ as well as risks _ for companies in the
hardware, software and publishing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't think is that much of this is going to happen soon,
or that the transition will proceed very far with anything
resembling today's e-book reading devices _ either software readers
on PCs and handheld organizers or specialized products such as the
Rocket eBook (www.rocketbook.com) or the Softbook Reader.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that these products are still immature, though
that's certainly true, or that the resolution of today's screens,
even with software enhancements such as Microsoft's ClearType, is
still far short of what we take for granted with ink on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Even with more polished products and better displays, I think
e-books are destined for a pretty limited role for years to come.
Sure, some folks will buy them and use them, but mostly, I predict,
for documents that aren't readily available on paper _ either
because (like King's story) they have yet to appear on paper or
because they're out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, I'll bet most people will end up printing out such
documents, at least if they're more than a few pages long, and
reading them on paper. (I'd love to know how many people actually
read King's story on screen.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some tech-savvy business travelers may get into reading the
latest management guru's advice or a hot novel in-flight on their
laptops. Electronic encyclopedias have already all but displaced
the old-fashioned kind, and dictionaries and other reference works
are probably destined for the same fate. And technicians crawling
around ships, planes, power plants and other complex systems will
undoubtedly adopt dedicated devices to carry the mountains of
documentation they need into the field; some have done so already.
</P>
<P>
   But most people, when given a choice, will continue to prefer
ink on paper to glowing pixels under glass. It's not that I'm
sentimental about the touch or smell of books, as some people
apparently are.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental issue is purely pragmatic: After centuries of
evolution not only in paper production and printing but also in
design, we've arrived at paper-based forms that are supremely well
adapted to the task of displaying information.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we continue to use more and more of the stuff, even
though technology boosters have been predicting its disappearance
for decades. (``The Social Life of Information,'' a recent book by
John Seely Brown, chief scientist at Xerox, and Paul Duguid of the
University of California at Berkeley, includes an interesting
discussion of these issues.)
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the way they discussed the e-book market at Seybold,
Adobe and its partners seem to share the view that paper's place is
secure for now. In that sense I think their perspective is a lot
more realistic than that espoused by Microsoft, which doesn't even
allow printing from its new Microsoft Reader program
(www.microsoft.com/reader).
</P>
<P>
   PAPER 2.0: If I'm right about the continuing appeal of paper,
what will it take to make my vision of reusable, dead-tree-free
books and periodicals a reality?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I think, involves an emerging set of technologies
known variously as digital paper, electronic paper or electronic
ink. The basic idea _ I'm glossing over the details and the
differences among the various research teams headed in this general
direction _ is to laminate a layer of ultrafine circuitry onto
paper or paperlike plastic film. Then the material would be coated
with millions of microscopic beads. These beads might be black and
white, or contrasting colors, on opposite hemispheres, or they
might have white particles suspended in a dark liquid. Either way,
the color of each tiny bead can be switched by applying an
electrical charge through the circuitry embedded into the material.
</P>
<P>
   The result is something that looks and handles a lot like paper,
except that it can be digitally ``typeset,'' on the fly, to
resolutions comparable to those of ink on paper. Individual sheets
could be bound together into groups resembling newspapers,
magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   To load content into one, one might stick it into a virtual
printer or insert a little memory module _ perhaps something like a
Sony Memory Stick _ into the spine, or perhaps just pass a wand
across it. Or maybe it could all be done wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like pie in the sky, but I don't think so. Some
of the nation's top technologists have been working hard at it for
several years, particularly at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center _
the fabled Xerox PARC _ and a Massachusetts company called E Ink, a
spin-off of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's almost
equally celebrated Media Lab. Both of these teams last year paired
off with another technology powerhouse to develop the physical
media for their projects: Xerox with 3M, E Ink with Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   (Disclosure: As I perused the E Ink Web site, I discovered that
one of its investors is the Hearst Corp., The Chronicle's new owner
_ alongside IBM, Motorola, the McClatchy Newspapers and others.)
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox team gives an overview of its technology at
www.parc.xerox.com/dhl/projects/gyricon. E Ink has much more on its
site (www.eink.com), including a Flash animation and a bibliography
of published articles about the company and the technology. Among
the listings is an excellent history and overview of both
companies' work in this area at www.eink.com/company/wsj000104.htm.
</P>
<P>
   How far away are real products based on this research? E Ink has
already deployed its technology in experimental form, not in books
but in signs at selected J.C. Penney stores and in sandwich-board
signs for a Yahoo promotional campaign in New York City. The
company's Web site says, ``By the year 2003, we envision electronic
books that can display volumes of information as easily as flipping
a page, and permanent newspapers that update themselves daily via
wireless broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that may be overly optimistic _ I remember the
company's founder, Joseph Jacobson, saying something very similar
several years ago. There's also the question of price _ even if
it's available in 2003, it might still be prohibitively expensive
for years after that. When I asked John Seely Brown, Xerox's chief
scientist and until recently director of Xerox PARC, in an
interview last week how long it would be before my fantasy might
come true, he replied, ``Realistically, about a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't hold either Brown or E Ink to their predictions _ after
all, we're talking about truly cutting-edge technology here. But
I'm pretty well persuaded that one or both of them _ and maybe a
dark horse or two, too _ will deliver the goods before the 21st
century is out of its adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, e-books will be a really big thing.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SO YOU KNOW: If you've paid close attention to media
coverage of lastweek's Emulex stock-manipulation scam, you may have
noticed some inconsistencies about what the Costa Mesa company
actually does. Early accounts generally described it as a
manufacturer of fiber-optic networking gear.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable why it was described that way, considering
all the enormous publicity actual fiber-optic networking players
like JDS Uniphase of San Jose and Cerent of Petaluma have garnered
in recent months. But it's not quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   What the company actually does is manufacture cards and chips
that connect computers to storage devices _ hard drives _ via a
high-performance interface called Fibre Channel. It is, in effect,
a top-of-the-line, server-grade alternative to the ATA or SCSI
interfaces used on desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it has nothing much in common with the
optical-fiber communications gear that the likes of JDS Uniphase
and Cerent (now part of Cisco) make. In fact, unlike fiber-optic
communications, Fibre Channel usually doesn't involve glass fiber
cabling at all _ despite its name, it's usually run over copper
wire.
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious about it, you can learn more at
www.fibrechannel.com; Sun Microsystems also has a white paper
comparing Fibre Channel to other storage interfaces at
www.sun.com/storage/white-papers/fccomp.html.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, one could argue, the distinction I'm making is
beginning to erode, because the future of data storage may be not
inside individual PCs or servers, but in drives and drive farms
sitting out on the network. In another example of the technology
industry's knack for clear and catchy names, one of the two main
implementations of this approach is called NAS, for
networked-attached storage, and the other is known as SAN, for
storage-area networks. But those are topics for another day.

 &HT;    `WinBack' not a winner for long
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Operation WinBack'' starts off with a bang. The
introductory graphics are excellent, and despite a largely
fictional setting, the story line promises a degree of realism that
offers more in common with ``Rainbow Six'' than ``Tomb Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   Realism is clearly a focus of this third-person action game,
which involves a crack anti-terrorism team going into action
against a well-organized terrorist force that has seized control of
a strategic weapons satellite.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, although the contrived acronym of the
anti-terrorism team, (Strategic Covert Action Team, or SCAT), is
the first hint that things may not turn out as well as they
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, within minutes of entering the actual game action,
one realizes that ``WinBack'' has all the entertainment value of
filing paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   While the graphics are actually quite nice, if leaning toward
the gritty realism end of the spectrum, both the game controls and
the game action are poorly conceived. Despite the third-person
interface, the action is conceptually most similar to that of
``Virtua Cop'' on the Sega Saturn. In ``WinBack,'' the agent makes
his way through an apparently outside environment that is actually
a bidirectional maze composed by artfully placing various objects
in places that will constrain the movement possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is done in a fairly subtle manner and is not bothersome.
The occasional semi-trailer laid adroitly askew creates a nice bit
of ambience in addition to constraining your freedom of movement.
However, the camera is constantly moving almost perfectly out of
sync with your own movements, thus frequently leaving you exposed
in the enemy's line of sight while you are staring at a concrete
wall 90 degrees away from where the incoming fire is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The firing action is problematic, too. It's apparently not
possible to fire over open sights, but basic sighting is required
through the laser sight first, so firing a shot is a two-step
operation. This isn't too clumsy by itself and actually is a more
accurate simulation of a real handgun-firing process, but when
combined with the movement-camera confusion, leads to a tremendous
amount of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the game is linear, with the same enemies in the same
places every time, these challenges can be surmounted by
repetition, but playing an action game by rote is almost
counterproductive. At the end of the day, I say just bag the
operation and let the Crying Lions have the wretched satellite.

 &HT;    For ultimate protection, unplug cable
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Is turning off my netsharing on my cable modem protection enough
for my computer files? I also have a password-protected
screensaver. Is that protection enough against cable modem hackers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gerry Dupuis, Decatur, GA
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Let's reiterate a few things from an earlier TechSavvy
column. There are pitfalls associated with using a cable modem. The
ultimate way to protect yourself is to unplug the cable from the
back of your PC when you don't need to surf the Web. Another layer
of protection is to turn off File and Print Sharing in the Network
Control Panel on the PC, or FileSharing on the Macintosh, when
you're cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: But the best protection is a firewall. A firewall controls
traffic between your computer and the Internet and alerts you to
intruders. There is protection for Mac and PC. PC'ers can go to
www.networkice.com for BlackICE Defender and Mac'ers to
www.opendoor.com for DoorStop.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: While screensavers can prevent outsiders from accessing
your computer when they walk up to it, they don't protect you from
an open cable modem system.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Hackers would access your computer as if it were a
directory on their computer. They look for an unprotected directory
and ``walk'' right in. Hackers can get their mitts on your files
and do a lot of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Where's a good place to get a rebuilt laptop? Also, I was
looking for a toast for a 60th birthday bash. Where can I find this
on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Ayton
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You take the cake, Bill. Not sure anyone has asked
TechSavvy a question like this. Let's talk used equipment first.
When buying a pre-owned car, you always take a chance if you don't
know what road it's been down. The same goes for computers. Having
said that, computer resellers are worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Surf to IBM's Refurbished PC Warehouse
(commerce-03.www.ibm.com). The wares had a previous life as leased
computers. Mac loyalists can cruise to MacResQ (www.macresq.com/)
or Mac of all Trades (www
</P>
<P>
   .macofalltrades.com/). Of course, you also can find PC and Mac
laptops on eBay (ebay.com/). Keep your eye out for warranty
options.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: After price-checking used models, investigate new
equipment, too. I'd compare and contrast before ruling out
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Now, about that perfect toast for the birthday bash.
We're hip on tapping the power of the Web for anything and
everything, so zip over to
zinnia.umfacad.maine.edu/(tilde)donaghue/toasts.html. There's bound
to be something to your liking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got
Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month,
Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
is now allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on
cellular telephone and pager communications _ all without the
user's consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say
the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping
equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the
fledgling companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures,
known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a
return to Soviet-style political repression under current President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end to all E-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly
Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is
now only a click away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree
in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone
calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies _
the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st
century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the
measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
</P>
<P>
   The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their
networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed
fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency
to keep an eye on electronic transmissions _ from private e-mails
to e-commerce purchases _ in real-time and in total privacy.
Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say
cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000, will mean the loss of the
service provider's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications
Ministry, admits that the regulations _ the Orwellian-termed
``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' _ give the
government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security organs and special forces have the right, and now the
capability, to monitor private correspondence and telephone
conversations of individual citizens in the name of establishing
legal order,'' Rokotyan told Russian television in July. He
insisted, though, that SORM would be used only for ``monitoring
individual cases according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet surveillance has come under fire in many countries,
including the United States. In 1994, U.S. lawmakers authorized the
FBI to wiretap and eavesdrop on criminals conducting or discussing
crimes over the Internet. The measure was vehemently opposed, with
only limited success, in 1998 by civil liberties groups and telecom
businesses who viewed it as a threat to both profits and personal
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Russia say these same issues that
aroused opposition in the United States are magnified here because
there are virtually no checks-and-balances to prevent the FSB from
using their expansive powers to cross from law enforcement into
political blackmail and commercial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet (service) providers must render assistance in a criminal
case. But free access to the Internet gives the FSB great power
that would be easy to abuse,'' said Ina Zemskova, a lawyer with the
St. Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group. ``In
our country, no one monitors the eavesdroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the SORM regulations are fraught with
loopholes that allow the FSB to sidestep the required warrant
before conducting any electronic surveillance. That leaves
telecommunications firms in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know exactly what the FSB does in our network. We
cannot see what they are doing, when they are tapping in. We can
only trust that they are not working against our clients'
interests,'' said Mikhail Yakushev, the head of the legal
department at GlobalOne, a multinational telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 million people, or 4.8 percent of Russia's 145 million
population, are connected to the Internet. That number is expected
to rise to 8 percent of the population in the next three years,
according to Avi Krel, the telecom analyst at UFG investment bank
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although miniscule compared to the United States, this activity
has generated 2,000 Internet start-ups in the last two years. Just
over 300 businesses are licensed to provide Internet service here,
and some 20,000 Russian Websites offer search engines, chatrooms
and e-commerce outlets. Economists estimate Russia's dot-com
economy's annual turnover at around US$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Internet has offered Russians much more than
monetary gain. The information superhighway has spurred the growth
of environmental organizations, academics and a rising number of
government critics by connecting them across Russia's 11 time zones
that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the most outspoken opponents of government policy
are chatroom monitors or network operators themselves. They were
among the first to sound the alarm about SORM, leaving the
traditional media in their wake as they posted up-to-the-minute
news about the progress of the proposed regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Syrov, the director of an ISP based in the northern Russian
town of Volgograd, has become one of SORM's most vocal critics.
After denying the FSB access to his Bayara-Slavia Communications
network in 1998, Syrov said he received anonymous death threats. He
said he has also fought off multiple attempts by the FSB to shut
down his business.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman contacted about the allegations raised refused
to comment for this story,
</P>
<P>
   But around the rest of the marketplace, opposition to the
regulations among ISPs has weakened as the government's
determination to institute the surveillance measures have
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   While the Communications Ministry said the vast majority of
Internet providers are complying with SORM, all but one of the six
Moscow-based ISPs contacted for this story refused to say whether
they had installed the eavesdropping equipment. The exception _
GlobalOne _ said all of its hardware and software contained the
equipment necessary for the FSB to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance movement is as good as dead,'' said a grim
Alexander Levanchuk, the founder of www.libertarium.ru, a Russian
political Website and one of the people spearheading a legal
challenge to SORM. ``The FSB can outmuscle us, and it usually wins
these things.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Perhaps you're a gadget glutton, or maybe your
trash bin overfloweth with disposable income . . . Either way,
there's something very novel, overpriced and niche-market
functional waiting for you in Sharp's Internet Viewcam ($700;
www.sharp-usa.com), a digital minicam that requires no tape stock,
merely a removable, many-megabyte (four to 32) ``SmartMedia''
memory card and four AA batteries. It weighs in at a respectable
5.2 ounces at roughly the size of a hockey puck. Utilizing
relatively new ``MPEG-4'' digital video compression, this unit
targets the amateur or frugal Webmaster hoping to place thin,
middling-grade streaming motion pictures (or stills) of the
family's last camping trip on the Web or directly into
manageable-sized e-mail messages. Playback on the PC is exclusively
suited to Windows Media Player, a dangerous assumption on Sharp's
part Still, this is certainly a gadget that'll get your gizmo
going.

   TAKING YOUR GAME TO ANOTHER DIMENSION
</P>
<P>
   Bring your PC monitor to ``life,'' virtually, with VR Joy 2000
($70; www.vrstandard.com), a 3-D glasses bundle complete with
adapters and tweak software ``VR Caddy,'' which will turn any
DirectX or OpenGL graphics _ think games _ into simulated
three-dimensional extravaganzas, regardless of 3-D acceleration
programming or lack thereof. Creepy in that ViewMaster Viewer kind
of way, this stunning VR Standard peripheral has an edge over
similar products on the market as it is compatible with ``most''
VGA graphics cards (as opposed to units such as Elsa's 3-D
``Revelator,'' which works best with Elsa's cards and not so great
with everyone else's). The Joy2000's Line Blanker Controller Port
allows users to view ``stereoscopic'' images on the Internet
without additional hardware or software for the 3-D effect. In
fast-paced games such as Unreal Tournament or the bundled, complete
version of Systems Shock II, that effect is uncanny to the point of
distraction, but slower, more fluidly paced games are simply a joy
to play. There's also great viewing potential for your favorite Web
sites or screen saver. Bringing us that much closer to the virtual
reality of ``The Lawnmower Man,'' this is the fully immersive
technology of the day.

 &HT;    Long-distance mouse may solve DVD woe
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader has sent in a question dealing with a
peripheral matter on digital photography and in the process has
provided me with a lot more information than, I fear, I will be
able to give him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor describes himself as a ``high amateur''
photographer who once used a professional 35mm single-lens reflex
camera with multiple lenses. We all know people like him _ you look
at their pictures and say, ``Wow, you ought to be a professional.''
They smile and remark that they've already got enough problems,
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have now switched entirely to digital photography,'' Taylor
writes, ``and have used it exclusively on a three-week trip to
Scandinavia and two weeks in the Canadian Rockies. The pictures are
beautiful, and I was able to use my CD writer to make CDs to share
with many of my fellow travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also typical of these ``high amateur'' photographers _
they're unusually thoughtful and unsparing with their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use ACDSee to view these and it is quite simple, you just
use the mouse wheel to scroll between pictures without having to
load each one. It also does a small amount of editing (such as
giving the pictures names).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Kodak DC265 Camera, and it is great. The Sony
Mavica's pictures are not very good quality, in my opinion. I tried
one out but took it back after the trial. Incidentally, many stores
will allow you to try a camera for 30 days. I tried three different
ones before settling on my first Kodak, and I would encourage
people to do this to find the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentions the Mavica because we discussed that line a few
weeks back. The Mavicas store their images on floppies instead of
memory sticks, a nice idea, but the images made with them do not
compare well with other cameras in the same price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as prints go, I have a HP Photosmart P1100 Printer, and
the picture quality is as good as those from my 35 mm camera. They
do 8x10 pictures of a quality that is outstanding when done on a
photo-quality paper, and 5x7s on regular paper are better than what
I was getting from my old Canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and his wife come for Christmas, I take pictures, I
print them off and that afternoon, when they go to her mother's,
they have the pictures of our Christmas to share with her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it's hard to get the family around a 19-inch computer
screen. Many of the newer DVD players say they will play Video CDs,
but as far as I can tell these are only for moving pictures
formats. Is there a DVD Player that will play JPEGs?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know of one, but then I know next to nothing about DVD
players made exclusively for plugging into televisions. However, a
19-inch screen ought to be, in theory at least, nicely viewable
from a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Several firms, I believe, make a long-distance cordless mouse,
effective from clear across the room. Perhaps this would alleviate
your problem if not solve it, and many thanks for all the
information.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S SECURITY AGENCY NOW ALLOWED STEALTH MONITORING OF

<P>
   MOSCOW _ For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got
Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month,
Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
is now allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on
cellular telephone and pager communications _ all without the
user's consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say
the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping
equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the
fledgling companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures,
known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a
return to Soviet-style political repression under current President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end to all E-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly
Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is
now only a click away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree
in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone
calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies _
the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st
century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the
measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
</P>
<P>
   The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their
networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed
fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency
to keep an eye on electronic transmissions _ from private e-mails
to e-commerce purchases _ in real-time and in total privacy.
Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say
cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000, will mean the loss of the
service provider's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications
Ministry, admits that the regulations _ the Orwellian-termed
``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' _ give the
government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.

   Sad but true: Paranoia is going out of style. The world really
is becoming a treacherous place, and genuine security is getting
harder and harder to come by (OK, maybe paranoia is still somewhat
fashionable). Fortunately, Angel Watch Systems offers numerous
devices to keep tabs on that which is tabable. Its Wall Clock Cam
for example ($240; www.angelwatch.com) contains a high-quality,
wide-angle pinhole camera within its covertly homely face. Suited
to just about any room in which one would expect a nondescript
timekeeper, the Wall Clock Cam offers discreet remote viewing
and/or recording through a standard monitor and/or VCR. The Angel
Watch product line includes innumerable other spy devices such as
the Clock Radio Cam, the Pencil Sharpener Cam or the Thermostat
Cam. And hey, even if your paranoia isn't real, the various units
function normally, too.

   EFFICIENT? COUNT ON IT
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-Packard HP12C Financial Calculator ($70;
www.hewlettpackard.com) hasn't changed much since the 1980s but,
like the mouse trap, it's simply too efficient at what it does to
warrant an overhaul. Boasting some 120 functions, the likes of
which only number crunchers can truly appreciate, this calculator
does it all, as far as numbers go anyway. Pardon my Greek, but the
HP12C is nuts on Statistical Analysis (cumulative, standard
deviation/mean/weighted mean, forecasting, correlation coefficient,
yadda yadda yadda); stuffed with business/finance features and
digitally cognizant of TVM (number nerd jargon for Time Value of
Money), making it expedient with loans, savings, leasing,
amortization, interest-rate conversions, bond price and yield,
depreciation methods and whatnot. Perhaps I'm not the most apt
reviewer to review this functional numeric chewer and spitter, but
the financier in my family swears by it. So do millions of other
proud professionals.

   TEST MARKET MARVEL
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet-enabled Palm clearly demonstrates why
wireless Internet is the future of personal data assistants. The
Palm Vx (www.palm.com; $399) with OmniSky modem (www.omnisky.com;
$299, with $150 rebate for customers who sign up for at least six
months of wireless Internet service) offers quick and easy Net
access to well-known portals such as Yahoo, Excite and Go.com, and
browsing to non-graphic-intensive Web sites. It also supports up to
six POP3 e-mail accounts, a valuable tool for the business
traveler. By comparison, the Palm VII only gives you a ``palm.net''
address and no Web browsing. The OmniSky modem uses AT&AMP;T's wireless
network, offering access in 3,000 metropolitan areas; Atlanta is
the only notable exception. The Internet service is $39.95 a month
for unlimited usage. My favorite feature of this Palm-modem combo,
available now only in Austin and Seattle as test markets, is the
detachable modem, so if you want to Palm sans Internet, you're
holding a svelte 3.9-ounce machine. With the modem, the setup is
about twice as thick and weighs 8.5 ounces, still sleek by any
measure.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' by Crave
Entertainment generated a lot of buzz at this year's Electronic
Entertainment Expo. The fighting simulator, based on the
pay-per-view event, featured outstanding visuals and game play.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated title finally hit stores Wednesday, and
Dreamcast owners should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been disappointed by the clunky graphics, clumsy
control and lack of depth of many boxing and wrestling games,
``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' will slap a smile on your face.
</P>
<P>
   Just like its namesake, ``Ultimate Fighting Championship''
showcases a rich variety of competitors and fighting styles around
the globe. Wrestling, boxing, submission fighting, sumo, jiu-jitsu
and kickboxing are just a few disciplines of the 22 initial
fighters. With this assortment, you can see some interesting
matches. The heavyweight, Andre Roberts, has some devastating
punches, but if he is taken to the mat by a Brazilian jiu-jitsu
fighter, his probability of winning is slim.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get a chance to compete and observe the extensive array
of styles and moves with six different fighting modes. The training
mode is a great starting point to learn the fighting systems and
various attacks of the characters. From there you can move on to
UFC mode and pummel your way to the championship belt. If you want
to develop your own custom fighter, you can check out the career
mode. In this mode, you can choose your fighter's build,
appearance, discipline and list of moves to be used against
competitors in other modes.
</P>
<P>
   A feature that sets it apart from other sports/fighting titles
is the realistic graphics and character animation. Once the
competitors strut through the crowded arena, you know you are in
for a visual treat. Character models are very smooth and lifelike.
The faces are scanned from the actual fighters and mapped to 3-D
models, creating a high degree of realism. Other authentic details
such as tatoos and natural skin tones distinguish each character.
</P>
<P>
   The animation complements the graphic realism nicely.
Motion-capture techniques were used to create the animations, and
it's evident there was a lot of fine-tuning applied to get the
motions just right. Movements are very fluid and don't have that
sluggish feel typical of so many wrestling games. There is also a
good sense of impact when a punch or kick connects.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all of the realistic visuals is the true heart of this
game _ the fighting system. Offense and defense are very balanced.
Button-mashing players may get lucky at other fighting games, but
if they don't conserve their energy and block properly, one swift
uppercut will send them to the floor. Learning how to counter and
defend properly is just as important as tackling and striking.
</P>
<P>
   As good as this game is, it may not be for everyone. This is not
a typical 3-D fighting game. There aren't any ninjas, projectile
attacks or supercharged lightning punch combos. Games like ``Soul
Calibur'' and ``Dead or Alive 2'' are good choices for that type of
fighting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' is a realistic fighting
simulation, and if that's what you're looking for, then this is by
far your best bet.

 &HT;    Fighter likes Sega game's close reflection of himself
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tito ``Bad Boy'' Ortiz is the reigning Ultimate
Fighting middleweight champion. He also is a video game junkie.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz praised Crave Entertainment's newest title, ``Ultimate
Fighting Championship'' for the Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the best fighting games I ever played,'' Ortiz
said over the telephone from Huntington Beach, Calif. ``I play lots
of video games, and it is tremendous how (Crave) can put everything
from the sport of UFC into the video game. They both look identical
to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, 25, is one of the most recognizable faces in the console
title, which also includes such big names as Frank Shamrock, ``Big
Daddy'' Gary Goodridge, Mark ``The Hammer'' Coleman and Maurice
Smith. UFC legends such as Ken Shamrock, Tank Abbott and Dan Severn
disappointingly have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game, Ortiz looks just like he does in real life:
bleached-blond hair and muscular upper body with his trademark
tattoos on both arms and skinny legs. Ortiz's fighting style is
both submission and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each character in the game, including myself, is accurately
(depicted),'' Ortiz said. ``All of my punches and kicks are exactly
the same. It's like, `Whoa ... I'm watching myself on TV in a video
game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz says his character is the best fighter in the game. At the
E3Expo last May in Los Angeles, Ortiz squared off with Frank
Shamrock in five matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won four of them and let Shamrock beat me in one just to be
nice,'' said Ortiz, with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of UFC's stars, Ortiz thinks the video game will
heavily increase the popularity and understanding of the sport. UFC
is sanctioned in only eight states. Ortiz says once people play the
video game, they will realize UFC does not deserve its ``outlaw''
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are just not educated on the sport because
when it first came out, it was a real bloody,'' Ortiz said. ``Now
it's totally different; UFC has gone through an evolution. The
fighters are so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about punching and kicking anymore. You have to
use techniques. It's just not the no-holds-barred, bloody sport it
used to be. I train eight hours a day for my bouts, and I am a
professional athlete. This game should give our sport a lot of good
PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is a former college wrestler who attracted the attention
of the UFC after being a sparring partner with Abbott. His most
memorable bout was at UFC XXII, when he took the still-undefeated
Frank Shamrock nearly to the distance. Ortiz charged Shamrock, who
unloaded three powerful elbow strikes to end the fight with 11
seconds remaining in the fourth round.

BIG FAT MESS IS CAUSING ERROR MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I would have sent this question by e-mail, but
my system is down for the count. Everything was frozen.
Control-Alt-Delete would not work. Now I'm getting this message
after the system starts: ``ScanDisk encountered a data error while
reading the FAT in Drive C.'' I tried to reinstall Windows 98, but
when it finished loading files and rebooted the system, it froze
again. Is there any fix for this that doesn't require me to
reformat Drive C?
</P>
<P>
   -- Critical Condition
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CRITICAL: Yes, but it involves a very large wooden mallet.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had a better answer for you, but look at the bright
side: All that physical exertion will flood your body with
endorphins, and you'll forget your worries in no time at all. Not
buying it, are you? Oh, well. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's normal for ScanDisk to run after an improper Windows
shutdown, like when you hit the reset button or the power suddenly
goes bye-bye. And you didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes,
computers freeze for no apparent reason, and absolutely the only
way to get things running again is to turn them off. When the beast
starts back up, ScanDisk checks your hard drive and tries to repair
any errors the bad shutdown may have created.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the way it's supposed to work. Unfortunately, it
looks like you've got some errors in your FAT, the file allocation
table. I often compare it to the table of contents of my
comprehensive journalism textbook from college. After I
accidentally ripped out those pages to mop up a spilled beer, there
was no way I could ever find the chapters on ethics and responsible
reporting, so I just gave up looking. That's what your PC is doing,
although there probably wasn't any beer involved. It can't find all
the files needed to make your computer work.
</P>
<P>
   The FAT is such a mind-bogglingly important file that there's
always a backup copy, just in case the real one gets corrupted. One
of the things ScanDisk tries to do is restore a corrupted FAT from
the backup, assuming it can find the thing and it isn't hammered,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Your last hope might be a better disk-repair program, such as
Disk Doctor, part of Symantec's Norton Utilities suite. I wouldn't
bet the farm on it, though. Maybe you should just think of this
whole episode as a wonderful opportunity to make a completely clean
start with your computer. Not buying that either? I didn't think
so. I must be losing my touch.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I bought a computer from a very close and
trusted friend (mistake). I allowed my wife to use said computer
(mistake). She found all the Web sites my trusted friend and his
spouse visited. How can I completely erase everything, or did I
make the third mistake: buying this unit?
</P>
<P>
   -- The Original Novice
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOVICE: Mistake? C'mon, guy, this is your chance to
blackmail your friend for years to come. Listen, I told you I
didn't read that ethics chapter.
</P>

<P>
   They seem the picture of health. But there are alarming signs
that athletes are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with
the unrelenting drive toward excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most athletes say that they are happy to die early if it means
that they could win Olympic gold,'' says exercise physiologist
Richard Winsley of Exeter University. ``That's the mindset we are
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although deaths are rare, sportsmen and women are falling ill
with an ever-widening range of ailments. Many are caused by one
particular problem, overtraining syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``People train harder and harder,'' says sports physiologist
David Jones at Birmingham University. ``But the more they train,
their performance gets worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fatigue, sore muscles, loss of energy, frequent
infections and mood disturbances. To arrest this decline, sufferers
push themselves even harder. ``But of course that's the worst thing
they can do,'' says Winsley.
</P>
<P>
   Overtraining syndrome troubles around 65 per cent of endurance
athletes at some point in their careers. Now the problem is
starting to appear in sprinters and power athletes too. ``They
present primarily with changes in mood with subsequent changes in
performance,'' says Richard Budgett of the British Olympic
Association. Although rest is the usual cure, sometimes the
condition becomes increasingly hard to treat.
</P>
<P>
   When we exercise normally, the body releases hormones such as
cortisol and growth hormone to help cope with the stress. ``If you
do it over and over, the hormonal responses become abnormal,'' says
Jones. Chronic high levels of cortisol can lead to muscle wasting,
loss of bone and a suppressed immune system. The result can be
recurrent injuries such as stress fractures, and minor infections
such as colds that won't clear up.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes overtraining syndrome may have similar origins to
chronic fatigue syndrome. Some doctors think that the reason people
with CFS find easy tasks arduous is that they are hypersensitive to
the neurotransmitter serotonin, which tells the brain how active
the body is.
</P>
<P>
   Jones thinks that overtrained athletes also sometimes become
abnormally sensitive to serotonin, and that this leads to feelings
of extreme tiredness. He is currently testing buspirone, a drug
that mimics serotonin to see whether these athletes show the same
sensitivity to the drug as CFS patients do.  &QL;

<P>
   Keep your eyes peeled. Among this year's gold medallists you
might see something close to the perfect athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes have consistently shattered records throughout the past
century. But now they are pushing against the very limits of human
potential, say researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improvement is real. But it's starting to level off in
most events,'' says Frangois Pironnet, a sports physiologist at the
University of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there will never be new records. But as
athletes begin to hit the ceiling of human ability, we'll no longer
expect each year's performance to be better than the last. For
example, in the classic running events even the best athletes are
finding it increasingly hard to run faster than the champion before
them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, new world records will occur randomly, just like
record-breaking rainfall or droughts. Take the men's 1500-meter
event. The world record of 3 minutes 26 seconds was set only two
years ago. But Pironnet says results from the past 15 years are
essentially random. From now on, the best times for that event may
scatter around the 3:26 mark _ sometimes a little better, sometimes
a little worse, but with no overall trend toward faster times.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are already trying to predict the ultimate human
performance. Robert W. Schutz, a statistician at the University of
British Columbia, has made predictions based on past performances
in seven track and field events and projected them into the future.
He calculates that by the year 2050 the marathon will be run in 2
hours 2 minutes 39 seconds (2:02:39), just three minutes faster
than the current best time of 2:05:42. Schutz has also projected
the ``asymptotic value'' for each sport _ the point at which for
all practical purposes progress will stop _ based on the flattening
performance curves.
</P>
<P>
   Pironnet has drawn up his own projections of what the ultimate
athlete may be capable of. He has tried to isolate those
physiological factors that limit performance. Pironnet combined lab
studies and performance statistics to spot changes in anaerobic and
aerobic power and endurance in runners over time. On the basis of
these figures, he suggests that over the next 50 years, record
times will begin to hit these limits.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more doubtful. ``Every time someone says we've
reached the limit, somebody else goes out and breaks a record,''
says Carl Foster at the University of Wisconsin in La Crosse.

<P>
   Arguments over whether to store or reprocess nuclear waste have
been thrown into confusion following a change of heart by the
British Atomic Energy Authority (AEA).
</P>
<P>
   In April, the AEA said the costs of both options were
``comparable'' if plutonium is defined as waste. Now New Scientist
has learned that a confidential draft of the report, completed in
January, concluded that storage ``has a large advantage'' because
it is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The government is considering whether to reprocess or store 25
tons of plutonium fuel from a defunct reactor run by the AEA at
Dounreay in Scotland. The April report was part of a public
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The draft was obtained from the Scottish Environment Protection
Agency by lawyers acting for the group Nuclear Free Local
Authorities. Jamie Woolley, legal adviser to the group, is now
calling on the government not to agree to funding for reprocessing
at Dounreay until it has studied the earlier, draft report. ``It
looks like the AEA has attempted to suppress a conclusion that it
doesn't like,'' he claims.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA denies this. It says the conclusion was altered because
the draft underestimated the cost of treating spent fuel before it
was stored.  &QL;

<P>
   Physicists think they've caught tantalizing glimpses of the
elusive particle that gives matter its mass.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working with a giant particle detector called ALEPH
at the CERN particle physics laboratory near Geneva say a handful
of oddball collisions may mark the fleeting appearance of the Higgs
boson. The Higgs is a crucial piece in the jigsaw of fundamental
particles. Finding it is currently the big prize for particle
physicists.
</P>
<P>
   The machine that produced these events, the Large Electron
Positron Collider (LEP), is scheduled to close down for good at the
end of this month. So the ALEPH researchers have precious little
time to collect enough data to confirm their observation.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Higgs boson, or some more convoluted explanation,
the Universe as we know it wouldn't exist. Postulated more than 30
years ago, the Higgs gives particles such as quarks and electrons
their mass. Particles swim through a sea of hidden Higgs bosons,
which drag on them and produce inertia, the essence of mass.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have been searching for the Higgs for more than a
decade. Although Higgs particles are extremely massive, they are
normally hard to spot because they exist only ``virtually.'' Higgs
particles exploit the inherent uncertainty in quantum mechanics to
pop in and out of existence for only the briefest of instants, too
short a time to be observed.
</P>
<P>
   To see a Higgs, physicists have to manufacture one by smashing
extremely fast-moving particles together. The energy of the
collision is converted into matter, and if the energy is high
enough, a bona fide Higgs may pop into existence. Having done so,
it decays into a telltale combination of other particles.
</P>
<P>
   Such decays could account for several unusual events observed
recently at LEP, ALEPH researchers said this week at a meeting at
CERN. But they admit that their evidence is not yet conclusive.
``It's unfortunately not enough to say we have made a discovery,''
says ALEPH's Wolf-Dieter Schlatter.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the events are chance combinations of random
particles, or fakes produced by familiar particles such as Z bosons
decaying in just the right way to mimic a Higgs. Such explanations
are made more likely by the fact that none of the other three
particle detectors arrayed around LEP has seen any sign of Higgs
events.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether CERN should keep LEP running to try to
confirm the Higgs sighting. ALEPH researchers could double their
data if LEP ran until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-kilometer-long LEP, housed in a ring-shaped tunnel
straddling the Swiss-French border, has already painted detailed
portraits of the W and Z bosons, and has proved that there can be
no more than six quarks. It is due to be dismantled to make way for
a new machine in the same tunnel, the Large Hadron Collider,
scheduled to begin hunting for the Higgs particle in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, CERN's great rival, Fermilab near Chicago, may
find the Higgs first. Fermilab will resume colliding beam
experiments this month, after more than four years of renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the ALEPH team may be making too much of too little.
``You wonder if it's just a way for them to extend their running
time,'' says Dave Besson of the University of Kansas in Lawrence.
ALEPH collaborator Alan Litke rejects this suggestion. ``We have no
interest,'' he says, ``in running LEP for the sake of running
LEP.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   That's right. According to a recent study, 70 percent of
Gnutella users take files from others but don't give away any of
their own. Apparently, some people weren't listening that day in
the sandbox when the teacher taught all the good little boys and
girls the virtues of sharing. Or perhaps they misunderstood the
immortal words of Polonius _ ``Neither a borrower nor a lender be''
_ and thought he said, ``To take is human, but to give endangers
your hard drive.'' Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it really shouldn't come as any surprise that
Napster and Gnutella are full of free loaders. Human nature is no
different on the Internet than it is in real life _ despite all
that idealistic chatter about the great digital democracy. It's why
utopian communities never work: Some folks bear the brunt of the
load, while everybody else coasts. When is the last time you threw
a potluck dinner and a few people brought lobster and caviar while
others showed up with the gastronomic equivalent of a can of soup
(or empty-handed, even worse)?
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the Gnutella study call this phenomenon the
``tragedy of the digital commons'' and suggest that it could lead
to the collapse of the file sharing craze. ``The social dilemma
rears its ugly head,'' says Bernardo A. Huberman, co-author of the
study and a research fellow at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. He
and his colleague, Eytan Adar, monitored Gnutella for 24 hours
earlier this month and discovered two different kinds of free
riders: those who don't share at all and those who share
undesireable files that nobody ever downloads (like the people who
donate junk to the local library and keep all the good books for
themselves).
</P>
<P>
   The study also claims that the top 1 percent of Gnutella users
contribute 40 percent of the total files shared, and the top 20
percent of users provide 98 percent of all files traded. Gnutella
was designed as an alternative to Napster, which is being sued by
the Recording Industry Association of America for copyright
infringement. Unlike Napster, Gnutella does not have a central
server; the idea is that if there is no central repository, there
is no one to sue. But when a few users are responsible for the bulk
of the shared files, those traders become vulnerable, the study
claims. ``If you hide in a crowd and you are among the 17 people
wearing a red jacket, everyone will notice,'' says Huberman.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? Teach the kids how to share? Watch the lawyers
get richer? Huberman, for one, doesn't think file sharing networks
will grow as fast as the entertainment industry fears _ unless
someone develops an incentive to encourage people to cooperate. One
thing's for sure. Peer pressure alone doesn't work. When you opt
out of sharing on Scour Exchange, a window pops up with this
message: ``Sharing your files helps the community. Are you sure you
want to disable file sharing?'' According to an unofficial study I
conducted among friends, the answer is usually yes.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman himself is a case in point. He says he only used
Napster once, when he tried unsuccessfully to locate a certain
Schumann quartet. Did he share his files? ``No,'' he admits,
laughing. ``I was a free rider as well, I guess _ but I was just
testing the system.'' That's what they all say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Roger, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive hiding out in Berlin was nabbed Monday, only a week
after he went underground. The contestant in an interactive game
was apprehended after bounty hunters gleaned information about him
on the game's Web site, www.RealityRun.com.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Roger isn't really Roger. He says he is a
``normal Dutch guy,'' but he doesn't live in Amsterdam. He lives
near Frankfurt and speaks fluent German, even though the game's
organizers claimed that his German was nicht sehr gut.
Disinformation on the Internet? Shocking!
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Roger to divulge his real name now. ``I signed a
contract to keep my mouth shut,'' he says. He's now working as a
consultant to the game's organizers, who plan to repeat the manhunt
in several cities before a final Reality Run in New York next year.
As for his sudden celebrity, Roger says he was touched by
conversations in the Reality Run chat rooms. ``People said, `I love
you.' It was incredible. It wasn't love in the McDonald's way. It
was real.'' Really. Roger. Over and out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Oh, the irony.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Web animation company Camp Chaos produced
an animated series poking fun of the recording industry's response
to Napster. That series got the attention of executives at Warner
Bros. Records, who hired the firm to produce a series for its
annual meeting. In the new cartoon, record execs Howie Klein and
Phil Q hire Tony Soprano to send Napster for a ride down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine until Sunday, when Camp Chaos posted the
series on its Web site; suddenly it wasn't a laughing matter.
Warner Bros. demanded that the files be taken down. Camp Chaos
president Bob Cesca says he thought he had negotiated a lower fee
in order to maintain the rights for Web distribution. The Warner
Bros. folks contend that the films were commisioned for private
viewing only. Cesca complied: ``I'm not into the idea of getting
into a battle with Warner Bros.,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's already too late. Thousands of people have already
downloaded the first two films, and they're being traded on Scour
Exchange and Gnutella. Cesna isn't sure if he will be able to post
the rest of the series, though, which leaves a lot of unanswered
questions. Will Tony nab Napster? Will Phil Q and Howie K defend
their honor? And what about all those free riders? Will they learn
to share or will the network implode?
</P>
<P>
   As they say in Hollywood, To Be Continued.

THIEVERY'S FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My late father often entertained cops at his secondhand store on
the west side of Chicago. They popped in to make sure he wasn't
peddling stolen goods. When they left, Daddy didn't go with them,
so I assume he was clean, or at least very clever.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations
would have come to his defense. But some purveyors of stolen goods
have friends in high places. Just look at who's going to bat for
Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge
Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against
Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of
their favorite tunes without paying for them. Essentially, Patel
agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's
primary business is the facilitation of thievery. She ordered
Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned
legal team an opportunity to recoup. Meanwhile, an extraordinary
group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a
conservative group best known for its successful campaign against
the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange
of ideas over the Internet. They warn that corporations may use the
Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its
intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide
authorized links on Ritalin?'' this brief thunders. ``The outcome
would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively
silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record companies aren't complaining about people who
post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album. They're upset
about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to
facilitate such theft. Consider the following quote from a Napster
official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but
pushing demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a
powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics
Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP;
Communications Industry Association. Among them, these three groups
represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer
hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped
write this amicus brief. It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing
defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster
should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists. Still, their
argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a
point with a good deal of merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some
obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be
a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie
studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette
recorders?
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony
Corp. for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders. The
Betamax machines were a license to steal, the movie moguls alleged.
People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV
programs that would cost the studios billions. There was only one
solution _ ban Betamax.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed. Fortunately,
the US Supreme Court stepped in. In 1984, the court ruled that even
if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property,
the devices also had many legitimate uses. It would therefore be
foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel
didn't try to ban Napster. Her ruling leaves the company free to
offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital
music.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom
tells you all you need to know. It's a tacit admission of the
obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet
ensure that the music thefts will continue. But that doesn't change
the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for
forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot
merchandise generally get burned.

&HT;     DATABASE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PESTICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pesticide Action Network, a San
Francisco-based environmental group, on Thursday introduced the
first comprehensive on-line database on the health hazards of more
than 5,100 ingredients in Sevin and other home and garden
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think that if the EPA allows a pesticide to be
sold, it must be safe to use,'' said Susan Kegley, coordinator of
the project and staff scientist at Pesticide Action Network.
``Unfortunately, that's not true, and finding out whether a
particular pesticide is linked to cancer, birth defects or other
problems can be extremely difficult. That's why our new database is
so important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pesticide Action Network's new site (www.pesticideinfo.org)
supplies information on whether a pesticide is a carcinogen,
affects reproduction or human development, or causes other harm to
health. The database tells which chemicals pollute ground water or
kill aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for the information include the World Health
Organization, National Institutes of Health, National Toxicology
Program and the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at the brand name Sevin identifies it as carbaryl,
a class of neurotoxic compounds. The EPA considers it a possible
carcinogen, and some scientists suspect it of being a chemical that
can disrupt the endocrine system, which produces hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Sevin can disable an enzyme, cholinesterase, which affects the
transmission of nerve impulses. Exposure may cause neurological
damage in developing fetuses and infants.
</P>
<P>
   Sevin has been used to help eradicate the glassy-winged
sharpshooter, a bug that leaves behind a virus that attacks plants
and has already infested crops in San Diego, Riverside, San
Bernardino, Orange, Los Angeles, Kern, Ventura, Santa Barbara
counties and parts of Sacramento, San Luis Obispo, Tulare and
Fresno counties.
</P>
<P>
   There the state Department of Food and Agriculture approved
spraying Sevin around houses in some of these counties. Dursban, or
chlorpyrifos, has been sprayed near Porterville on commercial
nursery stock.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like this, as with spraying in New York's Central Park
to fight the West Nile virus, Kegley said, the public can use the
new database to develop informed opinions on government decisions.

 &HT;    Animal experts say humans will always be in charge, but being
the family dog nowadays isn't such a bad gig
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - Anything outside of pampering a dog these days
seems almost uncivilized.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, we treat our furry friends like royalty. They're
groomed and bathed at special salons, fed premium food and given
Christmas gifts. They sleep in our beds and spend their days at pet
day care while we slave away at work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, city leaders in Boulder, Colo., recently passed a law
naming pet ``owners'' as pet ``guardians.'' But are all these
things really necessary to give Fido and Fluffy a good life?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my clients has a dog that goes to the beauty shop every
Friday to be groomed,'' said Marilyn Harkness, owner of pet-sitting
business in Waco. ``He has a standing appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pet owners consider their cats and dogs to be part of the
family, according to the American Animal Hospitals Association. But
let's be honest _ some are treated even better.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time Buster was told he had to finish his
plate before dessert? Don't think dogs get dessert? Hundreds of
bakeries catering to pet palates have opened across the country
during the last few years. Now, Fido can kick the monotony of Alpo,
Alpo, Alpo. Want to see that tail wag? Let him sink those K-9s into
some wheat germ bonbons covered with crushed peanuts or carrot
cupcakes or cinnamon and carob biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   All this pampering and primping of our four-legged friends has
some people wondering, though, exactly who owns whom _ who's
holding the leash and who's being led by it.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Woodbury, public-relations manager for the animal
hospitals association, said pets will always be at the beck and
call of their human masters. No matter how easy a dog's life may
seem, pets will always be property.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't always so bad, he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all that (pampering) reinforces the high value people
place on their pets,'' Woodbury said. ``There is a very serious
bond there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder law, which passed in July, emphasizes the status of
pets as living beings _ not simply property and is designed to curb
the abuse and neglect of animals. But councilman Gordon Riggle, the
lone opponent of the measure, said he sees the change as simply a
feel-good move with no legal consequences, and that, he added, is a
bad way to legislate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people call it the leading edge,'' Riggle said. ``Others
call it over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most cases, there's absolutely no problem convincing
people to pay special attention to their pets _ excuse us, those
other living beings in the house who have a lot of hair.
</P>
<P>
   One third of ``guardians'' talk to their furry companions on the
phone when they're away from home, according to animal hospitals
association studies. Nearly two-thirds say caring for their pet
fulfills a need for parenting. Health insurance for dogs and cats
is a booming business.
</P>
<P>
   Showering pets with all this humanity wasn't always the norm,
experts say. Back in the old days, back before we could talk to
Fido through the answering machine, he was around for more
practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to look at pets in a utilitarian view,'' said H.
Richard Adams, dean of the Texas A&AMP;M School of Veterinary Medicine.
``They were used to work or protect property. Now, they're viewed
more as companions. That's why people value them so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Woodbury said there are no definitive studies that
suggest today's pampered dog is a happier, more well-adjusted
creature.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the reality is, most dogs like to stink. Just ask local
groomers and dog ``guardians.'' A few minutes after Fido gets
through with his bath, you can usually find him rubbing his face
and hairy body in the yard, which, upon closer inspection, often
includes things we'd rather not print in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a pampered dog is one that sleeps in bed with you,''
said Shirlene Miller, owner of Tidy Tails Dog Grooming &AMP; Boarding.
``That's another reason to bathe them and keep them clean. But that
can be hard to do. One dog (after we bathed it), ran across some
dead frogs and rubbed against them.''
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Ortman, director of the Waco Humane Society Animal Shelter,
believes dogs should be treated like dogs, not humans. Even with
that view, she admits, some pets seem almost like children. Many
dogs who have to go through surgery at her clinic are calm until
their guardians show up and start showering them with sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't start whining until they see their owner come in,''
Ortman said. ``They enjoy the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said dogs who are groomed even seem to ``primp'' when
they first get home. But concluding that the clean, well-shaven dog
really feels like a sexier beast may not be the case, experts say.
The dog likely knows that he or she will be showered with affection
and may prance around looking for the next round of petting.
</P>
<P>
   Ortman has seen dogs with diamond earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets do what their owners do because they want the
attention,'' Ortman said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that your dog won't get into eating sirloin
steak every night. But Buster probably doesn't care about watching
the Animal Planet with you. When you talk to him and pet him while
you're in front of the TV, now that's what he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's taking proper care of your pet and providing for its
welfare,'' Adams said. ``Then there's pampering.''
</P>
<P>
   Caring for your dog includes feeding it things that help teeth
stay strong. Diamond-studded earrings are not necessary (and don't
do much to impress the other dogs, experts say). Showering your dog
with affection and spending time together on long walks is a
healthy routine for owner and pet. Talking to them through the
answering machine is optional.
</P>
<P>
   Getting your pet vaccinated and having periodic checkups is
necessary. Letting them sleep in bed with you is not. Providing a
healthy diet for your pet is necessary. Feeding him table scraps is
not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, feeding a dog human food (or letting him have too much
specialty pet foods) can lead to obesity, a common problem these
days with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm a firm proponent of the human/animal bond, it comes
with responsibility,'' Adams said. ``Owners have to look out for
the health and well-being of their pets and that doesn't mean
letting the dog do whatever it wants. Most dogs would like to run
free through the neighborhood without a leash, but that's not safe
for the dog. They would like to eat a lot of the foods we eat, but
that's not good for them either.''
</P>
<P>
   What about owners who insist their dogs stay inside where it's
air conditioned? Aren't dogs simply domesticated descendents of
wolves who have to deal with things like heat waves and cold
fronts?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at what the dogs are bred for,'' Ortman said.
``Some dogs would go crazy inside. They like being outside. But
poodles are different. They've been bred to be house dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said pampering doesn't just come in the home. It's on the
road, too. Many pet owners take their significant four-legged
others on cross-country vacations. While some dogs adjust well to
being in a car, owners should watch to be sure the dog isn't overly
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you won't have to worry about, though, is finding a
place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are special hotels that will accept pets,'' Miller said.
``More and more are beginning to do it. They have to, because pets
are such a big part of our lives.''

 &HT;    `Asunder' is a noble effort, undermined by creaky story
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - About the only time you hear the word ``asunder''
is at weddings: ``What God therefore has joined together, let no
man put asunder'' _ Matthew 19:6. But the word carries a sense of
the chaotic. A marriage put asunder doesn't just come apart; it
explodes, flinging shrapnel that rips through souls.
</P>
<P>
   That's what director Tim Reid's film ``Asunder'' attempts to
depict: an emotional explosion that rips through two couples who
initially appear to have everything.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Asunder'' has its moments, its laborious pacing, uneven
acting and often weak dialogue make it only average.
</P>
<P>
   Asunder starts with two couples at a carnival. Michael (Michael
Beach) and Lauren (Debbi Morgan) apparently have some tension
between them, but Michael's best friend Chance (Blair Underwood)
and his very pregnant wife, Roberta (Marva Hicks), are obviously
ecstatic to be together. Before the first scene is over, however,
Roberta and Chance fall from a Ferris wheel in a freak accident.
Chance escapes with minor injuries, but Roberta and the baby die.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving trio comes together after the tragedy, at first
offering one another support. But past betrayals, guilt and
jealousy will never let them heal.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of ``Asunder'' plays like a soap opera _ Lauren
is overwrought because she and Chance had an affair before
Roberta's death; Michael is guilt-ridden because it was his idea to
ride the Ferris wheel, and he's dissatisfied because Lauren won't
have his baby; Chance puts his dead wife and child out of his mind
by becoming obsessed with Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   But the last half of the movie slips from soap to slash as
Chance's obsession turns violent. Unfortunately, Underwood is never
quite credible either as grieving husband or knife-wielding psycho,
and his failings rob much of the movie's emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Morgan, on the other hand, is stellar. Her sex appeal has
always been undeniable, but in ``Asunder'' she shows range and
depth in a role that requires her to be sarcastic, anxious,
heartbroken, alluring and terror-stricken in rapid succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder'' is the first feature from New Millenium Studios,
which was founded by Tim Reid, television actor turned
producer/director. The film had a red-carpet premiere in Dayton
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has said he's interested in making movies for mature,
black, middle-class audiences to give them alternatives to the
teen-oriented fare he says mainstream Hollywood produces for the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder,'' is essentially a typical Hollywood movie about
troubled, affluent suburbanites with black performers slipped into
roles whites would usually play. Race never becomes an issue, and
aside from a few ``hip'' verbal exchanges between Michael and
Chance, the ethnicity of the characters is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It's refreshing to see black characters running businesses and
hiring waiters to serve guests at a Christmas party in their home.
It's too bad, however, there wasn't a better script to go along
with the fancy clothes and the nice sets.

 &HT;    Consumers face the daily dilemma of up-sizing their meals or
thinking about portion control
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - At 42, LuAnn Soliah isn't a kid anymore, but she
plays one at fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But to avoid any disputes about her age qualifications when she
orders happy meals and kids club specials, Soliah usually goes
through the drive-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go inside, sometimes they won't let you order off the
children's menu unless you're under 12,'' the Baylor University
nutrition professor said. ``If you go through the drive-through
they usually think it's for someone else. Sometimes they look at me
and ask if I want the toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliah isn't trying to save money by going with small orders.
And, for the record, she usually turns down the complimentary toys.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah, like millions of Americans, is trying to eat healthily.
But paying attention to nutrition in today's eat-out era doesn't
just mean watching what she eats. It means watching how much she
eats.
</P>
<P>
   Portion sizes at fast-food and sit-down restaurants are getting
bigger and bigger, Soliah and other nutritionists warn. Most
vending machines offer 20-ounce bottles of soda, instead of the
12-ounce size. Whataburger offers a 44-ounce drink, more fit for
snorkeling in than drinking. There's the Bacon Ultimate
Cheeseburger at Jack in the Box _ with two thick and juicy pieces
of meat, of course. Burger King recently added a super-size option
to its kids meal, calling them Big Kids Meals. And at most pizza
joints, the term ``small'' is blasphemy. Entry-level pizzas at
Domino's are ``medium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, you're not going to want to go back to a
place that serves small portions,'' said Janelle Walter, a
professor in the Baylor department of family/consumer science.
``The servings are large so you'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``portion distortion,'' as nutritionists call it, has
customers financially satisfied but nutritionally bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are at a restaurant and get a plate that has two big
pieces of chicken-fried steak, they'll do their best to eat it all,
even though it's more than they need,'' Walter said. ``When I'm at
restaurants, a lot of times I wish I could get something off the
senior citizens menu because it's usually the right amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating a colossally-huge, extra-jumbo order of french fries, for
instance, isn't what our bodies need, Walter and Soliah say. The
worst part for the health of the average drive-through addict is
that it's usually the less healthy parts of take-out meals _ like
fries and calorie-filled soft drinks _ that are up-sized,
nutritionists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is more Americans are eating out as part of their
normal lifestyle,'' said Kathryn Cortes, a dietitian at Providence
Health Center in Waco. ``And (restaurants) aren't offering extra
large salads or servings of vegetables. Actually, vegetables are
one of the most expensive items.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortes and Soliah said the problem with all this is that the
biggest portions are marketed as the best deals. In fact, 40
percent of adults say they feel like restaurants encourage people
to order the largest-size portions, according to a study by the
National Restaurant Association. Convenience stores often sell
their 44-ounce thirst-quenching, mega drinks for less than smaller
sizes, practically forcing customers to drown themselves in the
carbonated drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was wrong with a 12-ounce drink?'' Soliah said. ``Now,
you get their huge drinks. You don't want or need that much to
quench your thirst. But it's such a good deal, you end up buying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The health problem comes when people then feel compelled to
finish their meal because they've paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pay for it, we feel obligated to eat it,'' Soliah said.
``That interferes with our effort to keep our weight under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Health Statistics estimated that the
percentage of adults 20 to 74 who were obese increased 24 percent
in the 1960s to more than 33 percent in the late 1980s. By 1994,
the share of overweight adults climbed to 35 percent. Kids are 30
percent heavier than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem continues to get worse, recent studies suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at epidemic levels,'' Soliah said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``go large'' phenomenon comes from consumer demands,
but some is a natural outgrowth of more competition in the
restaurant industry. As Americans eat out more, more restaurants
open their doors to meet the demand. In turn, they fight for
business, offering ``platters'' _ not plates _ of food for less
than the eatery next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a competitive angle,'' said Alison Hovanec, a spokeswoman
with the Texas Restaurant Association. ``Restaurants have had to
diversify their concepts and watch prices and portions to keep up
with the guy next door. They have to be different. A lot of them do
that by offering more food for your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Mount, a spokesman with the National Restaurant
Association, admits that going lean may mean steering away from the
bulk of a restaurant's menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants a small portion, they can get an appetizer
or order a children's-size meal,'' he said.

   Say 'Trumpy' to a yachtsman, and you may as well say
'perfection.'
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Reid
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Down at Cracker Boy Boat Works, the trio
of old wooden yachts stands out among the dozens of fiberglass
craft like gold doubloons in a fountain full of coppers.
</P>
<P>
   Their teak decks and mahogany trim drink in the blazing white
light of noon and convert it to a soft, rich shellacked glow. Their
old prows jut, strong chins, out toward the sea, as if in defiant
challenge. They are in rough shape, undergoing restoration, but
still, they are as graceful as old violins.
</P>
<P>
   They are Trumpy motor yachts, genteel, rugged, elegant even in
decrepitude.
</P>
<P>
   They were not simply handmade; they were handcrafted, each out
of 50 tons of lumber, a shipwright's dream and a house carpenter's
nightmare because there's hardly a straight line to be found
anywhere on board.
</P>
<P>
   Steam-bent ribs, molded planks, rough-cut keels, laminated
fittings, smooth railings, flawless decks _ yellow pine, white oak,
chestnut curled and planed, caulked and doweled, rubbed and buffed
into perfect symmetry, perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   John Trumpy built them about 40 years ago in his boat yard, the
Mathis Yacht Building Co., Camden, N.J. He built the 104-foot yacht
Sequoia for Philadelphian Richard Cadwalader in 1925. It was bought
by the Department of Commerce in 1931, and by 1933, FDR was
cruising down the Potomac on it and the Sequoia has been known as
the presidential yacht ever since. He built boats for a Who's Who
of old American money: Scripps, Bingham, Deering, Chrysler. And new
money: the Vernon Savings and Loan yacht was repossessed by the
U.S. government. And he built minesweepers, cutters and sub chasers
for the government. Wood could take the pounding of Coast Guard
rescue work, and it's the only way to build a minesweeper: Magnetic
mines detonate in proximity to steel hulls.
</P>
<P>
   And otherwise staid minds detonate in proximity to old Trumpy
boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to check your brains at the door when you buy one,
like at a horse auction,'' says Trumpy boat owner John Regan of
Palm Beach. ``I suppose you could buy one for the status, but you
really should buy one because you love it. A wooden boat demands
much but gives back more.''
</P>
<P>
   John Trumpy was Johan Trumpy when he emigrated from Norway to
the U.S. in 1902. The Trumpy family had built boats in Norway for
two generations, and a branch of the family built boats in New York
City. The family hailed originally from Switzerland, where
oceangoing boats are something to read about, dream about. Johan
wanted to go where the action was. So he went to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His boats are not the Rolls-Royces of yachts; they are the
Dusenbergs. They were custom-built, all 366 private boats the
Trumpy yard sent down the ways from 1910 to the early 1970s. Only
90 are left. Many are derelicts, the nautical equivalent of the
banker who goes bust and ends up smoking cigar stubs under a
bridge, but only the finest Cuban cigar stubs. Even a derelict
Trumpy boat says wealth, even if it's former wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Like all rare slices of Americana, Trumpy boats have their
followers. Anybody with enough money can buy a yacht, but only a
lover of wooden boats, like Regan, will seek out and buy a Trumpy.
Most likely the boat will need work. Most likely the new owner will
call Jim Mooresdown at Cracker Boy in Riviera Beach, Fla., even if
the new owner is a Dutch merchant who lives in Tanzania, as is the
case with the owner of one of the Trumpys Jim Moores is restoring.
There just aren't a lot of places on the planet where a Trumpy can
get respect.
</P>
<P>
   They get love from Moores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the original craftsmanship,'' says Moores. He's
standing next to the concrete and wood blocks that support an
82-foot Trumpy, high and dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longleaf yellow pine sub-planking, fitted tight, perfect,'' he
says. ``And look along the keel. See how the entire stern is made
to help the boat ride up, push through the water. Look at the
curvature, bow to stern. And then remember: It's all wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Moores is in his mid-40s, flaxen hair, youthful face. Looks like
a Viking after a shave and a haircut. Knows his boats like Vikings
knew theirs. He rode into West Palm Beach 20 years ago, in a
pickup, with his tools and $400. From Lubec, Maine, literally a
stone's throw from New Brunswick, across a piece of the North
Atlantic that freezes for too many months each year.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Lubec, in his youth, Moores built small fishing boats for
Canadian fishermen. And he built dories, the classical fishing
trawler of the American fishing fleet. A good dory gets steadier in
the water as you load it with fish. A dory filled to the gunwales
with cod is as steady a boat as floats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian dollar went south in the late '70s; so did the
fishing industry. So did I,'' says Moores. ``I came here to start a
business, but look around. Lots of boats in Florida, lots of boat
yards. But not a lot of people who know wooden boats. But then
again, not a lot of wooden boats anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So he grew up in Maine, in a seafaring, boat-building family
perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana, actually,'' he says. ``But my family ran lumber mills
from Oregon to the Midwest. We know wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the boat-building Trumpy family can come from
Switzerland, the boat-restoring Moores might as well hail from
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody at the Cracker Boy boat yard has that lean, sea-salty
look from laboring under a hot sun. Moores, too. But he and his
seven colleagues _ including his 19-year old son, Andre _ wear lots
of sawdust in their hair. Sawdust from sanding, sanding, sanding.
Wooden boat restoration requires lots of sanding.
</P>
<P>
   The tips of mahogany dowels litter the ground, the whine of
electric sanders litters the air. Tools and blueprints are
scattered about. A cube of first-growth yellow pine lies in a
corner. It's all that's left of a beam Moores found in a demolished
warehouse in West Palm Beach. Only a guy who knows wood could spot
a treasure like that in a pile of dust-encrusted rubble.
First-growth wood is long gone from Florida, the South. Moores
milled the beam into a spar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use the original materials _ white oak, yellow pine
_ that's the best,'' he says. ``But the forests ... Well, the
forests are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Moores is surveying Andre's handiwork. Andre is under the hull
but not out of the sun. He's hot, he's sanding, he's sweating and
he's smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an apprentice, starting like I started,'' says Moores.
``At the bottom. The keel, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on deck, finish work is being done by Richard Rasmusson's
crew. Rasmusson's company installs new baths, dining rooms, beveled
mirrors, mahogany-front fridges, entire bedroom suites. He is known
as the master of custom finish work. His railing joints meet
without so much as a shadow, his hand-made cabin doors snap closed
with authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to spend a million restoring a boat to hear it
rattle,'' says Rasmusson.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't want to spend a million for a leaky hull. So
Moores' crew caulks and planes until an oiled razor blade couldn't
fit between the planks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find a Trumpy for maybe $200,000,'' says Moores.
``Figure a million to restore it. Not repair. Restore. You don't
fix a Trumpy with fiberglass, or mix wood helter-skelter in the
hull. You rebuild them. One nail, one dowel at a time. And when
you're done, you have a boat that costs as much, more maybe, than a
Hatteras. But when you motor down the Intracoastal, people will
look. And they'll look until you're out of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get lost in the Cracker Boy yard. Lots of boats. But if
you ask for Jim Moores, everyone in the yard will direct you thus:
He's down over there with those three Trumpys.
</P>
<P>
   And when you ask, how do I tell a Trumpy from the rest, the
yardmen will say: You'll know.

KILLINGS OF U.N. WORKERS ECHO THE VIOLENCE OF EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The mob rampage that killed three U.N.
workers in the West Timor region of Indonesia on Wednesday seemed
to some aid workers like a terrifying flashback: in many respects
it replicated the violence, exactly one year ago, in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   As survivors described the attack on Thursday, they told of
narrow escapes from men with guns and machetes who went from house
to house, banging on doors and threatening their occupants while
looking for more foreigners to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in a split second,'' one survivor, Alias Bin
Ahmal, told reporters on Thursday. ``A few who made it had a very
narrow escape. There was one who was stabbed and beaten. All hell
broke loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack took place just across the border from East Timor,
which was devastated last year by killings and destruction after
residents voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was one of several camps that still house more than
100,000 refugees who, for the past year, have been terrorized by
militias that opposed independence and that have now begun to step
up cross-border raids into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The attack offered the latest evidence in an unstable nation
that the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, does not have full control
of his armed forces, some of whom stood by and did nothing during
the rampage. Attending the summit meeting at the United Nations,
Wahid acknowledged as much, saying that the incident may have been
timed to embarrass him in the eyes of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It also may have been intended as a warning after a first step
by Indonesia to bring to trial some military and police officers
who were responsible for the violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the attorney general's office named 19 people as
suspects but came under immediate criticism for omitting top
officers, including General Wiranto, who had been the armed forces
chief. The United Nations has said that if Indonesia does not deal
adequately with those responsible, it could open its own
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in West Timor comes as East Timor is struggling to
rebuild after the violence that took at least 1,000 lives and left
some 70 percent of its buildings in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi warned a week ago
that escalating attacks in the region could be aimed at
destabilizing East Timor as it moves toward elections and full
self-government independent of the United Nations. In recent weeks,
two international peacekeepers were killed and several wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia itself, East Timor is a minor issue, receiving
minimal government attention. With violence endemic in parts of the
nation and with its politics in disarray, the problems that
confront Wahid seem to be more than he can manage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The killings on Wednesday were carried out by the same militias
that devastated East Timor, and they took place, once again, with
the apparent involvement of at least some members of the Indonesian
military. As in East Timor, nobody knows at what point the chain of
command may have broken down, but it is clear that the militias
continue to receive supplies and support from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as during the carnage in East Timor, armed
Indonesian soldiers and police officers stood by and did nothing.
Once again, officials excused the outbreak as an ``emotional
reaction'' by ``rogue elements.'' Once again, the government, which
had been promising for months to bring the situation under control,
sought to defuse criticism with a new promise.
</P>
<P>
   And once again over the past year, as it had throughout last
year in East Timor, the government allowed the threats and violence
to build in the refugee camps of West Timor in defiance of
international pleas and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not _ could not _ have happened if Indonesian
authorities had taken steps much earlier to disband the militias in
West Timor and prosecute them for known acts of violence,'' said
Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at the New York-based group
Human Rights Watch. ``Instead, local civilian and military
authorities gave every encouragement to these men and their
political front organizations to intimidate East Timorese refugees
under their control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmal, a Malaysian who heads the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua, where the attack took place,
said hundreds of armed men stormed the agency's office after the
funeral of a militia leader who had been killed by unknown
assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no attempt to stop these people from
coming in,'' he said. ``The few police that I saw stood by. People
were armed, some with guns, some with machetes. They were bent on
destroying and killing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ahmal said he and five colleagues hid in the home of a local
woman for three-and-a-half hours after his office was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was telling militias who banged on her door that we had
tried to come in but went further down the road,'' he said. ``If it
was not for the woman's determination and ingenuity we would all
have been sitting ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations continued on Thursday to evacuate its workers
from the most dangerous areas of West Timor. They were being moved
to East Timor, the territory from which some of them had been
evacuated one year ago after similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director for Human Rights Watch, who
spent several months in East Timor, said the militias might be
trying, as they did last year, to force foreigners to leave so that
they could act with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on foreign workers has been building, and the United
Nations pulled its workers out of the camps for a few days last
month when three of them were seriously beaten. Wednesday's attack
was the most serious of more than 100 incidents in which U.N.
workers have been threatened or beaten by militia members or their
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The militias have tried over the past year to block
international attempts to repatriate the refugees, using threats,
disinformation, roadblocks and kidnappings to persuade or force the
refugees to stay in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The militias appear to be acting from a mixture of motives,
Jones and others said. They appear to be hoping to take over the
western portion of East Timor and they have demanded a general
amnesty. They and their backers in the Indonesian military may also
be motivated _ as they were in the destruction in East Timor _ by
simple hatred and revenge.

   Ahmal said he was concerned that the attacks on the U.N. workers
and the evacuations now under way may leave no one in the camps to
help refugees who want to return to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there to assist the poor refugees who are still there
and literally trapped,'' he said. ``What do you say to those
refugee families in the camp who want to be repatriated?''
</P>
<P>
   His statement sounded very much like those of U.N. workers who
were evacuated from East Timor a year ago as the militias began
their rampage there.

FAST TIMES FOR CAMERON CROWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movie history tells us that just about the hardest kind of film
for an established director to make is his own coming-of-age
autobiography: Billy Wilder, Robert Altman, William Wellman and
dozens of other film immortals have tried and failed to pull one
off.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Fellini did it splendidly in ``Amarcord,''
and so has Barry Levinson with his on-going series of ``Baltimore''
movies. And, now, so has Seattle filmmaker Cameron Crowe with his
delightful new comedy memoir, ``Almost Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this film _ which traces Crowe's budding career as a
15-year-old rock journalist for Rolling Stone magazine _ is not
just a winning autobiography, it's an oasis of wit and style that
comes on the heels of what is generally regarded now as the most
intensely raunchy and witless summer in Hollywood history.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference room at Seattle's Boeing Field last month, where
he'd dropped in for the afternoon on a barnstorming blitz of the
country in the DreamWorks corporate jet, Crowe said, ``It's the
thing I'm most proud of in my life _ this and the Wilder book
(``Conversations With Wilder,'' his 1999 book on Billy Wilder).
What can I say? I feel blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   An unassuming, genuinely friendly man who turned 43 in July,
Crowe spoke about his labor of love with boyish enthusiasm, but he
looked tired at the end of a long day of interviews that began that
morning in San Francisco, and he seemed melancholy at the prospect
of boarding the plane again at the end of our interview. ``It's so
bizarre,'' he smiled ironically. ``I've come home _ but only for a
few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home'' is actually Woodinville, Wash., where Crowe has lived
since the late '80s with his wife, Nancy Wilson, half of the native
Seattle, sister-rock sensation, Heart. He has since filmed two of
his four movies here, and it's clear after a few minutes of
conversation that he thinks of himself as part of the community and
not just another Hollywood carpetbagger who spends a month in the
San Juans every summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all my writing here, and my family (wife, two children,
in-laws) and most of my friends all live in this area now. I'm
definitely the most comfortable when I'm in the Northwest _ to the
point that the hardest part of my job is having to spend so much
time away. And I think these feelings have been heightened by the
experience of making this movie, which is by its nature a
(psychological) break with my California childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he feel compelled to tell his own story at this
mid-point of his career? ``I guess because I could do it _ the
success of `Jerry Maguire' bought me a ticket. And I'm realistic
enough to know that this kind of clout doesn't last very long in
this business _ it can slip away overnight. So I thought if I
didn't do it now, I probably never would.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he afraid that such a personal movie might be regarded by
some as a Hollywood ego trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that possibility occurred to me _ and I certainly didn't
set out to make a movie that would subtly glorify me. The movie is
not so much about me as it's about the people around me, about that
particular era in rock music and what it was like to be in the
middle of it. The character is an observer _ just as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why,'' he added, ``the biggest challenge I had was
finding Patrick (Fugit, the film's young star). I didn't want an
idealized version of myself. I wanted someone who was funny,
awkward and naively idealistic. Someone who was wide-eyed and open
_ interesting but passive. After months of looking and finding
nothing, one day I popped in an audition tape from an unknown kid
in Utah and suddenly there he was. He's the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' essentially tells a story that has already
entered pop-music mythology: how, in 1973, a shy 15-year-old San
Diego rock fanatic bluffed a plum assignment from Rolling Stone
over the phone, experienced the headiness of '70s rock life
firsthand and eventually became a successful journalist and
associate editor of the magazine in its greatest era.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's film career, however, has been somewhat less of a
Cinderella story and has involved its share of ups and downs in the
two decades since he adapted his own 1979 first book _ an
``undercover'' account of teen life called ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High'' _ into a hit 1982 movie that spawned the careers
of Sean Penn, Nicolas Cage, Jennifer Jason Leigh and a half-dozen
other notables.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of the decade after ``Fast Times'' with one foot
in journalism and the other in youth-oriented movie projects like
``The Wild Life,'' a ``Fast Times''-clone he scripted in 1984. But
in 1989, after much travail, he finally put together his first film
as a writer-director: an unusually perceptive and well-received,
filmed-in-Seattle teen comedy called ``Say Anything ...''.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Crowe had ``pretty much relocated to the Seattle
area.'' It was the early '90s, just before the Seattle youth scene
was about to explode in the national media, and he chronicled the
roots of that cultural phenomenon in his second film as a
writer-director: ``Singles,'' a bittersweet look at the ``Seattle
scene'' starring Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never stop agonizing about `Singles,''' he said, the minute
I brought it up. ``The movie was held up for a year after we
completed it _ for a while, it looked like Warner Bros. might not
release it at all. By the time it did finally come out, Seattle had
become this media event, and the bands I used had all become
famous. So instead of being there first, it looked like the movie
was just trying to jump on the bandwagon and exploit the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'll always wonder what would have happened if the
movie had come out when it was supposed to _ before the grunge
thing hit. And I've always felt the bands here resented the movie
as a (rip-off). But I have to tell you that I recently got an
e-mail from Courtney Love. She said that when she wants to show her
daughter, Frances, what it was like here in those days, she'll show
her `Singles.' That meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years later, a television producer wanted to make a
series out of `Singles.' I wouldn't go along with it _ refused
permission. I felt that really would be an exploitation of the
scene. This is the city I love, and I just didn't want to be in the
position of milking it. Later, the producer turned roughly the same
idea into `Friends,' so I probably cost myself a bunch of money.
But, if I had to do it over, I think I'd probably do the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen today, ``Singles'' seems like the definitive statement
about the Seattle youth scene in the early '90s, but it was
perceived as a setback in Crowe's career. For his next project, he
decided to take a big step out of the contemporary youth scene and
take his time writing and polishing the script _ three years, in
fact. The film was ``Jerry Maguire,'' the hit 1996 comedy about a
sports agent (Tom Cruise) whose life is changed big time when he
decides to write a personal ``mission statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Jerry Maguire' was like the perfect filmmaking experience.
Tom _ the biggest star in Hollywood _ was a dream to work with. On
the first day on the set, in front of all the crew, he empowered me
_ absolutely empowered me _ to make that movie. He respected the
script so much that he allowed me to give line readings to the
actors, (presenting the inflections and emphasis) I wanted. Believe
me, I can't say enough good things about Tom Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the film's five Oscar nominations were two for
Crowe, for best director and best original screenplay. On top of
the film's smash box-office success, this recognition instantly
moved him into the midlevel of Hollywood's A-list of bankable
directors. ``Its success changed everything for me: It got me a
deal with DreamWorks to do this movie, and _ just as important _ it
got me a publisher (Knopf) for the Wilder book.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe regards Billy Wilder (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The
Apartment'') as Hollywood's unchallenged all-time master of
sophisticated comedy, and the book is a sumptuously illustrated,
freewheeling series of conversations between the young and old
directors during a period of a year and a half. It's one of the
most revealing of all inside-moviemaking books, and it ultimately
reveals as much about Cameron Crowe as it does about Billy Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Billy Wilder defines the art of movie comedy. There's
just no one else who can touch him. We don't have anything close to
(his talent) working in movies today, and it's such a loss. Seeing
his movies makes you realize how much the art has deteriorated
since his peak. When was the last time anyone made a movie in this
country as good as `Some Like It Hot' or `The Apartment?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Wilder talks about his long-standing dream of
making a film about his career as a young journalist in the magical
days of pre-war Vienna. Was this frustrated desire on the part of
his filmmaking hero one of the things that made Crowe want to
embark on his own version of the idea?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably it was, because I did realize from talking to Billy
that, the further removed you get from your youth, the harder it
becomes to do that kind of film successfully. I'm in the stage of
my life now when that (formative) period is distant but not so
distant that it's dim in my memory. Also, the early '70s are not so
removed for us that recreating them becomes a (prohibitive) task _
as re-creating '20s Vienna would be for Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' opens nationally on Sept. 22. After the
publicity tour, Crowe begins pre-production on his next film, a
comedy that the trade papers speculate will star Cruise. This will
allow him to spend more time at home _ where he writes and rewrites
his scripts in a process that usually takes several years and
always involves his wife as a ghost collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that he misses his home so much and already has
made two films set in and more or less ``about'' Seattle, has he
contemplated making it a trilogy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. Because right now is the most extraordinary time
in the city's history. Overnight, it's become like the cultural
capital of the world. Since the WTO thing, it's become even more of
a metaphor. The impact of Bill Gates and Paul Allen _ dominating
the community like two benevolent Renaissance princes _ is just so
amazing. Sure, if I had a story that captured all this, I'd be very
interested in doing it.''

HOME HEATING IMPROVEMENTS CAN TAKE THE EDGE OFF RISING ENERGY
COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAY ROMANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With home heating oil and natural gas prices expected to
skyrocket this winter, homeowners now have more incentive than ever
to take whatever steps are necessary to keep the cold air out of
their houses and the warm air in. Here are some tips for squeezing
every last BTU out of every bit of oil or gas your heating system
consumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the toughest things about dealing with energy
efficiency is that people are always looking for a silver bullet
that will make a big difference in their energy bills,'' said Dale
Horton, a program manager at the National Center for Appropriate
Technology, a nonprofit energy-efficiency organization based in
Butte, Mont. ``The problem is, the big differences are usually the
result of an accumulation of little things.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Horton said, homeowners usually have to ``think
like detectives'' when developing a strategy for saving money on
home heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look for all the little things that could add up
to a big difference,'' he said. ``Sometimes that means examining
every window and door for leaks and drafts, and sometimes it means
looking at the behavior of the occupants in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Horton said, while a small draft from around the
perimeter of a single window or door might not, by itself, result
in a noticeable increase in energy costs, small drafts from around
all the windows and doors in a house could. At the same time, he
said, the energy savings achieved by sealing and weatherstripping
every window and door in the house is going to be squandered if
even one occupant of the house insists on sleeping with the windows
open, even just a crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all behave differently in our homes,'' he said. ``And our
behavior can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Silverstein, director of the Center for Ecological
Technology, a nonprofit organization based in Pittsfield, Mass.,
said homeowners often determine what energy-savings measures are
worth taking by trying to figure out how long it will take for the
cost of the measure to be recouped. Replacing an old inefficient
furnace and water heater with new high-efficiency models, for
example, can result in efficiency increases of up to 30 percent.
Such upgrades, he said, can easily result in sufficient savings to
recoup the cost of the new appliances in just a few years,
particularly in times of higher-than-average energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any energy-saving measure that pays for itself in two or three
years is going to be a very good investment,'' he said. ``And when
the price of fuel increases, the payback period decreases.''
Silverstein said the best way for a homeowner to get an idea of a
particular home's energy needs _ along with an idea of the time
needed to recoup the cost of addressing them _ is to obtain what is
known as an energy audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy audits involve a trained auditor doing a computer-based
survey of the heating system in the home,'' he said, adding that
the audit would involve an assessment of the heating plant itself
to determine its current efficiency, as well as an examination of
the structure and other equipment in the house to determine where
heat loss may be occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Energy auditors will also point out ways that homeowners can
save money by increasing the energy efficiency of the house. Such
measures typically include increasing the amount of insulation in
the attic, wrapping the hot water boiler in an insulating jacket,
installing low-flow shower heads, installing a thermostat that will
automatically set back the nighttime temperature to 60 degrees or
so, cleaning filters on forced-air furnaces, sealing flues in
unused fireplaces, installing drapes on windows and sealing up
holes around plumbing and heating pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``An audit report should also provide the cost-effectiveness of
taking different energy-efficiency measures,'' he said, explaining,
for example, that while it would always be worthwhile insulating an
uninsulated attic, it might not always be cost-effective to
supplement existing insulation if the added cost will produce only
minimal savings.
</P>
<P>
   An energy auditor can also determine how ``leaky'' a house is by
using a ``blower door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I use blower doors on new houses to test how tight they are,''
said Chris Benedict, a Manhattan architect, who specializes in
energy-efficient home designs.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict explained that a blower door is a large fan encased in
a door-sized panel that is installed in a door opening leading to
the outside of the house. With all of the windows and other
exterior doors of the house shut tight, the fan is then used to
pull air out of the house. That creates a low-pressure condition
inside the home, which makes it possible to pinpoint places where
air is coming into the house from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use a smoke-pencil or a lit cigarette to see where air
is flowing,'' Benedict said, adding that once infiltration points
are identified they can be sealed with caulk, weatherstripping or
expanding foam insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict pointed out that it is generally not wise to make a
home too airtight because combustion appliances _ like furnaces,
gas water heaters and gas dryers _ can pull exhaust gases back into
the house if there is no source of fresh air for combustion. And
that, she said, could result in a dangerous buildup of deadly
carbon monoxide in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who are interested in obtaining an energy audit of
their homes can contact their fuel dealer or utility provider. Some
utility companies provide audits for their customers and those that
do not can usually provide the names of experienced independent
auditors. The cost of an audit can be $200 or more, depending on
the size of the house and the work performed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to perform their own home energy audit can do so
on the internet by going to the Department of Energy's Web site at
www.homeenergysaver.lbl.gov and following the instructions found
there.

WATCH OUT FOR THOSE THREADBARE SERIAL-KILLER CLICHES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hackneyed serial killer thriller ``The Watcher'' commits a
crime even worse than being irrepressibly dull ... it allows star
Keanu Reeves to speak.
</P>
<P>
   And all the elocution lessons his ``Matrix'' money could buy
would still be incapable of draining the Val-speak from his voice.
Reeves stars as a voyeuristic lady-killer with a penchant for
stalking his victims, then strangling them with piano wire.
</P>
<P>
   James Spader _ whose gravelly, emotionless tone and
overdependence upon prescription medication makes him seem like the
more ideal sort to play the story's homicidal creep _ is the FBI
agent whose obsession with the case forced him to abandon LA for
Chicago. Reeves follows, of course, escalating their cat-and-mouse
game by Fed-Exing pictures of his intended victims.
</P>
<P>
   Spader is reluctantly drawn back into the investigation, making
desperate attempts to find the nameless faces in an uncaring city
conditioned to pay as little attention as possible. There are some
clumsy attempts to make a point about how we go through life
without really seeing each other, how one person can be lost in sea
of forgotten souls. How apropos, considering how quickly this
substandard thriller will be forgotten in a seemingly endless ocean
of serial-killer flicks.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Joe Charbanic got his start in music videos,
which explains the annoying overuse of grainy film stocks, artsy
flashbacks and jump cuts. Yet in all of its attempts to be visually
striking (which, incidentally, it is not), ``The Watcher'' fails to
build even the slightest shred of suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei slums it as Spader's shrink and an
obvious victim-in-waiting, but she's given no other practical
purpose for being there. It's not about her, after all. But
considering that the film relies so heavily on the chemistry
between its two leads, you'd think they might have looked for more
explosive ingredients.

SMART AND SWEET, `NURSE BETTY' IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED

<P>
   Renee Zellweger's fresh-scrubbed looks and Midwest innocence won
her acclaim in ``Jerry Maguire'' but have been ill-used since. That
is, until she landed the lead in ``Nurse Betty,'' a delightfully
comic crime fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   In a contemporary take on ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Zellweger's
Betty Sizemore is a Dorothy in a small-town Kansas coffee shop.
She's perky, pretty and sweetly sociable, but a numbing marriage to
a philandering used car salesman (Aaron Eckhart) and fizzled dreams
have left her with a glazed-over smile for too much of her
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Her only relief is escape into a soap opera fantasy where she
imagines herself the true love of sensitive, haunted,
oh-so-handsome young Dr. David Ravell, played by cocky actor George
McCord (Greg Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that whooshes through her life arrives in the form
of two hit men _ deliberate, precise pro Charlie (Morgan Freeman)
and his smart-mouth, excitable protege Wesley (Chris Rock) _ who
literally scalp her scamming husband during an interrogation gone
terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The shock sends her spinning over the rainbow and onto the road
to Los Angeles in her husband's Buick (which just happens to hold
the contraband the hit men seek) as Nurse Betty, Dr. Ravell's
long-lost love who's coming back to reclaim her beau.
</P>
<P>
   She has two determined gunmen behind her, a flabbergasted soap
star convinced she's method-acting an elaborate audition (``Your
dedication scares me,'' he says after a couple of dates ``in
character''), and the luck of an innocent keeping her safe from
harm in the dangerous Oz of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Director Neil LaBute (``In the Company of Men''), working from a
script by first-time film scribes John C. Richards and James
Flamberg, shakes his sour vision of predatory human relations for
an altogether more generous portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Eckhart plays a smarmy, misanthropic creep and Kinnear
fine-tunes his now patented narcissistic jerk to smug perfection,
but LaBute turns true-hearted naif Betty into more than simply a
little lost innocent. The film could easily have descended into a
mean-spirited lampoon of a woman who confuses an escapist TV serial
for real life, but it's smarter and sharper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring Betty's journey is Freeman's philosophical Charlie, a
clear-headed career criminal who idealizes his target as a
combination homespun innocent, sophisticated aesthete and cunning
nemesis. Laconic, quiet, with a world-weary air effortlessly about
him, Freeman has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   When he erupts with, ``She could never fall in love with a soap
opera character,'' little realizing that he unwittingly has
himself, the joke gives way to the aching sincerity in his face. Is
there any difference between his romantic fantasy and hers?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's little satirical sting to the film,
rather surprising from the usually cutting LaBute, and he lets a
few glib twists drop with a thud, but those are minor caveats. He
pulls the farce and the violence and the fantasies together with a
deft touch and a sweetness rare in American films _ especially his.

JANSSEN BREAKS FANS' HEARTS AGAIN DOING A FINE JOB IN AN INFERIOR
FILM

   I've always maintained Famke Janssen can do no wrong _ except in
choosing her films.
</P>
<P>
   While she racked up hits in ``GoldenEye'' and ``X-Men'' and sank
her fangs into some clever genre exercises (``The House on Haunted
Hill,'' ``The Faculty'') with vamping glee, she remains most
notable as the best thing in many a self-indulgent American
independent production.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: ``Love and Sex,'' yet another in a seemingly
endless stream of indie romantic comedies. Apparently an
autobiographical peek into the dating travails of writer/director
Valerie Breiman, it confirms what many of us suspected for so long:
Hollywood writers really do live sitcom lives, minus the laugh
track. Imagine ``Sex in the City'' with an insecure heroine, no
sexy friends and none of the steamy sex.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine scribe Kate Wells (Janssen) muses over her romantic
history for an article about dating and the single woman in the
city. In flashbacks, we tour from her first high school affair
(it's both embarrassing and unsettling to watch Janssen play an
underage teen with a squeaky, shrieky voice between the sheets with
her French teacher) to her last lover, a dim hunk with a Robert
DeNiro-obsession. But the bulk of her remembrance revolves around
flippant artist Adam (Jon Favreau, the teddy bear single of
``Swingers'').
</P>
<P>
   Janssen gives passion and purpose to an often glib and whiny
role. She doesn't try to hide her model's figure, but rather
carries herself with a gangly awkwardness that broadcasts
insecurity, which explains her string of hopeless boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Favreau keeps his charm in low gear, sneaking up on us with
clever banter that feels more like a challenge than a pickup line.
He delivers Adam's ``I'm just a horny, self-indulgent guy'' lines
with a gentleness and a deprecating humor that belies the pose.
</P>
<P>
   Kate and Adam break up, embark on elaborate jealousy gambits and
obsess endlessly over one another while trying to remain ``just
friends,'' but it plays out like some grotesque sitcom. Appealing
as they are, Janssen and Favreau don't throw off sparks or even a
slow simmer. If they're made for each other, it's solely because
they're the only interesting people in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Sex'' is sprinkled with witty lines and convincingly
cuddly moments, and anchored by performers intent on turning their
neurosis-riddled roles into dimensional characters, but Breiman
brings nothing new or insightful or even all that clever, for that
matter, to the familiar questions of love and sex she churns up.

LILY TOMLIN IS HER MOST DELIGHTFUL CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOE ADCOCK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An interview with Lily Tomlin is really more like a breezy chat
than an exercise in journalistic professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   You hear about her brother Richard's career as a Palm Springs
lounge crooner and about her 87-year-old mother's deft way of
working a family reunion crowd. (Mrs. Tomlin's name is Lillie. Her
daughter Mary Jean borrowed and revised the name when she became a
professional performer some 40 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   You hear about Tomlin's collection of Maggie Smith's cigarette
butts and about the dreamy pasta in Venice. You discover that
Tomlin and her life partner/professional collaborator Jane Wagner
have been together for 30 years partly because, as Tomlin puts it,
``I adore her.'' You hear about the Communist who lived in the
Detroit apartment building where Tomlin grew up, and also about the
genteel ultra-conservative dowager who ``taught me to be a lady.''
</P>
<P>
   You laugh a lot. As the world has known for the past 30 years at
least, Lily Tomlin is very funny. TV watchers, film buffs and
theatergoers have all enjoyed the humor of this versatile
multimedia star.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin's monodrama ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in
the Universe,'' written and directed by Wagner, opens the Seattle
Repertory Theatre's fall season Monday. The show was developed and
fine-tuned 15 years ago at the Rep. Broadway audiences found it
funny. Audiences all over the country have found it funny. After
the present national tour ends this fall, Tomlin will open her
``Search'' again on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But besides being witty, ``Search'' is something else. The
play's eventful two hours includes a marriage breakup, a rejected
teenager, a disillusioned male swinger, several disillusioned
feminists, a lesbian relationship that doesn't work, a deranged
homeless woman, two prostitutes, alcoholism, depression and two
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we don't know for sure there are two suicides,'' Tomlin
objects. ``Marge, yes. But all we know for sure is that Chrissy
wrote a suicide note. We don't know whether she followed through or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve characters _ I think the misfortunes that befall them
over 10 years are about average for a group that size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Search,'' though comic in tone, encompasses dark aspects of
life. ``That's why it is poignant,'' Tomlin says. ``That's why it
touches people as well as entertaining them.''
</P>
<P>
   After turning the show into a movie in 1991, Tomlin had thought
she was done with ``Search.'' Other performers were able to obtain
rights to produce it. Tomlin was due to go on a road tour this year
with a stand-up comedy show. ``But Jane and I were doing workshops
with drama students at the University of Southern California, and
we used `Search.' It turned out that the students really liked the
material. They didn't live through the trials of '70s feminism. But
it's part of the way they live their lives. Feminism is part of
their culture.

   And they are interested in where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I decided not to do stand-up comedy. I'd much rather
tour with something substantial like `Search.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering feminists in ``Search'' are Lyn, Edie and Marge.
Lyn's supposed liberation involves marrying a sensitive New Age
man. Edie leaves her husband and takes up with a lesbian artist.
And Marge devotes herself to alcohol, her plant store and her many,
many men.
</P>
<P>
   Casting sidelights on American women's lives toward the end of
the 20th century are Brandy and Tina, two prostitutes; Agnus Angst,
a teenage performance artist who is angry at everyone and
everything; Chrissy, a rudderless voyager adrift in conflicting
currents; Judith Beasley, a late-blooming orgasm enthusiast; Paul,
whose eagerness to use women has become counter-productive; and
Kate, a wealthy and idle Manhattanite on the verge of terminal
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Trudy. Trudy is our ``Search'' guide. She is
one of the many psychotics who left mental hospitals and became
street people in the '70s. A source of endless delight for her are
the space aliens who rely on her for insights into life on Earth.
``They said to me, `Trudy, the human mind is so-o-o strange,''' she
tells us. ``I told 'em, `That's nothing compared to human
genitals.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the Wagner/Tomlin characters evolve, they develop an
increasing capacity to care and understand.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin herself is a partisan of caring and understanding. ``It's
terrible how callous we've become about homelessness,'' she says.
``When I was growing up, it was shocking to me, absolute shocking,
to see a man lying on the street. Maybe he had had a heart attack.
Maybe he was drunk. But I was shocked. Now we see people lying in
doorways and on sidewalk grates every day. We hardly notice.''
</P>
<P>
   A conversation with Tomlin is a bit like ``Search.'' One minute
is quite serious. The next is giddy. So let's end here on a light
note. Tomlin's birthday was Sept. 1. She is quick to point out that
she shares the date with various notables. She celebrated her
birthday here in Seattle. She is now 61.

ISRAELI BORDER GUARDS DETAINED AFTER BEATING PALESTINIAN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A court in Jerusalem ordered the detention of three
Israeli border police officers on Thursday after they severely beat
three Palestinian laborers on Wednesday and photographed one
another stepping on their victims.
</P>
<P>
   The swift legal action against the officers, who confessed to
the violence under questioning by investigators, came after Israel
Radio broadcast graphic accounts of the beatings by one of the
laborers and their Israeli supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The incident drew public attention to what Palestinians say is
common but usually unreported brutality by border police officers,
who are on duty at checkpoints and patrol Palestinian communities
under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's public security minister, Sholomo Ben-Ami, called the
police officers' behavior ``beastly,'' adding that he had told the
chief of the border police that their commanding officers should be
disciplined as well.
</P>
<P>
   The beating occurred at about 3 a.m. on Wednesday, as the three
Palestinians were heading home from work at a Jewish-owned grocery
store in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At a junction near the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, outside
Jerusalem, the laborers were ordered out of their car for an
identity check, and then severely beaten without provocation, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were beatings, screams, curses, and one of them was also
using a rock, hitting hard,'' Faisal Darabeh, one of the workers,
said in a radio interview. ``I was crying. He rammed my head into a
wall, and I fell to the ground. He told me to get up, and when I
got up he grabbed his gun and told me, `The safety catch is on
automatic, and if you say another word I'll kill you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Darabeh said he and another laborer, who had been hit in the
stomach and groin, were grabbed by the hair and their heads were
slammed together.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Palestinians were ordered to lie face down and the
police officers took snapshots of one another stepping on the
laborers' heads, Darabeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' supervisor, Moshe Zicherman, said in a separate
interview that he knew something was wrong when he heard ``terrible
screams'' in a radio communication from the workers' car. When the
workers finally radioed their location, Zicherman drove there and
found them ``in a state that was simply shocking,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like after a terrorist attack,'' Zicherman said. ``They
were vomiting blood, all contorted in a way I cannot describe in
words.''
</P>
<P>
   At the court hearing Thursday, a prosecutor from the Justice
Ministry's police investigation unit described the beatings as
``unreasonably brutal.'' The lawyer for the police officers said
that it was not an isolated incident. ``These things happen from
time to time,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Jerusalem Border Police. Atef Dagesh, said that
he took a grave view of the beating, and he asserted that police
commanders had filed complaints in the past against abuses by
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prepared to accept such a phenomenon,'' he said.
``This is not the way of our force.''

ABUSES

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Rosario Ibarra applauded when Mexican police last
month arrested an Argentine here who is suspected of kidnapping and
``disappearing'' scores of dissidents during Argentina's military
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aug. 24 arrest also rekindled Ibarra's 25-year-old cry
for a serious investigation into Mexico's own prolonged repression
against dissidents - including Ibarra's 21-year-old son, Jesus, a
student who was kidnapped by armed men in Monterrey on April 18,
1975 and has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key moment for us, for the family of the disappeared
here,'' said Ibarra, 73, one of Mexico's premier human rights
figures, who has relentlessly criticized Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, for years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the PRI was finally defeated in an election that will
end its 71-year lock on this country's powerful presidency. On Dec.
1, when president-elect Vicente Fox takes over, many families of
the disappeared hope he will investigate successive PRI
governments' reported use of torture, killings, secret detentions
and disappearances of political foes.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised campaign debate, Fox paid tribute to Ibarra's
``perseverance'' and ``struggle for the disappeared'' and made an
emotional appeal to Mexicans to end ``PRI authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra and others say some of those responsible or knowledgeable
about human rights abuses are still prominent figures in the PRI,
the government, private business or in the military. Two Army
generals arrested Aug. 31 on drug-trafficking charges have also
been implicated in human rights abuses by former detainees and
families of Mexico's disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the system did here, it did because they thought
they were untouchable,'' Ibarra said. ``I hope there's justice in
this country, and that (Fox) will do what the PRI didn't do during
so many years of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fox takes office he is expected to recommend Congress set
up a ``transparency commission'' that could probe the fate of the
disappeared and other human rights abuses as well as corruption and
theft of public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If society has proof of abuses, then I think investigations
will happen,'' said Fox aide Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who'd like a probe is Victor Pineda, 23, who was
only one year old when his father, a teacher and community
organizer also named Victor, was detained by soldiers in Juchitan,
Oaxaca, on July 11, 1978. His family has never been able to find
out what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the trauma this causes children,'' Pineda
said, sitting by his mother during a recent gathering of relatives
of the disappeared at Ibarra's home. ``But now the dirty inner
workings of the government are being revealed. There are people who
know what happened and they continue to walk the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   During her long, frustrating quest to find her son, Ibarra
founded the Eureka Group, which contends there are at least 448
unlawfully detained people still missing. The group forced the
release of about 1,500 political prisoners in the 1980s, some of
whom had vanished for as long as nine years, Ibarra said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the disappeared were rounded up during a wave of violent
repression through the 1970s, following the infamous Oct. 2, 1968
massacre of hundreds of youths protesting for more democracy prior
to the Olympic Games in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, disappeared in the 1980s or 1990s. Army Lt.
Miguel Orlando Munoz was 25 when he disappeared in May 8, 1993 in
Juarez, a city steeped in corruption and collusion between the
Mexican military and powerful drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's family claims they've been repeatedly lied to and
stonewalled by the military, which they believe is hiding
information about Munoz's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the PRI's defeat, two recent scandals here
sparked new demands to investigate the disappeared and other
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In August Mexican police arrested a prominent Argentine
businessman who the government had hired to direct a
car-registration program here. Former Argentine military officer
Ricardo Cavallo is being held for possible extradition to Spain to
face charges of atrocities committed against Spanish citizens and
others during Argentina's 1976-1983 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and 1980s, Mexico's PRI governments _ which
professed a leftist tradition _ welcomed refugees from Argentina
and Chile, where right-wing military regimes killed thousands. At
the same time, however, the PRI was violently cracking down on its
own mostly leftist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican dissidents armed themselves in response to
escalating repression. ``They didn't do that because of simple
adventurism. Remember what happened on Oct. 2,'' said Ibarra, who
still cries when she talks about her son, a medical student who,
unknown to her, was a sympathizer of a dissident organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they broke the law, then sentence them. That's what
justice is for,'' Ibarra said. ``What happened was the reverse. The
government broke its own laws and became a terrorist. It violated
the constitution, tortured, kidnapped and set up clandestine
jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Solomon of New York-based Human Rights Watch, agreed. His
organization, like Amnesty International, has compiled reports of
disappearances and unlawful detentions from the 1970s up to
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, Mexico legitimately laid claim to being a
refuge for the politically oppressed. But it's not an excuse for
its own excesses,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico for a long time didn't get the scrutiny it deserved,''
he added, in contrast to South American regimes. ``The government
took advantage of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, according to a 1999 U.S. State Department report
recognizing a pattern of abuses, has had ``limited success'' in
improving its justice system: ``A culture of abuse continues to
pervade the security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's long history of impunity was also spotlighted recently
with the arrest last month of two Army generals, one active duty
and the other recently retired, who are accused of protecting
Juarez-based drug traffickers. Ibarra and others believe these same
generals either participated in kidnapping dissidents or have
information about their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Octaviano Santiago, who is now a left-wing opposition legislator
in Guerrero state, said in April 1978 he was arrested and tortured
during a secret interrogation by one of the generals, Mario Acosta
Chaparro. At that time Acosta Chaparro held a lower rank, said
Santiago, who spoke by telephone from Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acosta Chaparro told me he had detained certain people,''
Santiago said, reciting six names. ``Those people never appeared
again. I'm willing to testify about this in any court of law that
calls me. This is the most important opportunity we have to find
out what happened to our people. (Acosta Chaparro) is a living
crime file. So among the sea of bitterness, this gives me a spark
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Matilde Gonzalez, whose 23-year-old son, Jesus, disappeared in
1974, said the other general, Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo, had a
reputation as a military officer who offered to sell information
about disappeared people.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said that in 1976 a neighbor passed her a message from
Hermosillo, who was an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbor said if I could pay 250,000 pesos (about
US$20,000) and buy a gold ring to give to his wife, Hermosillo
would provide some information. But I didn't have that kind of
money,'' said Gonzalez, 74, who has participated in hunger strikes,
marches, and visited prisons and filed multiple legal appeals in
vain over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico the Army has been untouchable,'' added Concepcion
Avila, Gonzalez's daughter. ``We've been waiting for a moment like
this, just like people in Argentina.''

THIS IS SPINAL TAP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a little weird to write about a movie that will appear on
VH1 between the time I finish typing this review and the time the
review hits print _ not to mention a movie that will be released on
DVD four days after it opens in theaters. But in the world of
Spinal Tap, where amplifier volume goes to 11 instead of 10 and
Stonehenge is a foot-and-a-half tall, somehow, it makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, why bother to see this reissue of Rob Reiner's
mock-rock-doc in a theater? The obvious answer _ that all
theatrical films should be seen on the big screen _ doesn't
necessarily apply here, especially because video editions and the
upcoming DVD will have extra scenes. Nothing much has been done to
this 16th-anniversary reissue; although it looks sharp, the sound
isn't exactly state-of-the-art stereo. The best answer is that the
movie gains from having an audience; it's a communal experience,
with so many good lines and bits that the laughter often covers
them up.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the movie is a fake documentary about the
world's loudest hair-metal band, and Reiner and co-writers Michael
McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer _ who play the core of
the band _ deftly pierce many rock cliches and pomposities. There's
a germ of a plot, as guitarist/singer David St. Hubbins' (McKean)
control-freak girlfriend drives a band-threatening wedge between
him and his longtime musical partner, Nigel Tufnel (Guest). But
mostly it's a series of amusing-to-gutbusting sketches as
chronicled by Marty Di Bergi, the Scorsesean filmmaker portrayed by
Reiner. In 1984, many of these scenes looked a little absurd _ now,
after we've lived through the excesses of Poison, Cinderella, Skid
Row and others, they look eerily prescient while managing to not be
dated.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner the director gets the movie over with quick, and that's
part of what makes it work; some bits are a little too slow, but
the movie as a whole is so brief that it never wears out its
welcome. ``Spinal Tap'' doesn't work for everyone, but those who do
connect with it will find that it leaves them hungry for more.

THE DOSAGE IS JUST RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Nurse Betty'' begins, Betty (Renee Zellweger) is a
waitress at a small-town Kansas diner who's so enthralled by her
favorite soap opera that she's become adept at refilling coffee
cups behind her back, so that she won't have to pull her eyes from
the TV screen. But when something bad happens to her scummy
husband, the quirky Betty really goes off the deep end. And we're
off on the road in this enjoyably twisted comedy of self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is a change of pace for director Neil LaBute,
who appears to have decided _ after the misanthropy of his first
two movies, ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and
Neighbors'' _ that nice people do exist, after all. Of course, he
didn't write ``Nurse Betty''; John C. Richards and James Flamberg
did the darkly witty screenplay, which won the screenwriting award
at the Cannes Film Festival. But LaBute's sensibilities still come
through _ as in the jarringly violent scene in which Betty
witnesses two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) murdering her
husband over some lost cocaine. It's a graphic scene, and it
switches something off inside Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that should be switches something on _ somehow, through
one of those psychological oddities that movies love so much, Betty
becomes convinced that a doctor character on her soap, ``A Reason
to Love,'' is her ex-fiance. Before her husband's body is cold, she
sets off to LA to reunite with the doctor, with the killers, the
town sheriff and a reporter in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time this year that Zellweger has been
involved in a plot like this _ she was on the run in ``Me Myself &AMP;
Irene,'' which also featured a character whose psyche was
traumatically snapped. But ``Nurse Betty'' puts her in the driver's
seat, and the movie is better for it. So's Zellweger. In ``Me
Myself &AMP; Irene,'' as in a lot of her other movies, the Texas native
was reduced to a reactive role; here, she drops her trademark
squint and screwed-up pout to give a wide-eyed, charmingly
ingenuous performance. Others react to her, and many of the movie's
best moments occur when it dawns on the people Betty meets that not
all of her spark plugs are firing.
</P>
<P>
   But Betty isn't the only person who's deluded. Freeman, who has
a weary gravity as the more patient of the two killers, plays a guy
who develops a crush on his vision of Betty as he begins to believe
that she's the angel who will pull him out of his moral sewer. And
the actor (Greg Kinnear) who plays the soap-opera doctor is so
flattered by Betty's attention that he mistakes her for a
particularly talented method actress and tries to get her a part on
the soap.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnear's character is the movie's biggest problem; although
Kinnear is fine, LaBute and the screenwriters fail to make his
character so convincingly self-absorbed or so stupid that he can't
see through Betty right away. And things threaten to unravel toward
the end, as the filmmakers try too hard to tie up some loose ends,
and some of the actors _ including Zellweger, who's otherwise at
her best _ lose confidence in their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although ``Nurse Betty'' isn't as provocative as LaBute's
earlier movies, it's a big leap for him as a director; maybe having
somebody else write it, or putting it on the road, forced him to
make a movie that doesn't look as stage-influenced as ``Company''
and ``Friends'' did. He usually jacks up his actors, but here he
gets Rock to tone down his shrillness while also eliciting an
acidly funny performance from him. LaBute also puts to good use his
talent for eclectic casting, sprinkling in amusing turns from Aaron
Eckhart as Betty's husband, Crispin Glover as the driven reporter,
and Pruitt Taylor Vince as the cantankerous sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ``Nurse Betty,'' though, is Richards' and
Flamberg's nutty screenplay, which makes up for its road-comedy
derivativeness with a smattering of ``The Wizard of Oz'' references
and an increasing rarity: humor that relies on dialogue, situations
and performances. Along the way, ``Nurse Betty'' makes some points
about celebrity, romance, regret and independence. If you're sick
of sophomoric comedy, it could be a cure for what ails you.

&HT;     COURT BARS OUSTER OF IRANIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court has barred the
deportation of an Iranian MAN who worked on a clandestine
translation of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,'' then fled
Iran before his colleague was tortured to death.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. immigration authorities decided Abbas Zahedi was lying
about the reasons he left Iran and ordered him deported. But the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said Wednesday
that Zahedi's evidence, including an order that he report to court
to face prosecution, showed he was eligible for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly likely that if Zahedi were to return to Iran, he
at the very least would be imprisoned, and at the worst tortured or
executed for distribution of `The Satanic Verses,''' Judge Betty
Fletcher said in the 3-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Zahedi, who entered the United States from Canada in 1996, now
lives in Los Angeles with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and two of his
children who also managed to leave Iran, said his lawyer, Michele
Carney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Satanic Verses,'' Rushdie's 1988 novel, includes dream
sequences in which the prophet Muhammad praises pre-Islamic
goddesses and in which prostitutes take the names of his wives.
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or death
decree, shortly before his own death in 1989, condemning Rushdie
and anyone involved in publishing or translating the book.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's current government disavowed the fatwa in 1998, but some
hard-line clerics have insisted it is still binding, and a private
organization continues to offer a reward for Rushdie's death.
Translators and distributors of the book have been murdered in
several countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zahedi, who ran an auto parts store and an electronics store in
Tehran, testified at his asylum hearing that he became interested
in the book in the mid-1990s and wondered what the government was
trying to hide. He said he located a copy in Turkey in early 1996,
took it home and asked a friend named Moshen, a political
dissident, to translate it into the Iranian language of Farsi so he
could distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   Zahedi said he made copies of each chapter Moshen had translated
and had given them to 20 to 25 people before security forces
arrested Moshen in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he fled the country the same day authorities
tried to serve a summons ordering him to appear in court. His
daughter was later interrogated and his mother was threatened. He
later learned Moshen had died under torture.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge said she did not believe Zahedi's testimony
because he was vague or inconsistent about such details as when he
learned of Moshen's arrest and who got copies of the books. She
also said documents presented by Zahedi about his impending
prosecution were unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court said inconsistencies in his testimony
appeared to be due to problems with a translator and were not
crucial to Zahedi's story. The immigration judge failed to say why
she rejected Zahedi's documents, which are consistent with State
Department reports about Iran, the court said.

CHINESE AIRLINE GETS APPROVAL TO SELL SMALL STAKE TO TAIWANESE
AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China Eastern Airlines said Thursday that it
had received preliminary approval to sell a 25 percent stake in its
tiny cargo subsidiary to China Airlines of Taiwan, a first step in
a what would be a landmark in cross-strait cooperation if Taiwan's
government allowed the deal to go through.
</P>
<P>
   While Taiwanese companies have invested heavily in joint
ventures with state-owned enterprises on the mainland and even
invested directly in some state-owned companies, there has yet been
no Taiwanese investment in China's air carriers, which were only
recently opened to limited foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taiwanese companies have invested as much as $40 billion
in mainland ventures, Taiwan's government has resisted the trend,
fearing that the island's economy could grow too dependent on the
mainland and in turn weaken Taipei's ability to govern the island
free from Beijing's interference. Taiwan maintains a ban on direct
trade and transportation links with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China Airlines has acknowledged that is in talks to buy a stake
in Shanghai-based China Cargo Airlines, a unit of the mainland's
state-owned China Eastern Airlines, but said it has not yet asked
Taipei for approval of any deal.
</P>
<P>
   China Airlines would need approval from the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and Economic Ministry's
Investment Commission to proceed with such an investment.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the
mainland's aviation regulator, has approved the share sale, any
deal would require still higher approvals from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed deal, China Airlines would buy a 25 percent
stake in the cargo carrier, diluting China Eastern's stake to 65
percent and that of another Chinese state company, China Ocean
Shipping (Group) Co., to 10 percent. China Cargo, which is the
nation's only all-cargo carrier but has just three planes, is now
70 percent owned by China Eastern and 30 percent owned by Cosco.
</P>
<P>
   Both China Eastern and China Airlines have said that financial
details and the timing of the stake sale have yet to be decided.

DESIGNERS GO FOR THE GLOW 
WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
HOUSTON _ The '80s glitz and glamour are on the way back.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fall and winter 2000, designers have turned up the wattage,
illuminating clothing from outerwear to underwear with the glow of
metallic fabrics, laces and leathers.
</P>
<P>
   This is one area of high fashion that includes crossover from
street fashion, especially the new rage of glam rock, as the trend
is tagged in Women's Wear Daily _ or pimp fashion, as the kids know
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold is big,'' said Evelyn Gorman, owner of the hip Mix
boutique. ``I think this whole gold thing can certainly be seen in
Madonna's new video.''
</P>
<P>
   In that video, for her latest single, ``Music,'' Madonna rides
in the back of a limousine, decked out as a parody of a rap star
with gold top, gold pants, gold cowboy hat and heaps of gold
necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry counter delights
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest fashion change in metallics will come in
jewelry, a category that has turned from silver to gold almost
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Gold hoop earrings, especially the larger ones reminiscent of
the original ``Charlie's Angels,'' have flown out of Cotton Club
stores, owner Lisa Spain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so many years everything was silver. Now everything is
turning gold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the gold is real or faux is not important, said Roz
Pactor, vice president/fashion director for Foley's department
stores. ``It's the look of gold that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman believes the trend to gold jewelry will be accepted very
rapidly and grow, ``but no one will throw their silver jewelry
away. And if they're smart, they will combine the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold as fabric
</P>
<P>
   At the Cotton Club, Spain is carrying gold leather and pleather,
gold snake and crocodile and even gold denim, the latter with a
painted-over finish.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Reich, owner of Wink boutique, is another who is replacing
the bohemian look of embellished jeans with gold-sheen jeans of
denim with Lurex threads.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic-finished garments need not be heavy in look or feel.
Some silk charmeuse this fall has a metallic look, even though it
is extremely soft, said El Matha Wilder, owner of Etui boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic accessories include little evening bags, belts and
other leathers with a slight metallic bronzing.
</P>
<P>
   At Mix, an everyday shoulder bag by Mayle is of gold leather
with gold leather fringe.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of blouses, adding a metallic-finish belt can
take a silk blouse and wool skirt from the office into evening.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in gold
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, this is merely the beginning of a retro trend that
will hang on for at least several years, so an investment in a gold
leather jacket, skirt or pants might not be as radical as it seems.
Gold, like python, may even achieve the status of a basic for a
season or two.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic-finished clothing does double duty, dressing up all the
basics in your closet for both day and evening. A black turtleneck
and skirt, for example, goes to luncheons, dinner or the theater
with the addition of a metallic leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Metallics also complement the rich spice colors of fall and
winter. For those who still believe that metallics should appear
only after dark, this season's evening clothes are heavily into
gold, silver, bronze and copper.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, for example, is stocking up on gold metallic separates,
said Christina Kerford, public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   At Esther Wolf, owner Fred McCann said gold brocade is one of
the choices he believes will be popular for evening. As with an
all-over beaded garment, his customers might once have thought of
gold brocade as an evening-only, but now he believes both beaded
and gold brocade separates will show up at fall and winter
luncheons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing,'' McCann said, ``these clothes have longevity.
They can go to different places, out to lunch and also to dinner.
Today's women don't necessarily buy for a special occasion, and
most want something in which they will be noticed. And, yes, they
want to look more feminine, younger and even sexy.''

INCREASE THE VAMP-OR-TRAMP ELEMENTS WITH FALL ADD-ONS

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The quickest ways to add vamp power to fall's ladylike looks is
with strong color and cutting-edge accessories.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinks, purples and fuchsias are accessory colors that can switch
easily from sensual to sexy. Lily Scott's pink beaded bracelet bag,
$235 at Saks, adds a kittenish touch to a Johnny Was python-print
chiffon blouse, $120 at Dillard's. A Mimo hot pink pashmina with
beaded fringe, $250, and a spangled pink Democracy Weekend
sleeveless sweater, $122, add warmth for fall. Both at Cotton Club.
</P>
<P>
   Color in shoes taps into a more playful mood for fall fashion
fun. Both Prada's lavender and purple leather mules, $370 at Saks,
and Enzo Angiolini's whip-stitched purple python and suede loafers,
$69 at Dillard's, may be worn day or night.

HOLLYWOOD'S LATEST CRAZE: DOWN-UNDER WONDERS

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Heath Ledger in
a scene from ``The Patriot'' and Adam Garcia in a scene from
``Bootmen.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 c.2000 Ivor Davis 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    While the world may be watching the Australian Olympics this
fall, thousands of miles away millions of moviegoers have something
else to watch: a slew of good-looking Australian hunks who are
currently captivating Hollywood.
 &HT;    Heath Ledger stared at us from the cover of August's Vanity
Fair, blonde and gorgeous in a tight, white tank top, his bare
midriff revealing well-toned abs, his thumbs dug deep into his
manly blue jeans.
 &HT;    Hugh Jackman took his stand on the cover of a July issue of
Entertainment Weekly _ tall, dark and handsome, his arm clasping
the bare shoulder of his dazzling blonde co-star, Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos.
 &HT;    Ledger and Jackman may not exactly be household names or icons
in the league of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio. But
they embody the new breed of cover boy, the attractive vanguard of
the new invasion of lads from Oz _ Australian faces that have
Hollywood in a lather.
 &HT;    Even before playing Mel Gibson's son in ``The Patriot,'' many
had declared Ledger to be the heir apparent to Gibson's crown as
Hollywood's favorite Aussie. As for Jackman, he may have started
the year as an unknown, but after playing bad boy Wolverine, a
hirsute hero with razor-sharp metal claws, in this summer's smash
hit ``X-Men,'' he's catapulted onto sexiest-man lists across
America.
 &HT;    Not long ago it was the chaps from the United Kingdom who
commanded the covers, intense, moody actors such as Ralph Fiennes,
Daniel Day-Lewis and Ewan McGregor. But suddenly their Aussie mates
are making them look tired and bland _ yesterday's news.
 &HT;    The Australians are the new flavor of the month, in short. We
haven't even mentioned the most successful of them all, the
Australian sex symbol du jour _ although he was actually born in
New Zealand _ ``Gladiator's'' Russell Crowe, who has recently
finished shooting ``Proof of Life'' opposite Meg Ryan, with whom
he's also enjoying a much-publicized off-screen romance as well.
 &HT;    Of course this is not Hollywood's first love affair with the
cream of the Down Under acting crop: Errol Flynn, a legendary
swashbuckler on and off the screen, was a giant in Filmtown during
the 1930s and 1940s. Peter Finch won an Oscar for his role in
``Network'' (1976), but had already held the attention of many of
the town's most beautiful women long before. Rod Taylor was also no
slouch in the romance department, and more recently Paul Hogan
became the darling of Hollywood during the ``Crocodile Dundee''
1980s.
 &HT;    Gibson ranks as the biggest of them all today, commanding $25
million a picture. He may demand a footnote, of course: He was
actually born in the United States, but as a boy was taken to
Australia by his father, who worried that his sons would be drafted
and sent to Vietnam.
 &HT;    Gibson, star of the ultraviolent ``Mad Max'' futuristic capers,
made a fortune playing a flamboyant cop in the escapist ``Lethal
Weapon'' series, but now is taken seriously as a triple threat _ as
an actor whose name alone can sell a picture and as a
producer/director who won an Oscar for ``Braveheart'' (1995. He'll
be back again in December's ``What Women Want,'' playing a ladies'
man who suddenly becomes able to read women's minds.
 &HT;    When it comes to the heavyweight acting department, this
generation's Peter Finch is Geoffrey Rush, best known for his
Oscar-winning turn as pianist David Helfgott in ``Shine'' (1996).
Rush, who will next be seen in ``Quills'' in December, has added
thespian voltage to such Hollywood films as ``Elizabeth'' (1998)
and ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998), and is never less than
wonderful.
 &HT;    Then there's Guy Pearce, who with his countryman Crowe scored
big in ``L.A. Confidential'' (1997), and is due to open next year
in the independent film ``Memento.''
 &HT;    And they keep coming. Adam Garcia of Sydney, on screen in the
current ``Coyote Ugly,'' seems a combination of Tyrone Power and a
young Mel Gibson. His star vehicle is the Australian-made picture
``Bootmen,'' based on the international stage hit ``Tap Dogs'' and
opening on Oct. 6, in which he plays a steelworker who turns his
back on the assembly line to become a dashing tap dancer in work
boots.
 &HT;    Word is that the smoldering-eyed Garcia will become a fully
fledged sex symbol once American audiences check him out in
``Bootmen.'' For an early peek, however, they can spot the
26-year-old dancing a featured role in the opening ceremonies of
the Sydney Olympics.
 &HT;    Of course, while Australian men may be taking Hollywood by
storm, their female counterparts are no slouches, either. Cate
Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Judy Davis, Rachel Griffiths and Toni
Collette have all shown admirable combinations of beauty and
talent.
 &HT;    But right now it's the rugged male wonders from Down Under who
are garnering most of the attention, bidding fair to eclipse Brad
Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and other home-grown hunks in the
heartthrob stakes.
 &HT;    The serious money is on the 21-year-old Ledger, who became an
overnight sensation _ at least to those who'd missed him in ''10
Things I Hate About You'' (1999) _ as a zealous, hot-tempered young
soldier in the blood-soaked Revolutionary War epic ``The Patriot.''
 &HT;    ``I really like the kid, he's far more mature than his age,'' an
admiring Mel Gibson says. ``He was measured and deliberate about
his work. I remember what I was like when I was his age _ God, I
don't think I was capable of some of the more subtle things he did
in our film. I look at guys like Heath and say, `Why wasn't I so
smart when I was that young?'''
 &HT;    Ledger, a native of Perth, has been deluged with offers since
finishing ``The Patriot.'' He recently completed a medieval romp in
``The Knight's Tale,'' and is already off in Morocco, shooting the
latest version of ``The Four Feathers.''
 &HT;    ``Once every 50 years a guy like that comes along,'' says Brian
Helgeland, director of ``The Knight's Tale.'' ``When Heath smiles,
it's Errol Flynn.''
 &HT;    At 31, Australian Jackman is the mature counterpart to Ledger's
bright young kid.
 &HT;    ``He's talented, bright, sweet, charming and gracious,''
Jackman's ``X-Men'' co-star Romijn-Stamos says. ``And he's sexy as
hell.''
 &HT;    Jackman was playing Curly in the British National Theater
revival of the musical ``Oklahoma'' _ he previously played Norma
Desmond's boy toy Joe Gillis in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset
Boulevard'' _ when ``X-Men'' came up. The road to Professor
Xavier's School wasn't smooth: The role originally went to Scotsman
Dougray Scott, only to fall to also-ran Jackman when Scott had to
withdraw after delays in his previous film, ``Mission: Impossible
2,'' but once in, Jackman made the plum role of ``mutant sex
symbol'' his own.
 &HT;    Next up for the Melbourne native is a more traditional
leading-man role, as Ashley Judd's romantic interest in the comedy
``Animal Husbandry.''
 &HT;    Like Jackman, Garcia first scored big on the stage, winning
London's prestigious Olivier Award as best actor in a musical for
his role as Tony Manero in the London stage version of ``Saturday
Night Fever,'' pulling off the seemingly impossible task of
measuring up to John Travolta's career-making turn in the 1977
movie. Next month he'll begin shooting on Penny Marshall's ``Riding
in Cars with Boys,'' cast _ believe it or not _ as Drew Barrymore's
20-year-old son.
 &HT;    So why is Hollywood going head over heels for the men from the
antipodes? One studio chief, who requested anonymity because he's
maneuvering to sign as many of the new lads as he can, says it all
boils down to salt-of-the-earth, uncomplicated manliness.
 &HT;    ``The guys are natural, blunt and so down-to-earth,'' he says.
``There's no pretense about them, and that's the appeal. They are
all real men, in a world where real men are in short supply.''

 PEDRO'S LESSONS: `Real World' Roommate's Death
Inspires  Cartoonist's Book  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  
 By SAM WHITING  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Judd Winick lived with Pedro Zamora for just six
months, but he's been living with his story for the six years
since.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in MTV's ``The Real World, San Francisco,'' in 1994, Winick
was just looking for free rent and a chance to be on television and
get his cartoons noticed. He didn't know how real ``The Real
World'' would turn out to be until a roommate on the show, Zamora,
developed AIDS symptoms. Three months after the show wrapped,
Winick was at Zamora's side when he died, just hours after the last
episode was shown.
</P>
<P>
   It made the national news, and made a mission for Winick, who is
now an AIDS educator and fund-raiser for the National Pedro Zamora
Project _ a job that peaks this month with the publication of
``Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned'' (Henry Holt;
$15).
</P>
<P>
   Written and illustrated in comic-book style by Winick, the
180-page paperback is a quick read and is aimed at people in their
early teens to early 20s. Winick creates the story's tension by
contrasting his safe childhood mowing lawns on Long Island with
that of Zamora, who came from Cuba in the Mariel boatlift and faced
bigger dangers once he got to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The book parallels the lives of Winick and Zamora, who were 24
and 22 when they met at ``The Real World'' house at the foot of the
Lombard curlicue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to write about the everyman's perspective, which
was me,'' Winick says. ``Regular guy getting to know someone who
has AIDS and what that is like.''
</P>
<P>
   That segment of the book, titled ``Six Months Below the
Crookedest Street in the World,'' is just one chapter out of five,
but it's the one that got the book published.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its ninth season, ``The Real World'' was the pioneer for
all the reality shows that are now copycatted to the level of
annoyance. The concept is to take seven strangers in their early
20s and throw them together in a house paid for and decorated by
the producers.
</P>
<P>
   Each season the cast is culled from 30,000 applicants, each of
whom thinks the show will launch him or her into TV or film
stardom. It hasn't yet, and at best cast members get an appearance
or two before going back from whence they came.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63 people who have been cast, Winick, 30, has probably
lived off ``The Real World'' the longest. As a direct result of the
show he has found a cause, a career, a first book, a fiancee and a
home in San Francisco. He lives in a flat in the Upper Haight with
fellow ``Real World'' veteran Pam Ling, a magenta-haired physician
who works in various city clinics that treat AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs will be the first ``The Real World'' wedding between cast
members who met on move-in day, and would make good footage for an
MTV special report. Maybe even a commemorative album to go with
``The Real World: The Ultimate Insider's Guide,'' published in 1997
by MTV Books. ``Pedro and Me'' is packaged in the same glossy red
binding, and is the same size, so they fit together on a bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Or on either arm of an easy chair for reference during the
constantly regurgitated ``Real World'' marathons. Next month, the
first four seasons of ``The Real World'' go into national
syndication, locally on KNTV (Channel 11) in San Jose. Watching it
while reading Winick's book should enhance the power of Zamora's
performance in hiding his sickness from the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to prove that you can live with it,'' says Winick,
who put in a good performance of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the book he admits that his biggest fear on the show was
being boring, and he went to great lengths to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   One episode he is a fresh-faced mama's boy who'd never been to
San Francisco. The next he's an ultra-hip artiste in a goatee and
vest at the televised wedding of Zamora and Sean Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   Winick raised a toast, as if they would live happily ever after.
But he knew the truth after nursing Zamora through night sweats and
bouts with shingles and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lied to the cameras,'' says Winick, who uses the book to
puncture that lie, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Writing and illustrating the book took two years. Some days were
tougher than others, as when he drew Zamora's face covered with
shingles, or with the skin pulled back from his cheekbones in AIDS'
death grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Pedro, I think it's the last time I'll be telling
the story,'' he says. He's about had enough of ``The Real World''
too, and an omen arrived this summer when the house was badly
damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Winick went by afterward, ``trying to put some closure on it,''
and got what he came for. The fire, as it turned out, had started
in the room he shared with Zamora, right next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put any kind of bizarre irony you want on it,'' he says.
``I've moved on from it, and now the house itself has moved on from
it.''

   MITSUBISHI (Normal, Ill.) _ For a short but trying time a few
years ago, this small town made national headlines. Horrifying
stories had emerged about the Mitsubishi auto assembly plant here.
Its factory floor, some workers charged, was one where some men
felt free to grope female workers, to ask them to bare their
breasts or to aim air guns between their legs. The company, while
vehemently denying the charges, nevertheless agreed in June 1998 to
pay a record $34 million to settle the largest federal lawsuit over
sexual harassment. In reality, however, while the headlines have

`THE BLIND ASSASSIN': THREE STORIES WOVEN INTO A SUSPENSEFUL
DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storytelling has long been a favorite hobby of many of Margaret
Atwood's characters. For some, it's a way to distance themselves
from painful memories while mythologizing mundane triumphs and
travails; for others, it's a means of discovering their own
identities, a way of connecting the dots in their lives, of turning
random points of light into something resembling a starry
constellation.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood's absorbing new novel, ``The Blind Assassin,'' features a
story within a story within a story _ a science-fiction yarn within
a hard-boiled tale of adultery within a larger narrative about
familial love and dissolution. The novel is largely unencumbered by
the feminist ideology that weighed down such earlier Atwood novels
as ``The Edible Woman'' and ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' and for the
most part it is also shorn of those books' satiric social vision.
In fact, of all the author's books to date, ``The Blind Assassin''
is most purely a work of entertainment _ an expertly rendered
Daphne du Maurieresque tale that showcases Atwood's narrative
powers and her ardent love of the Gothic.
</P>
<P>
   To build suspense and create a narrative hall of mirrors, Atwood
deftly cuts back and forth among three plot lines. The first
chronicles the day-to-day life of an elderly woman named Iris Chase
as she tries to come to terms with the many losses she has suffered
over the years, including the suicide of her sister, the suicide of
her husband and the apparently accidental death of her daughter.
The second plot line concerns the events that led to Iris' marriage
in the 1930s to a wealthy industrialist named Richard Griffen and
her estrangement from her sister Laura. The third, which apparently
consists of chapters from a potboiler Laura wrote, recounts the
furtive affair of a well-to-do woman and her ne'er-do-well
boyfriend, who meet in grungy, borrowed apartments and seedy hotels
under the constant threat of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Writing with uncommon authority and ease, Atwood conjures up the
lives of the Canadian gentry in a small town just north of the U.S.
border. She introduces us to the eccentric Chase family (they built
a fortune in the button business) and she traces the reverberating
effects that World War I would have on its members, in particular
Iris and Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Laura is three years younger than Iris, and from the start she
is a strange, watchful child, high-strung, inquisitive and
single-mindedly literal. When told that God is everywhere she frets
about his exact location, wondering if He were in the sun, in the
moon, in the kitchen. ``She developed the ability,'' Iris recalls,
``to subtract herself in the blink of an eye _ one minute she'd be
focused on you, the next she'd be elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After their mother dies in childbirth, the sisters must cope
with their father's sullen withdrawal into an alcoholic stupor and
the arrival of a sadistic tutor who has been entrusted with their
education. Though Iris resents having to be responsible for her
dreamy, wayward sister, it soon becomes clear that the two girls
are alter egos of sorts _ doppelgaengers and soul mates, like so
many of the paired heroines in Atwood's novels, from Cordelia and
Elaine in ``Cat's Eye'' to Zenia and her adversaries in ``The
Robber Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers, Laura and Iris find common cause in befriending a
charismatic young man named Alex Thomas, who is visiting their
small town. When Alex falls under police suspicion for being a
Communist and a labor agitator, the sisters hide him in the family
attic. Both soon become enamored of this sardonic and slightly
sinister man _ a development that will have serious repercussions
not only for them but also for successive generations of their
family.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what ensues in ``The Blind Assassin'' is
unapologetically melodramatic: In addition to several suicides in
the Chase family, there are intimations of child abuse and
intra-family adultery, not to mention loads of scheming,
manipulation and intrigue. Atwood grounds these events in carefully
observed social and emotional detail, even as she sends up her more
sensationalistic impulses in the extracts from Laura's novelette
(also called ``The Blind Assassin''), which features passages from
a pulp fiction story written by its hero. That story, set on a
planet far, far away, depicts a bloody, class-riven society that
sacrifices its young to propitiate ancient gods, and a chilling
assassination plot involving a blind killer.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling in its lurid way as ``The Blind Assassin'' the
novelette may be, it pales in comparison to the virtuosic
storytelling on display in ``The Blind Assassin'' the novel.

KEANU REEVES AS A SERIAL KILLER? IT'S A MOST UNEXCELLENT
ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: D  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the climactic moment of Hollywood's latest serial-killer
thriller, ``The Watcher,'' Keanu Reeves cocks his head audaciously
toward the camera and says in his inimitable, faux-serious style,
``How about that for deja vu?'' It's a perfect mini-review.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is a compendium of scenes from earlier entries in the
overworked genre. It's grindingly mediocre, in a way that probably
would have sent it straight to video were Reeves' name not on the
marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves himself appears to be on board as a favor to the
first-time director, Joe Charbanic, who shot most of the videos of
the star's rock band, Dogstar. Reeves looks bloated and unhealthy
and walks through the part as if he's still worn-out from making
``The Matrix'' sequels.
</P>
<P>
   His character is an habitual psychotic killer of young, lonely
women: a fiend who tortures them over a long period of time while
uttering pithy one-liners, then strangles them with piano-wire.
He's also a bit of a police buff who knows procedures and never
leaves incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And he's particularly fixated on the young FBI agent (James
Spader) who's been on his trail for the past three years: a man so
stressed by it all that he's become a pill-popping basket case who
has to make visits to a lady shrink (Marisa Tomei).
</P>
<P>
   Do you think we're working to a big scene in which the killer
kidnaps this beautiful and sympathetic heroine and, as bait for a
one-on-one with the hero, has her bound and gagged in his secret
lair _ which, naturally, is aglow with maybe a hundred, carefully
arranged candles?
</P>
<P>
   We have to see endless scenes of other young women being
stalked, beaten, abused, tortured, strangled and set on fire, and
of the hero frantically racing to get to them. How about that for
deja vu?
</P>
<P>
   Director Charbanic goes for an arty, MTV-style with
exploding-cuts and much grainy video footage injected for
flashbacks. It's lively but fails to disguise the fact that his
script is a dud and his career in videos has taught him little
about the art of narrative storytelling.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Caan And the Kids
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the bad guys in the picture he's like a good guy,''
said James Caan, talking about his role as a veteran troubleshooter
for a mob lawyer in ``The Way of the Gun.'' ``If there's anybody
who has any kind of moral backbone, it's him, because he's caught
in a dilemma between serving his boss and taking care of his boss'
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The good bad guy has been a Caan specialty since he played Sonny
Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic ``The Godfather.''
As an actor he has always been willing to blend his immense, almost
boyish charm with a sense of contained violence, suggesting
something darker behind the bright smile and accommodating patter.
``You see that this guy has been through the wars,'' said Caan.
``And yet he's just really calm and cool. He's done all the
footwork.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Way of the Gun,'' which opens nationally Friday, Caan's
character goes up against two punks, played by Ryan Phillippe and
Benicio Del Toro, who kidnap a young woman (Juliette Lewis) without
realizing that she is serving as a surrogate mother for the mob
lawyer (Scott Wilson) and his wife (Kristin Lehman). The action
builds to a shootout that recalls the films of Sam Peckinpah, for
whom Caan made ``The Killer Elite.'' ``Sam definitely would have
done this picture,'' said Caan, speaking by phone from his home in
Utah. ``It's his kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer-director of ``The Way of the Gun'' is Christopher
McQuarrie, whose screenplay for ``The Usual Suspects'' won an Oscar
in 1996. ``I'm a big fan of his writing,'' Caan said. ``There was a
great 14-page scene, which is basically why I did the movie,
between this character of mine and Benicio. A very long scene in a
diner, where he's talking about how people today want to be
criminals but don't want to commit a crime, they just like the
title.''
</P>
<P>
   With the vagaries of filmmaking, the scene did not make the
final cut. But Caan, who will be back next month in ``The Yards,''
carries no grudges. ``I really enjoyed working with the kids. I
call them all kids now, because I'm ancient. God, I just turned 60.
I can't even think of that. But I'm still playing basketball with
the 25-year-olds, so I just refuse to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   LaButian Undertones
</P>
<P>
   It's been four years since ``In the Company of Men,'' but Neil
LaBute still hasn't learned to play his role as America's Most
Controversial Filmmaker. He's still the shambling Midwestern nice
guy he has always been, even after further heating up the war
between the sexes with ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' and ``Bash,''
his collection of one-act plays that was recently shown on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Recently LaBute took two days off from preproduction in London
on his latest project, an adaptation of A.S. Byatt's novel
``Possession'' that will star Gwyneth Paltrow, to visit New York on
behalf of ``Nurse Betty,'' a romantic comedy with some dark
LaButian undertones that opens nationally Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For LaBute, who has always written his own films, two
adaptations in a row seem like a dramatic departure. ``What it is
more than anything is opportunity. Of those first two films, one
was generated strictly out of my backyard, and then the other one
came off of people seeing that. `Nurse Betty' came directly out of
working on `Friends and Neighbors,' because Steve Golin produced
that, and he had the script and said, `What do you think of this?'
I read it, and I didn't have the time to intellectualize career
choices. I told him I liked it and that I couldn't imagine me doing
it, and that's probably a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the theater I directed other people's material, so why
shouldn't I direct someone else's script? It was very freeing in
many respects not to be so close to something. I could immediately
be an audience member, and say, `This is good; this needs some
work,' and not feel that pang of, `I just gave birth to this, be
kind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Written by John Richards and James Flamberg, ``Nurse Betty'' is
the story of a small-town waitress, played by Renee Zellweger, who
witnesses the brutal murder of her drug-dealing husband and,
traumatized, retreats into a fantasy in which she believes herself
engaged to her favorite soap-opera character, a handsome, heroic
doctor played by Greg Kinnear. She sets out for Los Angeles,
pursued by the two hitmen she had observed, played by Morgan
Freeman and Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent every weekend and every day before we shot working on
the dialogue,'' said LaBute. ``But character-wise, plot-wise, it's
very much what the guys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the only thing that sprang from me as a complete idea
was Morgan and Chris going to the Grand Canyon at night,'' said
LaBute, referring to the scene in which Freeman's character reveals
that he has fallen in love with the woman he's chasing. ``The idea
was that she would imagine something transformative happening to
her at the Grand Canyon and then have these guys physically be
there and have something similar happen to them. I'm a person who
loves to continually thread things back into the hole. That's just
the way my mind works.''
</P>
<P>
   Depardieu Fils
</P>
<P>
   In France the actor Gerard Depardieu seems well on his way to
establishing an acting dynasty, like the Carradines or the
Bridgeses in the United States. Both Depardieu's daughter, Julie,
and his son, Guillaume, have embarked on successful acting careers,
and they both appeared with their father in the hugely successful
French mini-series ``The Count of Monte Cristo.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillaume, 29, is also the star of Leos Carax's grand, dreamlike
adaptation of Herman Melville's 1852 novel ``Pierre, or the
Ambiguities.'' Titled ``Pola X,'' it opens in New York Friday, two
years after its release in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre was a difficult character to play,'' Guillaume
Depardieu said over coffee in a West Side hotel, ``He's someone who
descends further and further, marginalizing himself, looking for
the truth, and finally he destroys himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The character is a spoiled son of the haute bourgeoisie who
drops out of his comfortable life to become a professional starving
poet, while he carries on a passionate affair with a strange young
woman from the East (Katerina Golubeva), who may or may not be his
half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Does Pierre become a great artist as a result of encountering
all of this brutal reality? ``Perhaps not,'' said Depardieu. But
why then has he gone through it? ``That, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, Guillaume is delicate-looking, a slender
young man with a self-described ``face of an angel,'' something he
resents. ``I would like to play villains,'' he said. ``But no one
will cast me with this mug.''

`THE WAY OF THE GUN' SHOOTS ITSELF IN THE FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The multi-Oscar-winning 1995 thriller ``The Usual Suspects'' was
the summation of a distinct brand of hip, funny, ultra-violent,
endlessly meandering, neo-noir crime drama that was, in many ways,
the signature American independent film of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun,'' the first directorial effort of
``Suspects'' screenwriter (and Seattle resident) Christopher
McQuarrie, is another edgy, hard-boiled crime drama that is very
much in this Tarantino-esque tradition, with all of the adjectives
above applying.
</P>
<P>
   But, somehow, the material seems agonizingly stale and the movie
just doesn't have the same kind of power to carry us away. It may
be that the casting spark or the directing touch is missing _ or,
more likely, it may just be that the time for this particular kind
of movie has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is the story of two wandering, low-life-scum
criminals _ Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del
Toro) _ who kidnap a young woman in an advanced state of pregnancy
(Juliette Lewis) who is acting as a surrogate mother for a wealthy
Southwestern couple.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly turns out, however, that the father-to-be (Scott
Wilson) is a mob boss of sorts, and the kidnap situation is soon
further complicated by the conflicting interests of what seems an
army of characters around him _ advisers, bodyguards and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, McQuarrie has a gift for hard-edged dialogue and
colorful characters. As in ``The Usual Suspects,'' he's also not a
bit afraid to construct a swift-moving, complex narrative that
constantly challenges his audience to keep up and often borders on
the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after a promising opening, this film loses our interest
fast. Without a dominating character or performance or visual style
to keep us focused, it soon becomes a tedious bloodbath populated
by uniformly unsympathetic (and unbelievable) characters.
</P>
<P>
   Also like ``Suspects,'' this movie works to a ``big-surprise''
ending in terms of one of its character relationships. But,
intentionally or unintentionally, the revelation is telegraphed
early in the movie, and anyone who hasn't figured it out before the
climax doesn't belong at an R-rated movie in the first place.

`NURSE BETTY': FRAGILE: HANDLE WITH DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' takes the most hackneyed dramatic ploy of soap
opera, a case of amnesia, and spins it into an irresistibly heady
mixture of sadness and hilarity. At its giddiest peaks the movie,
directed by Neil LaBute, produces that shivery feeling when your
heart melts but at the same moment you want to burst out laughing.
This whimsical rose-colored fairy tale with tragic undercurrents
suggests a contemporary ``Wizard of Oz'' for grown-ups. It is
easily the finest American comedy since David Russell's ``Flirting
With Disaster,'' another road movie that never ran out of
poignantly funny surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The event that whirls an innocent apple-cheeked waitress and
nursing-school dropout from the American heartland into a state of
enchanted forgetfulness is more traumatic than any tornado. When
Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) accidentally witnesses the grisly
murder of her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), by two hit men in the
living room of her home, she instantly erases it from her mind.
Deciding to leave her life in Fair Oaks, Kan., behind, she flees
the past in a 1997 Buick LeSabre borrowed from her dead husband's
used-car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow brick road she travels, without a scarecrow, tin man
or cowardly lion for company, is the great American highway leading
west to our own Emerald City, the Hollywood dream factory. That
factory has nourished Betty's fondest daydreams of living happily
ever after with a handsome modern-day prince. And the goal of this
not-terribly-bright, open-hearted young woman who dreams of getting
her nursing degree because she wants to ``help people'' is nothing
less than good old-fashioned romantic salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant and terrifying murder sequence at the beginning of
the film establishes its deliberately bipolar mood and lays out its
vision of modern America as a land of colliding, television-fed
dreams of romance and upward mobility. But instead of glibly
condemning the trash-television culture that has seeped into the
deepest crevices of American life, ``Nurse Betty'' accepts that
culture, recognizing both the necessity and the foolishness of
manufactured dreams from which there is no longer any practical
escape. Without them, it implies, there is no hope at all.
</P>
<P>
   As that murder sequence begins, Betty's no-good husband is being
terrorized by two thugs while his wife in the next room is riveted
to a videotape of that afternoon's episode of her favorite soap
opera, ``A Reason to Love.'' Betty is so enamored of its young
hero, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), a gifted surgeon in a Los
Angeles hospital, that her colleagues at the diner where she works
have recently given her a birthday present of a life-size cutout of
this dreamboat. As Ravell rebuffs the advances of the soap opera's
designated vixen, who turns right around and accuses him of sexual
assault, Betty's heart is in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Just then she is distracted by strange noises coming from the
living room and nervously peeks through a crack in the door in time
to witness the two killers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) shoot
her husband dead. As the movie cuts between the television show and
the murder, the soap opera seems strangely more real than the
fantastic, inexplicable violence erupting only a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging stunned but strangely cheerful, in a state diagnosed as
``post-traumatic stress'' (the word amnesia is never used), Betty
embraces the fantasy that David Ravell is the sweetheart she jilted
six years ago to marry Del. The time has come, she decides, for her
to go to Los Angeles for their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that takes many wonderful twists and turns toward a
bittersweet ending that strikes a perfect balance between tragedy
and a dizzy kind of bliss, fantasy eventually overtakes reality.
And for a brief, magical time Betty's traumatic delusion that
Ravell and his fictional world actually exist becomes real. Or half
real. (Among other things, ``Nurse Betty'' is about the power of
fiercely held fantasies to involve others.)
</P>
<P>
   As Betty arrives in Los Angeles, lands herself a job at a
hospital through astounding luck, then meets and charms the actor
who plays Ravell, the movie cuts back to the killers tracking her
down along with the stash of drugs she is unwittingly carrying in
the trunk of the car. Charlie ( Freeman), the older of the two, may
be a professional hit man, but he is also a remarkably erudite and
soft-spoken introvert who describes himself with bitter
self-contempt as ``a garbage man of the human condition.''
Freeman's mixture of animal cunning and resigned sad-eyed wisdom
finds the essence of Charlie's tortured soul.
</P>
<P>
   His accomplice and protege, Wesley ( Rock), is an angry,
hotheaded sociopath whose first reaction in tense situations is to
explode. He is the one major character in the movie without a
dream. Applying the same hysterical, blazing-eyed sarcasm to Wesley
that he brings to his stand-up comedy, Rock conveys a glowering,
chaotic nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair, helped by some snapshots of Betty, follow clues to
her whereabouts, Charlie nurtures his own sudsy fantasy of Betty as
a holy innocent, the romantic embodiment of everything he is not.
And in one of the film's riskiest moments, he falls into a dreamy
slow dance with the imaginary Betty at the edge of the Grand Canyon
in the middle of the night. (The soundtrack injects just the right
note of gentle mockery by playing Della Reese's overblown 1959 hit
``Don't You Know?'' in the background.)
</P>
<P>
   But the film's most enchanted sequence is the sustained romantic
pas de deux of Betty and her dream lover, who, despite massive
evidence to the contrary, she insists on believing is really Ravell
and not a vain young actor named George McCord. Flattered and
intrigued, George, in turn, nurtures his own fantasy that Betty,
far from being mentally disturbed, is really an ambitious,
dedicated Method actor who is so determined to be cast in the show
that she never goes out of character. As the tension escalates over
when and how the parallel bubble will finally burst, the screenplay
by John Richards (who wrote the story) and James Flamberg attains a
sublime comic delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   None of it would work if Zellweger's Betty weren't such a
perfectly blended mixture of sweetness, innocence and stubborn
determination tinged with a streak of petulance. Utterly likable
but never saccharine, flighty but not dumb, Betty is a contemporary
grown-up Dorothy Gale skipping down the yellow brick highway to
meet the wonderful wizard.
</P>
<P>
   What more appropriate guise for his millennial incarnation than
as a vain, self-centered actor who dreams of directing the show in
which he's a star? Kinnear, in his richest screen performance,
locates both the slippery charm and the nasty snub-nosed narcissism
of his Ken Doll character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is as much a triumph for LaBute as it is for its
cast, because its success is so dependent on its sustaining a
precarious balance between humor and pathos, realism and fantasy.
Compared with his vicious examinations of yuppie sexual cruelty,
``In the Co. of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' which
went for the jugular, ``Nurse Betty'' is almost warm and fuzzy. Yet
the director gives the film enough of a misanthropic edge to hold
sentimentality at bay.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of violent flashes in the murder sequence are so
(literally) hair-raising that you wonder for a second if the movie
can recover. But it does. And the emotional payoff is enormous.
``Nurse Betty'' says it's OK to wallow in suds, that dreaming is
only human. And without dreams to guide us in the land of a
thousand and one beckoning television wizards, we would never leave
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Nurse Betty'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of extreme
violence and some profanity.

`WENT TO CONEY ISLAND .. ': LOST YOUTH, LOST FRIEND, LOST CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God ... Back by 5'' is,
thank goodness, not as gawkily clever as its title, but it is an
odd mixture of boyish high spirits and grown-up melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It begins like an art-house episode of ``The Wonder Years,''
with an adult male voice-over recalling bygone days of youth as
snippets from pop songs mark the passing of the decades. In
bleached-out flashbacks to the old neighborhood, three friends _
Daniel, Stan and Richie _ progress from ``It's a Beautiful
Morning'' to ``Hot Child in the City'' to ``I'll Stop the World,''
as their clothes and haircuts change accordingly. The best of these
moments is a cringe-inducingly authentic garage-band cover of Adam
and the Ants' unforgettable (though not for lack of trying) hit
``Ant Music.''
</P>
<P>
   As the movie follows Daniel (Jon Cryer) and Stan (Rick Stear) on
their search for their lost chum, who they believe is homeless and
mentally ill, the flashbacks sketch their own slide from youthful
optimism to the misery and frustration of their 30s. Daniel works
at a jewelry store that's a small step up from a pawnshop, and
Stan, who limps as a result of a botched operation in childhood,
drinks, gambles and taxes the patience of his longtime girlfriend,
Gabby (Ione Skye). As the two friends wander through the desolate
winter landscape of Coney Island, we learn about the sexual
confusion and family tragedy that led to Richie's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Went to Coney Island'' is structured more like a play than a
movie. Its scenes _ Daniel and Stan's encounters with the eccentric
loners who populate the Boardwalk in the off-season _ seem talky
and stagy, and its action moves backward, toward a reckoning with
the past. Its cinematic interest is largely a result of Adam
Beckman's photography, with its artful overexposures and spare
wide-angle compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Cryer collaborated on the screenplay with the director, Richard
Schenkman. A few years back, the two of them made a quirky,
unassuming comedy called ``The Pompatus of Love,'' about the
romantic struggles of a group of young men in New York. This new
film is more ambitious, but its better moments are distinguished by
the scruffy egghead humor that made their earlier effort a pleasant
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The banter between Cryer and Stear flows easily and believably
and is often quite funny. But the script seems hamstrung between
smart-alecky self-consciousness _ a Skee-Ball parlor operator who
talks like a snide graduate student; a waitress who hands over a
menu with the comment ``It's as thick as `The Fountainhead''' _ and
heart-wrenching naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Richie's story is too weighted with pain to comport with the
student-film surrealism that surrounds it, and Rafael Baez, as the
adult Richie, seems to belong in a different movie. A subplot
involving Stan's gambling debts and a thuggish deli owner seems
pasted in out of a dozen other ``Mean Streets'' knockoffs. But the
filmmakers' earnestness and intelligence ultimately work at cross
purposes, and ``Went to Coney Island'' never quite comes to
dramatic or comic life.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: This film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual references and
profanity.

`IT ALL STARTS TODAY' TOUGH LESSONS FOR A DEDICATED EDUCATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It All Starts Today'' follows a year in the life of Daniel
(Philippe Torreton), the director of a preschool in a depressed
former coal-mining region of France. The son of a miner, Daniel
fills his journals with meditations on nature and history that
provide, as they are read on the soundtrack, a kind of poetic
counterpoint to, and relief from, the misery and deprivation that
dominate Daniel's professional life, and much of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed with unassuming realism, beautiful to look at even as it
refuses any suggestion of stylishness, this latest film from
Bertrand Tavernier is a passionate and relentless look at how
chronic unemployment _ with the usual side effects of alcoholism,
domestic abuse and pervasive despair _ menace the lives of
children. In spirit it's a bit like some of Jonathan Kozol's recent
books, which celebrate the resilience and innate goodness of
children even as they decry the way society has failed to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier takes us into the squalid housing projects in which
many of Daniel's students live and records the bureaucratic
boilerplate that, in the mouths of well-meaning but self-protective
functionaries and politicians, reduces young lives to jargon and
statistics. But he also illuminates the warmth and safety of the
school, watching Daniel and his colleagues sing songs, tell stories
and supervise art projects and playground games.
</P>
<P>
   In scene after scene ``It All Starts Today'' uncovers the
contrast between the world the teachers try to create for their
pupils and the world in which these children must grow up. In the
course of an ordinary day Daniel must deal with a boy who refuses
to talk, parents who can't afford minuscule contributions to the
school's activity fund, and a drunken mother who collapses on the
playground and then, overcome with shame, runs away, abandoning
both her 5-year-old daughter and her infant son to Daniel's care.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel addresses each crisis the only way he can, by a series of
improvised stopgap measures that seem woefully inadequate to
address the social catastrophe unfolding around him. He is
constantly at loggerheads with the local child welfare office, at
one point barring its staff members from the school. The elected
officials are no better, alternately complaining of budget
constraints and boasting about their accomplishments and
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The movie charts both Daniel's frustrations _ his humiliation by
an inspector who finds fault with his pedagogical techniques, the
trashing of his school by teen-age vandals _ and his minor
victories. He manages to harangue the authorities into providing
legally mandated medical examinations for the children and rescues
one young boy from an abusive home. He also tries to live a normal,
decent life: To find time for his girlfriend, Valeria (Maria
Pitaressi), to bond with her suspicious 12-year-old son, Remi
(Lambert Marchal), and to help his aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier _ who is still perhaps best known in this country for
``Round Midnight,'' his portrait of the sentimental bond between an
African-American jazz musician and an adoring French fan _ has
ventured into the kind of politically explicit drama often
associated with British filmmakers like Ken Loach and Mike Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   But on close inspection ``It All Starts Today'' can't be
dismissed _ or celebrated _ as a programmatically leftist film. If
it takes up traditionally leftist concerns _ the persistence of
social inequality, the plight of the poor _ it also implicitly
takes account of the European left's defeat. In this film the
French working class, once the proud standard-bearer of radical
tradition, survives as a demoralized underclass stripped of its
historical identity and its vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor who responds to Daniel's plea for more money with a
cynical tirade is a member of the Communist Party. Early on, a
politician stands in front of a mural of 19th-century strikers and
announces that the region must move beyond its claim to fame as the
setting of Zola's ``Germinal'' and stake its future on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's class consciousness at times seems downright quaint _
he's the only member of the school staff who belongs to the union _
and the parents of his charges hardly regard him as one of them.
When he complains to his own mother about her coffee, her tart
reply is, ``That's miner's coffee, not teacher's coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the politics of ``It all Starts Today'' might even
be called conservative, since it laments the breakdown of families
and communities and the corrosive effects of popular culture on
social cohesion and national morale. ``We're in Texas,'' says Samia
(Nadia Kaci), the pediatric nurse who becomes Daniel's chief ally,
marveling at a classroom full of children named Wendy, Kevin,
Clayton and Jimmy. ``No, we're on `The Young and the Restless,'''
Daniel replies.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of confecting an ideological soap opera or a
feel-good do-gooder melodrama, Tavernier has pulled off an
emotionally rich and remarkably restrained piece of storytelling.
Torreton, a member of the Comedie Francaise, is a marvelous actor,
compact and reserved, with a gentleness and sorrowful intelligence
that prevent his performance from becoming an exercise in
saintliness. His tough, unshowy goodness is one of the film's
consolations, though not its point.
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier strikes very few false notes. (One comes when Daniel
and his girlfriend, after an especially depressing visit to the
home of one of his students, make love in his car, as though to
remind us that this is, after all, a French film.) ``It All Starts
Today'' strikes a difficult and necessary moral balance, refusing
to succumb to hopelessness but also refusing to rule it out.

   Forget about global warming, it is global cooling that's changed
us all
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Latham
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ You hear a great deal about global warming
these days. Some people say it threatens life on Earth, others say
it is nothing but a myth. Me, I don't know anything about that
either way.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know about is global cooling. Now there is something
that has really changed our lives over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has warmed up a few degrees on the outside during that
time and, if so, that's a terrible thing. I know for sure, though,
that it has cooled down by 20 or 30 degrees on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has changed our lives more than air conditioning, I
don't know what it is. The term wasn't even invented when I was
born and now we cannot do without it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people my age remember not having it anywhere. We started
school around this time of year, which meant it was still blazing
hot for several weeks and we went until the beginning of June,
which gave us all of May during which to swelter.
</P>
<P>
   No air conditioning. No fans that I can remember. All we had
were open windows and the hope for a stiff breeze. What I remember
most about school in those days were the dozens of wasps that
buzzed along the ceiling and walls, just waiting for an
unsuspecting student.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, instead of learning multiplication, I was, like an
air traffic controller, dividing my time keeping track of all the
the wasps in the room. Forget plane geometry, I was plain scared.
Euclid never had to worry about this.
</P>
<P>
   The first air conditioner I remember at home was an oscillating
fan. I'm sure those fans were a remarkable invention but the most
remarkable feature about them is that they are blowing air
somewhere else almost all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And I still recall the day my dad installed the evaporative
cooler in the living room of our house. These contraptions weighed
about two tons and then you put water in them so that the air that
blew into the house was cool. Except it almost never was that cool,
especially if the sun happened to be beating down on the cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Evaporative coolers, which should never be used in areas with
more than 15 percent humidity, had two other significant features:
They grew a great fungus and they smelled like four-day old fish.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing you could about the fungus, but for the smell
we dumped a couple of gallons of Pine Sol a week into the water
tray. Everything smelled so strongly of pine in my house that we
really didn't have to take a bath for a week. It smelled like
Christmas in July.
</P>
<P>
   I was in high school before my family got its first window unit
that actually used Freon. My parents thought they were being smart
by installing it in their room, turned out they would always regret
it. Because from the instant the unit was installed, their bedroom
became the family room. They literally would have to drive us out
at night.
</P>
<P>
   And then a strange thing began to happen. After just a few weeks
of that wonderful air conditioning, it seemed to do nothing but get
hotter outside. Where once I could have worked or played outside
all day long, suddenly, the heat got to be too much for me.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in high school I was lucky enough to get a class in
the newly renovated _ and air conditioned _ part of the building.
Going there just before noon made every class afterwards
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but it hadn't been that hot before, had it?
</P>
<P>
   Global warming may not be as big a danger as global spoiling.
We've all become so accustomed to being comfortable all the time
that we can't stand it when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Besides , the two things might be tied together anyway. I'm
thinking global warming comes from the exhaust from all those air
conditioners.

`THE WATCHER': STALKED BY A SERIAL KILLER, HE PURSUES TALK
THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night last spring, fighting insomnia in a North Carolina
hotel room, I spent a few hours flipping back and forth between
``The Matrix'' and ``Devil's Advocate,'' which were showing on
competing cable stations. After a while they began to run together
into a single montage of Keanu Reeves dressed in black clothes,
furrowing his smooth brow in bewilderment as he grappled with one
metaphysical conundrum after another.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Watcher,'' a damp, morose bit of gristle directed by
Joe Charbanic, Reeves, once again dressed in black, looks jowly and
fatigued, perhaps because this time out the role of metaphysical
conundrum has been assigned to him. Playing a sicko whose metier is
the strangulation of young women, Reeves conveys his villainy by
enunciating every syllable with exquisite care and inflecting his
utterances with the fastidious sarcasm of a surfer James Mason.
Unfortunately, bewilderment comes more naturally to him than
diabolical intelligence, and his line readings, aiming for a
mixture of suavity and creepiness, just sound silly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not even Sir Anthony Hopkins himself could do much
with the lines Reeves is required to deliver: ``We need each other,
we define each other, we're yin and yang,'' he declares at a
climactic moment, adapting Tom Cruise's tearful speech from ``Jerry
Maguire'' to a darker purpose. The role of yin _ an FBI agent named
Jack Campbell _ is played by James Spader. As any moviegoer knows,
homicidal maniacs and the law enforcement officers who pursue them
are joined together by deep and mysterious psychic bonds. ``The
Watcher'' pushes this convention to an extreme by making Jack's
torment the killer's explicit motive.
</P>
<P>
   And Jack is plenty tormented. This we know because he staggers
home to a messy apartment, stares into his empty refrigerator and
takes a lot of pills. He also sees a therapist (Marisa Tomei), who
keeps a copy of Psychology Today on her office coffee table.
``Maybe you're just afraid,'' she speculates, after Jack haltingly
tries to explain how being stalked by a murderous lunatic makes him
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about that,'' the good doctor suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not. Like ``The Cell,'' the season's other serial-killer
picture, ``The Watcher'' is the feature-directing debut of a
filmmaker whose previous work consists mostly of music videos and
it is similarly crammed with MTV-style visual effects. The
murderer's point of view is registered in grainy hand-held video,
and Jack's inner turmoil reaches us through smeary, cut-up
flashbacks. The soundtrack swells with spooky techno effects, angel
choirs and echoey bits of remembered dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   All of this moody posturing is evidence of the film's aspiration
to be taken as what its production notes solemnly call _ daring to
invoke the name of Hitchcock _ a ``psychological thriller.'' But
it's about as thrilling as it is psychologically insightful. There
are some big explosions and a straight-to-video car chase, at the
end of which Jack and the entire Chicago police force seem to give
up, as though the film had kept rolling after the director shouted
``Cut!'' This is one of those movies in which the forces of law and
order are at once omnipotent _ commanding extraordinary resources
of technology and manpower, all of which can be summoned by
snapping open a cell phone _ and utterly incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy as you think,'' Jack muses about his job, but
watching him let the killer slip through his fingers again and
again, you wonder how hard it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the movie Jack crashes through his apartment, grabs a
hypodermic needle and jabs it into a big purple bruise just below
his bellybutton. ``I'm self-injecting migraine medication,'' he
tells his worried shrink. By the end of ``The Watcher'' you'll need
your own prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Watcher'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes several brutal
killings and a lot of tense FBI-agent-under-pressure swearing.

PARIS ANTIQUE DEALERS ARE TOASTING THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, France)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention, jet setters: get to Paris next week (if you can find
a hotel room). The opening of the French social season begins on
Tuesday, when more than 90,000 international collectors _ from the
the Prince of Lichtenstein and the Princess of Kent to Baroness
Philippine de Rothschild and Quentin Tarantino _ are expected to
congregate for a two-week extravaganza of openings, parties and
special events connected to the 20th edition of the Biennale
International des Antiquaires, the Super Bowl of antiques fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As antiques dealers, we are experiencing a fantastic era,''
said Claude Blaizot, president of the National Antiques Dealers
Syndicate in France. ``We are witnessing Paris' comeback on the big
chessboard, which the international art market represents.''
</P>
<P>
   The fair opens on Wednesday evening with a black-tie benefit for
the Foundation for Paris Hospitals. Bernadette Chirac, wife of
President Jacques Chirac of France, will welcome 800 guests to the
dinner, which has been sold out since Aug. 1. Isabelle Adjani,
Catherine Deneuve, Hubert Guerrand-Hermes and Dennis and Terry
Stanfill are among the R.S.V.Ps.
</P>
<P>
   Attending charity events is not considered particularly chic in
Paris, but people clamor to attend this one because they are given
the first crack at the Biennale. After dinner there is a private
viewing and shopping is allowed. The people viewing is pretty good,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities resume on Thursday night with a
by-invitation-only opening cocktail party given under the patronage
of . Some 4,000 people attend, dressed to kill in their fall 2000
``robes de cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Biennale setting is far more elaborate than any of the
American antiques fairs. The 116 dealers create stylish stands with
wallpaper, damask or paneling on the walls, and marble or oak
floors, whether they are selling Chinese pots or midcentury modern
pieces. (The cost of the decor comes in addition to the booth
rental fee, which is several hundred dollars a square meter.)
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 10 percent of the dealers spend more than $250,000 on
decoration,'' said Herve Aaron, a Paris dealer who is a longtime
participant. ``We've been working on our booth since July in a
warehouse near Roissy, where we did a mock-up of the space, which
will be hexagonal with an 18th-century parquet de Versailles floor
and Regence wood paneling on loan from a famous chateau.''
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to create a dazzling background for, among other
things, a rare Louis XV white lacquered commode signed by
Antoine-Mathieu Criard. ``He was one of the three most famous
cabinetmakers for lacquer during the reign of Louis XV,'' Aaron
said. ``And white is very unusual for lacquer in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Grange, a top Paris decorator, is designing the booth
for Pierre Passebon, owner of Galerie de Passage. Francois-Joseph
Graf has created settings for the pre-Colombian pots of Galerie
Mermoz, the 18th-century furniture and objets d'art offered by the
dealer Jacques Perrin, and the 20th-century specialist Robert
Vallois.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers are making a huge effort this year, partly as a
pre-emptive move to win clients' loyalties before Christie's and
Sotheby's start conducting sales in Paris. After years of dallying,
the French Parliament this year finally passed legislation to allow
foreign auction houses to operate in France, and the two houses are
expected to be in business by the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The art and antiques business is good in Paris. The French
auction houses reported that turnover increased 19.5 percent in the
first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more competition there is, the more clients there will
be,'' Blaizot said.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennale is held every other September in the Carrousel du
Louvre, an underground space next to the Pyramid at the Louvre
Museum. This year's collection opens to the public next Friday and
runs through Oct. 1. To maintain its attraction to regular
attendees _ who include Leon Black, Henry Kravis and Ronald Lauder
_ the French dealers' organization has added 23 new dealers and
organized a special Paris trip for American museum curators and
their trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Fine Arts Museums of
San Francisco are among those sending curators. They will be given
a private luncheon in the French Senate in the Luxembourg Palace, a
superb Louis XIII building; a dinner at Malmaison, the house
Napoleon built for Josephine; a tour of the 18th-century hotel
particulier of and Michel David-Weill; and cocktails with Felix
Rohatyn, U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  ambassador to France, at the American Embassy,
which is in a former Rothschild house.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennale is all about discoveries, and rediscoveries. This
year Modernism buffs may want to see Galerie Olivier Watelet, with
furniture by Jacques Quinet displayed in a booth with gold-leaf
walls and bronze floor panels. Even experts in midcentury modern
French furniture cannot often identify the work of this
20th-century Parisian interior architect and designer, though he is
the subject of a new biography.
</P>
<P>
   Quinet (1918-1992) was the son of a taxi fleet owner in Caen,
France, a city in Normandy that was leveled in World War II.
Trained by the Jesuits, he seems to have been a precocious student.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war he went to Paris to work for an architect,
Antoine Charpentier. At 21 he set up an office of his own. When
World War II broke out, he was drafted into the French air force,
then released when the government capitulated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he reopened his office in Paris. He spent his days
getting to know the skilled cabinetmakers and artisans in the
Faubourg St. Antoine, near the place de la Bastille. Despite
shortages of fine materials, be began to design bureaus in amaranth
wood, tables with bronze legs and chairs in white oak covered in
petit-point upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Claude, admired as a hostess, invited clients and
friends to soirees in their home. Soon Quinet was working for the
directors of companies like Larousse, Evian, Air France, Dassault
and Krema, a maker of sweets. He designed the interiors of planes,
trains and ocean liners. He did several pieces of furniture for the
residence of General Eisenhower at Marnes-la-Coquette.
</P>
<P>
   His furniture style was stripped down but elegantly
neoclassical, with bronze ornament and supports. He also used
lacquer regularly. He is ripe for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The other great surprise in the Biennale is the booth of
Vallois, who is showing a room full of museum-quality Eileen Gray
furniture. It is a collection that he sold in 1971 and has
reassembled for the fair.
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 pieces in the collection: furniture, rugs,
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the surprise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is for sale.'' Vallois said.

`THE WAY OF THE GUN': A NOIR STORY OF GUNS ALWAYS AT THE READY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who doesn't have much truck with the schematic
approach of those blustering screenwriting teachers who've become
legends in Los Angeles, Christopher McQuarrie writes scripts that
are meticulously worked out and lovingly hand-polished; they glow
with pride.
</P>
<P>
   He won an Academy Award for best screenplay for the stylish
sleight-of-hand of ``The Usual Suspects,'' perhaps the most
arbitrarily plotted crime film ever made; you bet that Kevin Spacey
is Keyser Soze only because he is having so much fun with the
performance. In McQuarrie's new script, ``The Way of the Gun,'' the
action is compartmentalized and the twists come in on a schedule,
something the New York subway system should aspire to. Each note is
struck to hang in the air for several beats. The movie may feel
redundant, but it is stylish and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun'' feels like a more violent and grim
version of a Coen brothers film; it could be Quentin Tarantino's
``Raising Arizona.'' Its lead characters are small-time criminals
who tend to speak in ambitious and hilariously orotund turns of
phrase, and it's a film noir built around the feelings adults have
about babies, climaxing with a childbirth and a lengthy gunfight
and standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The, um, heroes go by the names Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and
Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) _ the real-life surnames of Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid _ and they've ended up pursuing a
criminal career of ultraviolence (the way of the gun) because what
else could they do? When they visit a sperm bank in an attempt to
contribute to the future and make a few bucks at the same time,
their responses to the standard questions are so garishly outre
that it's surprising they don't set off fire alarms. Their options?
``Petty crime and minimum wage,'' Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   While at the sperm bank, Parker and Longbaugh hatch a plan to
kidnap Robin (Juliette Lewis), a young woman doing surrogate mother
duty for a wealthy couple, Hale Chidduck (Scott Wilson) and his
much younger wife, Francesca (Kristin Lehmann). The forlorn Robin
is about to give birth. ``I don't mind if it stays in there
forever,'' she drawls.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Longbaugh flee with Robin, pursued by a pair of
beautifully dressed security guards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) and
Joe Sarno (James Caan), Chidduck's special envoy and a fellow given
to language as grandiloquent as his prey. ``I can promise you a day
of reckoning that you will not live long enough to never forget,''
he snarls, and he uses the word adjudicator so much you suspect he
gets a royalty every time he says it.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie's dialogue _ lines like ``Karma's only justice without
satisfaction'' _ is self-conscious and baroque: Rococo puffs. The
characters' quirks seem to be carved in stone and placed in
platinum settings. Despite the deliberateness of his conception _
at one point, during a shootout in a car chase, the characters push
their sedans forward with their feet _ McQuarrie, making his
directorial debut, does have an authentic, if somewhat offbeat,
taste for inflating the nihilism of noir. He has a strong feeling
for the genre, and the gunfights _ which are louder than the Dolby
trailers _ are staged with an undeniable morality, and the
characters imbued with a sense of inevitability. They know what's
going to happen to them, and proceed anyway, as if finding honor
lying under the wheels of an oncoming Fate.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie understands how to direct actors, and he gets what he
wants from them. Lewis, a mom-to-be with a face that suggest an
infant's, is an interesting choice for the role. Robin represents
hope and the future and is most unwilling to change, but it's hard
to tell if she is meant to be determined or childishly stubborn.
Lewis makes her both, with a rapt delivery that is surprisingly
loud; her dreamy foghorn of a voice has a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe is the real surprise. His angel-boy face is hidden
under wiry scrubs of facial hair, and he uses a runty voice as if
he had studied the Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino of the 1970s. (He
sounds particularly like the Pacino of ``Serpico,'' speaking as if
he burned the roof of his mouth.) Del Toro, whose turn in
``Suspects'' was so freaky it was like watching a live action Dick
Tracy villain, is more understated here. He is a mesmerized soldier
of fortune, simultaneously out of it and wary. He's even dressed
like a revisionist western hero.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``The Usual Suspects,'' ``The Way of the Gun'' is not
intentionally vague. (In the earlier film, there may have been a
tiny clue; during the invasion of the ship in the movie's climax,
Spacey's Verbal Kint recognizes the language of the sailors, which
was also Soze's native tongue.) And this picture remains true to
its own internal logic. All the pieces fit snugly together.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie is smart about moviemaking in ways that show his
respect for the genre, and he doesn't force the material on
audiences. He knows that part of the enjoyment they will get is in
knowing they've seen movies like this before that weren't so direct
and intense. He uses a few pop songs, but the score is mostly
simple, with scenes highlighted by oboe and timpani.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that entertaining pointedness, one of the best scenes
takes place when Parker hands his hostage a sandwich and she tears
into it. ``It's from a gas station,'' he says patronizingly. ``It's
still good,'' she responds, dealing with what's right in front of
her. That's the strength of ``The Way of the Gun.'' It's a song
you've heard before, but each chord is hit with extraordinary
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Way of the Gun'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes numerous gun
battles, a long torture scene and a bloody childbirth.

`CLOUDS': SPELLING OUT BIG IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shot in limpid black and white, studded with symbols and
contemplative vistas of sea and sky, ``Clouds'' is a small movie
with large pretensions. It concerns a young physicist named Robert
St. John, who, to work out a radical new cosmology (``It may
subvert basic models'' he tells a colleague), takes a leave from
his teaching post and sets himself up in a quiet town on the
Northern California coast. There Robert (Michael Patrick Gaffney)
meets a painstakingly selected cast of eccentrics: a chatty, pious
landlady, a profane and cynical artist and a mysterious woman who
claims to have known the scientist in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's past is revisited through dreamlike flashbacks,
sometimes accompanied by voiceover. These moments suggest that in
his quest for knowledge of the world, Robert has neglected the
experience of it. He's so obsessed with meaning that he's lost any
sense of who he is. Luckily, it all comes right in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are not the zero and the world the same?'' Robert asks us.
``The suffering and the love? Reality and I are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no. ``Clouds,'' written and directed by Don Thompson,
is so eager to impel our contemplation of its big ideas (whatever
they may be) that it neglects to give its story much in the way of
interest or credibility. The dialogue consists of long
philosophical stretches of argument interrupted by sudden bursts of
inexplicable emotions. Thompson creates an illusion of enigmatic
seriousness by ploddingly spelling out themes _ art versus science,
truth versus illusion _ then smudging them with bits of contrived
surreal humor and artsy incongruity.
</P>
<P>
   All this is in the service of something so lofty it can't be
explained. Robert deflects inquiries into his cosmological project,
warning his artist friend that it's too mystical for him to grasp
and telling his colleague that his theory may be ``beyond
coherence, even mathematical coherence.'' This may be the movie's
truest assessment of itself, unless that comes a bit later, when a
character who seems to be Robert's ex-girlfriend tells him he's
``about the most intelligent dumb person I've ever met.''
``Clouds'' is about the dumbest intelligent movie I've ever seen.

`SOLAS': A MOTHER'S SELFLESS LOVE AND DIGNITY

<P>
   One of the good things that can come with age, if we're lucky,
is a growing capacity to feel and to give our unconditional love.
Benito Zambrano's quietly moving film ``Solas'' explores this gift
with a depth and subtlety that remind you, indirectly, of why the
movies are so infatuated with violence. It's so much easier to
portray anger on the screen (it's a short-cut to feeling) than to
evoke the kind of watchful, selfless devotion that radiates from
the film's central character who is identified only as Mother
(Maria Galiana). Because it's the kind of feeling that affects
things only gradually, it is almost impossible to portray on the
screen without some sentimental amplification.
</P>
<P>
   But Galiana's still, intensely concentrated portrait of a woman
who changes people's lives through small acts of kindness shows
that great screen acting doesn't necessarily rely on
psychologically revealing dialogue. This sober Spanish film, so
pointedly antithetical in spirit to the zany, sexually charged
antics of Pedro Almodovar and his imitators, has few frills. No
heavenly choirs or misty-eyed close-ups are trotted out to push our
emotional buttons. Except for Antonio Meliveo's discreetly
melancholy score, the movie is almost as plain as its central
character.
</P>
<P>
   A stout weather-beaten woman of around 70 who moves slowly and
rarely cracks a smile, Galiana projects the earthy solidity of
someone who despite coming from humble circumstances and being
illiterate is at home in the world because she doesn't expect much
of life. In one of her few remarks about herself, she gravely
professes to have a clear conscience. Those words, along with her
simple acts of thoughtfulness suggest that she is devoutly
religious, although she keeps most of her feelings to herself.
</P>
<P>
   She has made a rare journey into the city (the movie was filmed
in Seville) to be with her husband (Paco De Osca) while he recovers
from surgery. Hour after hour, she sits patiently at his bedside
lost in her thoughts while crocheting. When he addresses her, he
turns out to be a bitter old tyrant who baits his wife by claiming
to detect the smell of a man on her. Having endured his cruelty for
years, she seems almost impervious. But eventually we learn that he
used to be an abusive drunk who gambled, womanized and physically
abused his wife and his daughter, Maria (Ana Fernandez), with whom
she is staying.
</P>
<P>
   Wiry, nervous, and consumed with rage, Maria is definitely her
father's child, although she hates him for refusing to pay for any
higher education. Furious that she has to earn a living doing
menial labor (she works for a cleaning service), she loathes her
bosses, looks down on her co-workers, drinks heavily and fantasizes
about winning the lottery. When a friendly neighborhood bartender
who fancies her isn't looking, she blithely steals his liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's nearly hopeless life reaches a crossroads when she
becomes pregnant by her boyfriend Juan (Juan Fernandez), a burly
truck driver who uses her for sex and refuses to accompany her to
an abortion clinic when she pleads with him to go.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting, her mother takes in the whole sad picture of
Maria's life without comment and bit by bit she begins to brighten
it up. She shops for food. She cooks, places flowers in Maria's
bleak apartment and installs a chair she has found on the street.
By chance, she also meets her daughter's downstairs neighbor
(Carlos Alvarez-Novoa), a lonely old man whose only friend is his
loyal dog, Achilles. The two strike up a courtly friendship, and
she gives him simple, healthful meals.
</P>
<P>
   One day when she is going home from the hospital, Achilles
signals that there's trouble. She enters the apartment to find him
stricken with diarrhea, and despite his protestations insists on
cleaning him up.
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship has only lasted a matter of days before it's
time for her to leave and take her husband home. But before
departing, she introduces Maria to the neighbor. The introduction
proves profoundly life-changing for the two neighbors, who had
never spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solas,'' which opens Friday at the Lincoln Plaza in Manhattan,
eventually makes a bold narrative leap that is not entirely
convincing. Its final scenes are a bit two patly sentimental for
comfort. But Galiana's quietly monumental performance is one for
the ages. She is every mother who ever watched a grown-up child
stumble through life, swallowed her sadness and disapproval and did
what she could to help.
</P>

&HT;     COURT APPEARS READY TO STRIKE DOWN MINORITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Civil rights groups who hoped to preserve the
remnants of affirmative action after Proposition 209 outlawed it
appear to be headed for disappointment from the California Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Wednesday took up the major unresolved legal
question about the 1996 ballot measure: whether a government agency
can target minorities and women in recruitment, without promising
favorable treatment in jobs or contracts. The court showed little
doubt about the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plain language of (209) specifically prohibits that kind
of program,'' Justice Joyce Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, like Kennard a generally
moderate voice on the court, cited a report by the state's
nonpartisan legislative analyst saying contractors ``would no
longer need to show good-faith efforts'' to use minority and female
subcontractors under Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   The case could affect scores of city and county government
programs that make special efforts to inform, recruit and train
minorities and women. A ruling is due within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 209 prohibited preferences based on race or sex in
state and local contracting, employment and education. The measure
was upheld by federal courts, but the state's high court must
determine its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the court was a challenge to a San Jose ordinance, which
requires contractors, on city construction contracts over $50,000,
to contact at least four subcontractors owned by minorities or
women, negotiate with them and accept their bids or state
legitimate reasons for rejection. It does not give minority-owned
companies a built-in edge in bidding or set quotas or goals for
their hiring.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which has an ordinance like the one in San Jose,
filed arguments on behalf of Oakland, Berkeley, Albany, Hayward,
the counties of Alameda and Marin, and other local governments
seeking to preserve ``outreach'' to underrepresented groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Browne, the lawyer for a white male contractor who
challenged San Jose's ordinance, said it was designed ``to provide
a competitive advantage to minority- and women-owned businesses''
by requiring contractors to make special efforts to recruit them.
</P>
<P>
   A local government is free to reach out to all potential
applicants as long as its measures are strictly neutral by race and
sex, said Browne, of the Pacific Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Ronald George appeared to agree, suggesting that
outreach remains legal if it ``goes out to all groups.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers representing San Jose said the ordinance was
justified by a study it conducted in 1990 that found minorities
were underrepresented in city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to equalize the position of minorities and women in
the bidding process,'' said San Jose's lawyer, former City Attorney
Joan Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that ``contracting opportunities exist largely
for white males,'' said state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who
argued in support of the ordinance.

 &HT;    HIGH 'PETROL' PRICES IN EUROPE FUELING RISING TEMPERS, TENSIONS
 &HT;    With chart attached at end of story.

   LONDON _ If rising prices at the pump are annoying Americans,
they're infuriating Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Already paying the highest prices in Europe, Britons awoke
Thursday to headlines suggesting new taxes could drive the cost of
gasoline to the psychologically important level of 5 pounds _ or
about US$7.60 _ a gallon. Already, the price of unleaded gasoline
is the equivalent of about US$5.25 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Howard, a dentist who lives in suburban Surrey,
wondered Thursday afternoon if the increases would ever stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs me 50 quid (more than US$75) to fill my car,'' he
said, pulling the nozzle from his Toyota sport utility vehicle at a
service station. ``I can clean a few more teeth to come up with the
money, but one has to worry about how average working people can
keep up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Europe already are far above those in the United
States, mostly because of higher taxes. In Britain, for example,
more than two-thirds of the price per gallon is tax. The British
government has been slowly raising taxes on fuels, and retailers,
also pressed by rising crude oil prices, say they have no choice
but to push prices up even higher.
</P>
<P>
   In France, gasoline is cheaper, but the tension is higher. Over
the past few weeks, rising fuel prices have spawned a series of
demonstrations focused largely on blocking travel between Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, French truckers stepped up their five-day blockade
of the nation's fuel depots. They prevented deliveries to thousands
of service stations, which were quickly running out of gas.
Thousands of English tourists are trapped in France, unable to find
enough fuel for their journeys home.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, taxi drivers want to be allowed to raise fares to
offset fuel costs, and expressed their concerns with ``Operation
Escargot'' by driving at a snail's pace through the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In Calais Thursday, farmers atop tractors blocked access roads
to the Channel Tunnel, which connects France and Britain. Farmers
scuffled briefly with riot police when the security forces barred
protesters from closing the freight entrance to the tunnel, which
allows travel under the English Channel. A dozen tractors later cut
off the access road to the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Later, frustrated British vacationers caught in a three-hour
traffic jam caused by the farmers retaliated with their own
roadblock to protest what they perceived as preferential treatment
by French police. The Britons decided to block the French highway
leading to the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   John Hazell, a retired Essex financial adviser who had been on a
day-trip to see Impressionist painter Claude Monet's garden near
Rouen, told reporters that French police were letting their
countrymen through while making the Britons wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get home,'' Hazell said. ``We are fighting a
combination of the farmers and the French police, who are on the
same team.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of aviation fuel shortages, some passenger flights have
been cancelled or rerouted in Lyon. The airports in the western
French cities of Nantes and Rennes ran out of fuel, and the Nice
airport on the Riviera is expected to run dry by Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ordered many service stations to conserve
fuel for police, hospital and emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has been losing his patience
with the truckers and said their strike had ``inflicted a major
handicap on the French economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist premier, faced with a widening barrage of strike
threats, said an offer of a 15 percent tax cut on their diesel fuel
was the government's final offer. The truckers demanded 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The protestors seemed to have been inspired by last week's
success of French fishermen, who blocked ports until they won a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders, environmentalists and editorialists have
criticized Jospin for giving in to pressure and spawning even more
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, wary of the escalating protests, is urging
OPEC leaders to lower prices and will seek to influence the major
petroleum-producing states during meetings this weekend in Vienna.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy, cool weather will linger over the much of the southern
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys Friday as high pressure on the
East Coast continues to circulate moist air into the Southeast.
Periods of rain and some thunder will occur near the Gulf Coast,
especially over central and eastern sections. Drier air and some
sun will cover the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will spread from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast.
A weak cool front will be accompanied by a narrow band of clouds
and a few light showers as it approaches the southern Great Lakes.
Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will occur near the Ohio River as
humidity increases.
</P>
<P>
   Another surge of very cool air will reach the Northwest attended
by coastal and mountain showers. By Saturday, snow showers are
expected in the higher elevations of the northern Cascades and
Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HISTORIC DROUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City has joined a growing list of places in the
southern Plains that have set records for uninterrupted dryness.
Thursday was the 40th consecutive day without rain. The statewide
average rainfall for Oklahoma in August was only 0.13 inches, the
lowest since records began in 1895. The previous August record was
set in 1936 at the peak of the Dust Bowl years. The drought this
year has been especially severe from Kansas to Texas, however the
Dust Bowl droughts spanned several years in the 1930s and covered
most of the Plains.

 &HT;    SUN FINDS AN ASYLUM FROM CRAZY SILICON VALLEY REAL ESTATE PRICES
 &HT;    830&AMP;add. With TECH-LIST. For release Sunday, Sept. 10
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ When Sun Microsystems Inc. started looking
for space for a new office and corporate headquarters here four
years ago, it faced the same problems as any company trying to
expand in crowded Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Developable land is scarce. Real estate prices are among the
highest in the world. And in environmentally conscious California,
getting regulatory approval for new projects isn't usually easy.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's approach, however, was anything but typical.
</P>
<P>
   When the state put an abandoned 112-year-old former mental
hospital, decrepit and choked by weeds, up for sale as surplus
land, the computer giant bid on the site and won.
</P>
<P>
   Sun got the entire 82-acre site once known as the Agnews Insane
Asylum, complete with about 100 buildings, for about $621,000 an
acre _ cheap for commercial property in the heart of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the story behind the rise of Sun's newest campus, which
officially opened Aug. 23, goes far beyond the palatable price tag
and unusual history. It is a story rife with controversy, despite
seemingly good intentions by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the office park for the first time and it's hard knowing
where you are. It has the feel of a college campus, the appearance
of a turn-of-the-century town and the flavor of high-tech that is
inescapable in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Next to corporate meeting rooms, community ballet recitals and
public concerts are held in a refurbished auditorium where the rich
wood stage and high ceilings still echo performances of another
time.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is a new homeless shelter. Nearby, developers
are building low-income apartments _ something badly needed in
expensive Santa Clara _ and single-family houses.
</P>
<P>
   And smack in the middle of the corporate campus, between
buildings where Sun will have its world headquarters next year, a
15-acre city park _ the third largest in Santa Clara _ attracts
kids on scooters and picnicking families.
</P>
<P>
   All of it was paid for or prompted by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like something that's not supposed to happen,'' said a
giddy Larry Wolfe. As director of the City of Santa Clara's parks
department, Wolfe worked extensively with Sun on the newly named
Agnews Historic Park. ``I don't know of anything that has been done
like this anywhere before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is right. There hasn't been a project quite like Sun's
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But in cities where space is often at a premium _ especially in
high-tech, high-growth communities _ more and more technology
companies are taking unique approaches to their new digs.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, Internet company CarrierPoint Inc.
recently moved into the 60-year-old Siemens-Westinghouse building,
in part because company executives hope the retrofitted office
space near Georgia Tech will help attract new talent.
</P>
<P>
   And near Dayton, Ohio, local officials are trying to redevelop
the aging former Mound nuclear weapons plant, with its existing
high-speed data network and Cold War-era backup power supply, into
a 60-acre ``Smart Park'' for Internet and telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Often, like Sun, companies are partnering with local governments
to get projects done more quickly in tough-to-develop areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, for example, Computer Sciences Corp. is
teaming up with the city to redevelop a seven-block section of
downtown into an office campus and a new City Hall. Intel Corp.
also is working closely with Austin officials to build a new design
center downtown after environmental groups objected to the
semiconductor giant's earlier plans to build over the sensitive
Barton Springs aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clara, where space is so tight that the former mental
hospital was one of the last large developable pieces of land
anywhere, Sun saw a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go looking for land these days and it becomes a matter of
what can business use, what can the public use,'' said Sun
spokeswoman Diane Carlini. ``At some point, there's only so much
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, best known for developing the Java technology used in
Internet design and for its Unix-based servers, had another motive
in redeveloping the old hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, about the only
problem worse than finding good real estate is finding good
workers.
</P>
<P>
   After Sun officials determined that a high concentration of
their employees live within two miles of the abandoned hospital,
the company decided to try and buy it. At the same time, they
figured, working at the unique location could be an added
attraction for new employees.
</P>
<P>
   When a second phase is completed and Sun's headquarters moves
from nearby Palo Alto next year, about 3,600 employees will work at
the Santa Clara campus. Currently, almost 2,000 work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we have to find ways to differentiate ourselves
in a very hotly contested labor market,'' said Bill Agnello, senior
vice president of workplace resources at Sun. ``We think that
employees and potential employees will respond well.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In all, Sun spent about $250 million, or about $250 per square
foot of space, developing the campus, according to Agnello. That's
about the going rate for new space in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had other opportunities that would have been less risky,
less time-consuming, less expensive, but we felt this was the best
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a hospital that was falling apart and that the state
had closed it many years earlier,'' he said. ``The state didn't
have the rehabilitation dollars for it; the (nearby) residents
hated it. We were able to utilize it and still provide for open
space for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that didn't make it easy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sun's plans for the Agnews campus became the focal
point of one of the most contentious development battles ever in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the historical significance of the hospital
buildings, which were placed on the National Register of Historic
Places a few years ago, and environmental and traffic concerns, the
Santa Clara planning department initially rejected Sun's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the city council narrowly approved it a few months
later, leading some preservationists to file suit in an attempt to
derail the development. That suit failed, but it didn't stop
opponents from gathering enough signatures to put the plan to a
referendum, which Sun won in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite praises for the project today, some are still bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a very tragic thing that happened,'' said
attorney Susan Brandt-Hawley, whose law firm led the unsuccessful
legal battle. ``They said they couldn't restore (all) the
buildings, so they sacrificed historic resources of national
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt-Hawley, whose Northern California law firm specializes in
historical preservation cases, said she wouldn't be surprised to
see more bitter fights over historic buildings as space gets harder
to find and cash-laden tech companies continue to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things going on in California right now,'' she
explained. ``Space is becoming limited, and finally we're an old
enough state that we've started to have 100-year-old buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun did save and renovate four of the buildings at the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the auditorium, the refurbished former director's mansion
harkens back to a different age, with its warm sitting parlor and
wide wooden staircase that leads to rooms with a bird's-eye view of
the rest of the campus. Today, community groups can use the
building, completed in 1912, for meetings and other events.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the campus is a soaring clock tower that's
still being renovated. Depending on where you stand, the clock's
giant face peeks out between the 450 or so mature trees that Sun
kept on the site. The clock tower is near the only building that
Sun renovated that isn't open to the public, the hospital's former
administration building, which Sun uses for office space.
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials said they wanted to preserve more buildings, but
said the others were too decrepit to convert to modern offices.
They haven't completely disappeared, however. Roof tiles from some
of the old buildings were used on eight new buildings that Sun has
constructed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the development's controversy, Sun officials say they
did the best they could to blend corporate with community when
developing the new campus. And, they say, they'd do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, it was a matter of ``How do we make everybody as
happy as we can,'' said Carlini, the Sun spokeswoman. ``This is
what came about.''

U.N. REMOVES ALL AID WORKERS FROM WEST TIMOR AFTER ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Sadako
Ogata, on Thursday pulled the agency's remaining relief workers out
of West Timor, following Wednesday's attack on a U.N. refugee
office in Atambua that left three international staff members dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said she was withdrawing the relief workers because of the
likelihood of continuing harassment by self-styled militiamen
opposed to independence for neighboring East Timor. The decision
leaves tens of thousands of refugees, who had fled similarly bloody
attacks a year ago in the eastern part of the island, without
assistance from the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine agency employees, all but two of them Indonesian,
left Atambua Thursday, in a convoy escorted by Indonesian soldiers,
for Batugade, a border town in East Timor, where they were flown by
helicopter to the capital Dili. The group included two workers who
had survived Wednesday's attack _ a Fijian security officer and a
Japanese human rights official working for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 70 other employees of the United Nations and
other international organizations were flown out of Kupang, the
main town in West Timor, to Denpasar in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the three slain refugee workers were carried by a
separate helicopter to Dili, where their coffins were draped with
U.N. flags and driven to a morgue operated by the U.N. mission in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's special representative for East Timor,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, and other U.N. officials held an airport
ceremony to honor the dead workers, who came from Puerto Rico,
Ethiopia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time I put flowers on coffins or body
bags of U.N. staff, but it is particularly difficult when the
murder is so brutally senseless,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about sheer murder of humanitarian staff who
were there to protect the victims of similarly senseless violence
carried out by the same people in East Timor last year,'' the
special representative said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other leaders gathered for a
summit meeting here demanded that President Abdurrahman Wahid of
Indonesia take real steps to control the militias, which are
actually lawless gangs that are suspected of getting weapons and
covert support from the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who is attending the summit meeting, blamed the latest
rampage on militiamen grieving for their murdered leader, but also
suggested that the timing of the attack may have been meant to
embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian tourist in Atambua who was severely injured in the
rampage was evacuated on Wednesday to a hospital in Dili, where her
condition was upgraded on Thursday to stable.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian police reported finding a fourth unidentified
body after the attack, which was thought to be that of a worker for
another aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, said on Thursday that all
the U.N. employees been accounted for. Eckhard, at a briefing for
reporters, also confirmed that the organization's relief operation
in West Timor was now shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going back until Indonesia demonstrates that it can
get these militias under control, and the threat posed by the
militias has been eliminated,'' Eckhard said.

   WASHINGTON _ America's main space vehicle for the next decade or
two, or longer, will likely be about 123 feet long. It will have a
tall tail and stubby wings, and will use a massive external fuel
tank and twin booster rockets to help it get into space.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably look a lot like the space shuttle, in other
words. That's because it may very well be the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASA and aerospace industry companies have spent years
thinking about a cheaper, less complicated alternative to the
shuttle, no successor is ready to go just yet. For at least the
next dozen years, and maybe long after that, NASA will continue to
rely on a vehicle that had its origin in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people feel the shuttle will be operating for at
least the next two decades,'' said Jack King, spokesman for United
Space Alliance, the private consortium that now handles shuttle
launch preparation and maintenance for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of our orbiters is built for at least 100 flights,
and we're only about a quarter of the way through the lifetime,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Discovery returns from a flight scheduled for
October (the 100th flight for the shuttle program), it will be the
veteran among the four-vehicle fleet with 28 flights. Endeavour,
the newest shuttle, which replaced Challenger after it was
destroyed in a 1986 explosion, has flown only 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officially plans to fly the shuttle fleet through at least
2012, using it to build the International Space Station through
2006 and help maintain it after that.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Atlantis is slated to lift off Friday for the
station, to install equipment and supplies for the first residents,
who are scheduled to move in in November.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, who analyzes space and defense issues for the
Federation of American Scientists, said NASA will fly the shuttle
``until the next time it blows up. I think that's the real
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttles flying today have progressed since the Columbia
orbiter first took to space in 1981. NASA has tinkered with shuttle
hardware all along as new orbiters were built, but the Challenger
explosion resulted in hundreds of changes across the fleet to
increase safety, from redesigned rocket boosters to more powerful
flight control computers.
</P>
<P>
   More improvements are on the way, some $2.2 billion worth to
both the shuttles and the ground support systems. NASA will spend
the next five years building a stronger external tank, improving
the shuttles' engines to allow them to detect problems before they
happen, and moving to a ``smart cockpit'' that will automate more
tasks now handled by astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The planned improvements may be the largest modification ever
for the shuttle fleet, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said in a report released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said the improvements may be a little too optimistic,
and that NASA may not be able to get them done on time and within
budget. NASA needs to focus on getting them done by 2005 if it's
serious about moving to another vehicle by 2012, NASA's current
plan, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., is in charge
of the fourth major overhaul of the shuttle engines, one of the
major upgrades in the works. According to NASA, the shuttles'
engines operate at greater temperature and pressure extremes than
do any other machines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the planned changes is called the Advanced Health
Monitoring System, which uses an optical and vibration system to
track engine performance. If it detects trouble, it can shut an
engine down before the problem gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We currently use temperature to determine if there's a
problem, but a better way to do that is to monitor vibration,''
said Randy Humphries Jr., the propulsion upgrades manager for the
shuttle at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The optical system analyzes the plume coming out of the engines
to see if there's a problem such as engine parts breaking loose,
Humphries said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall workers are also moving to a new welding system for the
external tank that will make it stronger, and changes to the rocket
boosters to make their solid fuel less prone to cracking during
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA plans to fly the shuttle to at least 2010, 2012,''
Humphries said. ``We have to do the supportability items to keep it
flying the next 10 or 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Space Flight Center is also in charge of managing the
X-33 program, which is intended to lead to a commercially built
vehicle called VentureStar that could one day perform many tasks
handled by the shuttle or even replace it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   But that program's development has been more of a challenge than
NASA and lead contractor Lockheed Martin expected. Manufacturing
delays have put its future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had hoped to settle on a shuttle successor by 2005, with
the idea it would be ready to fly about five years later. Pike said
that date is ``vaporware,'' a computer industry term for software
or hardware that is announced but arrives late or never.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had been cutting back on the resources it was spending on
the shuttle after it handed over launch preparation and maintenance
work to United Space Alliance a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That cutback has been reversing after reviews showed that NASA
workers in shuttle-related safety and upgrade jobs and oversight
jobs were being overstressed and overworked.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, in fact, the shuttle is going to be
busier than ever as it makes more than three dozen flights to build
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   King said even if VentureStar does eventually show up, it won't
necessarily put the shuttle out of business. The shuttle was
designed as a do-everything workhorse, and VentureStar initially
will probably be just a cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle allows astronauts to float in space and wrangle with
wayward satellites or space telescopes that need updating.
VentureStar probably won't allow that, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the capabilities that the space shuttle has in
many areas, such as assembly and disassembly in orbit,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has good reasons to want to move away from the shuttle.
It's a big, complex, expensive vehicle. In fact, NASA touts it as
being the most complex machine ever built.
</P>
<P>
   It has more than 2.5 million parts, including 230 miles of wire
and more than 27,000 insulating tiles and thermal blankets to
protect it from the heat of re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   All that means it's expensive to fly. NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin has repeatedly complained that the high cost of flying
payloads to space, some $10,000 per pound, is stifling progress in
space flight.
</P>
<P>
   Such a complex vehicle also requires a horde of technicians to
keep it ready. King said United Space Alliance has 3,850 workers
who process the shuttle after each flight and get it ready for the
next one. According to the GAO, that requires 1.2 million separate
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not fly very often, it's very expensive and is of
uncertain reliability,'' said Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists. ``On the other hand, we have two decades of experience
with the shuttle and it's a known quantity.''

</P>
<P>
   That cutback has been reversing after reviews showed that NASA
workers in shuttle-related safety and upgrade jobs and oversight
jobs were being overstressed and overworked.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, in fact, the shuttle is going to be
busier than ever as it makes more than three dozen flights to build
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   King said even if VentureStar does eventually show up, it won't
necessarily put the shuttle out of business. The shuttle was
designed as a do-everything workhorse, and VentureStar initially
will probably be just a cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle allows astronauts to float in space and wrangle with
wayward satellites or space telescopes that need updating.
VentureStar probably won't allow that, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the capabilities that the space shuttle has in
many areas, such as assembly and disassembly in orbit,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has good reasons to want to move away from the shuttle.
It's a big, complex, expensive vehicle. In fact, NASA touts it as
being the most complex machine ever built.
</P>
<P>
   It has more than 2.5 million parts, including 230 miles of wire
and more than 27,000 insulating tiles and thermal blankets to
protect it from the heat of re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   All that means it's expensive to fly. NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin has repeatedly complained that the high cost of flying
payloads to space, some $10,000 per pound, is stifling progress in
space flight.
</P>
<P>
   Such a complex vehicle also requires a horde of technicians to
keep it ready. King said United Space Alliance has 3,850 workers
who process the shuttle after each flight and get it ready for the
next one. According to the GAO, that requires 1.2 million separate
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not fly very often, it's very expensive and is of
uncertain reliability,'' said Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists. ``On the other hand, we have two decades of experience
with the shuttle and it's a known quantity.''

 &HT;    `Usual Suspects' writer Christopher McQuarrie returns with `Way
of the Gun.'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Christopher McQuarrie wrote one of the most
celebrated movie scripts of the 1990s. ``The Usual Suspects''
stands at the summit of postmodern hip with Quentin Tarantino's
``Pulp Fiction'' and Charlie Kaufman's ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Released in 1995, ``Suspects'' was a crime thriller propelled by
whiplash twists, popping dialogue, and a mystery with a maddening
conundrum _ the elusive Keyser Soze _ at its core.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie's screenplay became a minor sensation, earning almost
as many awards, including an Oscar, as cultish admirers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood works in curious ways. Getting from that peak to
the 31-year-old writer's directorial debut, ``The Way of the Gun,''
, has been a journey through frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 'Suspects' on it was this downward slide. I really
thought that once (the Oscar) happened I'd be given this great leg
up,'' says McQuarrie. ``You go to the studios and tell them your
ideas, but they want to make their movie. ... The harder I tried to
make something that I thought was right ... `` He trails off into
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie, round and ruddy, has delivered this jeremiad before,
you can tell. It tires him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually it becomes about trying to get anything made just
so you can make it your way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Things got rough. When 20th Century Fox asked him to take a pass
at a crime script, McQuarrie pitched his ideas. ``But they insisted
on me making the characters good and sympathetic. You have to make
it OK that the characters are murdering thieves. And that so
offends me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I told them, 'You guys figure out how much money you're
willing to risk on my movie. I will not take a salary. I will not
take back-end fees. I will live on crafts services. I will cast
whoever you want. Just let me tell this story the way I think it
should be told.' And they said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeated, McQuarrie left the meeting and had coffee with actor
and friend Benicio Del Toro. ``I said, 'I quit. I'm out of this
business,''' McQuarrie recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro told him to make another crime film, but the writer
feared being branded ``the crime guy.'' Del Toro persisted: If you
want to make a movie your way, you first have to make the movie
they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Benicio that if I ever made a crime film again I would
make it in such a way that no one would ask me to make another
one,'' says McQuarrie. ``I would make a film about criminals and I
would not pull any punches.''
</P>
<P>
   He brainstormed with Del Toro and borrowed a true story his wife
told him about a rich couple who hired bodyguards to watch the
surrogate mother carrying their child.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Way of the Gun,'' a gritty and bloody kidnapping
caper with noirish overtones. Del Toro and Ryan Phillip-- e star as
fatalistic criminals who kidnap a pregnant woman (Juliette Lewis),
unaware of her links to the mob. Their troubles thicken. Guns are
pulled. Men die. A baby is born.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with the plot corkscrews and piquant dialogue that are
McQuarrie's forte, the drama is directed with economy and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But if there ever was glamo-- r attached to directing for
McQuarrie, it vanished apace. Some days were dark indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask myself why anyone would want to do this for a living.
It is the worst job,'' he says. ``But I will say the fear of
writing, of facing the blank page is infinitely worse ...
</P>
<P>
   With directing, you get up in the morning and that's what you
do. Love it or hate, you don't think about how to get out of it.
You've got to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``The Usual Suspects'' have wondered if director Bryan
Singer and McQuarrie will collaborate again. The high school chums
first teamed for 1993's ``Public Access,'' and McQuarrie was one of
11 writers on Singer's ``X-Men.'' When asked, McQuarrie offers a
suspiciously coy ``I don't know.'' Asked if they're still friends,
he says the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie's currently putting the final touches on his script
for ``The Green Hornet,'' about which he's enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have a director for it I'm thinking about
throwing my hat in the ring,'' he says. ``It's a superhero movie
without the suspension of disbelief. It would great if the
executives in charge get it.''

 &HT;    `Shelter' keeps its relevance, power
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - When baby boomers pointed to Woodstock '99's
sordid news footage as proof that Generation X had gone awry, X-ers
immediately reminded boomers of ``Gimme Shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the tragic Altamont Speedway concert of 1969, and
similar to the recent documentary ``Message to Love: The Isle of
Wight Festival,'' this 1970 film was a nail in the coffin of the
'60s free-love era. Released soon after the original ``Woodstock'',
it provided an emphatic counterpoint to that better-known
documentary's images of happy hippies changing the world. In
``Gimme Shelter,'' they can't even change chords without somebody
getting punched.
</P>
<P>
   How fitting that the 30th anniversary re-release of ``Gimme
Shelter'' _ which culminates in a stabbing death some 10 yards from
where the Rolling Stones are performing _ comes a year after the
fiery and violent Woodstock '99 and only two months after nine fans
were crushed to death at a Pearl Jam concert in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll tragedies are nothing new. The revamped, 35 mm
version of ``Shelter'' reminds us of this fact, while also offering
insight into why such debacles happen: namely, out of greed and
arrogance, neither strangers to the music business today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, filmmakers David and Albert Maysles, with co-director
Charlotte Zwerin, set out to document the Stones' first U.S. tour
in about four years. At that point, Altamont was just an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the first 25 minutes of the film are mostly generic concert
footage. There are also scenes of the ``Sticky Fingers'' sessions
at the Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama. For avid fans (and perhaps
only avid fans), this is great stuff. It's the start of what is
generally considered the Stones best period, marked by a darker,
more Americanized sound and by their arrival as a stadium act.
</P>
<P>
   These elements all come into play at Altamont, which makes up
the rest of ``Gimme Shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   From the go, the concert is a volcano of trouble. Hoping to give
a massive free concert in San Francisco as they did a few months
earlier in London (without any violence), the Stones are bounced
from two sites before settling on a speedway in nearby Altamont
that's hurting for business. This is two days before the event.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done, assure concert organizers, including lawyer
Melvin Belli (who represented Jack Ruby) and Michael Lang, the
smiley, can-do co-producer of the original Woodstock. Lang's
presence eerily ties Altamont to Woodstock '99, where his calm
nature similarly did nothing to help matters.
</P>
<P>
   Altamont's biggest mistake soon becomes obvious: The Hell's
Angels are brought in as a last-ditch, low-cost security team. Just
when it seems things can't get any stupider, organizers opt to pay
the bikers with beer.
</P>
<P>
   When Gram Parsons' timid Flying Burrito Brothers take the stage
to open the show, the Angels are plainly buzzing for a fight. Of
course, they get it _ with the crowd, stagehands, even Jefferson
Airplane singer Marty Balin, in one of the movie's most memorable
scenes. The next segment shows the Grateful Dead high-tailing it
out of there without performing. It's the only sign of intelligence
in ``Shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels aren't the only ones to blame, though. Fans are seen
getting wasted and wild the night before the concert. On the
morning of the show, Mick Jagger gets punched by a fan while
walking to his trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The violence builds to the tragic stabbing of Meredith Hunter by
an Angel _ caught on film and rerun several times, like the
Zapruder footage in ``JFK.'' The clip shows Hunter carrying a gun.
It doesn't, however, support the (unproven) charges that the Angels
initiated the confrontation because the victim was black and his
girlfriend was white.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's message is nonetheless clearly written on Jagger's
face as he watches the stabbing footage in postproduction: This
concert spawned this death, and neither should have happened.
Unfortunately, the lesson of how tragic a poorly produced concert
can be is one still being learned.

<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of failing to maintain the military power of the
United States and said he would change how the country uses and
deploys force.
</P>
<P>
   In an address in Dayton, Ohio, Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, said he would modernize the military to protect the United
States and its allies from emerging threats. He said America's
armed forces were poorly paid and poorly housed, and that he would
improve conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said that improving the pay and living conditions of fighting
men and women was necessary to improving morale and the readiness
of the military to fight and keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for new leadership in Washington, D.C., that will
rebuild the morale of the United States military,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With retired Gen. Colin Powell at his side, Bush said he would
rebuild the strength of the military. Bush said there were
disturbing signs of military weakness, including low numbers of
recruits, needed replacement parts and low military pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will rebuild the military power of the United States in
order to keep the peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized President Clinton's use of military
peacekeepers. Although he did not specifically criticize any
individual peacekeeping missions in Haiti or Kosovo. But Bush
suggested he would find a different way to exert U.S. military
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the United States military is to be able to
fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the
first place,'' Bush said. ``The mission of the United States
military is not to try to solve all the difficult and diplomatic
questions this country faces. We must be peacemakers not
peacekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would redefine how war is fought. He said
modernizing the military was necessary to prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military of the future must be easier to move, harder to
find, more lethal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke on similar themes earlier in the day in an address to
veterans in Detroit. There, he said he would transform the military
from a force made to fight Cold War-era battles into an
organization that could fight ever more technically sophisticated
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Detroit, Powell contended the Clinton administration
is unwilling either to modernize the military and improve current
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is we have to invest in readiness; we have to buy
the equipment we need in the future,'' Powell said. ``We have to
plan for the transformation of the armed forces in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, also speaking
about military issues Thursday at a campaign stop at a Portland,
Maine, company that makes valves for submarines. ``Is the U.S.
military better off than it was eight years ago? I don't think
so,'' said Cheney, a former secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush has been emphasizing the military, an issue he
believes gives him an edge on Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday, Bush spoke to
veterans in Milwaukee, saying that the United States must dominate
the skies and the seas in order to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gore have argued Bush and Powell have overstated
the problems of the U.S. military, which on the basis of size,
training and technology is overwhelmingly superior to any other
fighting force in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has argued their economic plan would actually
spend billions more of the surplus on improving the military. Gore
has said Bush would dedicate much of that money to tax cuts.

<P>
   Naugahyde may not be your notion of tasteful interior design,
but it may be one way to prevent bacteria from spreading in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric-covered furniture helps transmit vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) _ culprits notorious for causing infections in
hospital patients, according to new research. The bacteria's
capsule-like coating apparently helps them survive a long time
within fabrics, which become breeding grounds for the critters.
</P>
<P>
   Better to have furniture covered with nonporous material like
vinyl that can be wiped down easily with disinfectant, say the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of the enterococci in intensive care units are
VRE, meaning they're resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin,
commonly used to treat bacterial infections, says the study, which
is reported in the August issue of the American Journal of
Infection Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``These organisms are hardy,'' says lead study author Dr. Gary
Noskin, associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University
Medical School. ``They can survive for a long time on environmental
surfaces such as countertops, bed rails, telephone receivers and
privacy curtains. They're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Noskin says most people who carry VRE don't develop
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``VRE don't cause problems in normally healthy people. They
aren't jumping off the beds and chairs and making people sick, but
they can be a problem for people with weakened immune systems,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Jarvis, chief of the infections and prevention branch
of the Hospitals Infection Program at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), says the study is not the first of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing link in the study is how the bacteria is
transmitted _ and what is the likelihood that a patient with severe
underlying disease will contract it,'' Jarvis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study does highlight, though, the importance of
disinfecting patients' rooms [when they leave] and that
disinfectant must be applied so that it has contact with the
organism or it won't work,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital infection control is essential, but don't get
sidetracked, says Marissa Miller, a veterinarian and director of
the antimicrobial-resistance program at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on what the most important issues are, and
it's not replacing all the fabric-covered furniture in hospitals.
If we diagnose resistant infections rapidly and prescribe the
appropriate antibiotic, we'll have the greatest impact,'' Miller
says.
</P>
<P>
   Carpeting in hospitals also has fallen out of favor with some
infection-control experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpeting is a filthy thing that harbors infection,'' says Dr.
Philip Tierno, a microbiology and immunology expert at New York
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hospital is not a home. It's an institution to give medical
care. We're not fooling the patients. It they are afraid of
surgery, a little carpeting isn't going to make them less afraid,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Washing hands is still a highly effective way to control
infection, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands are still the most lethal weapons in the hospital. In at
least six or seven studies, it's been shown that about 50 percent
of all people don't wash their hands, and hospital workers mirror
what the general population does,'' Tierno says.
</P>
<P>
   Noskin says the most important message of the study is that
``hospitals are, by and large, very safe places for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there are some resistant bacteria on surfaces. Even
with fabric-covered furniture, you can prevent patients from
getting VRE just by covering the furniture with a sheet. And, when
it comes time to replace furniture, replace it with something easy
to clean,'' he says.

glass schooner marked with your name, and we'll count them up at
the end and charge you then. Downstairs, there's a sea kayak and
snorkeling equipment if we want to go looking for the manta rays
that prowl just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there will be electricity, but not right now. If we want
a really hot shower, we'd best take it between 6 p.m., when the
generator comes on, and midnight, when it shuts off again.
</P>
<P>
   We are only about 75 miles south of Cancun, but it might as well
be a million.
</P>
<P>
   This is what we had been hoping to find when we went to what has
been collectively dubbed the Riviera Maya, an 80-mile stretch of
resorts and villages on the Yucatan coast all the way from the
southern tip of Cancun, to the north, to Tulum, on the southern
end.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the indigenous people who lived on this land a
thousand years before the Spaniards showed up, the region is
probably the hottest tourism area in Mexico right now. Prized for
its white-sand beaches, sunny weather and clear, turquoise water,
the equal of any in the Caribbean, it is also becoming known for
its all-inclusive luxury resorts, which are popping up all along
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   If Cancun is at one extreme of Mexican beach resorts, with all
its five-star hotels like the Ritz-Carlton, chain restaurants like
TGIFridays and nightclubs that charge $20 to get in, we were
looking for the other. When we set off for a four-day drive along
the Riviera Maya, we were looking for a more laid-back Mexico _
where there are only a couple of thatch-roofed restaurants to
choose from, nightly entertainment consists of watching the stars
with a drink in hand, and, if your timing is right, you just might
have a half-mile-long stretch of white-sand beach to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE: TULUM
</P>
<P>
   The man who shows us a room in one of the thatched-roof cabanas
at Piedra Escondida, an eight-room resort on the beach south of
Tulum, is sweating heavily, a sign we probably should have taken as
an omen. But the room is clean and cute, decorated with colorful
Mexican textiles and ceramic tiles, and has a big private bath.
Plus, the owner is willing to take $60 a night, down from the $75
originally quoted and less than the $80 to $100 charged by similar
places down the road. There seems to be a nice breeze if you open
both windows. We take it.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours earlier, my friend Chris and I had landed in
Cancun, climbed into a rented Nissan Sentra, and set off for Tulum,
generally recognized as the southern tip of the Riviera. Even
stopping for a slow lunch _ quesadillas, chips, juice, delivered by
a shy 12-year-old boy who charged us $8 _ at a tiny deserted
restaurant on a beach called, as best we could determine,
Xcalacoco, we'd made the 80-plus miles in under three hours.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the scheme to build up the Mayan Riviera, the
coastline road between Cancun and Tulum has been greatly improved
over the past several years. Now it is excellent _ four-lane
divided all the way to Playa del Carmen, about a 45-minute drive
from Cancun, and a wide, smooth two-lane with broad shoulders from
there south to Tulum. The driving is easy, once you figure out that
locals consider the shoulders an equal driving opportunity, and
that you shouldn't panic when a taxi decides to pass you despite
there being a car heading in the opposite direction not 30 feet
away. (Everybody always moves over in time; in four days we did not
see a single fender-bender, a record I dare you to match in
Dallas-Fort Worth.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people know Tulum as an archaeological site; it is a minor
Mayan city, originally known as Zama, the culture's word for dawn,
largely abandoned about 400 years ago. The ruins of Tulum have
become perhaps the culture's best-known symbol, by virtue of their
breathtaking setting on cliffs overlooking the gulf and its easy
access to Cancun. But Tulum is also a small modern village, with
little hotels, restaurants and shops, and, on a separate road that
goes down to the beach, a string of small resorts.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   The farther along the road you drive, the more rustic these
resorts get, down to the dirt-floor-and-hammock cabanas that
backpackers discovered a generation ago. We end up on the more
upscale end of things, as, other than exploring the ruins, best
done in the cool early morning before the buses arrive from Cancun
and Playa del Carmen, there's not a lot to do here, and we want a
nice setting in which not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk along the beach and watch European and Mexican kids
play in the surf; browse the three or four shops selling hammocks,
silver jewelry and pottery; buy bottled water and snacks at the
small food market; or settle in with a book on one of the hammocks
strung between palm trees. There are no discos, no American chain
restaurants, no minimalls.
</P>
<P>
   The resort's lights flicker on just before sunset, as promised,
when the generator kicks in. (There is no electricity on this
stretch of coast; for miles, everyone relies on generators.) We
head to the resort's tiny restaurant for an early dinner, where
we're delighted to see that, because its owners are from the Amalfi
coast of Italy, it serves Italian food. A basket of chips with
fresh salsa, heavy on the lime and cilantro, and two dishes of
perfectly cooked pasta, one with an unusual and delicious sauce of
avocado and cream, and several icy Sols, goes for well under $20.
</P>
<P>
   With the sea breeze wafting through the open windows of the
dining room, and against the background chatter of our fellow
guests, a mix of German and French tourists, it's a perfect
evening. Like them, we decide to retire early; the lights go off
around 10 p.m. anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the room, getting ready for bed, we congratulate
ourselves on finding this spot, for getting out of the Cancun rut.
</P>
<P>
   Then we realize the first problem in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   We lie in our beds trying not to move, so as not to exert
ourselves and sweat even more. Tomorrow, maybe we'll look for a
room with a fan.
</P>
<P>
   DAY TWO: TANKAH
</P>
<P>
   Casa Cenote, a thatch-roofed, open-air restaurant overlooking
the water and heralded by the guidebooks as an undiscovered gem,
has managed to be discovered today not only by us but by a large
family from Georgia, several day-trippers from up the road, and
assorted other tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But its location, on the northern end of a gently arcing bay
that most people call Tankah (also spelled Tank-ha or Tancah) has
enthralled us. The beach is wide and white; the surf is blue and
gentle. And except for the 20 diners at this restaurant, the place
is practically deserted. We'd planned to find a condo tonight in
Akumal, a 30-year-old diving resort about five miles north, but
instead we decide we'd rather try for one of the homes or small
inns that have sprung up in recent years on the road to Casa
Cenote.
</P>
<P>
   We get lucky on the third stop. The Clarks, who opened their inn
and its attached dive shop about three years ago, have a room for
$65, breakfast included. We also get free use of snorkeling
equipment and a sea kayak, and access to the breezy second-floor
patio, open to the sea and the Clarks' meticulously planted
beachfront garden. (Edged in conch shells, it's in the shape of a
large state of Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   And the spotless room, with cool tile floors, a large bathroom
and a tiny patio, has a ceiling fan! (Though, as we learn to our
regret later, it's not of much use after the generator shuts down.)
</P>
<P>
   We have the beach pretty much to ourselves all afternoon, as we
carefully collect perfectly preserved pieces of coral that we end
up throwing back onto the beach. That night, we luck into a party;
some local divers had gone lobster hunting the night before, and
the Clarks invite us to join them all as they cook up their catch.
We eat dinner late, a feast of fresh lobster, rice, baked potatoes
and garlic bread, and are regaled with stories of life along the
Mexican coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see why I'm here?'' one of the divers, a Florida
transplant, asks suddenly. ``Come with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He leads us outside, up a rickety ladder and onto the roof of
the inn.
</P>
<P>
   At first it's pitch black, so dark we can't see as we pick our
way over to the edge. But as our eyes adjust to the darkness, we
see dozens of brilliant stars; so many, you can't begin to count
them. We can hear the waves hitting the beach below and virtually
nothing else. The breeze is almost chilly, and smells just barely
of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I'm here. What else do you need, he asks
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Tankah, too, is changing. Ten years ago, there was almost
nothing here; now, like dozens of little inlets along this coast,
with names like Paamul, Kantenah and Chemuyil, Tankah is a hot
commodity. When Chris and I kayak into the bay the next morning to
go snorkeling at the coral reef a half-mile offshore, we see huge
cranes rising from the jungle at both ends of the beach. More
development. We wonder: How long before Tankah is a full-on resort?
</P>
<P>
   DAY THREE: PLAYA DEL CARMEN
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny hut that serves as the Hotel El Faro reception area,
Menudo is checking in right in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not really. But the group of five well-to-do Mexican
teen-agers _ wearing silver wraparound shades, gelled Ricky Martin
haircuts and many FUBU logos, all carrying color-coordinated
cellphones _ is our first indication that Playa has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Even six or seven years ago, this one-time fishing village was
so laid-back that pigs and dogs were nearly as common on the beach
as tourists. Simple hotel rooms a block from the beach went for $25
a night and were largely filled with American backpackers and
Europeans settling in for long stays; fresh lobster and shrimp
dinners in the open-air restaurants cost less than $10.

 TANKAH, Mexico: less than $10. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now, fueled by a huge building boom that in just two or
three years has added a McDonald's, a Gap store, and a bunch of
upscale shops, restaurants, hotels and coffee bars, Playa, as it's
called, has become a trendy destination.
</P>
<P>
   Playa, in fact, is said to be to be the fastest-growing city in
all of Mexico. It sure looks like it. There is construction on
virtually every block; help-wanted signs seeking gardeners or cooks
or maids are posted at the entry to a number of hotels and
restaurants, an unusual sight in a country with a traditionally
high unemployment rate. And on the main drag of the tourist zone,
Fifth Avenue, vendors hawking ankle bracelets and silver crosses
and Talavera pottery have grown noticeably more aggressive,
probably a direct response to the scads of cruise ship passengers
and day-trippers from Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs Playa is trying to limit its growth. For
one thing, there is a palm-tree ordinance; hotels cannot be taller
than a palm tree, limiting them to about 3 stories.
</P>
<P>
   For another, most of the new hotels are not mega-resorts but
boutique properties like the 5-year-old El Faro, a sleek, modern
hotel with marble baths in the 28 guest rooms, all built around an
old lighthouse and a gorgeous free-form pool just off the beach.
Owner Bernd Durrmeier plans to add a parking garage, plus 40 or
more condos and rooms, within the next few years, but he plans to
keep as much of his landscaped grounds as possible, and he says
other business owners are trying to keep the development tasteful,
not garish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get the city to preserve what we have,'' he
says. ``Playa is one of a kind. It's more comparable to places in
Europe, little villages that have grown up along the coast, where
you can stroll to shops and restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   And, once we're over the initial shock of its growth, and the
sheer number of sun-lovers on the beach, we realize he's right.
Some of the most recent development has been in an area called
``Uptown,'' the end of Fifth Avenue farthest from the dock where
passengers disembark from cruise ships and ferries from Cozumel.
Unlike that end, called ``Downtown'' and crammed with rowdy
restaurant/bars like Senor Frogs, fast-food outlets like Domino's
and Burger King, and cheap souvenir shops, Uptown is largely made
up of upscale clothing boutiques, coffee bars and restaurants with
sophisticated menus.
</P>
<P>
   We gravitate toward that end of town, flipping a coin among
several stylish restaurants and choosing one called Xas for dinner.
Its dimly lit decor and its menu of Asian-Mediterranean dishes,
like a quesadilla stuffed with oyster mushrooms and teriyaki
chicken, would not be out of place in Deep Ellum. It is the best
meal of our trip, and even with drinks, we still spend less than
$30. We stroll happily down the half-dozen blocks back to the
hotel, past quiet restaurants and bars less than half-full. Despite
our fears, we realize, Playa is not Cancun. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   DAY FOUR: CANCUN
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a deserted restaurant right before the dinner hour,
sipping a Negro Modelo, Chris looks over my shoulder in terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look outside, look outside,'' she says. ``There's a whole
bunch of pirates, and they're coming in here!''
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere else, I would have cut her off from the beer; here, I
merely looked at where she was pointing with mild interest.
</P>
<P>
   In Cancun, few bars or restaurants seem content to merely sell
food and drink. Everybody has to have a shtick _ waiters who wear
fake plastic butts under their aprons and pretend to flash you
while they serve the quesadillas, or who dress up like matadors, or
who carry motorcycle helmets that they slip on the heads of
unsuspecting guests, then slam shots of tequila against them and
pour them down said guest's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, who pretend to be pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Chris said, there was a gaggle of them _ some of them on
stilts _ headed our way. Another waiter, who apparently hadn't
gotten the theme and was dressed like a 1930s-era gangster, had
already tried to get us to ``loosen up'' by sneaking up behind
Chris and poking her in the side. We looked at each other, downed
our beers and headed back to our hotel. We'd spent 45 minutes in
Cancun's party zone, about 30 minutes more than our limit.

 TANKAH, Mexico: than our limit. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our defense, forced fun isn't our idea of entertainment. In
Cancun's defense, it is the choice of a lot of people. With more
than 24,000 hotel rooms, all of them built within the past three
decades, it is Mexico's most popular beach resort, drawing more
than 2 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them come here because, as has often been noted, Cancun
is a place that could be anywhere. The beautiful coastline has been
built wall-to-wall with modern conveniences, malls and a Hard Rock
Cafe and McDonald's and Pizza Huts. You don't need to know a lick
of Spanish; you don't need to carry any money besides U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mexico's finest hotels are here, including an
extravagant Ritz-Carlton, the beautiful-people boutique hotel Casa
Turquesa, Mexican chains like the Camino Real and a number of
all-inclusive resorts, from whose well-planned grounds guests never
have to venture.
</P>
<P>
   We avoid those, checking into a more unusual option, the Villas
Tacul, a small complex of casitas once used to house visiting
government officials and dignitaries. Turned over to private use a
decade ago, the lobby and the low-slung hotel rooms are decorated
not like a glitzy hotel but more like a gracious Mexican home, with
blue Talavera pottery lamps and planters, heavy carved wooden doors
and furniture, and silver-framed mirrors. There is a small
restaurant, a pool, tennis courts and a playground on the lush
grounds, but no disco, no loud bar, no American chain restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, like many in Cancun, open up right to the beach,
which is where we are most comfortable in this town. Before our
ill-advised venture into the pirate bar, we'd spent a couple hours
baking under a thatched palapa, watching kids dig in the sand and
adventurous types zip past on personal watercraft, and occasionally
cooling off in the bathtub-warm surf.
</P>
<P>
   We see a lot of tourists as we walk down the beach that
afternoon, and most of them seem quite happy, pleased with their
visit to Mexico's most famous coast.
</P>
<P>
   We're happy for a different reason: Now, we know the Riviera
Maya offers alternatives, a lot of them.

 &HT;    MEXICAN OFFICIAL CAUGHT IN INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL FOUND DEAD
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the midst of a scandal involving an associate
who is a suspected Argentine torturer, a high-ranking Mexican
commerce official has been found with his throat slashed in an
apparent suicide, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ramos Tercero, 45, a deputy commerce secretary, reportedly
said in a note that he didn't have ``the energy to defend myself
today or in the coming years as if I were a criminal or a
gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos was found dead Wednesday night near his car, which
contained six suicide notes and was parked along a highway in
Mexico state, officials said. An economist with a doctorate from
Stanford University, Ramos was a government official responsible
for a troubled national car-registration program here that was
plunged into an international scandal last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Mexican police detained the director of the program,
an Argentine businessman contracted by commerce officials last
year. Ricardo Cavallo is being held for possible extradition to
Spain, where a judge has implicated him in dozens of kidnappings,
acts of torture and killings while a Naval officer during
Argentina's 1976-1983 military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials like Ramos were forced to defend the car
registration program, which the federal government enacted to help
reduce the high rate of car theft in Mexico. Prior to Cavallo's
arrest, the program, known here as ``Renave,'' was already under
attack, with numerous state governors and others questioning its
high fees and the government's decision to hire a private firm to
run the program.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cavallo is also being linked in Spain to car theft
and the kidnappings of 16 babies of Argentine political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a clean man. I'm a good man,'' Ramos reportedly said in a
lengthy and hostile note authorities said was left for Reforma
newspaper. Reforma first revealed suspicions about Cavallo's past
and has covered the program's other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City newspaper posted the contents of what it said
was all six letters on its Internet Website.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said the concession given to Cavallo's firm was done
``with total transparency'' and in strict accordance with the law.
He blamed himself for some errors in making sure the program had
credibility, but he said it was ``professional and clean'' and was
in no way ``an instrument to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos also accused Reforma of publishing false accusations and
subjecting him to ``harsh scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When will you pay?'' Ramos wrote. ``My dream is that this
grotesque episode will inspire in Mexicans a decision to make the
media responsible under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco, Ramos said he
had worked ``to the limit of my capacity and my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the climate of hysteria that's been generated,'' he wrote.
``I have no doubt that my errors and omissions will be presented to
public opinion as intolerable crimes . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   Ramos asked his wife to forgive him in a letter written to her
and his four children. He said the registration project ``was
dead'' although the company had acted properly. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for what I'm going to do, but it is the best that I
can do under these circumstances,'' Ramos wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, in New York to attend the
United Nations Millennium Summit, expressed condolences to Ramos'
family and called him ``an honorable man with a firm calling to
public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, Mexico's president-elect, called for a thorough
investigation into Ramos' death, along with other Mexican
opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is behind this has to be confirmed,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos was found with his jugular vein slashed, holding a razor
in his hand, authorities said.

   EUROPE-GASPRICES _ LONDON _ A stranglehold on refineries and
oil-storage areas by truck drivers and farmers led to widespread
shortages of gasoline and rationing in some areas of France on
Tuesday, and the unrest over the high cost of diesel fuel appeared
set to spread to Belgium and Spain. Gasoline has exceeded $6.50 a
gallon across Europe and people are really angry. Additionally, the
French strikes are screwing up life on this side of the channel.

   MEXICO-DEADOFFICIAL _ MEXICO CITY _ A high-ranking Mexican
commerce undersecretary was found dead along a highway Thursday, in
the midst of an international scandal involving a suspected
Argentine torturer. Authorities say Raul Ramos Tercero had a knife
wound to the neck and may have committed suicide. Ramos Tercero was
heavily involved in a scandal-ridden federal car
registration-program called ``Renave.'' The commerce department had
given a concession to a private company to run the program, which
many Mexicans thought was useless and costly. The Argentine
director of the program was taken into custody here in late August
and is wanted in Spain on charges of torture, kidnapping and murder
during Argentina's dictatorship. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   SENATE-STURGEON _ WASHINGTON _The Senate votes Thursday in a
showdown between the recreational and barge industries over the
pallid sturgeon. The outcome could foreshadow the fate of more than
40 disputes between environmental and business interests over
``riders'' in the 11 unfinished appropriation bills. Pallid
sturgeons are primitive, shovel-nosed, toothless, six-foot-long
bottom-suckers that have lived in the Missouri River since the
Jurassic age of the dinosaurs, but began disappearing after dams
tamed most of the river. Upriver forces led by Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., want to let the Corps of Engineers allow spring floods in
the Missouri in order to make it easier for the endangered fish, as
well as two rare shorebirds (the piping plover and the internal
least tern) to reproduce. Downriver forces led by Sen. Christopher
(Kit) Bond, R-Mo., say the spring floods would endanger jobs in
businesses dependent on barge traffic. (Mollison,, Cox News

   LEOFRANK-RABBI _ ATLANTA _ The Cobb County rabbi who placed a

a recent AJC story alleging that ``the Jews bribed the governor''

   BUSHAIR _ George Bush is fighting to keep Austin, San Antonio

are motivated by the prospect for embarrassment. They say that he
cannot afford to have these metropolitan areas added to a list that
already includes Dallas and Houston, especially in the midst of a
campaign in which he asserts things are getting better. But
monitoring in those cities clearly show that ozone levels there
exceed the tougher new standard. Bush, and several other Republican
governors, counter that EPA's new standards have been struck down
by an appeals court and now await Supreme Court review, and EPA
action should await that ruling. (Sherman, Atlanta

   CHAMBERS-GORE _ Publishing and cable magnate Anne Cox Chambers,
a big Democratic donor, has mended fences with Vice President Gore.
Chambers, who owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, will host a
private dinner at her Buckhead mansion for Gore when he visits
Georgia Sept. 8. An early financial backer of Gore's, Chambers
stopped supporting Gore earlier in the 1990s because of his support
of cable regulation. She backed rival Bill Bradley in the primary,
hosting a fundraiser that netted Bradley $225,000. But in April,
Chambers donated $100,000 to the Democratic Party, one of the two
largest individual contributions to the Democrats of anyone in
Georgia. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

to $1 million for the Democratic Party. The scheduling of the
fundraiser is another example of how the quest for money often
drives the quest for votes in the presidential race, even after the
party nominating conventions. (Foskett, Atlanta

keep spending heavilyon adding manufacturing capacity. Samsung's
announcement opens the door to a potential expansion of its sizable
presence in Austin, where the company employs 1,100 people. Samsung
spokesman Bill Cryer said this week he expects the Korean company
will decide sometime in the next year whether it will build a
second factory in Northeast Austin anytime soon. When it first
announced its expansion in Austin, Samsung officials said the
company might build up to five chip factories here, depending upon
the continued strength of the market. (Ladendorf, Austin

   FEDEX _ United Parcel Service Corp.'s top two rivals _ FedEx

scarce, but industry experts say FedEx wants to turn over many of
its ground deliveries to the Postal Service. In return, FedEx
planes would carry Postal Service next-day shipments. FedEx could
also gain access to 38,000 U.S. post offices. The deal raises legal
questions and UPS can be relied on to fight it vigorously.

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a
peasant environmentalist and an Army colonel _ human rights group
believe are unjustly imprisoned now.

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications
and Internet provider in Russia must install a program designed by
the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good. WAN:

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an
investment that reaps priceless returns. A growing number of that
same group are beginning to question Israel's reliance on American
largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CENSUS-ADJUST _ A federal lawsuit against the state of Virginia
is emerging as the all-important test case in the politically
charged issue of whether states next year can use raw census
results instead of statistically adjusted counts to redraw
legislative districts. A dozen major U.S. cities and counties have
joined the fight against a Virginia law passed this year by the
GOP-dominated legislature. Urban areas, with large minority
populations traditionally undercounted by the census, fear the
Virginia law will set a national precedent. (Holmes, Cox News

   DAYTON END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues.
</P>
<P>
   The series is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill
Moyers called ``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from
Sunday, Sept. 10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can
stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   The stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run
date that corresponds to the day the story is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Elements from the series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY
LIVING page for Tuesday, Sept, 19. That page will be available on
Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

But Gross declined to be treated or even tested for metastatic
disease. He felt the time had come to leave this life gracefully,
and on his own terms. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 80 inches

expectancies, they both mislead patients and families and disable
the hospice concept. It's generally agreed that doctors need more
training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

stages of that disease. He says he's no longer bitter about what
happened to him in Vietnam, and that he looks forward to ``meeting
the Lord.'' And he's also grateful to the hospice and palliative
care program at the Dayton VA, which has provided his end-of-life
care free of charge. The VA here wants to get the word out: it
provides a wide array of end-of-life services to eligible veterans,

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

Friday evening. PHOTOS are available.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given
millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world
grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways
to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one
of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20
years ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to
implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under
the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong
villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner, Atlanta

<P>
   GETTING THERE: Most flights from Dallas/Fort Worth land at the
international airport in Cancun. From there, cabs can be hired to
almost any point on the Riviera Maya; examples of fares are about
$40 one way to Playa del Carmen, $60 to Tulum. An alternative,
especially if you are headed to Playa del Carmen, is to fly into
Cozumel and take the ferry (about $10 one way) from Cancun to
Playa.
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING: U.S. citizens can get into Mexico with a driver's
license and birth certificate, but a passport makes things easier.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING THERE: In Tulum, Piedra Escondida offers eight rooms
with private bath, no fans or a/c, starting from $65, off season.
For information, check out www.hotelstulum.com. No credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Tankah, Tankah Inn guest house offers five rooms with private
baths and ceiling fans, at rates starting from $65, off season. For
reservations, e-mail the owners at tankahdiveinn &LR; lycos.com. No
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Playa del Carmen, Hotel El Faro has 28 rooms with a/c and
private baths, from $120, off season. Information,
www.hotelelfaro.com; reservations, www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com.
</P>
<P>
   In Cancun, Villas Tacul has 23 villas with rooms and suites,
from $145. www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: The archaelogical site at Tulum is open daily, from
about 7 a.m. to dusk. Admission about $3; parking about $2; guides
are available for an extra fee. Plan on at least one hour to see
the site; it's recommended to arrive early to avoid the heat and
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of ``ecological'' parks along the coast
between Cancun and Tulum, offering manicured beaches, restaurants,
snorkeling spots, marine life, and often a Disney-like atmosphere.
The most popular seems to be Xcaret, which advertises a dolphin
swim program, an underground river ride, horseback riding and an
evening program including a re-creation of a Mayan ball game called
Ulama and a folklorico performance. Admission from $52, including
bus transportation. Information: www.xcaretcancun.com.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Mexican Tourism Board operates a toll-free
line, (800) 44MEXICO, but it has operated only sporadically over
the past several months, and did not appear to work last week.
There is also a Mexico tourism office in Houston; (713) 772-2581.

 &HT;    HOUSE UPHOLDS ESTATE TAX VETO, BUT GOP CLAIMS IT AS CAMPAIGN
ISSUE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a vote fraught with political overtones, the
House failed Thursday to override President Clinton's veto of a
bill to phase out the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   The 274-157 vote fell 14 short of the two-thirds of those
present required to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and House Democrats invoked party unity to protect the
president's record of only two veto overrides since Republicans
took control in 1995, and none during the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Democrats who had supported phasing out the tax when
the bill was first approved by the House switched their votes
Thursday to support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the final vote, 155 Democrats sided with Clinton, along with
one Republican and one independent. Voting to override were 53
Democrats, 220 Republicans and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they planned to wait until the next
Congress _ when they hope Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will be
president _ to try again.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also indicated they expected the estate tax to be a
major campaign issue this fall, particularly for those Democrats
who switched their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this will be part of the campaign. We'll let the
American people decide by their own votes,'' said Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas. ``If the American people really want this tax
relief, we'll have a Republican Congress with a Republican
president who will sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax vote was the first of two showcase tax votes
scheduled this month. Next week, the House will try to override
Clinton's veto of the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' which causes
some married couples to pay higher income taxes than they would if
they were single and filed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the vote, calling the repeal bill ``a huge tax
cut for the most well-off Americans'' that threatened the nation's
economic health and critical government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the estate tax repeal would benefit only 2
percent of the wealthiest taxpayers while jeopardizing the
projected federal surplus and efforts to shore up Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have reduced government revenues by $105 billion
over the next 10 years, and $50 billion a year when fully
implemented in 2011. A Democratic alternative would cost $22
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans portrayed Thursday's vote as a referendum on what
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., called an ``unfair, immoral and
unsound tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The death tax penalizes families who have worked hard and
saved all their lives,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas. ``We don't
need a toll booth on the way to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats responded that Republicans were engaged in a
``political ploy'' by pushing a bill they knew would not become law
while ignoring the Democratic alternative, which they said would
eliminate the estate tax on family farms and businesses worth up to
$4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., asked Republican lawmakers to
support the veto and then work on a compromise tax bill in the
waning days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still time for us to work together on this and other
matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP lawmakers complained that the Democratic plan, which
relied on raising the limit on a tax exemption, was too complex for
most taxpayers to use. They said the only way to overcome that
hurdle would be to eliminate the tax entirely.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Republicans would not ``play games'' with the estate
tax and said Democrats were not serious about wanting to lower
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't want tax relief, he wants to keep this
money in Washington so he can spend it, and (Vice President Al)
Gore is the same way,'' DeLay said.

 &HT;    BUSH BACKS OFF ON DEBATE STANCE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush backed down Thursday from his refusal to
participate in more than one formal presidential debate, and said
he now is willing to negotiate the question with Al Gore. ``I want
there to be debates. . . . As to what they look like and where they
are, it'll be worked out in due course,'' Bush said. Earlier, Bush
had said he'd participate in only one of the three debates proposed
by the nonpartisan debates commission, and he wanted to add more
informal debates on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and CNN's ``Larry King
Live.'' Gore said he'd appear at the latter two, but only after
Bush commits to all three commission debates. Asked today if he
might agree to more than one commission debate, Bush said, ``Yeah.
. . . We'll work it out. . . . I made a serious attempt to find
some interesting formats.''
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY AND POLITICAL REINFORCEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by retired generals Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf,
George W. Bush promised a ``culture of innovation'' in modernizing
the military through investment in technology. Powell likened
problems in the military to a spreading cancer that Bush could
cure. Readiness and enlistments have dropped, he said, and the
Democrats have failed to prepare the military for post-Cold War
challenges. ``Our enemies start noticing (and) before you know it
you're on a path downward,'' Powell told hundreds of veterans today
at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. ``That little cancer
starts to break out in the body of the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: TOO SOON TO JUMP OUT OF FOXHOLE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, reacting to supporters' concerns, said Thursday
he would try to energize his campaign by ``putting faces to
policy'' in events featuring everyday Americans. But he also said
some backers seemed to be getting too jittery too soon after Al
Gore's comeback in recent polls. ``That's Washington,'' said Bush.
``That's the place where you find people getting ready to jump out
of the foxholes before the first shot is fired.'' Bush campaign
officials liken the rising nervousness among party leaders to fears
expressed last winter after Bush lost the New Hampshire primary to
John McCain. They suggest this current angst, too, will pass.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: BUSH'S PROMISES TOO EXPENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has followed up his 191-page budget blueprint with a New
York Times ad today attacking his rival's tax and spending plans.
Gore argues that George W. Bush's proposed tax cuts would enrich
the wealthy, use up the surplus and push the budget back into
deficit. ``Does it matter if the numbers all add up?'' the new ad
says. Gore argues that tax cuts pushed by Bush would cost the
Treasury $1.3 trillion over 10 years, or $1.6 trillion including
lost interest. In addition, Gore says, new spending pushed by Bush
would drain an additional $474 billion. Plus, says Gore, the
missile defense program pushed by Bush would register ``at a
minimum of $150 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: GORE'S PROMISES TOO EXPENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush opened a new line of attack against Al Gore,
accusing his rival of making so many promises in this campaign that
he would eat through the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus
projected for the next decade. Bush dismissed the new economic plan
that Gore announced as an emblem of big government ``overcharging
the working people. If I might summarize it for you, it says keep
sending all your money to Washington, and I'll be glad to spend it
for you,'' Bush shouted at an airport rally in Indianapolis. ``And
spend it he can. This man knows how to spend that money.''

   Al Gore leads George W. Bush by 6 percentage points, according
to a new Reuters/Zogby poll released Thursday. The poll of 1,001
likely voters conducted for Reuters on Monday through Wednesday by
independent pollster John Zogby showed Gore leading Bush by 46
percent to 40 percent. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader polled 5
percent and the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan scored 2 percent. Seven
percent were undecided. In a two-man matchup. Gore led 49-43
percent. Gore's lead was still near the edge of the poll's
statistical margin of error of 3.2 percent, but the survey
confirmed that Gore has kept the bounce he received from last
month's Democratic convention and added to it.
</P>
<P>
   GORE EXPECTING TEAMSTERS' NOD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore expects to receive the highly coveted presidential
endorsement of the Teamsters today, and the considerable
get-out-the-vote manpower that comes with it. The Teamsters,
because of the union's fierce opposition to Gore's free-trade
advocacy, which George W. Bush shares, have been a holdout while
other major unions endorsed the vice president long ago. Teamsters
head James P. Hoffa has flirted with the idea of endorsing Bush,
and the union has backed Republicans in the past: Ronald Reagan in
1980 and 1984, and ex-President Bush in 1988. The Teamsters jumped
to Bill Clinton in 1992 but abstained from endorsing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVITY RISES AS POLL STANDING DROPS
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign for the White House intensifies, George W.
Bush's upbeat messages are being replaced by hard-hitting digs at
his Democratic opposition. Republicans in key states welcomed the
change in tactics, saying swing voters care whether Al Gore is
being straight with them. They also hope the new focus on Gore's
credibility will help Bush regain the lead from Gore. ``Most
campaigns would like to have the luxury of staying positive, but in
order to stay positive you've got to stay significantly ahead in
the polls,'' said Tom Slade, former chairman of the Florida
Republican Party. ``In races that get close _ and this one
obviously has _ the knives are going to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   APOLOGIES TO DISABLED REPORTER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign has apologized to a disabled reporter denied
access to a Gore campaign stop in Michigan over the weekend. The
General Motors plant Gore visited and the buses transporting media
members to the site were inaccessible by wheelchair. While Flint
Journal reporter Chad Swiatecki, 22, was able to cover an earlier
stop made by Gore, arrangements had to be made by the newspaper to
send another reporter to the second stop. ``I got angry when the
state campaign director tried to smooth things over,'' said
Swiatecki. ``But he really wasn't sympathetic or apologetic about
what happened. The only response I got was, `We've never run into
this before.' `` Swiatecki said he has since received a call from
Kim Ruby, a Gore spokeswoman, who apologized to him for the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   UNCERTAIN DEBATE SCHEDULE COSTLY
</P>
<P>
   The costs of preparing for a presidential debate are mounting,
even though it is increasingly uncertain whether the event will
take place on Oct. 3. University of Massachusetts officials are
about to sign a contract for electrical work that will cost between
$120,000 and $165,000. And unless the Commission on Presidential
Debates pulls the plug _ which it said it doesn't want to do _ the
university will soon face having to sign a contract to complete the
production work needed to accommodate the press and nationally
televise a debate. That is expected to cost between $250,000 and
$400,000. All that would come on top of $250,000 the university has
already laid out for infrastructure improvements and other
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER DEBATE, ANOTHER DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   As the spat over the presidential debates plays out, House and
Senate Democratic leaders are churning up their own election year
debate controversy on Capitol Hill. Several months ago, the two
leaders _ Rep. Dick Gephardt and Sen. Tom Daschle _ challenged
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
to a debate on ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' Oct. 15. The
Republicans declined, saying they were too busy and couldn't plan
that far ahead. This week, Gephardt dashed off a letter to Hastert,
saying he was disappointed that Hastert would not participate in a
discussion of major campaign issues. John Feehery, Hastert's press
secretary, said the speaker was busy doing his job. ``He is a
legislator, not a debater,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN FIGHTING FOR PLACE AT DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   As the Bush-Gore sparring over debates continued, Reform Party
hopeful Pat Buchanan's legal fight to be included in the debates
made its way to a federal courtroom in Washington. Buchanan's
lawyers asked District Court Judge Richard Roberts to essentially
reverse a Federal Election Commission ruling and mandate Buchanan's
participation in any debates run by the bipartisan debates
commission. Under commission rules, participants must garner an
average of 15 percent popular support in five major polls. Buchanan
lawyer John Duffy argued in part that the commission is not
``non-partisan,'' but rather a bipartisan group protecting the
interests of the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   CHASING THE FEDERAL FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential hopeful John Hagelin has filed papers
with federal election officials laying claim to $12.6 million
reserved for the party's nominee. Hagelin officials said the forms,
filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission, reflect that he
is on the ballot in 11 states as the party's candidate for
president. Election law requires a ``minor party'' candidate
seeking federal funding to certify they are on the ballot in at
least 10 states. The FEC has 10 days after all the necessary papers
are filed to issue a ruling. Pat Buchanan, who also claims the
party nomination, filed similar documents a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   NADER: STILL UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, who wrote the 1965 book ``Unsafe at Any Speed''
that criticized automakers for putting profits ahead of safety,
showed up at a congressional hearing on defective Firestone tires,
but didn't address the lawmakers. Instead, the Green Party's
presidential nominee spoke to reporters in the hallway outside,
saying not much has changed in the past 35 years. Nader said he is
convinced that Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co., which
uses the recalled tires as standard equipment on its vehicles,
covered up defects that led to deaths and injuries. He called for a
change in the law so company executives can be criminally charged
for withholding such information.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN CLEARED TO SEEK TWO OFFICES
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Elections Enforcement Commission confirmed that
Joe Lieberman can run simultaneously for the vice presidency and
re-election to the Senate. The panel's general counsel, Jeffrey
Garfield, rejected the complaint of Fairfield University politics
professor John Orman, who said Lieberman's re-election campaign was
``frivolous'' and ``irresponsibly self-indulgent'' and urged that
he be eliminated from the Senate ballot. If elected to both
offices, Lieberman would have to resign from the Senate to serve as
vice president, and Republican Gov. John Rowland would appoint a
replacement to serve until the next statewide election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY CONTRASTS THE TAX CUT PLANS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, in a speech before the Chamber of Commerce in
Wilmington, Del., drew a distinction between who would benefit
under Al Gore's tax cut plan and who would get relief under George
W. Bush's proposal. ``Al Gore will give tax relief if you have
solar panels on your roof or if you drive a battery powered
automobile,'' Cheney said during a 45 minute talk _ among the
longest he's given in five weeks of campaigning. Families with a
mother who stays home with the children get nothing, he asserted.
``You ought to have a tax system that doesn't discriminate one way
or another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS ENDS UP WITH BIGGER SURPLUS
</P>
<P>
   Texas ended its fiscal year with $45 million more in the bank
than July estimates showed, pushing its surplus to $1.45 billion,
the state comptroller said. The state's budget became a
presidential campaign issue in July when a legislative report
projected that $610 million in cost overruns in some programs would
cut into the surplus. Some Texas Democrats blamed the overruns on a
$1.7 billion tax cut that Gov. George W. Bush advocated and signed
into law in 1998. Legislators said the newly announced surplus
would more than cover any excess spending. The state ended its
fiscal year Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   JERSEY AGAIN OVERSHADOWED BY NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   The Hillary Clinton-Rick Lazio battle so dominates the focus of
voters throughout northern New Jersey that it could become a key
factor in the contest for the Senate seat of retiring Democrat
Frank Lautenberg. Turn on any television in north Jersey and it's
hard to miss the barrage of ads drawing attention to the nationally
watched New York Senate race. After a summer-long run of ads, vast
numbers of New Jersey residents have been captivated by the
high-profile campaign so much so, in fact, that the home-state
contest between Democrat financier Jon Corzine and Republican Rep.
Bob Franks has been registering barely a mention at dinner tables
and cocktail parties north of Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   NO LOITERING NEAR BUSH RANCH
</P>
<P>
   It will harder to get a long look at George W. Bush's new Texas
ranch. McLennan County commissioners have restricted traffic near
the 1,600-acre spread, banning parking or even stopping along about
three miles of roadway. The restrictions came at the request of the
Secret Service, which was concerned about media and tourists
impeding traffic in the rural area near Waco. ``It's a public
safety issue,'' said County Commissioner Ray Meadows. Commissioners
also are considering establishing a 40-mph speed limit in the area,
which has no posted speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TAKES THE MOUND, BUT DOESN'T GET SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore thought about hiding behind his Secret Service agents,
but was soon enough strutting his stuff in a charmed outing with
the Detroit Tigers. ``A lot better than a lot of broken-down former
pitchers that I've seen,'' Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher said
as Gore threw batting practice for the Tigers an hour before the
two teams met. Even hitter Robert Fick, after getting whacked in
the hip by Gore's lone wild pitch, was impressed: ``He's definitely
not making (a fool) out of himself.'' Autograph seekers mobbed the
rookie star on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   A HARLEY, NOT A TANK
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman, a senator normally known for quiet demeanor,
donned a motorcycle helmet and took a quick spin on the back of a
Harley-Davidson. Lieberman spent some time answering questions from
workers on a motorcycle assembly line in Kansas City, Mo. Then,
with his motorcade waiting, the jeans-clad Lieberman got on the
back of a green Harley driven by an employee and waved to reporters
and employees as they circled the parking lot. He later
acknowledged that ``there was some pressure'' not to ride by aides
who feared a repetition of the ridicule Michael Dukakis got when he
put on a helmet and rode in a tank during his presidential campaign
in 1988.

JESUS MAY PULL THE STRINGS, BUT THIS MARIONETTE HAS OTHER IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
  By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there any relationship so intimate as that between a puppet
and its master? Whether controlled by hand, strings or sticks,
puppets are famous for providing bolder alter egos for those who
manipulate them. ``My Puppet, Myself'' could easily be a subtitle
for everything from the cheery television shows of Shari Lewis to
those homicidal ventriloquist movies that show up every decade or
so.
</P>
<P>
   As portraits of divided selves, however, these are all quite
mild compared to the spectacle presented toward the end of Ronnie
Burkett's ``Street of Blood,'' the ambitious, exhaustingly told
tale of anger and intolerance in rural Canada, now at the New York
Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   In that scene, Burkett, the puppeteer, is Jesus Christ; the
marionette at the end of the strings he is pulling is a movie star
who suggests a cross between Katharine Hepburn and the demented
Norma Desmond. She is also a vampire, and she craves a taste of
Jesus' blood. ``Let me know your pain,'' says the gnarled,
bespangled creature, less than half Burkett's size, as she hungrily
crawls up his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Before you cry ``Sacrilege!'' on the one hand or ``Far out!'' on
the other, you should know that ``Street of Blood,'' part of the
Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, has a heart as
pious and platitudinous as that of its narrator, an apple-cheeked,
gray-haired farmer's wife who describes herself as ``a silly old
biddy in a Sears housedress.''
</P>
<P>
   That one-person encounter between Jesus and the Hollywood
Antichrist is bizarre enough to make you sit up in your seat for a
moment and consider just what makes Burkett tick. The odds are also
that during the more than two hours leading up to that scene, you
have found yourself slumping toward the floor more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett is a obviously a man of high-reaching ideas, many
talents and amazing stamina; his touring Theater of Marionettes,
based in Alberta, has previously considered subjects like the
Holocaust. He has created all the puppets in this 14-character
play, as well as their many elaborate costumes and the show's set;
and he pulls the strings and provides the voices for every one of
them, visibly assisted by only his stage manager, Terri Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he has written a script that addresses the
theological implications of AIDS, the destructiveness of the gay
anger bred by homophobia and the dangers of identifying with the
heroines of old movies. Unfortunately, this is all presented with a
patient, smiling preachiness, an attitude one associates with
aspiringly groovy ministers hoping to recruit young congregation
members. The marionettes wind up seeming like little more than a
lure, the candy coating on the pill.
</P>
<P>
   The show is centered on the relationship between the gentle,
good Edna Rural and Eden, her defiantly gay son, who grew up
idolizing one Esme Massengill, star of stage, screen and
bloodsucking. Both Esme and Jesus show up for a showdown in the
little town of Turnip Corners, battling for the souls of the
conflicted Rurals. Though Edna has a few reprimands for Jesus for
neglecting his flock, it's not hard to predict who will win.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute drag queens for puppets and take away the Christian
angle, and ``Street of Blood'' starts to look awfully familiar,
like Charles Busch's ``Vampire Lesbians of Sodom'' stripped of its
wicked irony. Mercifully, there are the puppets, and if you focus
on them instead of what they're saying, ``Street of Blood'' is
easier to take.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the finely detailed appearances of the
marionettes that astonishes; it is also Burkett's ability to endow
them with such physical eloquence. A seemingly simple twitch of the
strings, and these characters deliver gestures and assume postures
more expressively human than much of what's offered by live actors
in Broadway musicals these days.
</P>
<P>
   The overture for ``Street of Blood'' is ostensibly provided by a
sextet called the Turnip Corners Ladies Orchestrale. How each of
these musicians simulates playing her instrument, from piano to
clarinet, is a wonder. Even more so is how each commands the stage
with her own character-defining walk. Burkett's marionettes are
clearly talented performers. Now if only they could find the right
script. &QL;

LIEBERMAN ADAPTS WELL TO HIS CAMPAIGN ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ On a day the Democrats devoted to trumpeting
their economic goals, Vice President Al Gore, speaking in
Cleveland, never mentioned the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech on the same topic Wednesday, here at Southwest
Missouri State University, Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, spoke in dire terms of the economic plans of Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee. Bush's proposals
would ``send us back down the drain of deficits, rising interest
rates and rising unemployment,'' he said, and would ``cause tremors
across the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has adopted the traditional role of the No. 2, taking
the lead in attacking the opposition, allowing Gore to remain, if
not above the fray, then less deeply mired in it. At every stop,
Lieberman vows not to make personal attacks on Bush and his running
mate, Dick Cheney, and so far he has not. But he has not hesitated
to tear into their policies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running around signing a book of blank checks drawn on an
account that his tax cuts have already depleted,'' Lieberman said
Wednesday of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, he lit into Bush much more strongly than Gore
did for refusing to take part in two of the three debates proposed
by a bipartisan commission, stopping just short of accusing Bush of
being afraid to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Governor Bush is making an end run around the
established rules of presidential debates,'' he said. ``It's like
one of the teams in the Super Bowl, a few weeks before the Super
Bowl, saying, `I don't want to play in that city, I don't want to
play by those rules, and I don't want to play in front of so many
people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic campaign officials acknowledge the difference between
Lieberman's approach and Gore's, but say it is not a result of any
grand strategy. ``It's what they're comfortable with,'' one aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGNING HIGH ON A HOG
</P>
<P>
   This is how politicians are different from ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, Medicare has been front and center in
the national campaign. There have been days when the Democrats,
especially, have talked about little else. So it must have come as
a bit of a surprise to Lieberman when he took questions Wednesday
from workers at a Harley-Davidson motorcycle factory in Kansas
City, Mo., and the first query, from a young man, was this: ``I
notice none of you guys who are running are talking about
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary mortals might have grown agitated, but Lieberman
resisted the temptation. Instead, he gently corrected the
misimpression and reiterated the points he and Vice President Gore
have made dozens of times in dozens of places.
</P>
<P>
   The senator seemed a bit out of place on the factory floor, a
situation he either missed or gamely ignored. Harley workers, it
turns out, look a lot like Harley riders, with a sizable quotient
of black T-shirts over jeans, beards, ponytails, sunglasses worn
indoors, and people who generally looked like they might be
auditioning for ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in jeans and a blue dress shirt, took it all in
stride, and even went for a spin around the parking lot on the back
of a hog driven by a company employee _ while wearing a helmet, of
course. When it was noted that Michael Dukakis' image suffered when
he was seen wearing a helmet _ in his case, while driving a tank _
during the 1988 presidential campaign, Lieberman said: ``It was
another act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a new fantasy,'' he told a reporter. ``I want to buy a
Harley-Davidson.''
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING TO GRIN AND BEAR IT
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Gore picked Lieberman as his running mate,
the focus _ both in the media and in the senator's own comments _
was on his being the first Jew to be nominated by a major party for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Lieberman has shifted somewhat away from the topic, but
others raise it so often that he could not drop it completely if he
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   At the motorcycle plant, a woman asked him how, if he became
president, his religion would influence the selection of Supreme
Court justices. (He said his Judaism ``doesn't specifically relate
to these kinds of decisions.'') On Monday, Sen. Richard Durbin,
introducing Lieberman at a union hall in Peoria, Ill., said the
Democrats had ``been the first to open the door of opportunity,''
citing John F. Kennedy, Geraldine Ferraro, ``and now, Joe
Lieberman, the first Jewish American to be nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme has also led to some of the campaign's more awkward
moments. At a rally in Claymont, Del., late last month, Sen. Joseph
Biden pointed into the audience and said to Lieberman: ``Joe, you
see that woman over there? She's Jewish, you're Jewish, we're
Catholic. But I say no purgatory for her. Straight to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's smile never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   EVOKING AN UNPOPULAR WAR
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Lieberman mentions that Gore ``volunteered for
service in Vietnam.'' It seems an odd tribute, given that both Gore
and Lieberman opposed U.S. involvement in the war, as did tens of
millions of other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the line always draws hearty applause. And this mostly from
crowds of Democrats, people who, presumably, would be less inclined
than Republicans to view the war favorably. It is, if nothing else,
a sign of America's continued ambivalence about the war, three
decades later.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schmidt, a 49-year-old construction worker who heard
Lieberman speak at a Labor Day festival in Detroit on Monday, said
he was opposed to the war when it was under way and has not changed
his views. But he cheered loudly at the mention of Gore's tour in
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served his country, and you've got to respect that,'' said
Schmidt, who escaped the draft by having a high lottery number.
``If he didn't go, someone else would have went, like me.''

MEDIA TYCOON VOWS TO KEEP KREMLIN FROM GAINING CONTROL OF TV
NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's most flamboyant tycoon aggravated a standoff
with President Vladimir Putin late Thursday by announcing, as
promised, that he is giving away his dominant stake in the nation's
largest television network rather than surrender it to Kremlin
control.
</P>
<P>
   Or almost, anyway. The tycoon, Boris Berezovsky, said at a news
conference that he was putting his shares in the network, ORT, in
trust for the next four years, splitting control among a host of
national journalistic and cultural figures. If their stewardship is
successful, he said, he will give them a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   But Berezovsky did not define success, or specify how the
network's new stewards, a group he is still choosing, would manage
the empire.
</P>
<P>
   That left outsiders still wondering whether Berezovsky was just
parrying in a continuing power struggle with Putin or sincerely
working to prevent a government takeover of Russia's free press, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky offered another reason. ``I am tired, tired, tired,''
he said at a news conference. ``It seems to me that alone, I simply
cannot carry any longer this load called ORT.''
</P>
<P>
   ORT _ the initials stand for Russian Public Television _ is
nominally government-run. But nobody doubts that Berezovsky, who
controls at least 49 percent of its shares, really pulls its
strings.
</P>
<P>
   In parliamentary elections last winter, he wielded it as a club
on behalf of friends within the Kremlin who were promoting Putin as
the successor to President Boris Yeltsin. With ORT's help, Putin's
Unity Party destroyed its opposition, setting the stage for
Yeltsin's surprise resignation and the spring election of Putin to
a full four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin and Berezovsky have since parted ways. Berezovsky, who
himself gained election to parliament, abruptly quit the
legislature this spring to organize a political opposition to the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has opened his own attack against Berezovsky and other
tycoons, focusing government investigators on their business
empires in what seems to be a campaign of intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of a role Putin's ill-concealed
contempt for the news media plays in that campaign. Days after his
inauguration as president in May, masked police raided the offices
of one often-critical press baron, Vladimir Gusinsky, and shortly
afterward jailed him. A criminal investigation later was abruptly
dropped amid rumors, strongly denied, that Gusinsky had cut a deal
with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin has cast the Kremlin's actions as an attempt
to free Russia from the grip of rapacious monopolists. In
particular, he has suggested that Russia's news media are not truly
free because they speak for the rich instead of the ordinary
people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Putin has yet to say whether he thinks the government is better
qualified to run the news media in the name of ordinary people.
When the government's proposed budget for the next fiscal year was
released this week, for the first time there was a ``top secret''
classification stamped on all expenditures involving the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   The public has no love for Berezovsky or other media titans. Any
number of Russian commentators charge that the tycoons amassed
their fortunes through shady deals at the expense of ordinary
Russians, and that they use their media holdings mostly to protect
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   For Berezovsky, the last straw appears to have been a demand by
the Kremlin this month that he hand over his stake in ORT or suffer
Gusinsky's fate.
</P>
<P>
   At his briefing on Thursday, Berezovsky listed 14 men and women
who he said had accepted his offer to be ORT trustees, and another
nine who apparently had yet to respond. They include some of the
best known and most respected figures in Russian journalism, from
newspaper editors and columnists to authors and television anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky said none of the trustees would be financially
responsible for the network, which is reported to have lost money.
And he said he was considering a similar plan for his other media
holdings, which include Moscow's most powerful business daily
newspaper, Kommersant, and a stake in a popular Moscow television
channel, TV6.
</P>
<P>
   While some dismissed the move as a public-relations ploy,
Berezovsky said he was acting to prevent Putin from further
consolidating control over Russian politics and society.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin already controls one major network, RTR. Control of
Gusinsky's NTV network is in some doubt, leaving ORT as the only
network with national reach that is outside the Kremlin's control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has neither confirmed nor denied that it has issued
an ultimatum to Berezovsky. One official said the government had no
objection to Berezovsky's plan to distribute his shares in ORT,
providing it was not a sham deal to cover his continued control.

<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ For such a small town, Annapolis (pop. 33,000)
has an astonishing array of personalities.
</P>
<P>
   To military types and sports fans, Annapolis is the U.S. Naval
Academy. To architecture lovers, it is a charming 18th-century town
built on a late 17th-century Baroque street plan. To history buffs,
it has been the capital of Maryland for 300 years and was briefly
the capital of the United States. To recreational boaters, it is
among the premier sailing centers on the Eastern Seaboard, its
waterfront thronged with pleasure craft. And to just about anyone,
it is a perfect place to savor Maryland's singular contribution to
Western civilization, the steamed hard-shelled crab.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all for weekend visitors, Annapolis' numerous
attractions are within a 15-minute walk of one another. Like many
tourists, I was drawn to Annapolis by its 18th-century buildings
and by the Naval Academy, a fascinating and surprisingly
visitor-friendly place. Because Annapolis' Colonial homes and
gardens are open longer on Saturdays than on Sundays, I toured them
first, then the Naval Academy, ending my visit at the historic
State House.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting Colonial houses in Annapolis are a product
of its ``golden age'' in the 1760s and 1770s, a period whose spirit
was neatly captured by Jonathan Boucher, the rector of St. Anne's
Church in town at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the genteelest town in North America, and many of its
inhabitants were highly respectable, as to station, fortune and
education,'' he later wrote. There was ``hardly a town in England
so desirable to live in as Annapolis then was,'' he added. ``It was
the seat of government, and the residence of the governor, and all
the great officers of state, as well as of the most eminent
lawyers, physicians and families of opulence and note.''
</P>
<P>
   I walked to the intersection of Maryland Avenue and King George
Street and was magically transported to Boucher's Annapolis. Before
me were two of the grandest mansions of that golden age: The
Hammond-Harwood House and the Chase-Lloyd House. Both completed in
1774, they reflect the genius of William Buckland (1734-74), who
immigrated to Virginia from England as an indentured servant in
1755 but ultimately became one of the Colonies' most distinguished
architects.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammond-Harwood House is a classic example of the five-part
Anglo-Palladian brick mansion popular in America before the
Revolution. Other late Colonial houses may be larger or more
ornate, but none, I think, is more perfect. The Maryland Avenue
facade of the house exemplifies the qualities of
Anglo-Palladianism: Balance, elegance, coolness, understatement
and, above all, flawless proportions. The exquisite front door,
writes G.E. Kidder Smith in his ``Source Book of American
Architecture,'' ranks ``as one of the finest in U.S. Georgian
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckland's manifold gifts are equally evident inside. The rooms
of the Hammond-Harwood House are not only flawlessly proportioned,
but also, because Buckland had apprenticed in England as a joiner,
contain superbly decorated woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Revolutionary War, Samuel Chase was a young,
ambitious Annapolis lawyer and land speculator. The historian
Norman Risjord called him ``an ardent patriot'' whose ``political
philosophy always seemed to coincide with his own interests.''
Chase later signed the Declaration of Independence and served with
great distinction on the Supreme Court, even though he is best
known today as the only member ever to be impeached. (He was
readily acquitted of the politically motivated charges against
him.)
</P>
<P>
   Chase began building his Annapolis town house in 1769. The
towering three-story mansion he planned was intended to proclaim
his ascendance from humble origins to Maryland's professional
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Chase (but luckily for today's tourists), he
soon ran out of money. Remarkably, he married a woman of modest
means and sold the unfinished house, then a brick shell, to one of
the wealthiest men in Maryland, Edward Lloyd IV. In December 1771,
Lloyd contracted with Buckland to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   The parts of the Chase-Lloyd House designed by Buckland and open
to visitors are a stunning progression of essays in Anglo-Palladian
design. The Palladian front door opens into a front entrance hall
graced by a screen of Ionic columns inspired by one of Palladio's
drawings of Roman baths. Beyond the screen is a majestic
double-cantilevered stair. An oversize Palladian window looking out
on the garden dominates the landing. The stair culminates at the
second-floor hall with its finely decorated plaster ceiling and two
niches flanking a pedimented door.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Prince George Street, one block south of Maryland Avenue, is
the William Paca House and Garden. Paca (pronounced PAY-cah) was a
contemporary of Chase and, like him, a lawyer and Patriot leader
who signed the Declaration of Independence. Unlike Chase, Paca had
the good sense to marry one of the wealthiest women in the Colony,
Mary Chew. Four days later he bought a prime double lot in the
center of Annapolis, with ample room for a huge house and an
expansive garden.
</P>
<P>
   Paca's house, an imposing five-part brick mansion of 1765 he
probably designed himself, is well worth visiting. The principal
attraction here, however, is the superb two-acre Paca garden.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the vicissitudes of time _ the house served for many
years as the entry to a large hotel and the garden as a parking lot
_ the garden of today is only partly a restoration of Paca's
showplace. The upper half is a conjectural formal garden consisting
of four parterres: Elegant compositions of roses, mixed flowers,
hollies and topiaries. The lower half is a reconstruction, based on
historical evidence, of the ``natural'' portion of Paca's garden.
The sophisticated Paca had combined the French formalism that still
dominated garden design in the Colonies with the naturalism then in
vogue in England.
</P>
<P>
   The garden is full of lovely plantings, outbuildings and
decorative elements, like the charming summerhouse and a
Chinese-style bridge over a pond. Urns copied from the garden of
the poet Alexander Pope at Twickenham, near London, are a splendid
touch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL MATERIAL &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday I turned from Annapolis' golden age to the sights,
sounds, history and beauty of the Naval Academy. It was founded
here in 1845 and has occupied a magnificent site on the Severn
River almost uninterruptedly ever since. (During the Civil War it
was moved to Newport, R.I., to put it beyond the reach of
Secessionists in southern Maryland and Virginia; in 1865 it was
nearly relocated to Perth Amboy.)
</P>
<P>
   The academy is the undergraduate professional college of the
Navy, with a 4,000-member Brigade of Midshipmen. During the
academic year midshipmen study at the Annapolis campus, but summers
after the first year are spent at sea and in other off-campus
training. Upon graduation, each becomes an officer in the Navy or
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   I began my visit at the excellent visitors' center, where I saw
an enticing film about the academy and exhibits about its history,
the life of midshipmen, and famous graduates. I then strolled into
the central part of the academy's campus, the Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagg buildings are in three main groups. The first contains
Bancroft Hall (an immense building, repeatedly enlarged, that is
still the academy's only dormitory), Memorial Hall (a majestic
pavilion that is reached by the grand entrance and ceremonial
stairway of Bancroft Hall) and Dahlgren and MacDonough Halls, which
Flagg designed to be the academy's armory and boathouse. Directly
across the Yard is what remains of Flagg's academic grouping, the
main component of which is Mahan Hall, once the library, with a
striking facade and clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   Flagg's finest building at the academy is the chapel. Based on
Jules Hardouin-Mansard's Dome des Invalides in Paris, the burial
place of Napoleon, the chapel is a beautiful building inside and
out, despite a competent but distorting addition of 1940 by Paul
Philippe Cret. (Because of the addition, the best view of the
Chapel's exterior is from the intersection of Porter and Buchanan
Roads, a hundred feet to the south.)
</P>
<P>
   Several of the buildings in the Yard are open to visitors. The
most interesting ones, architecturally speaking, are the work of
Ernest Flagg (1857-1947), a brilliant, dedicated and protean New
York City architect who was (among other things) one of America's
greatest practitioners in the Beaux-Arts style.
</P>
<P>
   Beaux-Arts architecture was a turn-of-the-century movement
centered on the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where Flagg was an
outstanding student in the 1880s. Flagg's buildings at the Naval
Academy, constructed between 1899 and 1908, instantly made me a
convert. They show in the best light the hallmarks of the
Beaux-Arts style: Intense rationality, clarity, monumentality,
meticulous use of decorative elements, and the dramatic and
purposeful ordering of interior spaces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the chapel holds much Tiffany stained glass on
historical themes as well as a magnificent dome. In the chapel's
crypt are the remains and fascinating memorabilia of John Paul
Jones, Revolutionary War hero and ``father of the United States
Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   My last stop at the Naval Academy is a great place for children:
The Academy Museum. The main floor offers a wonderful jumble of old
photographs, ship paintings, swords, medals and memorabilia of the
academy and of early naval heroes as well as a modern exhibition on
the Navy's history from the Spanish-American War of 1898 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   The basement houses the academy's trove of 17th- and
18th-century English wooden ship models, one of the two largest
collections in the world. (The other is in the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich, England.) The models are both precious
artifacts and works of breathtaking craftsmanship. One of the most
remarkable models in the collection is that of the Grafton,
completed in 1679, which may once have belonged to my all-time
hero, Samuel Pepys, when he was Secretary to the Admiralty in the
1680s.
</P>
<P>
   My final destination was Annapolis' most historic structure and
best-known landmark, the Maryland State House in State Circle. The
oldest part of the building, dating from the 1770s, contains a
restoration of the Old Maryland Senate Chamber, which served as the
seat of Congress (and hence as the capitol of the United States)
from November 1783 to August 1784.
</P>
<P>
   In this room Gen. George Washington, in a poignant and tearful
ceremony, tendered his resignation as commander in chief of the
American Army on Dec. 23, 1783. (Ever the showman, George then
gleefully scampered off to enjoy Christmas dinner with Martha at
Mount Vernon.)
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris here,
formally ending the Revolutionary War and making the United States
a genuinely independent nation _ though only after the ailing
delegate from South Carolina was transported from his sickbed to
produce the requisite quorum of 9 (out of 13) states.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious and endearing feature of the old State House is
the huge white dome constructed in 1785-88 to the plans of the
architect Joseph Clark. Said to be the largest wooden dome in the
country, this structure has dominated the Annapolis skyline ever
since, thanks to two remarkable characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clark wildly overreacted to critics who felt that an
earlier cupola on the State House roof had been too small to convey
the new state's dignity. As an astute observer wrote of Clark's
design in 1789, ``There is a disproportion between the dome and the
body of the building which must hurt the eye of every spectator.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking, in a random stroke of genius Clark modeled the
dome on the Schlossturm, or castle tower, of the palace of
Karlsruhe, Germany. How did an epitome of German High Baroque wind
up as the crowning feature of Maryland's State House? Clark most
likely saw an engraving of the Karlsruhe Schlossturm in the
Annapolis book and print shop owned by his brother, Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's State House dome was an immediate sensation, both
because of its highly distinctive style _ nothing like it ever
existed in Britain, for example _ and because of the wonderful
views from its observation deck. I stood on the State House
grounds, heartily agreeing with the dome's many early admirers,
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Charles Willson Peale among
them. After all, why shouldn't the centerpiece of one of our finest
Colonial towns, which is still conspicuously grounded on a
300-year-old Baroque town plan, be a German Baroque marvel?

RUSSIA'S AVANT-GARDE SISTERHOOD: 6 WOMEN FORGED IN REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Give credit to Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's
director. He remains a genius hustler. For the opening Thursday of
``Amazons of the Avant-Garde,'' the exhibition of paintings by six
Russian women from around the time of the Revolution, Krens invited
President Vladimir Putin of Russia to stop by.
</P>
<P>
   Krens' latest multinational enterprise links the Guggenheim and
the cash-challenged Hermitage in St. Petersburg. This is a big deal
potentially. The two museums plan jointly to franchise themselves
(the Hermitage, like the Guggenheim, has already been multiplying,
with an outpost in London and one coming in Amsterdam), and to swap
pictures and exhibitions. A permanent, tourist-ensuring Hermitage
section would be installed at the proposed Guggenheim near the
Financial District. (Are you listening, City Hall?) There would
even be more nonmodern art shows uptown.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that all such historical forays, should they
materialize, will further infuriate the Metropolitan and other
colleagues on whose territory Krens blithely poaches. He doesn't
care, obviously. It's a new world he is designing for museums.
Survival of the fittest. Perfect for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   And why complain? Cultural economics works in funny ways these
days, but the system incidentally benefits the public, sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Witness ``Amazons,'' a concise exercise, organized by Matthew
Drutt, a Guggenheim curator, with Zelfira Tregulova and John Bowlt.
Monographically arranged, it tendentiously focuses just on the
years before and after the Revolution and on painting; several of
the artists continued to work much later and did more than paint.
The women (Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga
Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova) are familiar,
thanks to a slew of Russian shows.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of them, Goncharova and Popova, are great
painters; the others are not, but the exhibition isn't a case of
special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what
it was without them collectively. In one way or another, each
nudged Russian culture, briefly anyway, into the 20th century, a
testament to the impact of women on modern art before the word
feminism came around.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Stepanova, they weren't especially political, at
least not before the Revolution, meaning that they wanted artistic
change, which was not the same as being Bolsheviks who wanted to
knock off the czar. Mostly they were well-off. (Stepanova was the
exception again.) They traveled around Europe, absorbed new French
and Italian art and moved in connected circles, but often
competitively.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't paint alike, so they certainly weren't a unified
group. Goncharova mixed Russian folk art, Chinese and Byzantine art
with German, French and Italian modernism to make neo-primitive,
Cubo-Futurist, mystical masterpieces. As that list implies, her
section of the show is a mad dash through different styles.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova gravitated from Cubo-Futurist illustrated poems to
images of dancing robots based on some sort of mathematical
calculations she made. Udaltsova was a Cubist turned Suprematist.
Exter was a colorist _ like her friends in Paris the artists Robert
and Sonia Delaunay _ who was influenced not only by Cubism but also
by Ukrainian embroidery. Popova, next to Goncharova, was the finest
painter. She began with Cubism, then absorbed one idea after
another before she, like several of these other women, decided in
the revolutionary spirit that easel painting had had its day, and
switched to utilitarian, proletariat-friendly textile and stage-set
designing.
</P>
<P>
   The show doesn't pursue the story that far. Popova and Rozanova
both died young. Goncharova left Moscow for Paris to design for
Diaghilev and stayed. Exter moved to Paris in 1924 and taught at
Leger's studio. Stepanova's career fizzled under the Soviet regime,
as did the career of Udaltsova, branded a formalist by Stalin. She
died in 1961.

<P>
   Linda Nochlin, the art historian, recently joked that before it
all came apart, this was at least ``one avant-garde that featured
women working rather than just taking off their clothes and lying
down.'' True enough. They operated alongside their male
counterparts without anybody seeming to consider it remarkable. If
any of the women felt strongly about their role vis-a-vis the men,
they kept their opinions to themselves. That wasn't their concern.
Russia having had a tradition of female patrons, gallery owners and
artists, they tapped into it naturally. On this issue the rest of
Russian society was stuck in the middle ages, but the avant-garde
provided a cocoon of comparative enlightenment and equal
opportunity. The story in the exhibition seems if anything more,
not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with gender as it
does, and almost everything to do with painting.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what unites these women, despite the differences:
they were all modern painters at a moment of incredible upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   If it were possible to have met any one of them, it would
probably be Goncharova, the Damien Hirst of prerevolutionary
Moscow, who issued crazy decrees, appeared in outrageous films and
cabarets and scandalized the public with pictures that the police
repeatedly confiscated as pornographic and blasphemous. She became
a sensation and great success, her inspiration having been the
Futurists. She aspired not just to Futurism's aesthetic but also to
its mastery of hype, its worship of change for its own sake. At the
same time her art came from a mind saturated in fantasies of
homeland, mystical religion, primitive art, peasant society and the
peculiarities of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peasants Gathering Grapes'' typifies at least two of her
fixations, ancient stone idols and native Russian subjects, which
she combines into a purely modern image whose god (Futurism's god,
too) was the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The other women achieved Goncharova's imaginative level
sporadically. Rozanova ended up painting a couple of amazing
abstractions, one of them a single quivering green stripe against
bare white, Barnett Newman before the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Udaltsova, who studied in Paris under Jean Metzinger and Henri
Le Fauconnier, made solid, unremarkable Cubist pictures with
exceptions like ``At the Piano'': its fragmented forms, in
syncopated rhythm, imply movement ingeniously. Stepanova's
illustrated poems and dancing figures are crudely painted, which
becomes a virtue in one striking self-portrait in which she
grimaces, a tick-tack-toe board and black dots for her eyes,
eyebrows and nose.
</P>
<P>
   Popova's legacy is obscured without the textiles, typography and
stage designs, although the paintings, even this show's uneven
selection of them, give an idea of her gifts. As with Udaltsova,
she studied in Paris under Metzinger and Le Fauconnier, and she
must have scrutinized Leger from the beginning, because
``Composition With Figures,'' its mechanical figures locked in a
shimmer of gold-blue faceting, is very close to his style. But it
is far from secondhand because of Popova's extraordinary way of
building space and her exquisite touch.
</P>
<P>
   She was said to have been inspired by Italian Renaissance art,
too, and this composition, the figures in a landscape, is so basic
that it goes back at least to Giorgione, typifying, perhaps, the
ambition of the Russian avant-gardists to evoke the old Renaissance
to bring about a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has been transformed into a single, monstrous,
fantastic, perpetually moving machine,'' wrote the poet Alexander
Shevchenko in 1913. ``We, like some kind of ideally manufactured
mechanical man, have grown used to living, getting up, going to
bed, eating and working by the clock _ and the sense of rhythm and
mechanical harmony, reflected in the whole of our life, cannot help
but be reflected in our thinking and in our spiritual life: in
Art.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded good at the time, the promise of mechanization and
modernity. In the paintings of these women it clearly flourished,
unspoiled, before Stalin flipped Shevchenko's vision on its head,
making mechanized society a dystopia.
</P>
<P>
   The works in ``Amazons'' have a surprising fortitude even now.
Revolution. A brave new art world. The idea persists although the
form it takes continually changes. Ask Krens.

&HT;     A MEASURE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY PASS

   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore vowed during his
acceptance speech to raise the minimum wage, the Democratic
National Convention delegates erupted in rafter-rattling cheers
matched in decibels only by the huzzahs for his promises to protect
abortion rights and reform health care.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly 60 years, the minimum wage issue has come up
regularly and has been mostly symbolic. The proposed increase is
merely $1 an hour. As the lowest wages rise, however, higher wages
tend to follow to adjust to the improved pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbol is powerful. In the world's most prosperous
economy, the salary floor for the nation's lowest-paid employees is
currently only $5.15 an hour, or about $10,700 for full-time work.
</P>
<P>
   This is a disgrace, a piddling sum that members of Congress _
who just hiked their own annual salaries to $145,500 with generous
side benefits _ can justify only if they are cruel, stupid or in
the pocket of cheapo big business.
</P>
<P>
   (Not surprisingly, that group includes the meanie Texas twins,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Republican whip Tom DeLay.
Armey wants to repeal the concept of a minimum wage altogether, and
DeLay was recently voiced anger at House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
for suggesting a compromise plan to get the bill passed.)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Democratic minority in Congress are
overwhelmingly behind a minimum wage increase. But for decades,
Republicans have automatically resisted such hikes on the grounds
that small businesses can't survive if forced to share their
profits with lowly laborers instead of using the money to pave over
a new parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Republicans up for re-election did not dare oppose
the proposal outright. Both the House and Senate passed measures
raising the limit $1 over varying periods of time but compensating
businesses by giving them big tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible Republicans up for re-election are pressuring their
leaders to do the right thing politically and economically. They
want to seem at least mildly concerned about narrowing the vast
income gap between corporate executives and their unskilled
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is this little problem of the lame duck president. He
doesn't want to be fleeced, particularly in an election year
important to his legacy. He has threatened to veto the GOP
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's compromise would provide $76 billion in tax cuts for
small businesses over 10 years to help companies pay ``the costs of
this wage increase.'' It was a psychological breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. What are these supposed costs? An Economic Policy
Institute (EPI) study of the last minimum wage hike in 1996 _
opposed by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich until the Republicans sank in
the polls that election year _ shows that the predicted devastating
loss to corporate America never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth continued at a remarkable pace. The threatened
inflation driven by wage increases did not happen. Some restaurants
raised menu prices, but labor costs were only part of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 increase raised the wages of almost 10 million workers,
of whom about 71 percent were adults and 58 percent were women. The
EPI reports that four different tests have failed to prove any
substantial loss of jobs directly due to the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage hike is likely to pass this fall because both
parties know it is a popular issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a big Gore issue, his rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, has been mostly silent on the subject. It's not a winner for
him. He needs an antidote to his huge across-the-board tax cut
proposal that would benefit the rich proportionately more than the
middle class or poor.
</P>
<P>
   But he supports undercutting the minimum wage by demanding that
states be allowed to opt out of any increase if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   There are already escape clauses for the states. Six, including
Bush's Texas, have lower minimum wage levels for local jobs to
which federal standards do not apply. Texas has a minimum wage of
$3.35 an hour for uncovered workers, including seasonal and farm
laborers. Seven other states have no local minimum wage level at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The federal minimum wage, which covers most workers for large
companies paid by the hour, began at 25 cents an hour in 1938. A
North Carolina reader reminds me that in those long-ago days, 25
cents paid for a haircut, five candy bars, six cups of coffee, two
bottles of beer or five hot dogs. Members of Congress were
considered overpaid at $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Today a stamp is 33 cents, and an order of french fries is
$1.19. If you can find him, a plain old barber will still give a
male a cut for $10 but women can pay $65 for a real do-up.
</P>
<P>
   The current minimum wage is no longer the single support system
for low-income families. We now have supplemental federal programs
like food stamps to help out. But it is still important for a
country of enormous wealth to demonstrate that its leaders do think
about the least fortunate. It might even be called compassionate
conservatism.

&HT;     BUSH VOWS DEFENSE MODERNIZATION AMID GOP CONCERNS OVER HIS
CAMPAIGN  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, moving to address some Republican worries that
his campaign is faltering, flanked himself with military heroes of
the Persian Gulf War on Thursday as he pledged to equip America's
armed forces with billions of dollars worth of new high-tech gear.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a fresh national survey showing Vice President Al
Gore leading by 6 percentage points and buffeted by allies' public
criticism of his campaign, Bush declared himself the underdog and
vowed to change his style.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would hold more town hall-style meetings with voters
and make fewer set-piece campaign speeches. He also indicated
greater flexibility on the timing and format of campaign debates
with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to meet with people more often in less
formal settings,'' Bush told reporters on the campaign trail in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, responding to GOP criticism of
the Bush campaign, said: ``We're listening'' because those comments
are ``well intentioned. Republicans want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby International poll released Thursday showed Gore
leading Bush 49 percent to 43 percent in a two-way race. Zogby's
poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey released Thursday, the CNN-USA TODAY poll, showed
Gore leading Bush 47 percent to 44 percent among likely voters. The
survey had a margin of error of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, declaring that he is the ``underdog'' in the contest,
urged supporters to have ``no illusions'' about the difficulty of
achieving victory on Nov. 7. Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said Gore
has ``recaptured some of the mantle of incumbency, adding that Bush
has always ``liked being the challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been leading Gore by more than 10 percentage points
going into the Republican convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby survey showed Gore had doubled his 3- percentage point
edge over Bush to 6 percentage points in just 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore challenged Bush's federal budget arithmetic in a
newspaper ad, fleshed out plans to create 10 million new high tech
jobs by 2010 and won the endorsement of the 1.5-million member
Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush had sought the endorsement of the union that
had supported Republican presidential candidates before backing.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters said they plan to spend $9 million to support
candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters' spokesman Bret Caldwell said members backed Gore in
part because of his ``populist message'' since the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Even before results of the new Zogby poll were released, some
prominent Republicans had voiced varying degrees of concern over
the Bush campaign. They included Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge;
Michigan Gov. John Engler; campaign consultant Charles Black;
former education secretary William Bennett; House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio; and Reps. Fred Upton, R-Mich.; and
Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked to retake the momentum by signaling willingness to
end a stalemate over campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be worked out,'' Bush said. ``I want there to be
debates. The more who watch, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's flexibility contrasted with earlier insistence that he
would only participate in two interview-style 60-minute TV
appearances and a lone 90-minute debate hosted by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates that has sponsored every
campaign debate since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sought three formal debates with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also sought to rebuild momentum by focusing for a second
day in a row on national security _ a tried-and-true issue for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to representatives of the 1.9-million member Veterans
of Foreign Wars meeting in Detroit, Bush shifted away from
allegations that the Clinton-Gore administration had permitted the
nation's military preparedness to deteriorate and focused instead
on the steps he hopes to take to transform the armed forces from a
lumbering Cold War-era force to a rapid deployment force.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Bush promised a blue ribbon military task force to
map modernization that would ``redefine how war is fought and won
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined during stops in Ohio by two retired military
officers who helped his father, President George Bush, prosecute
the 43-day Persian Gulf War in 1991 _ retired Gen. Colin Powell,
who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and retired
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the battlefield commander.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the second-term governor of Texas, left it to his running
mate, former defense secretary Dick Cheney, to flesh out the
Bush-Cheney plan for Pentagon modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Portland, Maine, Cheney sharpened his criticism of
the Clinton-Gore administration by drawing from a letter written to
the White House last March by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that
challenged the 30 percent reduction in the Pentagon's research and
development funding over the last six years. Lieberman is now
Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lack of planning for the future may represent the path of
least resistance _ but it is by far the path of greatest risk,''
Cheney quoted Lieberman's letter as saying. Cheney added: ``Sen.
Lieberman was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney promised a total $20 billion boost over the next five
years to the Pentagon's annual $34.3 billion research and
development budget for new weapons. Cheney vowed as well to earmark
at least 20 percent of the Pentagon's annual $61.8 billion for
weapons ``that propel America generations ahead in military
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign questioned Bush's budget commitment to
transforming U.S. armed forces. Gore has promised to devote $100
billion of the projected 10-year, $4.6 trillion federal budget
surplus to increase defense spending compared to $45 billion
promised by Bush, Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush talks tough on defense but that is all it is _ talk,''
said Gore spokeswoman Kym Spell.

WHY SPIKE LEE SHOULD LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something weird is happening at your local multiplex, something
that hasn't happened for almost a decade. A Spike Lee movie is
playing, and it's actually ... fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy,'' which documents four black
comedians in concert, isn't very funny _ only Steve Harvey
consistently hits his marks _ but it's surprisingly likable _
high-spirited, loose, and rambling.
</P>
<P>
   Savor the moment, because Lee will be invading theaters in early
October with a more typical Spike Lee Joint. ``Bamboozled,'' which
is already making headlines in New York for its provocative ad
campaign, concerns a black comedy writer trying to get fired from
his white-run TV network. He writes a neo-minstrel show starring
blacks in blackface, sure that it will be offensive enough to
destroy his career. Instead it becomes a national sensation. The
preview suggests that ``Bamboozled'' may be Lee at his most
portentous and hectoring _ a somber satire about comedy, if such a
thing is possible.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Bamboozled'' is heavy-handed, it won't be a surprise. A
creeping didacticism has taken Lee hostage. He has always made
message movies. His early films, especially ``School Daze,'' ``Do
the Right Thing,'' and ``Jungle Fever,'' shouted out his issues:
black economic empowerment, black America's color and class
divisions, the danger of white hegemony, the vitality of black
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's movies were also hopped up with ambiguity, joy and
humor. ``Do the Right Thing'' remains as provocative as it was in
1989: Why does Mookie chuck the garbage can through the pizza-shop
window? How much sympathy does Radio Raheem deserve? Lee, who has a
sharp ear, crammed his movies with bantering and bullthrowing. The
three black men hanging out on the sidewalk are a profane,
hilarious chorus in ``Do the Right Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mars Blackmon, Lee's nervous Nike-wearing pest in ``She's Gotta
Have It,'' is one of the funniest and most memorable characters in
recent American film. ``Crooklyn'' is suffused with a charming,
bittersweet nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has never stopped working or experimenting. He is endlessly
ambitious. He has jumped genres from musical (``School Daze'') to
biopic (``Malcolm X'') to road tripper (``Get on the Bus'') to
concert movie (``Freak''). His subjects range from music (``Mo'
Better Blues'') to black colleges (``School Daze'') to basketball
(``He Got Game'') to phone sex (``Girl 6'') to the Son of Sam
killings (``Summer of Sam'').
</P>
<P>
   Nor has he restricted himself to movies: Lee makes ads and music
videos, writes books, runs a successful ad agency, and still has
time for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, the high spirits have leached away and
didacticism has swallowed his movies. Lee's recent films are
cluttered with stagy speeches in which a character announces the
lesson we should learn from the movie. (``Get on the Bus'' is
little else.)
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing has replaced questioning. ``Do the Right Thing''
succeeds partly because it's never clear who's heroic and because
its characters are constantly changing. But the basketball
recruiters in ``He Got Game'' are pure evil. ``Get on the Bus'' has
the ethical nuance of a buddy movie. ``Summer of Sam'' ends with a
heavy-handed near-lynching.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lee has sliced the humor from his serious films.
Consider the characters Lee himself has played. In his early
movies, he played a series of nebbishy, funny pipsqueaks, notably
Mars Blackmon, Half-Pint in ``School Daze,'' and Mookie.
</P>
<P>
   But his characters have sobered up. ``Summer of Sam'' marks the
nadir: He is a dead-eyed, mono-tonal TV reporter, a character as
different from Mars Blackmon as you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The trash-talking that crackled through ``School Daze,'' ``She's
Gotta Have It,'' and ``Do the Right Thing'' has gone missing, too.
``Summer of Sam,'' a film about a tense, violent neighborhood
during a heat wave, is an update of ``Do the Right Thing'' without
the verbal flash and humor. Lee is recycling lines he once played
for laughs as straight dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus of ``Do the Right Thing'' jokes about how blacks
never live up to their big talk. In ``Get on the Bus,'' the callow
black Republican character echoes the riff, almost word for word,
but this time it's supposed to show the speaker's cruelty. Lee
repeats himself: the first time as farce, the second time as
tragedy. Lee may be suspicious of comedy because he would hate to
be dismissed as a clown. But his sobriety robs his films of the
leaven they need.
</P>
<P>
   Lee did, of course, just direct ``The Original Kings of
Comedy,'' but even here his message is political. When Lee talks
about why he made it, he never discusses how funny the comedians
are. Instead, he focuses on the importance of publicizing black
entertainers ignored by white America.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's directing style _ why do it when you can overdo it? _
emphasizes his didacticism. His films are stagy and expressionist.
He favors bizarre camera angles and histrionic lighting. He repeats
intrusive film-school techniques movie after movie, notably his
distracting practice of having supposedly walking characters rolled
on dollies.
</P>
<P>
   As David Edelstein, film critic for Slate.com puts it, ``He has
an unbelievably self-conscious style. He never wants you to forget
his presence as the director.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he permits no respite from his message or his direction,
Lee's movies feel claustrophobic. ``The Original Kings of Comedy''
does not feel this way because you can't turn stand-up into a
sermon and because you can't play too many directing tricks on a
live stage show.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talent, Lee is not much imitated as a film director.
His TV commercials, with their quick wit and quick cuts, have been
widely copied, as has his entrepreneurial style. But not his
artistry. No director, except perhaps John Sayles, shares Lee's
unflagging seriousness. And actors are too powerful in Hollywood to
allow many control maniacs like Lee to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin Scorsese directs a film, it can be an ``Al Pacino
movie'' or a ``Robert De Niro movie.'' When Steven Spielberg
directs, it can be a ``Tom Hanks movie.'' But a Spike Lee film is
never a ``Denzel Washington movie'' or a ``Wesley Snipes movie.''
It is always a Spike Lee Joint.
</P>
<P>
   There is a medium where Lee is not disappointing these days:
documentary. Perhaps the best movie he has made in the past decade
is ``4 Little Girls,'' a nonfiction account of the 1963 Birmingham,
Ala., church bombing that killed four black girls. He brought his
visual energy and fierce intelligence to the project, but
documentary subdued his style. There was only so much ``directing''
he could do. He was locked to the facts. He didn't have actors he
could order around. He had to work with real people. This restraint
made ``4 Little Girls'' clear, smart, and passionate.
</P>
<P>
   No one who pays $8 for a feature film on a Friday night really
wants speechifying and moralizing, which is why watching recent Lee
features is often irksome. But documentary-goers expect and even
demand speechifying and moralizing, which is why watching ``4
Little Girls'' isn't.

CURBING TERRORISM IN TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The savage murders of three UN refugee agency staffers in West
Timor, just across the border from liberated East Timor, came as
149 heads of state assembled at the United Nations in New York for
a millennium summit meant to strengthen the organization's
peacekeeping capability.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan and Sadako Ogata, the UN high
commissioner for refugees, expressed their outrage to Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid. In turn, Wahid said he was mourning
for the slaughtered UN refugee workers. They were slain while
aiding the 125,000 East Timorese refugees remaining from the
300,000 who were driven from their homes a year ago by militias
that were formed, trained, and supplied by the Indonesian Army and
special forces known as Kopassus.
</P>
<P>
   This relationship of puppet to puppeteer is crucial because it
suggests where the responsibility belongs for the slaughter of the
three UN staffers.
</P>
<P>
   This and other atrocities could not have happened if the
Indonesian military did not allow them to happen. Indeed, there is
suspicion among relief workers and UN personnel that Kopassus and
the Indonesian Army were the hidden organizers of what appears to
be a highly orchestrated effort to drive the UN staffers from the
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The evident aim of Wednesday's massacre is to end the UN's
registering of refugees, most of whom want to return to East Timor
but are being intimidated into remaining in the camps by the
militias. Bishop Carlos Belo of East Timor, the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, has told of bands of militia thugs crossing the border
into East Timor and ambushing unarmed villagers. As a consequence
of these terror raids, East Timorese in the border area have become
too fearful to sleep in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   The political goal of this terror campaign is to create a buffer
zone near the East Timor border with West Timor, where militias in
thrall to the Indonesian Army might rule. This was the fallback
plan in August 1999, when the military officers wanted some means
of keeping their hand in East Timor even if the East Timorese voted
for independence, as they did on Aug. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wahid lacks true control of the Indonesian military, he is
the wrong person to hector, and UN bureaucrats are the wrong people
to be demanding an end to the terrorism of the militias. Indonesian
Army officers are the responsible parties, and US military
officials who trained many of them are the ones to demand a halt to
the bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   The militias must be cleared out of the refugee camps in West
Timor. The training of militias by the Indonesian military must
cease. There must be an end to the militias' cross-border raids and
ambushes. And the 100 or so hard-core desperados in the militias
must be removed from West Timor and shipped elsewhere in the
Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan can hardly impose his will on the Indonesian officers
behind the killing of UN staffers. The US Army can and should. One
of those three murdered and mutilated workers was an American.

LEGALIZING DRUGS WOULD JUST MAKE MATTERS WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following ``separate buy'' article from SLATE, the premier
online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New
York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   (James Q. Wilson is the author of books about crime, politics,
bureaucracy, and human character.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JAMES Q. WILSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By saying that our federal (and many state) drug laws are
irrational, that does not mean we can solve the problem by
legalizing certain illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   If only things were so simple. The central problem with
legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption under
almost any reasonable guess as to what the legalization (or more
modestly, the decriminalization) regime would look like. The
debate, I think, must be between those who admit this increase and
then explain why they would find it tolerable and those who admit
the increase and find it intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal drugs _ and here I refer chiefly to cocaine, heroin,
PCP, and methamphetamine _ have three prices that are much higher
than what they would be if the sale were legal.
</P>
<P>
   First, under legalization the cash price would be lower. No one
knows by how much, but the most cautious scholar says by a factor
of three, the boldest one says by a factor of 20. Now take a
powerfully addictive substance, one that not only operates on but
modifies the human brain by producing compelling effects that often
can only be achieved again by increasing the dosage, and ask how
many more people would buy it if its cash price were only 30
percent or even 5 percent of its current price.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you think that everybody who wants the drug is already
using it, a most unlikely possibility, then the answer must be _ a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Second, under legalization the quality price would be lower.
Drugs are now purchased in most cases from people who offer no
meaningful promise of quality. You can buy cocaine or heroin that
has been cut five times or 20 times, and cut with sugar or rat
poison. The Food and Drug Administration does not require accurate
labeling, and unless you are a repeat customer, you probably have
no idea what you are getting. Feel like taking a chance? Buy a drug
from the furtive fellow on the street corner.
</P>
<P>
   Third, under legalization the search price would be zero. You
would not have to search or run risks of being mugged or arrested.
Maybe you would be able to buy it in the local pharmacy, but you
would get it from some dealer operating in the open with no risk to
you.
</P>
<P>
   Cut all of these three prices _ the cash cost, the risk of not
getting a decent quality, and the absence of searching and running
risks _ and the total price reduction would not be by a factor of
20 but probably by a factor of 50. Consumption will go up
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Now what happens? Here is where the only meaningful debate can
exist. Do you think that there will be a decrease in drug crime?
Maybe _ if the crime committed by users seeking money to buy drugs
and the dealers protecting their right to sell drugs falls by an
amount greater than the increase in crime committed by addicted
users who are no longer capable of holding a job. Not all coke or
heroin addicts are incapacitated, but a significant fraction _
perhaps one-fifth, perhaps more _ are. Say we have 1 million users
now, with 200,000 of them so dependent on the drug that they are
useless for any activity, including holding a job.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose after legalization we have 5 million users, with 1
million totally zonked.
</P>
<P>
   We can support the 1 million on welfare, though I think the
political chance of that is utterly remote. Or we can let them fend
for themselves by stealing. They may well steal more than the
200,000 steal when the price of drugs is much higher. Take a guess.
But remember that after we create the 1 million, we can't turn the
clock back. We shall have them forever.
</P>
<P>
   Or to take another example. Suppose we have 15,000 people killed
by drunken drivers. How many will be killed by coke- or
heroin-addicted drivers if access to those products becomes as easy
as access to alcohol is now? There is no way to tell, but it would
be foolish to assume that the number would be trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask how many marriages, now afflicted by alcoholism, will be
afflicted by drug abuse when drugs become legal. Or how many
pregnancies that now are harmed by fetal alcohol syndrome will be
harmed by fetal drug syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Recall also that most people in drug treatment are there because
of some form of coercion. Very few walk in on their own. Take away
coercion, and you take away treatment for all but a few burned-out
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   John Stuart Mill, the father of modern libertarians, argued that
people can only restrict the freedom of another for their
self-protection, and society can only exert power over its members
against their will in order to prevent harm to others. I think that
the harm to others from drug legalization will be greater than the
harm _ and it is a great harm _ that now exists from keeping these
drugs illegal.

   ``We're sexy and cute and smart to boot,'' chants the Rancho
Grande High School cheerleading team, the Torros, five-time
national cheering champions. They are also cheats, or so it is
charged by the East Compton Clovers, a largely black rival squad.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the Torros planted a spy with a video camera and
stole the Clovers' routines. Shocked to the quick, the Torros' new
captain, Torrance (Dunst), proposes devising new steps, leaps and
tosses. Her teammates tell her to forget it. Who cares if the
routine was stolen? Besides, there isn't time to hone a new one
before they're out there on ESPN defending their title.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent Torrance brings in a choreographer named Sparky,
who installs a new act he has also sold to a half-dozen other
cheerleading teams up and down the Southern California coast. That
doesn't help clear the cheating cloud when the Torros are the
second team to perform the same routine at the regionals. Even more
determined to achieve originality, Torrance devises gyrations
incorporating jazz, martial arts and mime. Bring on those Clovers.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Torrance and her teammates live in scanty cheering outfits,
bikinis and nighties. But while there are plenty of sexual asides
and assessments of body parts, the film stays clean and sportif.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A little, but not overdone.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: Without making an issue of it, the movie has a sharp
ear for the put-downs, rejection and personal viciousness that high
school students reserve for one another. The male Torros rouse
general homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9: Older viewers in this group will be caught up, but
considering the slightly risque nature of the proceedings, perhaps
not.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10 AND UP: Parents' choice, but the film is loud fun, and
in its brushes with ethics and tolerance even relatively
substantive, given its subject.

   At millennium time in Hong Kong, the banalities are in full
swing when a dervish in a tuxedo leaps onto a Las Vegas-style
runway and drop-kicks his way through a squad of goons sent to
collar him. But this is no musical. Shaw (Snipes) works for a
covert action unit belonging to (ready?) the United Nations. And
now that dirty little band, headed by the world body's director of
security (Archer), no less, faces its largest assignment: strike
back at those trying to sabotage an impending trade agreement with
China.
</P>
<P>
   The globe itself hangs in the balance, at least to hear the
secretary-general (Sutherland) tell it. ``There's no free lunch;
you have to pay the piper,'' he says, quitting just short of ``the
buck stops here.'' But it's Shaw who is bounced around by sadists
who also make an awful mess out of attractive young interpreters
and electronic eavesdropping specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Who is behind all this? Looks like ``the triad,'' one of those
inscrutable Asian conspiracies tied to sleazy-looking types who
seem to have escaped from a Jackie Chan movie without their sense
of humor. Then the Chinese ambassador, named Woo, is shot in
midspeech, allowing the movie to take note of ``a war on Woo.''
</P>
<P>
   Pounding around New York one step behind or ahead of evil
forces, Shaw befriends Julia (Matiko), a young woman whose
connection with this mess isn't entirely clear but who at one point
is made to strip and throw all her clothes out the window of a
speeding car because she is unwittingly wearing a planted
microphone. Back at the United Nations, the secretary-general
considers bringing in the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Numerous killings are gratuitously, leeringly brutal.
One woman's head is repeatedly smashed through a heavy mirror.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: No one seems much in the mood, although prostitutes are
fleetingly shown at work with a North Korean general and Julia ends
up demurely in the buff.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A full complement.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: They wouldn't keep making junk like this if it
didn't sell to teen-agers. With that in mind, the film is typical
of its kind.

</P>
<P>
   As a test pilot who took experimental aircraft to the edge of
the stratosphere in the 1950s, Frank Corvin (Eastwood) naturally
assumed that he would be among the first sent into space. In fact,
Frank only got to shake hands with the first, a chimpanzee named
Mary Ann. So it was, too, with his pilot friends, Hawk (Jones),
Jerry (Sutherland) and Tank (Garner), all of whom were passed over
when the space program moved from the military to the civilian-led
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Frank owed his dumping to Bob Gerson (Cromwell), a
spotlight-hogging space administrator. But the worm turns in the
year 2000 when a Russian satellite, aloft for 30 years, loses
control and threatens to crash back to earth. Frank inadvertently
designed the guidance system on that old bird back in 1969 (the
Soviets stole his specifications), and he's the only one who can
keep the thing flying now.
</P>
<P>
   After refusing on principle, Frank signs on _ with stipulations.
He'll fix the craft, but only if NASA sends him and his cronies up
in a space shuttle. Gerson is apoplectic. Frank and the others are
well into senior citizenhood. To prepare, they run geezerly laps,
sweat streaming down sagging flesh. Still, old Hawk and Jerry
manage some womanizing, and the four of them pull it together long
enough to qualify physically while, this being the movies,
mastering the intricacies of shuttle operation.
</P>
<P>
   Aloft, though, Houston and the old guys definitely have a
problem. For one thing, the Russian ship is not exactly the wayward
clunker everybody assumed it was. Then Hawk decides to fly himself
to the moon, while his pals prefer flying by the seat of their
pants.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Frank and Hawk trade punches outside a bar.

just enough excitement.

drawn by the geriatric set, even in space. &QL;

 &HT;    SENATE REPUBLICANS WIN A ROUND IN MISSOURI RIVER FIGHT
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flexing their majority muscles in the first of many
showdowns over environmental policy, Senate Republicans voted
Thursday to keep the federal government from raising the flow of
the Missouri River in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, other big shippers and barge owners along the lower
part of the river applauded the result, which would keep the flow
of the 2,300-mile-long river smooth all year around.
Environmentalists who favored varying the flow split, with some
lamenting their loss and others glad that the Republicans failed to
obtain a veto-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   By a margin of 52-45, largely along partisan lines, the Senate
voted to ban the Army Corps of Engineers from trying to help save
the pallid sturgeon and two rare shore birds by raising the level
of the Missouri in the spring and lowering it in the summer about
once every three years.
</P>
<P>
   Voting Thursday to defend the ban were 51 Republicans and Sen.
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. On the losing side were 43 Democrats and
Sens. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., and Bill Roth, R-Del. Three senators
missed the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That display of unity strengthened the bargaining power of
leaders in both parties for the tough negotiations that will settle
end-of-session disputes over several issues, including more than
three dozen environmental clauses in unfinished appropriation
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that varying the flow of
the Missouri would help create sand bars where the piping plover
and interior least tern can raise hatchlings, and would stimulate
breeding by the pallid sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The sturgeon, a 6-foot-long, toothless, bottom-sucking primitive
that has been swimming in the Missouri since the Jurassic age of
dinosaurs, have been breeding less often since the once-wild
Missouri was tamed by reservoirs and dams.
</P>
<P>
   During a passionate, fact-packed three-hour debate, the ban was
defended by its author, Sen. Christopher (Kit) Bond, R-Mo., whose
downriver farmers fear wet fields and believe that year-round barge
service will help keep down railroad shipping rates. The attack on
the ban was led by Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, whose upriver recreational businesses make more money from
fishing and boating by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, almost all senators ignored the arguments and
simply closed ranks behind their party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That partisan pattern infuriated Tom Searchinger, an attorney in
the Washington office of Environmental Defense, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't vote on the merits in a case where the Army
Corps of Engineers says the economic benefits of the change will
more than match any economic losses, how can we ever expect them to
enforce the Endangered Species Act?'' he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   However, other environmentalists were delighted that Bond fell
far short of rounding up the 67 votes that would be needed to
override a veto threat issued by Clinton at Daschle's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this puts us in an excellent position to rip this
provision out in the conference committee, because the president is
going to have a tremendous amount of leverage,'' said Mary Beth
Beetham, director of legislative affairs in the Washington office
of Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Jason Schechter said, ``The
president has no intention of letting this language ever become
law. If that takes a veto, there will be a veto.''
</P>
<P>
   But Searchinger said, ``There's always abundant risk when a
whole lot of items get thrown into a messy pile on the (bargaining)
table at the end of a session, as to what will survive.''

`ON OUR OWN TERMS': THE MANY LAYERS OF DYING  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Va., Kan., Mo.)  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In America, a nation of strivers, people want to believe that
everything is subject to improvement, even dying. While death
remains (presumably) a constant, the act of dying has become more
complex. Medical advances have prolonged life, but often in an
undesirable form, forcing doctors to reconsider their roles and
obligations. Terminally ill patients may think they want to take
control of their mortality with physician-assisted suicide, then
find they are afraid.
</P>
<P>
   So dying remains a mystery, subject to legal, medical,
theological, emotional and economic considerations. No one wants to
think about it, but eventually everyone must. To help, Bill Moyers
has provided an extraordinary guide with ``On Our Own Terms,'' his
panoramic and often profoundly moving vision of how we die in
America today.
</P>
<P>
   In this four-part, six-hour PBS series, Moyers and his crew
cover a lot of physical as well as emotional ground, featuring
doctors and patients from all over the country, in all kinds of
financial and family circumstances, uncovering heart-wrenching and
sometimes surprising stories of fortitude and fragility,
indifference and love.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the intimate case studies Moyers presents offer
the intense emotionalism of great drama, he always aims to
instruct. So in addition to the six hours presented on television,
PBS has produced elaborate amplification at www.pbs.org, making
this program a vivid illustration of how television and the
Internet are becoming increasingly linked. Throughout the program,
references to corresponding links on the PBS Web site appear
onscreen. The Web site offers comprehensive information on both
practical and intangible matters, including financial planning
advice for terminally ill patients, various treatment alternatives
and on ``taking a spiritual inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the new genre of hospital documentaries like ABC's
excellent series ``Hopkins: 24/7,'' Moyers and his producers don't
try to mimic the fast-paced style of prime-time television dramas _
though these cameras also follow patients into conferences with
their doctors and into their homes. Often the cameras stop to show
pictures of the patients before, when they were happy and whole,
and these ordinary snapshots take on layers of poignancy and
meaning. Viewers meet people who face death with humor as well as
resoluteness, like the retired math teacher who refers to each
weekly gathering with her children and grandchildren as ``the last
supper.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyers isn't afraid to linger, to acknowledge the knotted layers
of his subject. Introducing the third episode, ``A Death of One's
Own,'' which deals with assisted suicide, Moyers notes that the
subject is often sensationalized by the media and pointedly
observes that in this program ``Dr. Kevorkian is not heard from.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Moyers is an unobtrusive but steady presence,
introducing each episode and then occasionally appearing on camera
to ask a gently leading question. (``Is it hard to have to focus on
him all the time?'' he asks a dying man's wife.)
</P>
<P>
   The producers have assembled a remarkable array of subjects,
people whose obsession with death _ whether personal or
professional _ provokes multifarious thoughts about it. They found
Thomas Lynch, the Michigan undertaker who is also an author on the
subject, a homespun poet and philosopher, and a smart, sensitive
doctor specializing in palliative care at Mount Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan. She requires her medical students to read Tolstoy's
``Death of Ivan Ilyich,'' about a man who is dying without anyone's
acknowledging that his death is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The undertaker from Michigan wonders why so many people ask for
funerals without flowers, but when Diana, Princess of Wales, died,
strangers offered flowers in abundance. A doctor in
Charlottesville, Va., tries to convince a group of medical students
that to stop giving a patient food and air through tubes isn't
killing him, just letting him die. In New York City, a young man's
family, refusing to acknowledge that their son is dying, wants to
reduce his pain medication so he can be alert enough to fight the
disease that will kill him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The series falters only in the last episode, ``A Time to
Change,'' which becomes preachy as it poses important questions
about the financial challenges of providing good end-of-life care
to everyone. In part because many of the patients featured here are
too far gone to make a connection, some of the immediacy of the
earlier episodes is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The series shines with its individual portraits, some of which
have the resonance of good literature. In ``A Death of One's Own,''
Jim Witcher, a veterinarian in Louisiana, and his wife, Susie, are
living their lifelong dream of owning a horse farm in retirement _
a dream fulfilled except that he is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease,
a creeping paralysis that will steadily destroy every function. He
wants to be put to sleep before he dies a miserable death, the way
he often relieved the suffering of animals when he was in practice,
but assisted suicide is illegal in Louisiana and against his
family's religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   His wife sympathizes enormously but can't promise him she'll
fulfill his wishes. It's too much for her to be both a grieving
wife and an ethicist. So she does what she is able, caring for him
at home because, she says, clearly loving, she can't bear the
thought of a stranger ``wiping his bottom.'' It is wrenching to
watch her struggle to hoist her husband from his wheelchair onto a
plastic chair for his shower, then bathe him with the same strong
hands she uses to soap and rinse their horses.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode, ``Living With Dying,'' begins with Bill
Bartholome, a pediatrician in Kansas City, an articulate observer
of his own dying. It reveals no secrets to say that Bartholome dies
at the end of the program. That's the point of his presence.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But first, he engages the audience with his matter-of-factness,
which transmits deep intelligence and bravery. When he received his
diagnosis, it seemed appropriate to him that he should be stricken.
``Why not have it be somebody who can deal with it?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholome possesses the mixed blessing of being able to
diagnose his illness (esophageal cancer) and to monitor its
progress. After initially experiencing ``a kind of grief I had
never known,'' he says, he determined to live with vibrancy as ``a
terminal person.'' He does not want to kill himself as he nears
death; nor does he want to prolong his life. He just wants to die
at home, with his wife present, as comfortably as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For him, this is a personal decision, though Moyers demonstrates
that Bartholome is part of a wider movement to humanize the dying
process. Hospitals like Mount Sinai have established palliative
care units whose focus is not on curing patients but on easing
their pain, though patients still may request medical treatment
beyond painkillers. Then there are hospices, where the emphasis is
strictly on comfort, not cure.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers meets with Bartholome and his wife over a period of
months, and the patient is visibly losing ground, dropping 20
pounds in less than a month. By the end this tall man weighs 154
pounds, a shadow of the hearty 216-pound fellow seen in a snapshot,
happily holding a freshly caught fish.
</P>
<P>
   He writes a journal about his experience and confesses in one
interview that he is in pain, but decided not to take his
medication that day so he could think clearly. ``I want to be
master of ceremonies at this thing,'' he says of his death. Perhaps
we dare not ask for anything more. &QL;

JAPAN'S BANKING SYSTEM TOTTERING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ First, there was the failure of Sogo Co., a lumbering
department store chain that was crushed this summer by its $17
billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a construction company, Inoue Kogyo, was rescued from a
similar fate when its banks forgave $136 million in debt; Hazama,
another construction company, may receive similar treatment for
about $1 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the central bank moved to raise interest rates,
if only fractionally.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of those events increased the strain on Japan's rickety
banking system. The question now is whether their combined effect
will be lethal, forcing the government to intervene as it did two
years ago when the financial system came close to collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has spent 25 trillion yen in tax money, or $238
billion at current exchange rates, on its overhaul of the financial
system, of $666 billion allocated for that purpose in 1998. Even
more has been spent to prop up banks and other financial
institutions indirectly, through credit-guarantee programs and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are standing at the same divide where we were standing two
years ago, when we recapitalized the banks,'' said Yasuhisa
Shiozaki, a youngish legislator from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party who has been a rather lonely advocate of painful
financial restructuring. ``We can either recapitalize the banks
again, or we can just let them go bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiozaki is perhaps the boldest of a growing group of
politicians, economists and government officials who think that
Japan never entirely repaired its banking system after many banks
stumbled into crisis in autumn 1997, falling victim to profligate
lending policies and social pressure to maintain relationships,
whatever the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at the watchdog Financial Supervisory Agency
have recently been telling reporters and analysts that three or
four more of the country's big banks should have been nationalized
in 1998, along with the ones that were _ Long-Term Credit Bank and
Nippon Credit Bank. But politicians, they say, would not sanction
such radical surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Shiozaki doubts that the government has the will for a second
round of refinancing in the wake of Sogo's failure, when a plan to
spend close to $1 billion to waive debt and keep the company afloat
was swamped in an outcry of public disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling-party politicians quickly scrapped the plan, and Sogo
failed, blowing away the fig leaf that covered Japan's
supposedly-resolved bad-debt problems. ``What we found out with
Sogo and afterward is that the essential and fundamental problems
of the Japanese economy were still there or perhaps even worse,''
Shiozaki said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although a second injection of public money into the banking
system may be unlikely, the government has proven itself adroit at
devising bank rescue programs in disguise. A decision to postpone a
deposit-insurance program that would limit government protection to
about $95,000 a depositor, rather than the unlimited protection in
place since 1996, was aimed at protecting the regional banks and
local lenders that would likely see their customers flee for
bigger, sounder institutions if the plan were to start in March
2001 as originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's $285 billion credit-guarantee program for
small and midsized enterprises is as much about supporting banks as
about helping struggling mom-and-pop businesses. Takatomo Nakagawa,
a researcher at Teikoku Data Bank, remarked: ``The companies using
this program were, in many cases, using the money especially to pay
back existing bank loans, not only for the operations of the
company. The money was used for the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As of March, the major banks had more than $40 billion reserved
against bad debts, but James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at
ING Barings in Tokyo, estimates that those reserves would cover
only about 2.5 percent of their potential problem loans. He doubts
that all bad debt has been properly classified and that real estate
collateral has been properly valued.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are more optimistic. Statistics show that the big
banks have enough reserves to cover 25 percent of the roughly $188
billion in bad debts held at the end of March.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, the government enacted sweeping financial
reform legislation aimed at setting the banking system, which had
nearly collapsed within the preceding year, back on its feet. In
exchange for an infusion of public money totaling 8 trillion yen,
or $76 billion, the banks were forced into a wholesale
re-evaluation of their loan portfolios, urged to consolidate, and
exhorted to focus on profitability rather than the relationships
that determined past business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent an additional 6.8 trillion yen, or $64.2
billion, rehabilitating the two major banks it nationalized, Nippon
Credit Bank and Long-Term Credit Bank. ``I think people forget how
much has been accomplished in less than two years,'' said Yoshimasa
Hayashi, a young member of the upper house of Parliament. ``The
commitment to financial reform continues to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   While an impressive wave of consolidation in the last two years
has cut the ranks of Japan's biggest banks in half to 10, it has
yet to produce obvious efficiencies. Nor has consolidation
noticeably changed the type of business banks here do or the way in
which they do it.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have yet to incur the costs of bringing their outmoded
technology up to date; meanwhile nimbler new financial institutions
that have linked their fortunes to the Internet are plowing new
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' bread-and-butter lending business remains in a
prolonged slump. Borrowers are either desperately working to reduce
their debts or are increasingly relying on the capital markets for
their borrowing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the banks are struggling with negative forces over
which they _ and the government _ have little or no control.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, credit ratings agencies are warning that
bankruptcies, already ratcheting up every month, are likely to hit
a high this year as bigger and bigger debtors throw in the towel.
Bankruptcies rose 21 percent in July compared to the same month
last year, according to Teikoku Databank, a private research
company, and the total debt owed by the companies that folded
tripled to a high of $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see an avalanche of new bad debts into the system, the
banks do not appear to have enough resources to cope comfortably
with the problem,'' Fiorillo said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wave of bankruptcies is forcing banks to sell off shares
they hold to raise money to cover losses, which is, along with
sales by foreigners, contributing to a drop in stock prices that
further erodes the remaining value of their investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ING Barings estimates that the more than 7 trillion yen in
profits that Japanese banks boasted last year when the stock market
staged a mini-recovery had, as of July, turned into roughly 500
billion yen in losses with the market's fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the agency charged with overhauling the financial
system, the Financial Reconstruction Commission, has been buffeted
by a series of scandals that have created a revolving door in its
leadership and undermined its power and credibility. In the last 10
months, the commission has had four chiefs, two of whom were forced
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head of the organization has been changed too frequently
and that is not good,'' said Hakuo Yanagisawa, the member of
Parliament who served for one year as the commission's first chief
before he was replaced in a routine cabinet shuffle. To critics,
all this suggests that the government is going to have to find some
way to overcome popular resistance to injecting more money into the
banking system. ``Public funds are going to be used, either through
the Deposit Insurance Corp. or by letting banks go bust or
injecting more capital into them,'' Shiozaki said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Shiozaki and his like are alarmists. ``The
problems emerging now are more or less within the scope of what we
anticipated,'' Yanagisawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa is still accorded a great deal of respect, both
within Japan and without, and is credited with forcing the
consolidation that has reconfigured the landscape of Japanese
banking. Bankers feared him, reformers praised him and politicians
respected him.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his tenure that Long-Term Credit Bank, once the
flagship of the Japanese banking system, was sold off to a group of
foreigners led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC, a private equity firm
based in New York. That move has had big repercussions. Long-Term
Credit, now known as Shinsei Bank, refused to participate in a debt
restructuring plan for Sogo. Ripplewood seemed well aware when it
bought Long-Term Credit that many of its loans were basically
irrecoverable. It demanded that the government promise to make the
bank whole on any loans that fell in value by 20 percent or more
for three years after the sale _ even though the government had
supposedly transferred all bad loans from the bank to the Deposit
Insurance Corp. long before Ripplewood came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians are now arguing that the government agreed to
that provision because it also knew that a good portion of
Long-Term Credit's loan portfolio was suspect but could not win
political sanction to pull the plug on well-connected companies
like Sogo, Daiei, Kumagai Gumi and the Saison group, which have
strong ties to leaders of the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshimi Watanabe, a Liberal Democrat in the lower house of
Parliament, believes that this failure to thoroughly weed out bad
debts and consign them to the Deposit Insurance Corp. was a basic
flaw in the whole bank rescue program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original evaluation of those loans was totally wrong,'' he
said. ``The banking bureau at the Ministry of Finance was claiming
these loans were `grey' loans, not bad loans, but in fact these
loans were to companies that had a high probability of going
bankrupt or were effectively bankrupt already.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa conceded that some of the assumptions made when the
Financial Reconstruction Commission was established have since
proven faulty. ``We had hoped that those companies would have made
strenuous efforts to restructure themselves in the period before
their loans were transferred to Shinsei,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government's economic forecasts had been too
rosy, thus skewing its projections about corporate recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But Yanagisawa argues that today's problems are largely ones of
perception, not asset quality. ``There is no one who can explain to
the Japanese public that these problems are within the bounds of
what we had anticipated,'' he said. ``Government authorities had
envisaged this scenario.''

COLUMN: CORPORATE BONDS ARE AN OVERLOOKED BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which market do you believe?
</P>
<P>
   A look at the U.S. equity market shows a generally positive
picture. Valuations are high, and indexes of major stocks are near
record levels. Clearly, productivity and profits are expected to
stay high for the indefinite future.
</P>
<P>
   But in the credit markets, the outlook appears much bleaker.
There, money is becoming harder to find, and the price is
expensive. Lower-quality borrowers always have to pay more than
safe ones, but this year the spreads have widened significantly.
That would be expected if people feared a recession, but then one
would also expect to see the stock market doing much worse than it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation for this split is simple supply and
demand. The government is buying back Treasury bonds, so yields on
those securities may have been pushed lower than they otherwise
would be. But companies are borrowing at a rapid pace even though
investors are not particularly interested in buying bonds, and that
is driving up yields. Money has been coming out of junk bond mutual
funds this year, while it has poured into stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those bonds have been sold to foreign investors, who
these days are buying about a third of the corporate debt issued.
Bob Prince, the research director at Bridgewater Associates, a
money management firm, argues that higher rates have been needed to
lure overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the widening spreads meant that borrowers paid
more, but credit to companies that willing to pay the tab did not
really seem restricted. The banks have been willing lenders, but
there are now scattered signs that they are growing more cautious.
Since late last year, more and more banks have been telling the
Federal Reserve that they are tightening credit standards. The
default rate on junk bonds has been creeping up, even as the
economy hums along with rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   This fall may prove to be the testing time for capital markets.
Wall Street is gearing up for another big dose of initial public
offerings, and Europeans _ who have provided a lot of the capital
to finance U.S. markets _ need to raise a lot of money to finance
wireless telephone licenses that have fetched amazing bids at
government auctions in Europe. If investors don't put up enough
capital, stocks could suffer far more than bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, something can be said for buying what others
don't want. Just now, that is debt. Corporate bonds won't do well
if the economy goes belly up, and they will not perform as well as
stocks if corporate profits keep booming for years and years. But
within that range of economic outcomes is a middle ground that
favors bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Fridson, Merrill Lynch's junk bond guru, reports that the
spreads of junk bond yields over Treasuries are now far higher than
his economic model would forecast _ higher, in fact, than at any
time in the past save for a brief period in 1998-99 after the
Russian default and Asian crisis, when investors feared a worldwide
recession. Fridson adds, however, that he sees nothing on the
horizon that would produce a sharp narrowing of spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, the Bridgewater analyst, calculates that the divergence
between the pricing of stocks and of corporate bonds ``is near a
40-year high'' because the bond market has priced in plenty of risk
of economic disappointment while the stock market sees little risk.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: Corporate bonds are a better buy than
stocks.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being a ``compassionate conservative.'' Or at
least it shouldn't be easy. Some critics believe that the term is
oxymoronic. (Oxymoron: ``A phrase in which two words of
contradictory meaning are used together for special effect, for
example, 'wise fool' or 'legal murder.''') But this is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently contradictory about the concepts of
``compassionate'' and ``conservative.'' In theory, one can be both
_ even if, like ``black Republican,'' actual living specimens are
more likely to be found on public display than in natural
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics think that a ``compassionate conservative'' is at
most the back half of an oxymoron. But this also is unfair. You
don't have to be dimwitted to be a compassionate conservative. The
question is whether it helps.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fitzgerald thought the opposite. He famously wrote, ``The
test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two
opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the
ability to function.'' If Fitzgerald was right, the fact that
George W. Bush goes around calling himself a compassionate
conservative means that either George W. is a first-rate intellect
or ``compassionate'' and ``conservative'' do not qualify as
opposing ideas. Do you doubt the answer?
</P>
<P>
   If a person is both sincerely compassionate and sincerely
conservative, though, the issue is what that person does about it.
Here is where the mental challenge starts _ especially if that
person is a candidate for president of the United States. The
contradiction Bush faces in running as a ``compassionate
conservative'' is between the idea that the leader of the national
government can solve all sorts of social problems and the idea that
the national government is a contemptible institution that
invariably does more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a problem for traditional, non-compassionate
conservatives. They don't like the government, and they don't want
it to take on any ambitious social projects. Nor is it a problem,
in theory, for a compassionate conservative governor (with no
higher ambitions). He or she can advocate government activism at a
sub-national level. And of course it is not a problem for liberals,
who favor government activism and don't simultaneously object to
government.
</P>
<P>
   As a compassionate conservative running for president, Bush
spends his days bemoaning terrible national problems, agreeing with
everybody's complaints about the failure of Washington to address
their particular grievances, condemning the current national
administration for refusing to take action, promising great
flurries of action _ and gushers of money _ when he gets the keys
himself, setting goals and making promises about all the wonders he
will be able to achieve, and adding that he will get the horrible
federal government off our backs.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is the official Bush campaign summary of his
education policy:
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush will reform the nation's public schools. ... He
will close the achievement gap, set high standards, promote
character education, and ensure school safety. States will be
offered freedom from federal regulation, but will be held
accountable for results. Performance will be measured annually, and
parents will be empowered with information and choices.
</P>
<P>
   Swell. But if education is properly a function of lower levels
of government, why should it be the centerpiece of a campaign for
president? And why is the national Clinton-Gore administration at
fault for an alleged ``seven years of stagnancy?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if education is our No. 1 national issue,
what is wrong with the national government enforcing a national
policy about it? Especially if we've gone to the trouble of
electing a president who claims to have many of the right answers.
And if the great tradition of local control has resulted in
catastrophe, why is that an argument for the sanctity of local
control?
</P>
<P>
   If the federal government has no business imposing a national
policy for education, what business does it have spending billions
of taxpayers' dollars on education? Bush proposes more billions
every day. What is the point of sending that money to Washington
and then sending it back? On the other hand, if the federal
government takes the money but only gives it back if you do what it
wants, how is that different from imposing a national policy?
</P>
<P>
   Bush promises to liberate local schools from burdensome federal
regulation and also to require this, that, or the other in order to
get federal money. Of course, local school systems are free in
theory to turn down the money, but Bush's promise to ``reform the
nation's schools'' assumes they won't turn it down, which is a safe
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a safe assumption that Bush's mind (sometimes
referred to as his ``advisers'') has not been troubled by questions
like this. Similar questions arise, or ought to, about
``compassionate conservative'' policies that try to have it both
ways about big government by working through the private sector.
W.'s sleep has probably not been disturbed by these questions
either.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread suspicion that this man may be a dim bulb really
lets Bush off too easily. It's not that he is incapable of thinking
through the apparent contradictions in his own alleged core
philosophy. It's that he can't be bothered. He'd rather just hold
two opposing ideas in his mind at the same time. He turns out to be
remarkably good at it. Maybe two ideas aren't that much harder than
one, if you're starting from scratch.

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 2 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   New England (0-1) vs. Jets (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   These teams meet for the fourth straight season in a prime-time
game, this one on Monday night, when both teams' fans and peers
will get an up-close look at the continued rivalry. It runs deep,
from management to coaches to players. The Patriots seek to heal
their offense. It was squashed last week vs. Tampa Bay and the
offensive line, in particular, was tossed around by the Buccaneers.
The Jets feel good, rightly so, about winning on the road, at Green
Bay, and about protecting their lead in the closing seconds. The
matchup of the Patriots' defense against the Jets' offense decides
this game. Give the Patriots' defense the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Patriots, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-1) vs. Cincinnati (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   A brand new stadium will be christened, a stadium named after
the team's founder, Paul Brown. It is a beauty. It sparkles in
downtown Cincinnati and is nestled near the Ohio River. And the
Bengals get to play their longtime rival, their Ohio brethren, the
Browns, in the first-ever game there. Watch quarterback Akili Smith
to rookie receiver Peter Warrick. This is the start of something
special.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Bengals, 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (1-0) vs. Baltimore (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Tony Banks is 7-4 as the Ravens' starter and his
team has won five of its last six games. They are 7-0 when back
Priest Holmes rushes for 100 or more yards. Ravens' receiver Quadry
Ismail has produced four 100-yard receiving game in his last 6
games. How does a guy get faster as he gets older? Actually, it's
that the Ravens utilize Ismail and feature him, as opposed to him
being a complementary player as he was in Minnesota. Baltimore can
produce a 2-0 record for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Ravens, 26-24.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (0-1) vs. Tennessee (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Against Buffalo, The Titans are a strong team, but they have a
weakness _ not enough big plays downfield. Nearly everything the
Titans get on offense comes in a grinding running game and in its
short passing game. Receiver Carl Pickens is supposed to help free
this offense. Playing against Kansas City instead of Buffalo will
help. The Chiefs allowed 386 yards of offense in losing to
Indianapolis last Sunday. Tennessee might not match that but should
get plenty of yardage in this victory.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Titans, 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (0-1) vs. Tampa Bay (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown threw for 290 yards and two touchdowns against the
Vikings but surprisingly ran 10 times for 87 yards and a touchdown.
For the Bears to reach the playoffs, however, it will be with
McNown's arm instead of his legs. Same way, if he is to beat Tampa
Bay, but that does not look likely. Tampa Bay has not allowed
Chicago to score 20 points in their last 8 meetings. It has not
allowed Chicago to score an offensive touchdown in the last 10
quarters they have played against each other. And Tampa Bay has
beaten Chicago in five straight meetings. Make it six. Prediction:
Buccaneers, 23-6.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (1-0) vs. Philadelphia (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Both the Giants and Eagles are off to fast starts on the ground.
The Giants' leader is Tiki Barber, who is averaging 11.1 yards per
carry. Philadelphia's leader is Duece Staley, who gained 201
rushing yards vs. Dallas. In beating Dallas, Philadelphia not only
scored 41 points on the road but also exuded excitement and
confidence. If both teams' running attacks are neutralized, the
game will come down to the arms of Philadelphia quarterback Donovon
McNabb and Giants' quarterback Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Giants, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (0-1) vs. Buffalo (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay offense sank against the Jets and now plays the
defense that led the entire league a season ago. That is a bad
combination. Brett Favre says he is ready to throw it short and
long against Buffalo, that his arm is still sore, but sound. By the
time the Buffalo defense is finished chasing and hitting him, Favre
will have more pain than simply in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Bills, 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (1-0) vs. Minnesota (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   The key attraction here is the Miami defense and cornerbacks
Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison against Vikings receivers Randy
Moss and Cris Carter. Intriguing, too, is the matchup of Miami's
stout defensive front against Minnesota's big offensive line and
speedy back Robert Smith. But Miami must also focus on offense.
Against Seattle, quarterback Jay Fiedler made enough good plays and
running back Lamar Smith (27 carries, 145 rushing yards) ran
rampant on natural grass. Can both accomplish that against
Minnesota on artificial turf inside a dome? Minnesota's offense
will do enough, but the Vikings win this game on defense with
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Vikings, 21-6.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (1-0) vs. Indianapolis (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Since the Raiders have never played in the RCA Dome, they are in
for a treat. Well, more like a scare _ because the fans there whoop
it up, making it nearly impossible for visitors to hear the signal
calls. Just as scary is the Colts' offense, which is shifty and
speedy at receiver (Marvin Harrison), cool and calm at quarterback
(Peyton Manning) and bullish yet stylish at tailback (Edgerrin
James).
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Colts, 26-17.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (1-0) vs. Seattle (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks performed miserably against Miami last week and
quarterback Jon Kitna was the focal point, throwing four
interceptions and fumbling. Mike Holmgren, Seattle's coach,
believes Kitna can only improve. Seattle's defense possesses the
personnel to run with the Rams. That's the start in the making of
an upset. And Seattle will be focused, and prepared to answer all
the critics after their listless opening game. And after all of
that drama against Denver on Monday night, the Rams are ripe for an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Seahawks, 30-28.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (0-1) vs. San Francisco (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   These teams let the ball fly when they meet. Last year, there
were 15 touchdowns scored in their two games and 8 of them were for
20 or more yards. San Francisco has won seven consecutive home
openers but figures to struggle with the Panthers. Panthers back
Tim Biakabutuka averaged 5.9 yards per carry last week against
Washington and can match that against the 49ers' defense. Though
49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia currently leads the league with three
touchdown passes, look for Panthers' quarterback Steve Beuerlein to
make the bigger, longer, more decisive throws.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Panthers, 28-20.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (1-0) vs. Detroit (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are headed in positive directions. Washington
continues to mesh a galaxy of stars; Detroit hopes to get its main
man back _ quarterback Charlie Batch. He has made a speedy recovery
from a knee injury sustained during the preseason and is expected
to play on Sunday. That makes the game more fun for Detroit. Watch
Detroit kick returner Desmond Howard. He used to be a Redskin, but
they gave up on him; he will be ready for Washington. The
difference in this game is quarterback Brad Johnson against a
suspect secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Redskins, 27-23.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (1-0) vs. Denver (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves makes his return to Mile High Stadium. Reeves coached
the Broncos from 1981 through 1992. Good thing he has receiver
Shawn Jefferson on his side. Jefferson gained a career-high 148
yards against the Rams Monday night. That is because New England
always tried to balance him with receiver Terry Glenn, whereas the
Falcons will let him fly. Jefferson will make a mark in this game,
too. But not as much as the Broncos' balanced attack on the ground
and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Broncos, 30-24.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (0-1) vs. San Diego (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams fought hard in their losses last week _ the Saints by
4 points to Detroit and the Chargers by 3 points to the Raiders _
but both also showed that they are short in manpower. Neither is
playoff-bound. Neither has enough speed. Neither starting
quarterback (Jeff Blake for New Orleans, Ryan Leaf for San Diego)
is consistent. Neither defense sacks the quarterback enough.
Neither makes enough big plays. They deserve each other.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Chargers, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (0-1) vs. Arizona (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dallas gained 167 yards and allowed 425 against
Philadelphia last week. And quarterback Jake Plummer's passing
yardage (318) was nearly twice as much as Dallas' total offense.
Troy Aikman sits this one out, recovering from a concussion.
Randall Cunningham will start and will give the Dallas offense a
different look, one with more mobility and with more deep passing
strikes. There is no way the Cardinals should lose this game. They
are at home, have played well against Dallas in recent seasons and
don't have to face Aikman or new receiver Joe Galloway, out for the
year with to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Cardinals, 27-21.

&HT;     COSTS OF NEW MILITARY TRAINER PLANE FLY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's new trainer aircraft is expected to
shoot past its estimated cost by some $753 million, 19 percent
above its original price tag, with the U.S. taxpayer footing most
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The initial cost for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System
(JPATS) had been $3.9 billion for a fleet of 740 propeller-powered
aircraft with two seats, one for the student pilot and the other
for an instructor. But according to internal Pentagon budget
documents, the price is expected to surge as manufacturer Raytheon
Aircraft Co., of Wichita, Kans., grapples with design snafus,
increased material costs and poor prospects for foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   The cost growth in the program has raised eyebrows in the
Pentagon where JPATS is competing for scarce funding against such
high-priority weapons as the Air Force F-22 fighter and the Navy
F/A-18 Super Hornet jet.
</P>
<P>
   The cost spike is all the more disconcerting for Pentagon
officials because JPATS had been designated by the military as a
model for cost-effective purchasing in a culture that is notorious
for cost-overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kaminski, then the Pentagon's top procurement officials,
told Congress in 1997 that purchasing programs like JPATS would
prove that military items could be acquired faster and cheaper
through the use of commercial products and commercial practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and Navy plan to use the JPATS aircraft to train
student pilots in the fundamentals of flying. The JPATS aircraft
would replace the Air Force's T-37B and the Navy's T-34C primary
trainer aircraft. Air Force student pilots will begin training on
the plane next June while the Navy is scheduled to begin training
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Air Force is flying 11 JPATS aircraft from
Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio. The 11 represent the first
of 454 airplanes that the service hopes to buy. The Navy plans to
buy 328 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminski's enthusiasm was based on the fact that JPATS was
designed as a cousin of an existing aircraft _ the Swiss-made
Pilatus PC-9 commercial aircraft _ and therefore would require only
limited modifications. Those modifications include improved
ejection seats, a pressurized cockpit, an elevated rear instructor
seat, and flexibility to accommodate a wider range of male and
female pilots. The plane also boasts design improvements to protect
against ``birdstrikes'' where birds hit the propeller blades,
causing the plane to stall.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan estimated the cost per aircraft at about $5
million. Now, however, estimates by the Air Force and civilians in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense put the cost at about $6
million each. Some Pentagon officials believe that the aircraft
will cost up to $6.5 million each. The price includes the cost of
ground-based simulators as well.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, an Air Force F-16 fighter jet costs about $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   The JPATS cost overrun isn't among the military's worst
financial miscalculations. For example, the Pentagon estimates that
production costs alone for the Air Force F-22 jet will balloon by
some $8 billion, or 20 percent, over its $37 billion cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy A-12 attack jet was canceled for incurring over $1
billion in projected overruns. And a new Army and Marine Corps
howitzer is overrunning its $31 million development budget by $6.6
million, a 21 percent boost.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the JPATS cost growth, about $230 million, reflects the
fact that the armed services have decided to buy 41 more aircraft.
In addition, the military has opted to stretch out the program by
buying fewer of the planes annually over a longer period, creating
inefficiencies on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   But blame for the remainder of the overrun on JPATS _ about $525
million worth and possibly more _ is being laid at the feet of
Raytheon and higher manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Col. Ronald Joseph, the JPATS program manager, said
that ``the aviation market is booming and commercial costs are
increasing. There are some inefficiencies from the company. All the
things combined over a period of time add up to more program
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who declined to discuss how much more the program will
cost the Pentagon, said the military is girding for a
``correction'' in the price, meaning that the Pentagon will end up
paying more.
</P>
<P>
   David Riemer, Raytheon Aircraft's vice president for government
business, blamed the lack of foreign sales for the higher cost of
each airplane. ``When we forecast the aircraft's price to the U.S.
government, we had a significant volume of (projected)
international sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those sales haven't materialized due to several factors: a
competitive trainer market and lingering economic problems in Asia
and Latin America that squelched orders from those regions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's rosy assumption was that initial orders from other
countries for the aircraft would top 200 aircraft. But at present,
only 69 are on order: 45 planes from Greece and 24 from Canada. And
prospects don't look that good for many more in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shop floor is not as efficient, indirect expenses aren't
spread over as many airplanes,'' Riemer explained.
</P>
<P>
   One Air Force official who asked not to be named said that some
in the Pentagon are questioning whether the military should pay for
the company's mistake in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why we should have to eat their pricing problem,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also has had difficulty modifying the commercial
aircraft design for military use. For example, when test pilots
flew the plane in steep dives or tight turns, the plane's propeller
blade on the Pratt &AMP; Whitney Canada_manufactuered engine would bend
and hit part of the aircraft. This sparked a six-month delay in the
project as engineers sought to correct the problem. Joseph said
that problem has been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the problem of sauna conditions in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the Pentagon's top weapons tester,
``cockpit temperatures near 100 degrees farenheight have been
recorded'' in the JPATS, a situation that prevents the plane from
being used during warm days.
</P>
<P>
   These design setbacks will force Raytheon to absorb at least $36
million in overruns and possibly more.

   WASHINGTON _ America's main space vehicle for the next decade or
two, or longer, will likely be about 123 feet long. It will have a
tall tail and stubby wings, and will use a massive external fuel
tank and twin booster rockets to help it get into space.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably look a lot like the space shuttle, in other
words. That's because it may very well be the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASA and aerospace industry companies have spent years
thinking about a cheaper, less complicated alternative to the
shuttle, no successor is ready to go just yet. For at least the
next dozen years, and maybe long after that, NASA will continue to
rely on a vehicle that had its origin in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people feel the shuttle will be operating for at
least the next two decades,'' said Jack King, spokesman for United
Space Alliance, the private consortium that now handles shuttle
launch preparation and maintenance for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of our orbiters is built for at least 100 flights,
and we're only about a quarter of the way through the lifetime,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Discovery returns from a flight scheduled for
October (the 100th flight for the shuttle program), it will be the
veteran among the four-vehicle fleet with 28 flights. Endeavour,
the newest shuttle, which replaced Challenger after it was
destroyed in a 1986 explosion, has flown only 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officially plans to fly the shuttle fleet through at least
2012, using it to build the International Space Station through
2006 and help maintain it after that.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Atlantis is slated to lift off Friday for the
station, to install equipment and supplies for the first residents,
who are scheduled to move in in November.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, who analyzes space and defense issues for the
Federation of American Scientists, said NASA will fly the shuttle
``until the next time it blows up. I think that's the real
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttles flying today have progressed since the Columbia
orbiter first took to space in 1981. NASA has tinkered with shuttle
hardware all along as new orbiters were built, but the Challenger
explosion resulted in hundreds of changes across the fleet to
increase safety, from redesigned rocket boosters to more powerful
flight control computers.
</P>
<P>
   More improvements are on the way, some $2.2 billion worth to
both the shuttles and the ground support systems. NASA will spend
the next five years building a stronger external tank, improving
the shuttles' engines to allow them to detect problems before they
happen, and moving to a ``smart cockpit'' that will automate more
tasks now handled by astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The planned improvements may be the largest modification ever
for the shuttle fleet, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said in a report released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said the improvements may be a little too optimistic,
and that NASA may not be able to get them done on time and within
budget. NASA needs to focus on getting them done by 2005 if it's
serious about moving to another vehicle by 2012, NASA's current
plan, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., is in charge
of the fourth major overhaul of the shuttle engines, one of the
major upgrades in the works. According to NASA, the shuttles'
engines operate at greater temperature and pressure extremes than
do any other machines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the planned changes is called the Advanced Health
Monitoring System, which uses an optical and vibration system to
track engine performance. If it detects trouble, it can shut an
engine down before the problem gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We currently use temperature to determine if there's a
problem, but a better way to do that is to monitor vibration,''
said Randy Humphries Jr., the propulsion upgrades manager for the
shuttle at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The optical system analyzes the plume coming out of the engines
to see if there's a problem such as engine parts breaking loose,
Humphries said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall workers are also moving to a new welding system for the
external tank that will make it stronger, and changes to the rocket
boosters to make their solid fuel less prone to cracking during
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA plans to fly the shuttle to at least 2010, 2012,''
Humphries said. ``We have to do the supportability items to keep it
flying the next 10 or 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Space Flight Center is also in charge of managing the
X-33 program, which is intended to lead to a commercially built
vehicle called VentureStar that could one day perform many tasks
handled by the shuttle or even replace it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   But that program's development has been more of a challenge than
NASA and lead contractor Lockheed Martin expected. Manufacturing
delays have put its future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had hoped to settle on a shuttle successor by 2005, with
the idea it would be ready to fly about five years later. Pike said
that date is ``vaporware,'' a computer industry term for software
or hardware that is announced but arrives late or never.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had been cutting back on the resources it was spending on
the shuttle after it handed over launch preparation and maintenance
work to United Space Alliance a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That cutback has been reversing after reviews showed that NASA
workers in shuttle-related safety and upgrade jobs and oversight
jobs were being overstressed and overworked.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, in fact, the shuttle is going to be
busier than ever as it makes more than three dozen flights to build
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   King said even if VentureStar does eventually show up, it won't
necessarily put the shuttle out of business. The shuttle was
designed as a do-everything workhorse, and VentureStar initially
will probably be just a cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle allows astronauts to float in space and wrangle with
wayward satellites or space telescopes that need updating.
VentureStar probably won't allow that, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the capabilities that the space shuttle has in
many areas, such as assembly and disassembly in orbit,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has good reasons to want to move away from the shuttle.
It's a big, complex, expensive vehicle. In fact, NASA touts it as
being the most complex machine ever built.
</P>
<P>
   It has more than 2.5 million parts, including 230 miles of wire
and more than 27,000 insulating tiles and thermal blankets to
protect it from the heat of re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   All that means it's expensive to fly. NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin has repeatedly complained that the high cost of flying
payloads to space, some $10,000 per pound, is stifling progress in
space flight.
</P>
<P>
   Such a complex vehicle also requires a horde of technicians to
keep it ready. King said United Space Alliance has 3,850 workers
who process the shuttle after each flight and get it ready for the
next one. According to the GAO, that requires 1.2 million separate
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not fly very often, it's very expensive and is of
uncertain reliability,'' said Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists. ``On the other hand, we have two decades of experience
with the shuttle and it's a known quantity.''

POSTAL SERVICE AND FEDEX CONSIDER FORMING PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service and FedEx Corp. are discussing a
partnership that would help the service increase revenue while
giving FedEx a low-cost way to reach millions of residential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Postmaster General William Henderson said Thursday that
executives from both organizations had been meeting in Washington
and Memphis, where FedEx is based, and that the outline of a deal
could be ready to be presented to the service's 11-member board as
early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic that we can reach some agreement,'' he said.
``We think there are big opportunities for the Postal Service and
FedEx.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx also confirmed that the two sides were talking, but a
spokesman declined to provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said that the alliance could enable the Postal Service
to take advantage of FedEx's extensive air network while letting
FedEx piggyback on the Postal Service's network of mail carriers.
For example, mail carriers could pick up returns for FedEx's
catalog clients on their regular rounds, saving FedEx the expense
of having to visit thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership between the post office and FedEx could be a blow
to United Parcel Service, which is the industry leader, delivering
12 million packages a day. FedEx delivers 3.3 million shipments a
day. It dominates the overnight segment of the market and has been
trying to expand its less speedy ground-delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson said that the post office would not make an
exclusive agreement with FedEx on any service accept a contract to
provide air transportation. ``In terms of access or use of the
postal service or leveraging our assets, we are open to negotiating
with anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may blunt some of the opposition to a deal but also make it
less attractive for FedEx. ``If they are saying, `We would like to
strike a deal with FedEx, UPS, DHL and anybody else who is
interested,' said Norman Black, a UPS spokesman, ``yes, we would
seriously look at what they are proposing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that it did not appear that that was what the Postal
Service was doing based on reports of the talks, which appeared
Thursday in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. ``You
are left with the impression that they would use taxpayer-paid
employees to favor one competitor over another,'' Black said. ``And
we don't believe that Congress and the United States Postal Rate
Commission would find that proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an $800 million shortfall in revenue, the post office
is expected to lose $300 million in the fiscal year ending this
month, its first loss since 1994. During the heavy mailing seasons
each fall and winter, the service makes substantial profits that
are whittled away when mail volume drops in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said that he was looking for ways to increase revenue
and offset the fixed costs of the Postal Service's vast delivery
network by, in effect, renting it out to companies like FedEx.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of FedEx fell 45 cents Thursday, to $39.82, on the New
York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    Bush trailing Gore in national poll, but still strong in Texas
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It all looked so effortless just a few short weeks
ago. Now, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, down in the polls and plagued
by reports of gaffes and missteps, is taking criticism from within
his own party as he struggles to regain his balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters/Zogby national poll of 1,001 likely voters released
Thursday had Democratic nominee Vice President Al Gore leading Bush
46 percent to 40 percent. Adjusted for the margin of error of 3
percentage points, Zogby said the poll shows Gore with a ``slight
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is running especially well among independents,
African-Americans, Hispanics and other key Democratic groups, the
latest evidence that he has secured his once-elusive base. He
gained startling ground among women, who traditionally vote
Democratic in large numbers but have, until now, eluded Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And a new Texas Poll shows that although Bush, the Republican
nominee, still holds a formidable lead in his home state, it has
eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bush has had a dismal few weeks but has kept it
close because the swing groups are close,'' Zogby said. ``The swing
groups are independents, where Gore leads, parents and voters who
live in $25,000 to $50,000 households. No one's won the presidency
without winning that group, going back to '72. And the two are in a
dead heat among those two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The Summer 2000 Texas Poll released today shows Bush still
enjoying a generous lead in the state _ 53 percent to 30 percent _
but Bush's standing is down from June, when he led 57 percent to 24
percent. The poll of 1,000 registered voters was conducted Aug.
7-30 and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials ignored the tightening Texas numbers,
voicing confidence despite the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whopping 23 point lead shows once again that Texas is
solid George W. Bush country,'' spokesman Ray Sullivan said. ``As
we saw in the race against Ann Richards in 1994 and in the
primaries this year, George W. Bush runs strongest as the
challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly and privately, though, Republicans are expressing
concern. On Thursday, conservative columnist Robert D. Novak,
advising from the nation's op-ed pages, wrote, ``George W. Bush
needs to change the atmosphere to keep panicky backers from heading
for the high grass.'' He urged Bush to seek a, ``face-to-face
confrontation,'' with Gore before the Olympics steals away already
scant voter attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, one GOP adviser said the campaign has got to
marshal more forces to give Bush - who dubbed himself, ``the
underdog'' Thursday - much-needed support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole theme of the national convention was, 'Read the
polls. We're going to win,' `` the adviser said. `` There was no
serious discourse on the agenda and how to sell the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He revived a familiar criticism, that Bush's tight-knit Austin
team _ strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and
communications director Karen Hughes _ must branch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are all the governors? Where's the calvary that's
supposed to be coming over the hill? Poor Bush is out there all
alone defending himself,'' he said. ``I think the campaign needs to
understand this is a big deal. You need 15 or 20 guys out there
every day pushing your message. Traditionally, campaigns expand the
tent after you win the nomination and you expand it again after
your party convention,'' he said. ``This Austin one's stayed a pup
tent.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent GOP Bush supporter circulated a three-page e-mail
lambasting the campaign for ads attacking Gore, failing to reach
out effectively to black voters and muzzling running mate Dick
Cheney, whose Halliburton stock options presented public relations
problems for the campaign for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's a loser,'' the Republican said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's post- convention bounce has been more sustained than the
Bush team anticipated. Some insiders are wary of a Republican ad
poking fun at Gore for his appearance at a Buddhist temple and they
say Bush's use of a vulgarity to describe a New York Times reporter
_ picked up by microphone at a recent campaign appearance _ made
him look like an amateur at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush's efforts to keep his message front and center
have been eclipsed by his refusal to agree to all the debates set
by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the bipartisan group
established to avoid just such posturing. He has so far not
committed to all three scheduled metes, saying instead that he will
debate Gore on ``Larry King Live'' and on NBC's, ``Meet the
Press,'' and in one commission debate.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby called the debate over the debates, ``preposterous,'' and
added: ``Every day he's focusing on it he looks like a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for
the Social Sciences at Dartmouth College, said candidates
routinely, ``play games about format,'' but that Bush can ill
afford them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bush's case I think it's a little more problematic because
of perceptions among political elites that he's not going to be
good debater, that Al Gore is going to make hamburger out of him,
that it makes him look fearful,'' she said. ``That's kind of
insider baseball stuff. If, in the end he ends up debating, most
voters will forget how he got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, campaign manager of former Sen. Bob Dole's 1996
White House bid, said there's plenty of time for Bush to recover.
He called Bush's Medicare and prescription drug plans steps in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a very substantive campaign on paper,'' Reed said.
``The convention speech was great. They just need to go back to the
basics of blocking and tackling when it comes to message delivery
nationally.''

QWEST TO CUT 12,800 JOBS AND INCREASE CAPITAL SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Qwest Communications, a fast-growing provider of
telecommunications services, said Thursday that it would cut nearly
13,000 jobs and increase capital spending in an effort to heighten
efficiency after its $44 billion acquisition of U S West.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Denver, will lay off 11,000 staff
employees, more than 15 percent of its work force, and 1,800
contractors, although it was not clear which geographic regions
would be hardest hit by the layoffs. The cuts will mainly affect
nonunion and middle-management positions, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's capital expenditures will amount to $9 billion this year
and $9.5 billion in 2001, figures that surpass Wall Street
estimates by as much as $1.5 billion. The company expects revenue
of $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion this year and $21.3 billion to
$21.7 billion next year. The revenue estimates are only marginally
better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Though investors are usually enamored of companies that trim
their work forces to cut costs, traders were apparently shaken by
concern that Qwest's unexpected growth in capital spending would
not correspond to a healthy increase in cash flow. The stock fell
$2.06, or 4 percent, to $49.44 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Qwest, which has largely focused on fast-growing
areas like Web-hosting and high-speed Internet access, had escaped
the malaise that has gripped investor sentiment in the
telecommunications industry in recent months because the company is
considered to have less exposure to the squeeze in revenue from
traditional long-distance operations.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, with 71,000 employees, operates a data and voice network
spanning more than 150 cities in the United States and Mexico. In
addition, the company gained about 25 million local phone service
customers in 14 states after buying U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the drop Thursday, Qwest shares have risen 13.4
percent this year, compared with declines of 42.4 percent in
WorldCom and 40 percent in AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qwest took the market by surprise with a barrage of
announcements that investors need time to analyze,'' said Brian
Hayward, who manages the $3.6 billion Invesco Telecommunications
Fund in Denver. ``We're in wait-and-see mode, where the best stock
in its peer group is coming under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the combination of Qwest, a company that is at the
forefront of the changes washing over the telecommunications
industry, with U S West, a slower-growing company that was
considered something of a laggard even when compared with its Baby
Bell counterparts, was not expected to be completed without
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digesting U S West is not a simple task,'' said Jeffrey Kagan,
an independent telecommunications analyst. ``Qwest is still intent
on being disruptive to its competitors.''

&HT;     BUCHANAN ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK RIVAL'S CLAIM TO $12.6 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reform Party hopeful Patrick Buchanan announced
Thursday that he will try to block the effort of his rival, John
Hagelin, to win $12.6 million in federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he will file a lawsuit challenging Hagelin's claim
to be the party's nominee in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission _ which will decide who gets the
money _ requires that any candidate applying for the funds must be
on the ballot in at least 10 states as the party's nominee.
Buchanan, a former Republican, submitted his list of states on Aug.
25 while Hagelin, a physicist from Fairfield, Iowa, who is also the
presidential candidate for the Natural Law Party, turned in his
list last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan officials disputed four of Hagelin's states _
Arizona, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming _ saying they already had
certified Buchanan as the party nominee. In addition, they said, a
fifth state, Tennessee, has agreed to put both candidates on the
ballot, which would make it ineligible for FEC consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who heads her brother's campaign, said Thursday
that ``John Hagelin is a fraud scheming to deceive the FEC.'' She
charged that he ``has no claim, no standing, and no right to the
Reform Party's election funds.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the decision Wednesday by Wyoming's secretary of
state that Patrick Buchanan will be on the ballot there as the
Reform Party's candidate. Hagelin is to appear under the Natural
Law Party banner, disqualifying him from appearing on another part
of the ballot there.
</P>
<P>
   The other six states claimed by Hagelin are Colorado, Illinois,
New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon and Washington. Hagelin spokesman Robert
Roth said he was ``confident that the courts and the FEC will
ultimately decide in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed by Buchanan claim he has the Reform Party ballot
line in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland, New Jersey, New
Mexico, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   FEC officials could not be reached for comment, but a public
hearing on the case is scheduled for Tuesday, with a decision
expected within a few days. However, the loser may ask for another
hearing, which would delay a final decision by 15 days. The hearing
is expected to focus on whether both men followed the Reform
Party's nominating rules during its convention in Long Beach,
Calif., last month. Roth said Hagelin attorneys will offer evidence
of massive vote fraud by Buchanan. They will claim that he sent
about 500,000 primary ballots to people on his Republican donor
list, asking them to vote for him in the Reform Party's mail-in
primary and that the vast majority of these people did not request
the ballots, which party rules require.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that a random check of 14 Buchanan primary voters in
Iowa found that 12 had not asked for the ballots. If FEC officials
look carefully into the matter, Roth said, ``there is no way they
could give the money to Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan officials deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Reform Party Convention, Buchanan won 49,529 votes while
Hagelin got 28,539. At a rump convention Hagelin won.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hagelin filed a claim in a California Superior Court
in Long Beach asking a judge to declare him the sole nominee for
that state's Reform Party. The action came one day after Buchanan
filed an identical claim.
</P>
<P>
   The filings represent the first time that a court has been asked
to decide which candidate will represent the party for a particular
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision in the California could be extremely important in
swaying other states and perhaps even the FEC,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing in that case is scheduled to begin Wednesday with a
decision expected within a week.The Reform Party's nominee is
entitled to the federal money because Ross Perot, the movement's
candidate in 1996, received 8 percent of the presidential vote,
exceeding the commission's 5 percent requirement.

&HT;     REPUBLICANS FAIL TO OVERRIDE ESTATE TAX VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House failed Thursday to override President
Clinton's veto of the estate tax repeal, giving Republicans what
they say is a potent political issue to use against Democrats on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The House 274-157 tally was 14 votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who call the levy the ``death tax,'' had proposed
phasing it out over 10 years. They say it hurts farmers and small
businesses, as well as people who died before they could do estate
planning, by forcing their survivors to liquidate to pay a tax rate
as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, only 47,500 estates, 2 percent of the total, paid
the tax, and most of the revenue came from estates worth more than
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appeared pleased despite the failure to check
Clinton's Aug. 31 veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us build the case for the campaign,'' House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said after the vote. ``The American people
are going to see that the Democrats want to keep this money in
Washington. They don't want to give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill in June with a veto-proof margin of
279 to 136, including 65 Democrats. On Thursday, only 53 Democrats
joined 220 Republicans and one independent in favor of the
override.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, voting 59 to 39, approved the repeal in July.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Democrats have offered a more modest
proposal to reduce estate taxes for estates of less than $4
million, but Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., quickly dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair
and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hour-long debate before the vote, Democrats said the
GOP bill was a gift to rich families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have so many spent so much time to give so much money to
so very few,'' said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., pleaded with Republicans to join
with Democrats to pass a more moderate estate tax bill.
``Republicans would rather have sound bites than sound tax
policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the repeal, drawing on the ``death tax''
moniker, fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No taxation without respiration,'' said Rep. J.D. Hayworth,
R-Ariz. ``Let's put this unfair death tax to death. It's unfair to
have to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., one of the 53 Democrats who
voted for the override, complained that ``America is literally
taxed from the womb to the tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sent the legislation to the White House on a red
tractor last month to illustrate their contention that it hurts
farm families.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed it with a farmer and self-described wealthy man
at his side, saying the bill was skewed to the wealthy and would
waste the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The current tax applies to estates worth more than $675,000,
rising to $1 million by 2006, and $1.3 million for a family-owned
farm or business.
</P>
<P>
   While only 2 percent of families pay the tax, which has a 55
percent top rate, Republicans say nobody should have to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional and White House estimates, the bill
would have cost $105 billion in the first 10 years, as the tax was
phased out, and then $750 billion in the decade after the repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said before the vote that Republican
leaders knew it would fail, but he said they relished the chance to
use the issue against Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are pure, raw politics that help us to play into the
presidential campaign and say we tried,'' LaHood said. ``The next
two weeks we're trying to stick it to Clinton and Gore and say to
our base `we tried.'''
</P>
<P>
   Family businesses can be protected from estate taxes by
purchasing life insurance, providing gifts to heirs, and by setting
up trusts. But supporters of the repeal said too few people make
plans before it is too late.

TRUCKERS' STRIKE SPREADS IN FRANCE AS FUEL SHORTAGES GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A strike begun three days ago by truckers who blockaded
fuel depots to protest spiraling fuel costs spread Friday as
workers from other sectors of the economy joined the
demonstrations, disrupting transportation systems throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, airline workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers and even the
owners of river barges and sightseeing boats that cruise the Seine
have now joined in the protest. Their actions, along with the
truckers' blockade, have combined to produce the growing fuel
shortages and varying degrees of inconvenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, for instance, farmers set fire to piles of tires on
train tracks, leading to havoc with train schedules in the area. In
the north, they blocked border posts between France and Belgium. In
other towns, private ambulance drivers used their vehicles to block
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Paris had largely been spared in the last few days. But Friday
hundreds of taxis poured into the city in a slow-moving column that
created a traffic jam that lasted hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the truckers' blockade of the country's fuel depots
has begun to be felt the pumps. France's three major oil companies
said that up to 80 percent of their stations were reporting
shortages. Some drivers also found it difficult to get fuel because
police officers were patrolling gas stations to make sure that
police, hospital and emergency service vehicles got the first
chance to buy the gas that was available. In other towns, officials
sought only to limit hoarding by putting a cap on the amount of
fuel that could be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has quickly become a huge political problem for Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, who on Wednesday broke off negotiations
with the truckers after two of the country's three major unions
refused to ratify an offer of a 15-cent reduction per liter in fuel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Jospin did not comment on the strike. But his
transportation minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, talked tough, saying,
``If we let things go on, that could break the process of growth
and development that's going on in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest began gathering steam on Sunday after a week in
which the government offered a series of financial measures to
fishermen, who had also blockaded the country's ports in August
because of rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the truckers believed that they would get relief in a
long-awaited package of tax cuts that Jospin's government unveiled
last week. But the government instead chose to use a budget surplus
from a booming economy in other ways. The plan included a cut in
the taxes on home heating oil, but not fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fuel has been rising even faster in Europe than in
the United States because of the decline in the value of the euro.
On top of that, fuel carries a government surcharge of more than 70
percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of diesel fuel in France has risen about 40 percent in
the last year. A gallon of diesel fuel costs about $2.84 here.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jospin's problem in negotiating with the truckers is
that even his latest offer has been sharply criticized by
environmentalists in his governing coalition. The Greens say his
concessions break earlier promises to continue to push France
toward use of rail traffic over more polluting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to blocking various border posts, farmers scuffled
with the authorities at the Channel Tunnel as they tried to block
freight trucks from boarding trains to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the European Union asked France to prove that it
was taking measures to ensure the free movement of goods and access
to its ports.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' blockades, set up at some 80 depots throughout the
country, were beginning to take a heavy toll in some areas. One
French newspaper reported that school cafeterias in the Vosges
region, in eastern France, faced shortages because food suppliers
ran out of gas for their delivery trucks. Some school bus routes
were shut down in the central city of Lyon. In other areas, rental
car agencies said they had to turn away customers because they
could not give them any gas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, leaders of the truckers union tried to blame
the government for backing out of the negotiations and urged that
they return to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reach a solution quickly,'' said Rene Petit, the
leader of the trucker's union. ``We simply must resume dialogue
with the authorities.''

   BRITISH INTEREST RATE UNCHANGED
</P>
<P>
   With signs that economic growth is easing, the Bank of England
left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent for the
seventh consecutive month. The decision had little impact on
foreign exchange markets, where the British pound has slipped by 6
percent against the dollar in the last three months. The bank's
decision coincided with data suggesting that car sales are falling,
a housing boom is cooling and both retail prices and wage increases
are slowing. The combination left inflation in July at an
annualized 2.2 percent, below the government's target of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERMARKET ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch supermarket retailer Royal Ahold NV is to expand its
operations in Spain with the purchase of the Superdiplo chain of
food and general merchandise stores for 1.2 billion euros ($1
billion) worth of shares. Once it is complete, the purchase will
add hundreds of stores to Ahold's operations in Spain and is
expected to generate sales of about 2 billion euros, Ahold said.
The company also will assume 153 million euros in Superdiplo debt.
At the news, Ahold's share prices lost as much as 5 percent of
their value on the Amsterdam stock exchange. The retailer is active
in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INVENSYS SHARES FALL
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Invensys PLC fell 36 percent, their largest drop since
the company was created through a merger 18 months ago, after the
company warned that first half profit would fall below last year's
levels. Invensys, a British industrial equipment maker, said it
would cut as many as 3,000 jobs in the United States and Mexico and
accelerate a reorganization plan. The cuts would be in addition to
1,000 jobs that are expected to be eliminated as a result of
Invensys' $747 million purchase of Baan NV, a Dutch software maker
that has been losing money. Invensys attributed the shortfall to a
drop in U.S. business, sluggish oil and gas spending and an
accounting change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   Abbey National PLC has agreed to buy Scottish Provident, an
Edinburgh-based life insurance company, for 1.8 billion pounds
(about $2.6 billion) in an effort to diversify as competition
erodes profits in its core mortgage lending business. The new
company will be the largest life insurer in Britain. Abbey National
said it expected the purchase to enhance earnings within the first
year, and to generate (PS)93 million in cost savings within two
years. The Scottish Provident brand will be retained. ``The
transaction delivers on our stated strategy of significantly
diversifying our business,'' said Ian Harley, Abbey National's
chief executive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELLULAR PHONE SPINOFF
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico said
that it would create a spinoff company called America Movil which
will undertake all of Telmex's foreign investments, principally in
Latin American cellular phone services. Telmex's cellular phone
subsidiary, Telcel, which controls 70 percent of the national
market, will become part of America Movil, which will take over
Telmex's existing wireless services in Brazil, Puerto Rico and
Guatemala. The Telmex president, Carlos Slim Domit, Latin America's
richest man, said that the separation would give his cell phone
businesses more independence and flexibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPANISH-LANGUAGE TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca, the world's second-largest Spanish-language
broadcaster, has joined with Pappas Telecasting of the United
States to create a new television network called Azteca America
Inc., which aims to capture 25 percent of the total U.S. television
market within five years. TV Azteca and Pappas, which will control
20 and 80 percent of the network, respectively, hope to reach 130
million Spanish-speaking viewers in North America by the start of
next year. Azteca America's principal competitor in the rapidly
growing Hispanic market in the United States is Univision, which is
part owned by the largest Spanish-language network in the world,
Televisa of Mexico. The majority of the new network's programming
will come from TV Azteca's Mexican studios although some shows will
be produced locally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMPERIAL BANK PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Canada's second-largest bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, reported third-quarter operating profit of 380 million
Canadian dollars ($256 million), or 93 Canadian cents a share,
higher than the 86 cents consensus forecast by analysts surveyed by
FirstCall/Thomson Financial. With after-tax gains from selling a
portion of its investment in Global Crossing Ltd., a
telecommunications company, and some real estate assets, the bank's
total profit was 601 million Canadian dollars ($406 million). Like
most other big Canadian banks, CIBC's profit for the quarter ended
July 31 was higher than a year earlier, but lower than in the
previous quarter because of weaker financial markets.

KOPPEL SIGNS DEAL TO CONTINUE ON `NIGHTLINE' FOR 5 MORE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ted Koppel, the anchor of ABC News' ``Nightline''
since it made its debut in 1980, has agreed to stay with the
program for the next five years, though he will appear as the
anchor less frequently, executives announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a five-year contract with ABC News that he signed
Thursday, Koppel will be the anchor three nights a week starting in
January. He had previously been under contract to anchor the
program, which is shown Mondays through Fridays at 11:35 p.m., four
nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel has also agreed to be the host of six special, weeklong
``Nightline'' series a year and, when important news breaks, to
anchor prime-time editions of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightline'' has been a strong ratings performer for two
decades, though it has shown some weakness recently. With an
average of 4.4 million people tuning in each night, its audience is
down about 9 percent compared with this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Koppel, 60, had been telegraphing a desire for a
diminished role with ``Nightline'' in order to pursue opportunities
on the Internet and at the same time prepare to make way for a
successor. He said Thursday that he believed the new contract would
allow him to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying that I believe that a prudent thing to do is
to have a transition period that is so long and so gradual and so
smooth that when it finally happens, the public won't even notice
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has assigned Tom Sievers, the ``Nightline'' senior field
producer, to oversee the program on a daily basis. He will report
to Tom Bettag, the executive producer.

   HOLOCAUST-LAWYER (Undated) _ Edward D. Fagan, once a
little-known personal injury lawyer from New Jersey, is likely to
earn millions of dollars in legal fees for pursuing his audacious
idea to sue European banks in the theft of money 50 years ago from
those who died in the Holocaust. As he recast himself as a ``human
rights'' lawyer, Fagan left neglected personal-injury clients in
his wake, abandoning their claims or not returning their phone
calls for years, according to court papers and interviews. One
former client recently won a malpractice judgment against Fagan and
ethics officials in New Jersey filed a misconduct complaint against
him last month on behalf of another client. Fagan, so at ease with
using the emotional force of the Holocaust as a weapon, also
ignored for months scores of plaintive calls and letters from aging
Nazi-era survivors anxious about whether their claims had been
received, according to a paralegal who worked last year for him. By

   NY-MAFIA-ARRESTS (New York) _ A profile of the witness behind
the construction industry mob arrests announced on Tuesday. He's a
street tough from the Bronx who married into the mob at its highest
level in New Jersey, came to work the rackets in Manhattan, and who
ultimately quit as the pressure grew to be too much and he feared
for his life. By C.J. Chivers.

   SCI-MAYA-PALACE (Undated) _ In a remote jungle of Guatemala,
among the remains of a little-known ancient city with a name
meaning ``place of serpents,'' archaeologists have uncovered one of
the largest and most splendid palaces of Maya kings ever
discovered. Its more than 170 high-ceiling rooms were built around
11 courtyards and spread over an area greater than two football
fields. By John Noble Wilford.

   September
</P>
<P>
   ``ON OUR OWN TERMS: MOYERS ON DYING'' _ Not a title calculated
to drive ratings, that's for sure. Four 90-minute reports on
end-of-life journeys, with those on the road as well as their loved
ones and caregivers. PBS, starting Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``GIRLFRIENDS'' _ A series whose name may be the most-used word
in comedies with mainly black casts. It's built on the
relationships among four young black women _ and yes, that is the
same number as ``Sex and the City.'' UPN, Mondays at 9:30, starting
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER'' _ The Oscar-winning documentary about
the attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics comes to
television. It covers the events from the hostage-taking through
the futile negotiations to the violent conclusion. It includes an
interview with the only surviving Arab terrorist, Jamal al-Gashey,
who has been in hiding for 28 years. HBO, Sept. 11 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWO-MINUTE DRILL'' _ What does Michael Davies, the production
mastermind behind ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' do for an
encore? He does a sports quiz show, with Kenny Mayne as host and
with three contestants showing off their arcane knowledge in an
effort to win cash prizes that escalate _ but slowly. And only up
to $200,000, not a million. As a producer put it: ``Hey, we're
cable.'' Then again, how much should you get for knowing things
like who has the Kansas City Royals' season record for home runs?
(OK, I know, it's Steve Balboni, 36.) ESPN, Mondays at 7, starting
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE ELIAN GONZALEZ STORY'' _ And the winner in the latest rush
to make a ripped-from-the-headlines movie is: Fox Family Channel,
which beat out CBS, whose movie of the same title is not yet
scheduled. Here a child actor named Alec Roberts plays Elian, with
Esai Morales as his father and Laura Elena Harring as Marisleysis
Gonzalez. The events should be rather familiar. Fox Family, Sept.
17 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``FEAR'' _ ``Blair Witch'' meets ``Survivor.'' Young contestants
compete to survive in a setting with a horrifying background while
they are constantly harassed and scared out of their wits. They all
have cameras attached to their vests. MTV, Sept. 21 at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``DIRECT EFFECT'' _ An effort to link online fascination with
video fascination: Viewers vote online for the next video they want
to see, mixed in with the usual guests and live performances. It
sounds a bit like Total Online Request Live. The host is the
one-named Teck, of ``Real World'' fame. MTV, starting Sept. 25 at
5:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN MASTERS: CLINT EASTWOOD'' _ One of the most reliably
fascinating PBS series takes a look at the now esteemed actor and
director as he hits 70. PBS, Sept. 27 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   October
</P>
<P>
   ``JACKASS'' _ An off-beat show with silly pranks and antics
performed by Johnny Knoxville, exploring the underground world of
skateboarders. MTV, starting Oct. 1 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``DEADLINE'' _ Nobody in television makes better crime dramas
than Dick Wolf of ``Law and Order,'' but here he is trying a
hybrid: Crime and journalism. Oliver Platt plays a famous
of-the-street columnist for a New York tabloid; he also teaches
journalism, and he and his team of young students investigate
crimes on the side. The cast includes such familiar names as Bebe
Neuwirth, Lili Taylor and Tom Conti. NBC, Mondays at 9, starting
Oct 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``FRONTLINE: THE CHOICE'' _ In what is now something of a
tradition, the documentary series takes a close look at the men
running for president. Reported by Peter Boyer, the program
promises to avoid pundits and stick to friends, mentors and
historians. PBS, Oct. 2 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``TUCKER'' _ In television, no good show goes unparroted. In
this case, ``Malcolm in the Middle'' seems the obvious inspiration,
though this is clearly a less-inspired version. A teen-age boy
finds his life in disarray after his parents' divorce, and he and
his mother are forced to move in with his strident aunt and her
slug of a son. Katey Sagal (``Married With Children'') is the aunt,
while Eli Marienthal (``American Pie'') plays Tucker. NBC, Mondays
at 8:30, starting Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``YES, DEAR'' _ A comedy less notable for its premise _ two
couples who are close friends differ about approaches to being
parents _ than its cast, which features not one, but two former
stars of famously failed ``must see'' Thursday-night comedies on
NBC: Mike O'Malley of ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' and Anthony Clark
of ``Boston Common.'' CBS, Mondays at 8:30, starting Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``BUILDING BIG'' _ A five-hour look at some of the most
spectacular structures in the world, including the Channel tunnel,
the Golden Gate Bridge and the Toronto Skydome. The host is the
author and illustrator David Macaulay (``The Way Things Work'').
PBS, starting Oct. 3 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``DARK ANGEL'' _ This is the first creative work undertaken by
James Cameron since ``Titanic,'' and while not quite as ambitious,
it is a highly polished piece of science fiction entertainment with
a young star, Jessica Alba (``Can't Hardly Wait''), who commands
the screen. She plays a superwoman type who has escaped a genetic
experiment in a post-apocalyptic future, when the world's economic
system has collapsed, and teams with a streaming-video journalist
to expose the bad guys. Among her other amazing talents, Alba
manages to support lips that look like they're been stung by a
whole hive of bees. Fox, Tuesdays at 9, starting Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GEENA DAVIS SHOW'' _ Truly a star vehicle, this show wants
to be ``Sex and the City'' crossed with a family comedy, a tall
order. But then Geena Davis is a  &UR; really &LR;  tall actress. She plays a
Manhattan career woman who marries a divorced guy (Peter Horton of
``Thirtysomething'') with kids, making her an instant mom. It's a
well-positioned show that will do well if it's well executed. ABC,
Tuesdays at 9:30, starting Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``GIDEON'S CROSSING'' _ The season's most serious drama, with
the estimable Andre Braugher of ``Homicide'' moving into medicine
at a teaching hospital that takes on desperate cases. It's heavy
going, especially with many patients facing terminal illnesses, but
Braugher has big acting shoulders. Reuben Blades co-stars. ABC,
Wednesdays at 10, starting Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``TITANS'' _ The season's standout in terms of sheer silliness,
the latest soap opera from Aaron Spelling seems unsure itself
whether its hilarious hokiness is intentional. It's about the usual
stuff: The members of a rich, venal family scheme to ruin one
another, mainly through sex. Yasmine Bleeth has the juicy vixen
role, though her supposedly venomous lines draw mostly laughs. But
Spelling has mined this territory successfully before. Victoria
Principal of ``Dallas'' makes a comeback as an older-generation
vixen. NBC, Wednesdays at 8, starting Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``GILMORE GIRLS'' _ A gentle, quirky multigenerational drama
with a light touch about a mother and her daughter in a Connecticut
town. Lauren Graham stars as the mom, with Alexis Blendel as the
other Gilmore girl. WB, Thursdays at 8, starting Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``C.S.I.'' _ A crime drama with a heavy emphasis on forensic
science, this hour has a number of things going for it, including a
reasonably intelligent approach and a cast headed by Marg
Helgenberger (``China Beach'') and William Petersen (``The Rat
Pack''). The producer is Jerry Bruckheimer, who usually blows
things up in the movies. CBS, Fridays at 9, starting Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``FREAKYLINKS'' _ Inevitably, we have a show about a Web site.
This one has ties to the makers of ``The Blair Witch Project'' and
tries to make a similarly scary name for itself. A team of young
hunters of the paranormal traces strange links to the death of a
team member's brother. There is, of course, a real Web site to feed
the hoped-for frenzy of interest. Fox, Fridays at 9, starting Oct.
6.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FUGITIVE'' _ What's it been? Forty years? It's actually
been 37 since the original series made its debut, and it's already
been updated once as a movie, but the old chase is back. Dr.
Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his wife, runs from Lt.
Gerard, while simultaneously seeking the one-armed man who did the
deed. Tim Daly gets the David Janssen/Harrison Ford part, with
Mykelti Williamson stepping in for Barry Morse/Tommy Lee Jones. In
case anybody's still wondering, Dr. Kimble didn't do it. CBS,
Fridays at 8, starting Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``MADIGAN MEN'' _ Another show with roots in ``Sex and the
City.'' This one would like to take a look at the male side, as
long as that means men with Irish roots who share a Manhattan
apartment and spout cute Irish aphorisms. Gabriel Byrne, a true
potential television star, is the newly single man with a teen-age
son and a dad from the old sod, played by Roy Dotrice, who also
played opposite Byrne on Broadway in ``Moon for the Misbegotten.''
ABC, Fridays at 9:30, starting Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TROUBLE WITH NORMAL'' _ What does that title mean? No,
there is no character named Normal; instead, there are two paranoid
characters who think their neighbor is spying on them. Jon Cryer,
who has had numerous shots in television comedies in the past,
plays the neighbor who is equally paranoid and actually  &UR; is &LR;  spying
on them. They all go to a therapist. Many people have paranoid
tendencies, which perhaps sets up a sizable audience, but do people
who are paranoid find paranoia funny? ABC, Fridays at 8:30,
starting Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DISTRICT'' _ A crime drama that aims to be edgy, but may
be asking for trouble: A white police chief, played by Craig T.
Nelson, moves to Washington to clean up a town where black leaders
have failed. Some genuinely gripping moments could get lost in the
potential controversy. CBS, Saturdays at 10, starting Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAGE ON SCREEN: THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER'' _ A live
performance of the current Broadway production of the Kaufman and
Hart play, with Nathan Lane and Jean Smart. PBS, Oct. 7 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``THAT'S LIFE'' _ Another show looking to duplicate the ``you
can go home again'' premise of ``Providence,'' this quirky-funny
hour has some nice character work from Heather Paige Kent (``Stark
Raving Mad'') as a woman in her 30s who dumps her fiance and goes
back to college, and from Paul Sorvino and Ellen Burstyn as her
parents. CBS, Saturdays at 8, starting Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``ED'' _ The one new NBC series that seems to be getting an
affectionate response, this gentle, likable hourlong comedy is not
big on laughs but it works because of its sweet characters. Tom
Cavanaugh (``Providence'') reacts to the misfortune of losing his
job and his wife (to the mailman) in the same day by fleeing to his
hometown, a recurring theme this season. There he essentially
resurrects his adolescence, reuniting with high school friends and
even chasing the unattainable girl from those years. To accomplish
that, he buys a local bowling alley, where he also dispenses legal
advice. Even though it's from two of David Letterman's longtime
writers, Rob Burnett and John Beckerman, it's a show that could
give warm and fuzzy a good name. NBC, Sundays at 8, starting Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``HYPE'' _ A cast of newcomers tries to bring the sketch comedy
formula up to date in a weekly series of fast-paced parodies of
youth-oriented movies and music. WB, still sticking to the recipe
that built the Fox network, tries to re-create the magic of ``In
Living Color.'' WB, Sundays at 9, starting Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIKKI'' _ Looking for new venues and new characters, Bruce
Helford, the creator of ``The Drew Carey Show,'' goes all the way
to Las Vegas to build a comedy around a dancer on the Strip, played
by Nikki Cox of ``Norm,'' who is married to a big lug who wants to
be a wrestler. WB, Sundays at 9:30, starting Oct 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``OLIVER TWIST'' _ The big ``Masterpiece Theater'' effort of the
season, a three-part adaptation of the Dickens book with Robert
Lindsay, Julie Walters and Michael Kitchen. PBS, starting Oct. 8 at
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``BETTE'' _ The most anticipated new comedy of the season, with
Bette Midler playing a version of herself, in the throwback style
of ``Burns and Allen'' or ``The Jack Benny Program.'' Actors play
the other members of her family, as well as her manager and
accompanist, but the show is all about Midler, with a lot of her
brand of broad comedy mixed with regular bursts of music. That has
always been a winning formula for her, and it should be here, too.
CBS, Wednesdays at 8, starting Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``WELCOME TO NEW YORK'' _ A comedy with most of the conventions
intact _ a fish out of water shines in a new work environment _ but
in this case the writing makes it exceed the preconceptions. Jim
Gaffigan plays an Indiana guy brought in to be a weather reporter
for a television show in New York by the brassy producer, played by
Christine Baranski. Watch for an unusual clash between Gaffigan's
character and the entrenched anchorman, played by Rocky Carroll.
CBS, Wednesday at 8:30 starting Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``CURSED'' _ For how many years now has NBC tried to make
comedies hits by slotting them in the ideal location, Thursdays at
9? So many that the title of this one seems all too apt. Steven
Weber (``Wings'') plays a man whose comfortable life falls apart
after a bad date, when the woman puts a curse on him. Yeah, and
then what happens? That's the part that nobody seems to know. NBC,
Thursdays at 9:30, starting Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM'' _ One of the wildest and most promising
new series of the season. It is the creation of Larry David, the
comic mind behind many of the greatest episodes of ``Seinfeld,''
and is improvised from basic story lines. David plays himself as a
stand-up comic surrounded by dysfunctional, loony friends. It
sounds like ``Seinfeld,'' but it's much different _ after all, it's
on cable. HBO, starting Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: THE ROCKEFELLERS'' _ A two-part biography
of the rich American family, from the early days of Standard Oil to
the current generation. From producers who previously chronicled
the Kennedy family and Ronald Reagan. PBS, starting Oct. 16 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``SPIDERGAMES'' _ The first original daytime soap opera on
cable, about a family investigating the murder of the most hated
man in town. Everyone is a suspect and an heir to his video-game
empire. MTV, starting Oct. 16 at 4:30, repeating at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FEARING MIND'' _ Here's the concept: Stephen King and his
New England family in a sitcom. A horror novelist named Bill
Fearing has real-life horrors, including a mother-in-law who said
she had one month to live five years ago _ and other wacky stuff
like that. The British actor Harry Van Gorkum, whose name sounds
like a Stephen King character, stars, with Susan Gibney. Fox
Family, starting Oct. 20 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``BOSTON PUBLIC'' _ A drama about life in a high school would
not sound too promising if it were not coming from David E. Kelley,
who has made ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' into two of the
best series of the last five years. Here the challenge is making
daily high school life dramatic and funny, and it's a bit of a
stretch. A plot in which a teacher fired a gun in a classroom drew
instant protest, and Kelly promised changes. As usual, his writing
is of a high quality and so is much of the acting, led by Chi
McBride as an intense principal. Fox, Mondays at 8, starting Oct.
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``HATE.COM: EXTREMISTS ON THE INTERNET'' _ A documentary about
how hatemongers have used the Web to find new recruits, spread
their messages and in some instances even set up hate crimes. HBO,
Oct. 23 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW'' _ Here is NBC's great comedy hope,
the first new series starring a ``Seinfeld'' grad. And what's
happened? It has been one stumble after another, not unlike the
ones that used to afflict Kramer. Except that those were funny. The
original pilot was totally scrapped. No one knows much about the
new one except that Richards is still playing a bumbling detective.
He does have co-stars now, including Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night
Live'') and William Devane (``The Hollow Man''). NBC, Tuesdays at
8, starting Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``FREEDOM'' _ More apocalypse mongering from the producer Joel
Silver, who hit it big with ``The Matrix.'' Much about this one is
``Matrix''-like, including the premise of a resistance unit
fighting an evil military elite that has taken over humanity. UPN,
Fridays at 8, starting Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``LEVEL NINE'' _ Crime fighting goes totally cyber in this hour
about a secret group created to fight Internet villains, like
hackers who blackmail airlines by threatening to crash airplanes.
Created by John Sacret Young (``China Beach''). UPN, Fridays at 9,
starting Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN'' _ Valerie Bertinelli, who was once in
every other TV movie, returns to play a romantic role in another
generation: Now she's the mom with the teen-age children. The kids
plot to bring Valerie and Jeffrey Nadling, who plays the dad, back
together in a story that is set on a tourist ranch in the wilds of
Alaska. CBS in October.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``SECOND HONEYMOON'' _ Roma Downey and Tim Matheson star in
another movie about a couple that just can't seem to break up. Here
the soon-to-be-divorced pair get a surprise 20th-anniversary gift
from the family: A tropical vacation. It works wonders. CBS in
October.
</P>
<P>
   November
</P>
<P>
   ``NORMAL, OHIO'' _ A troubled comedy that still has a great
asset, John Goodman, as star. Goodman plays a father who happens to
be gay; he moves back to his hometown and comedy is meant to ensue.
But this is an all-new premise _ a first pilot was totally remade _
so the result is harder to predict than usual. Fox, Wednesdays at
8, starting Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE STREET'' _ The true heir to ``Sex and the City,'' because
it comes from the same creator, Darren Star. This hour is full of
similar steamy touches as it traces the overheated lives, both
professional and social, of a group of young Wall Street brokers
who are on the make _ in more ways than one. The clothes, the music
and the moves are all designed to reveal the male side of the
sexual play featured in Star's HBO hit. Adam Goldberg (``Saving
Private Ryan'') and Tom Everett Scott (``That Thing You Do'') are
among the big, talented, attractive cast. Fox, Wednesdays at 9,
starting Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``JACQUELINE BOUVIER KENNEDY ONASSIS'' _ Yet another Kennedy
family mini-series, of which so many already exist that they could
fill their own cable channel. This one promises the whole story of
Jackie, in four hours, based on the biography by Donald Spoto.
Joanna Whalley, who has one other high-profile television role on
her resume (``Scarlett''), here will try to impersonate perhaps the
most famous woman of the 20th century. CBS, starting Nov. 5 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAPOLEON'' _ A four-hour documentary biography of the French
general and emperor, directed by David Grubin, whose previous films
for PBS include ``F.D.R.,'' ``L.B.J.'' and ``Truman'' in the
``American Experience'' series. PBS, Nov. 8 and Nov. 15, at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN TRAGEDY: THE UNCENSORED STORY OF THE SIMPSON
DEFENSE'' _ Destined to be one of the most talked-about projects of
the season, for better or worse, this adaptation of the Lawrence
Schiller book has already been threatened with an injunction by new
lawyers for O.J. Simpson. It is an account of his defense strategy
and the cast of characters includes those familiar names Johnnie
Cochran (Ving Rhames), Robert Shapiro (Ron Silver), F. Lee Bailey
(Christopher Plummer) and Barry Scheck (Bruno Kirby). Told over
four hours _ if no restraining order is issued _ by a production
team led by Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana. CBS, Nov. 12 and Nov.
15 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: RETURN WITH HONOR'' _ A
two-and-a-half-hour account of the sufferings and ultimate
victories of a group of American airmen shot down in Vietnam and
subjected to years of torture before their release. It includes
film from the Vietnamese government archives. Introduced by Tom
Hanks. PBS, Nov. 13 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   `DAG'' _ David Alan Grier is a talented, funny guy, but this is
his third try at sitcom success and it's not the charm. Here he
plays a bumbling Secret Service agent banished to cover the
president's wife (Delta Burke, who may look too much like a certain
young lady in a beret for some people's comfort). The idea is to
make the comedy extremely broad, but that will require generating a
lot more laughs than the pilot did. NBC, Tuesdays at 9:30, starting
Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOVA: HITLER'S LOST SUB'' _ About the 1991 discovery of a
sunken World War II U-boat, found only 60 miles off the coast of
New Jersey, with its unexploded torpedoes and the bodies of its
crew still aboard. The documentary follows the efforts of the diver
John Chatterton and his crew to identify and explore the boat, a
quest that cost three more lives. PBS, Nov. 14 at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``LOOKING FOR LOST BIRD'' _ A story of a woman, adopted as an
infant, who searches for her biological parents, discovers they
were Navajo and seeks to learn of their culture. Mercedes Ruehl is
the star, with Jamey Sheridan as her husband. CBS, Nov. 19 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MOVING OF SOPHIA MYLES'' _ Della Reese of ``Touched by an
Angel'' plays yet another heartwarming role: The widow of a
cherished pastor who duels with an evil real estate maven played by
Rue McLanahan. CBS, Nov. 26 at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``FOR LOVE OR COUNTRY: THE ARTURO SANDOVAL STORY'' _ The story
of the brilliant Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval, who refused
to defect after the Castro takeover because of his love for a
woman, but later did so, with the help of Dizzy Gillespie. Andy
Garcia stars in a cast that includes Gloria Estefan and Charles S.
Dutton. HBO in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``GROWING PAINS: THE REUNION'' _ At first glance this seems like
a project conjured up solely to get Leonardo DiCaprio into a
television movie. But he didn't show up for this reunion, of
course, so fans of the series will have to satisfied with Alan
Thicke, who did. ABC in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE BEGINNING'' _ Religious stories have been unexpected
hits in recent years, so why not go right to basics. It's the
familar roster, including Adam and Eve, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph and
Moses, with a lot of special effects to enhance the telling. Among
the interesting casting choices: Martin Landau as Abraham, and
Billy Campbell of ``Once and Again'' as Moses. NBC in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``IN HIS LIFE: THE JOHN LENNON STORY'' _ A lot of Lennon's early
professional life was covered in the feature film ``Backbeat,'' and
that R-rated material seems unlikely for a network television
movie. This one includes a bit of his troubled childhood, but
shifts quickly to his efforts to form a skiffle band, his meeting
with a mate named Paul, and so on. NBC in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MIRACLE WORKER'' _ Yet another version of the famous play,
which has already been a television special and a movie. Now it's
back to television, almost solely as a vehicle for Hallie Kate
Eisenberg, who in her ubiquitous Pepsi commercials has not
demonstrated quite the acting depth that this part has pulled out
of the likes of Patti Duke. ABC in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNFORGETTABLE: THE NATALIE COLE STORY'' _ A television movie
biography of the singer, who endured several rises and falls before
her hit ``duet'' with her dead father. NBC in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``WIDOWS'' _ Three women with extremely different backgrounds
come together after their husbands are killed trying to pull off an
art heist. Over four hours, on two days, they team up to search out
the killer. Mercedes Ruehl is the middle-class housewife, Brooke
Shields is the low-rent actress and Rosie Perez is the used-car
saleswoman. Lynda LaPlante, the creator of the great ``Prime
Suspect'' series, also created the original of this story, which
was a hit in England. ABC in November.
</P>
<P>
   December
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW'' _ The singer-songwriter plays himself
in a semi-fictional story about a lead singer for a band who is
very much like Chris Isaak. The musicians are real; many of the
backup characters are not. The show has as much music as comedy.
Showtime, starting in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``QUEER AS FOLK'' _ In Britain, this brutally frank drama about
gay life was a sensation. Rather than simply import it, Showtime
decided to make an American version. Pittsburgh steps in to
approximate blue-collar Manchester, and Hal Sparks, who was once
the host of ``Talk Soup,'' stars as Michael, who is secretly in
love with his childhood friend, a drug-addled advertising
executive. The show is steeped in character complications, some
comedic, some heart-tugging, all fiercely realistic. Showtime,
starting in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``SANTA WHO?'' _ The old guy crashes in New York, of all places,
days before Christmas and suffers amnesia. Panicked elves have to
hunt him down. Santa falls in with a Christmas-hating reporter and,
of course, he lands a job as a department store St. Nick. Will
Santa recover his memory in time to save Christmas? Leslie Nielsen,
who already has the hair, if not the girth, stars with Tommy
Davidson of ``Booty Call.'' ABC in December.

   ``NERO WOLFE'' _ The rotund, brilliant detective who never
leaves his New York townhouse comes to television, a long while

IRAN'S PRESIDENT OFFERS CRITICAL WORDS ON DEMOCRATIC REFORMERS AND
THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami of Iran criticized his country's
democratic reformers on Thursday for their unrealistic expectations
and urged his people to avoid extremes in the name of promoting
either security or freedom.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in a meeting room of the U.N. Plaza Hotel,
Khatami also criticized the international outrage over his
country's prosecution and conviction of a group of Jews as spies
and ruled out an official dialogue with the United States until
Washington changed its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a mid-level cleric trained in philosophy, was swept
into office in an upset landslide victory in 1997 on a platform
promoting tolerance and the rule of law. But between smiles, he was
defensive as he fielded tough questions about the recent setbacks
in Iran's fledgling reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Persian and dressed in the turban, robe and cloak
that identify him as a cleric, Khatami made little effort to charm
journalists, as he did during his maiden voyage to the United
Nations two years ago. Back then, he told journalists how he had
started out as a journalist and editor, expressed his admiration
for the American Puritans, summarized the definition of justice in
Plato's Republic and said he wished he could be a tourist and spend
up to a month in America.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he stressed that his country's moves toward
democracy should not be compared to countries in the West with two
to three centuries of experience, and called for moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot endanger security for the sake of freedom, and you
cannot endanger freedom for the sake of security,'' Khatami said.
``This is a delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Describing his people as ``impatient,'' he said, ``the demands
of the people should not rise beyond possibilities.'' Complicating
matters are the constant complaints about the country's inflation
and high unemployment, especially among young people, which, he
said, ``add to certain expectations not in sync with the
possibilities of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He warned against extremism, which, he said, ``in any form, any
direction is unwanted, whether in the name of freedom and
supporting people's rights or in the name of security and
suppressing people's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami even suggested that he might not run for re-election
next May, although Iran's state-run television quoted him recently
as saying that he would run again. And he seemed to distance
himself from the reform movement that was sparked after his
victory, saying, ``Let me remind you that I did not come in the
name of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian president is caught in the middle of an intense and
dangerous power struggle between reformers and conservatives in
Iran. Increasingly, conservative forces opposed to democratic
reform who enjoy the financial backing of well-placed power brokers
have been willing to use any means _ including violence _ to
maintain a hold on various spheres of power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most recently, vigilantes, many of them armed with batons and
other weapons, took over the airport and forcibly prevented two
reformist leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of
Khorramabad, sparking days of rioting with students in which a
policeman was killed and more than 100 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the past several months, more than a score of
Iran's reformist newspapers and magazines have been shut down, many
of its reformist journalists and clerics have been put into prison
and its judiciary, dominated by ultraconservative clerics, is
determined to punish any behavior it considers un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has struggled to prevent violent confrontations by
calling over and over for calm. But since nationwide riots last
year, students have become more organized and are beginning to say
that passive resistance will no longer work.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference on Thursday, Khatami also said the
international reaction to the case of ten Iranian Jews and two
Muslims convicted in July of espionage was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you never mention the Muslims convicted by the same
court and who are still in prison for the same reasons?'' he asked,
adding, ``If instead of these Jews they were Christians, would the
world still react as it did today?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did not personally intervene in the case, Khatami
stressed that the executive branch should not interfere in the work
of the judiciary. But he added that the cases are before the
appeals court, and expressed the hope that ``no one will be
convicted beyond their actual guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami downplayed the importance of a recent meeting in New
York between Iranian parliamentary deputies and U.S. congressmen as
``unplanned.''
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled out the possibility that the meeting might be a
prelude to higher-level meetings with U.S. officials. Citing
``serious issues'' dividing the two nations, Khatami called on the
United States to ``confess'' its involvement in the coup
orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 that
overthrew the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and
restored Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. ``This confession
will be a big step forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When reminded that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
essentially apologized for the 1953 coup in a speech on Iran in
March, Khatami listed a number of other grievances against the
United States, including economic sanctions and the Clinton
administration's opposition to the construction of a pipeline
through Iran to ship oil and gas from the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West, people still refuse to understand that the
cheapest, fastest route transferring energy from the Caspian is
through Iran,'' Khatami said. He also cited U.S. ``allegations''
against Iran, code for U.S. assertions that Iran is involved in
sponsoring international terrorism and is developing weapons of
mass destruction, including a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the United States to offer ``apologies'' and
``practical measures'' to prove that the nature of the relationship
has changed. ``Unfortunately, the Americans have been less inclined
to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the morning, at a breakfast with a small number of
journalists, many of whom Khatami knows, he was more relaxed. When
Christiane Amanpour of CNN asked him a pointed question, just as he
dug into his cornflakes, he replied: ``Is this an interview or a
friendly conversation over breakfast? Allow me to continue our
friendly chat.''

 &HT;    Aerodynamics don't just benefit NASCAR drivers
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back sometime in the '60s, I recall someone commenting
that a Lotus Europa, or maybe it was an Elan, was so
aerodynamically perfect that you could drive it 100 mph in the rain
and never have to turn on the windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
   My first thought was why would anyone be going 100 mph in the
rain?
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who were driving in the '60s, the vehicles we
were cruising around in were about as aerodynamic as a brick, and
the windshield wipers were doing well to maintain contact with the
windshield at 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It only took 30-something years for the light bulb to come on.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I was traveling down I-85 from Charlotte,
N.C. to Atlanta in a new Chevrolet Monte Carlo. My husband was
following in another vehicle. I barely noticed that it had begun to
rain. All of sudden, the sky opened up, but my visibility was
perfect. I thought I was imagining things as I watched perfect
little beadlets of water dissipate oh-so-symmetrically across the
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The story about the Lotus crawled out of the cobwebs of my
memory.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that Chevrolet had gone to great lengths to produce an
aerodynamically ``clean'' vehicle. As with most consumers, the
coefficient of drag numbers mean little to me.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the company go to all this trouble? It's pretty
well-accepted that the Monte Carlo is produced for one main
purpose: NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Bob _ who for 25 years worked in the engine shops of
the NASCAR teams of Richard Petty, Richard Childress and Darrell
Waltrip _ has long said that the cheapest horsepower you can find
is aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving home, I could hardly wait to show off my newfound
marvel. Bob was a bit uneasy about driving around in the rain with
the wipers off (I did switch them back on when we were stopped for
traffic lights) but had to agree that it was an impressive
demonstration. For the record, we were not traveling 100 mph; the
Monte Carlo cleaned its own windshield quite nicely at 45 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we both noted that there was little or no road
film or dirt buildup on the side of the Monte Carlo, another
indicator of an aerodynamically ``clean'' vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of good aerodynamics is to reduce drag. That
means to keep the air from ``clinging'' to the vehicle, except
where you want it. Manufacturers spend hundreds of thousands of
dollars doing research in wind tunnels trying to find out just what
we observed going down the road. The water didn't lie on the
windshield, nor did it cling to the side panels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NASCAR Monte Carlos are similar, but not identical, to
the Monte Carlo you will find in the showroom. Except for the
grilles, all the NASCAR race-car bodies _ Chevrolet, Pontiac and
Ford _ are pretty much identical to each other.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll just have to appreciate Chevrolet's _ and other
automakers' _ efforts to improve aerodynamics if not just for the
savings on wiper blades, then for the 28 miles per gallon that a
slick car can get on the highway.

 &HT;    Old refrain: Good help is hard to find
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is something I'd hoped would never have to be
written. It's a story about the decline of a reputable auto repair
shop that my mother had entrusted with the mechanical health of her
pet '81 Oldsmobile for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   My story starts this past summer while I was out West visiting
Mom. We took her car into the shop for an oil change and checkup
before driving it from her home to California. While the car was
being worked on, I chatted with the shop foreman, a man whom I've
respected and trusted to oversee the care of the Olds.
</P>
<P>
   The checkup noted that two of the tires were getting marginal
and the rear brakes were more than half worn. We left for our trip,
confident the Olds was in sound shape.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember if it was the small puddle of oil, the pinging
of the engine or the lack of air conditioning in 100-degree weather
that alerted me to the fact that maybe they had missed a few things
at the shop.
</P>
<P>
   However, when we returned, I went back to the shop and spoke
with the foreman. He answered with two statements that I hear
echoed throughout the auto repair industry.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to hire mechanics out of the same shallow pool as
every other shop attempting to keep its doors open. Competence and
conscientiousness have become rare traits.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he has become reluctant to even mention needed repairs,
as it tends to scare customers away. People perceive that they are
being ripped off when additional services are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Mom needed to drive the Olds across the country when she moved
here. She made an appointment to have the car completely gone over
before the 2,500-mile trip. I gave her a list of things that needed
to be examined in addition to whatever the inspection revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the repairs, which included valve cover gaskets, a
CV axle, brakes, A/C service, wheel alignment and new tires _ along
with a much needed major tuneup _ exceeded the value of the car,
but Mom gladly paid for the assurance that her baby was in tiptop
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later I got the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   She told me that the car lacked the power it had before and she
smelled gasoline. I responded with, ``Take it back, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Mom, her two dogs and my daughter made it
across the United States without a noticeable mechanical mishap,
except for poor gas mileage. The bad news is I opened the hood.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel dripped from an over-tightened fitting that damaged the
carburetor. Several of the original 20-year-old vacuum lines were
cracked and split, as was a more obvious coolant hose. A thorough
test of the air conditioning system disclosed the need for it to be
reserviced properly. And although the repair order stated the
battery was serviced, it sported a layer of grime and green, fuzzy
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's car is a testament to the plague that threatens the auto
repair industry. Several automotive industry studies have
determined we have an aging work force of mechanics (averaging
between 42 to 50), with virtually no new blood on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   I used to say, ``How much will you be willing to spend to get
your vehicle repaired?'' I'm beginning believe that no amount of
money will be able to purchase a commodity that is becoming
extinct.

   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-led House failed Thursday to
override President Clinton's veto of a $105 billion bill to repeal
the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican lawmakers don't plan to try to reach a compromise
with the White House on the issue before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 274 to 157 Thursday to overturn the presidential
veto, 11 votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   When the House passed the original bill in June, 65 Democrats
joined with the Republican majority to do away with federal estate,
gift and generation-skipping transfer taxes by 2010. On Thursday,
13 Democrats switched their votes to help sustain the president's
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend the House members who voted today to reject the
majority's flawed estate tax bill,'' Clinton said in a written
statement after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I support estate tax relief that addresses family farms,
small businesses and principal residences, the approach taken by
the majority in Congress is part of a $2 trillion tax plan that
would take us back to the days of deficits, high interest rates and
fiscal irresponsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans promised to remind voters which Democrats changed
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the ones people ought to focus on when they express
their outrage,'' argued House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar
Land.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that Republicans could have reached a
compromise agreement with them that would have provided some
reduction in estate taxes starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were serious, they would have worked with us,'' argued
Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay said the White House does not want to provide estate
tax relief this year.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax, or ``death tax'' as Republicans have come to
call it, was first added to the tax code in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   The tax code currently excludes the first $675,000 from taxation
for most estates and $1.3 million for family-owned farms, ranches
and small businesses. And by 2006, the exclusion for most estates
will climb to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue the estate tax borders on the macabre. ``We say
death as an event should not trigger a tax,'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Houston. ``The death tax
has given purgatory a new meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the provision taxes wealth that has already been
taxed.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal effort was supported by numerous business groups,
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Air Conditioning
Contractors of America.
</P>
<P>
   The White House contended the Republican-backed bill was
targeted toward a small group of wealthy Americans and would cost
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials estimated the measure would cost
government coffers an additional $750 billion in the second decade,
with more than half the benefits going to about 3,000 families a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 _ the last year for which the Internal Revenue Service
has data _ less than 2 percent of the families inheriting estates
had to pay an estate tax _ fewer than 43,000 estates in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that the tax affects many more people than
those numbers would suggest, since many families sell their
businesses rather than incur the hefty estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich don't pay these taxes,'' DeLay said. ``It's people
like me, when I used to be in the pest control business.'' (DeLay
sold his business three years ago, incurring a capital gains tax).
</P>
<P>
   Democrats favor a proposal that would raise the exclusion for
family farms and closely held businesses to $2 million and allow
any portion of that exclusion not used when the first spouse dies
to be added to the estate of the surviving spouse.

   WASHINGTON _ A political action committee raising campaign funds
for the House Republican impeachment prosecution team has postponed
a tribute to former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr scheduled for
Oct. 4, the PAC's director said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Roney, the House Managers PAC director, attributed the
decision to scheduling difficulties. He said the Oct. 4 date would
conflict with the end of the legislative session on Capitol Hill
and the desire of House members to resume campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But Roney acknowledged that the event ``was turning out to be a
little too political.''
</P>
<P>
   Roney and Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of 13 House Republicans
who served as prosecutors (also called managers) in last year's
Senate trial of President Clinton, decided to pull the plug after
the event piqued media interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was our blind ignorance, but we didn't think it would
be described as being political,'' Roney said. ``Even though it was
a fundraiser, we didn't want it to be viewed as political _ as a
lot of media were beginning to portray it.'' The managers group did
not want to put Starr in the midst of another political
controversy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The event might be rescheduled for some time after Congress
adjourns next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC has raised $70,000 to $80,000, ostensibly for the
re-election of the 11 managers running for re-election to the
House, as well as one _ Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. _ running for a
vacant U.S. Senate seat. The 13th manager, Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla, is not seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12, only McCollum and Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., are in
tight election battles. McCollum is neck-and-neck with popular
Florida insurance commissioner Bill Nelson. Rogan is battling
California state Sen. Adam Schiff in a contest that could become
one of the most expensive House races ever. Rogan and Schiff
together have raised $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998
and the failed Senate bid to remove him from office in 1999 have
always been a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   In polls would-be voters rank ``moral values'' high on the list
of significant issues, and most prefer Republicans on issues
relating to these values.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush regularly tells audiences that if he wins the election,
he'll swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, polls taken during the impeachment effort
showed that while voters disapproved of President Clinton's
personal conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, they opposed
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said people ``don't like what (Clinton) did, but they
want to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans such as Rogan cannot back away from their role in
the matter either, Sabato said, adding, ``When politicians show
fear, they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Rogan stresses issues of local concern in his
Southern California district encompassing Pasadena, Glendale and
Burbank. He talks about impeachment only when a questioner brings
it up at a meeting, his press spokesman Jason Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   The district is undergoing rapid demographic change, with
Hispanics, Asians and Armenians _ who tend to prefer Democrats _
gradually replacing Republican-leaning Anglo voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates, including Schiff, have
tried using impeachment to their own advantage. They have accused
Republicans of being consumed with scandal and investigations at
the expense of bread-and-butter issues such as saving Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican strategists view the impeachment imbroglio as a
nonstarter. ``It's not in our interest to keep talking about
Clinton and Monica,'' said one senior Republican official, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Starr now teaches law at George Mason University in Northern
Virginia and volunteers as an instructor at a high school in
Washington's predominantly black Anacostia section.

CAUSE OF GULF WAR SYNDROME A MYSTERY, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no conclusive evidence that nerve gas, uranium or
military vaccinations caused the Gulf War syndrome ailing thousands
of Desert Storm veterans, according to a massive study released
Thursday that strongly suggests the affliction's actual cause will
forever remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 118,000 Persian Gulf veterans suffer from the
chronic fatigue, headaches, muscles spasms, joint pain, and rashes
that characterize the syndrome, and the new results left many of
them yet again frustrated at the inability to properly diagnose
their decade-old problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most veterans expected this outcome. Most of them don't have
faith in government to resolve this,'' said Bill Frazure, a Gulf
War veteran from New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Institute of Medicine in Washington, was
designed to help devise a way to compensate ailing Gulf War
veterans. Its immediate implication was that veterans petitioning
the government for financial compensation cannot cite exposure to
the chemicals and vaccines studied as proof they are sick.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's more sweeping suggestion was that the apparent
nonexistence of data on what each soldier was exposed to in the
Persian Gulf permanently cripples scientists' ability to diagnose
the syndrome's causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that crucial piece of information, we cannot draw
conclusions regarding whether the agents present in the Gulf War
theater are the cause of the health problems among veterans who
served there,'' said the study's chair, Dr. Harold C. Cox, a
medical professor at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center at a news
conference Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's crew of researchers continue to examine 30 other possible
causes of the syndrome. But even if they eventually determine some
of the chemicals veterans were exposed to have long-term health
effects, they will not know which individual soldiers are ailing
from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know who was actually exposed to what. The
Department of Defense really doesn't know who was where when,''
said Dr. Samuel Potolicchio, a professor of neurology at George
Washington Medical Center and one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure data, he said, will ``probably never be available.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has spent an estimated $145 million
studying Gulf War Syndrome, and still classifies it as an
``undiagnosed illness.'' One-sixth of the 700,000 veterans who
helped wrest Kuwait from the Iraqi army in 1990-91 have filed
medical complaints since returning.
</P>
<P>
   Most have gotten treatment for each symptom, one by one, at
Veteran's Administration hospitals. But an underlying cause has
been frustratingly elusive. Initially, many thought the cause was
in veterans' heads, that war-time stress and hysteria provoked the
symptoms. The accusation irked many veterans, creating an
atmosphere of hostility and distrust of the government that
continues to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're blaming it on the vets. They want to tell guys it's
all in their heads,'' said Frazure. ``We're so used to this, we're
just kind of at the point where we just shrug our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the causes eliminated Thursday was the anthrax vaccine
injected in thousands of soldiers in the event Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein unleashed the lethal virus. But that didn't convince Paul
Perrone, 35, of Methuen, who served as a military police officer at
the US-led coalition's base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty convinced that the vaccines are the culprit. What
they say means nothing to me one way or another. They're either
stonewalling or just blind to the issue,'' he said Thursday, just
after returning from his neurologist's office where he is being
monitored for multiple sclerosis symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's study was an effort by the federal government to
corral a decade's worth of research to determine if the scientific
establishment had made any progress on Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reviewed thousands of studies on the chemicals
thought most likely to be the source behind the syndrome: sarin, a
deadly nerve gas that Iraq has deployed in the past; military
vaccines for anthrax and botulism given to many soldiers to guard
against chemical weapon attacks; pyriodostigmine bromide, a
compound taken by many soldiers to strengthen them against possible
chemical attacks; and depleted uranium, which many were exposed to
when military equipment was destroyed during combat.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concluded there is not enough evidence to say these
substances cause any long-term health problems. However, with
sarin, they said further study is necessary because the evidence is
extremely limited, most of it comes from victim studies from a 1995
terrorist attack on a Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside researchers criticized the study's approach in
examining the substances in isolation. They theorize that Gulf War
syndrome is a product exposure to multiple toxic substances that,
perhaps, make veterans more sensitive to everyday chemicals used
here. They worry the new evidence will lead to a new round of
skepticism about the veterans' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors who treat vets are very much influenced by studies
like this,'' said Dr. Claudia Miller, associate professor of
environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio.

HOME VIDEO: `KANE' WARS; NEW RELEASES AND POPULAR RENTALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Battle of Egos Over `Kane'
</P>
<P>
   Famous for gathering the Hollywood elite at San Simeon, his
California estate, the press baron William Randolph Hearst was once
asked why he didn't devote himself fully to movies rather than
journalism. ``He said: `You can crush a man with journalism, but
not with motion pictures.' That was his answer,'' Douglas Fairbanks
Jr. says in the documentary ``The Battle Over Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Released on tape this week by WGBH Boston Video, the 1996
Academy Award-nominated film depicts two gifted egomaniacs in the
process of discovering that, whether by movie or newspaper, those
most damaged could include themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by Thomas Lennon and Michael Epstein, the
film, made by WGBH and shown on PBS's ``American Experience,''
skillfully interweaves the gigantic personalities of both Hearst
and Orson Welles, the 24-year-old whose 1941 film starring himself
as the Hearst-like Charles Foster Kane still defines Hearst in the
minds of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, the methods Hearst had used to lay
bare the lives of others had been used on him,'' a commentator says
in the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Being portrayed ultimately as a brooding, isolated wreck, which
he never was, bothered Hearst, but he was primarily incensed over
Welles' depiction of his companion, the actress Marion Davies, as a
featherbrained drunk. Hearst tried to suppress the film by branding
Welles as a communist and a homosexual, among other things. Then he
tried to have the movie destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Welles didn't scare easily, or at all. In 1938 his radio
broadcast ``War of the Worlds'' and its invading Martians panicked
the country and left Welles, then 22, wondering if the fallout
would destroy his career. ``It was the only time I worked with
Orson that I saw him slightly afraid,'' one associate says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the furor greatly bolstered Welles' reputation and
landed him in Hollywood with a large contract. ``Citizen Kane'' was
his first film. ``He always lived phenomenally dangerously,''
Lennon said in an interview. ``Flying into controversy was Welles'
method.''
</P>
<P>
   But the portrayal of Davies was a mistake. In the documentary
Fairbanks calls her a delight, ``full of wit, humor, a glorious
gal.'' Welles, speaking in the film in 1982, three years before his
death, says the depiction was ``something of a dirty trick.''
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Herman Mankiewicz, the co-screenwriter of
``Citizen Kane,'' is labeled as Welles' partner in mischief. ``I
think they thought they could get away with it,'' says William
Alland, a Welles colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they realized how touchy the old man was and
this was Hollywood and there would be hell to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But even that would be all right. ``If Hearst sued that would be
great,'' Alland continues. ``The film would be news everywhere.
They'd drive the old man crazy, turn the town on its ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Welles' career never fully recovered from Hearst's onslaught,
which had lasting repercussions at the studios. Lennon said that
his own film was criticized for implying that ``Citizen Kane''
essentially finished Welles. ``His career wasn't over by 25,'' he
said, ``but it was limited in a way that haunted him for the rest
of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION TO MARS'
</P>
<P>
   Washed out of a mission to Mars for psychiatric reasons, Jim
McConnell (Gary Sinise) gets his chance later when the astronauts
run into problems with a huge human face they find embedded in the
red planet. The commander of a rescue attempt figures he needs a
man of McConnell's experience along. Brian De Palma's film reaches
for the great unexplainable out there, but, Elvis Mitchell wrote in
The New York Times, ``it has been a long time since such a
grandiloquent souffle of majesty and silliness refused to rise on
the big screen.''
</P>
<P>
   2000. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 113 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG. Release date: Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   `EAST IS EAST'
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, George Khan (Om Puri), the Pakistani owner of an
English fish-and-chips shop, battles to justify his traditionalist
and often brutal ways with a brood of seven children. Rebellion
turns George into a raging patriarch, but Damien O'Donnell's film
shies away from religious and cultural complexities in what becomes
basically a sitcom. When George's rage blows the film apart,
``O'Donnell's attempts to restore its tone of easygoing farce seem
awkward, even insensitive'' (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   2000. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 96 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   `THE QUARRY'
</P>
<P>
   In remote South African landscapes, tortured souls with generic
names like the Man and the Woman face daunting human and political
issues. After murdering a clergyman who made advances toward him,
the Man (John Lynch) takes up the minister's duties in a small
village, where he boards in the house of the Woman (Sylvia Esau).
The Woman, who is black, is having an affair with a white
policeman, who subsequently arrests a poor black man for the
killing. For all its susceptibility to symbolic interpretations of
God, justice and race, Marion Hansel's film is a ``first-rate
venture into mystery and suspense'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   2000. First Run. $79.95. 112 minutes. No rating. Release date:
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   `STIFF UPPER LIPS'
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sinyor's film struggles with what appears to be a long
overdue and surefire idea: a sendup of Jane Austen, Merchant-Ivory
style dramas set among the English upper classes. It's 1908, and
Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) is desperate to marry off her niece
Emily (Georgina Cates) to the pompous Cedric (Robert Portal).
Lower-class blokes take a hand, but as the film ``stumbles along,
its humor is so scattershot, its tone so wobbly and its casting so
uneven, that the movie never coheres'' (Stephen Holden).

DANGER STALKED REFUGEE WORKER SLAIN IN TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MIAMI _ He studied journalism and law, but those who knew Carlos
Caceres understood that he had loftier plans in mind, like changing
the world by trying to help clashing cultures understand each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 33-year-old United Nations refugee worker, who
grew up amid different cultures in Puerto Rico and Florida, died
while working in one of the world's deadliest culture clashes in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres and two other UN workers, who were stationed in West
Timor, which remains under Indonesian rule, were mutilated and
burned on Wednesday by an angry mob of militiamen opposed to
independence for neighboring East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Danger lurked all around him, including death threats, Caceres
recently told friends and relatives. Only a few hours before the
attack, Caceres told a friend via email that he and his colleagues
in the remote West Timor town of Atambua were warned of the
approaching mob, but he continued working on behalf of Indonesian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Militiamen armed with homemade weapons and semiautomatic guns
attacked the UN compound chasing away nine local policemen on
guard, according to information provided to the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Tipton, one of Caceres's journalism professors at the
University of Florida, said that when heard the news Thursday about
his former student, his ``stomach turned.'' But he wasn't surprised
to find out where Caceres was or what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time talking about how different cultures
get along,'' Tipton said in a telephone interview Thursday from his
campus office in Gainesville. ``He always seemed interested in ways
of bringing people together instead of focusing on their
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres's interest in divided cultures may have come from his
own upbringing, which was spent in Puerto Rico until his family
moved to Miami in the mid-1970s. Tipton said he and Caceres spoke
often about the interaction between Miami's Hispanic and
non-Hispanic cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he wouldn't go into journalism,'' added Tipton, who
also wrote one of Caceres's recommendation letters to Cornell
University Law School. ``There was a soft-spoken, almost fragile
quality to him, but it was clear to me he had a strong sense of
social responsibility to help change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Caceres's relatives demanded answers from UN and
Indonesian officials about the attack, like why the workers were
allowed to stay there despite the constant threats they received
from militia members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have got him out of there,'' the victim's father,
Gregorio Caceres, said from his home in Jacksonville. ``One of the
questions I have for the United Nations _ and I spoke to them
(Thursday) ... I asked: He knew he was in danger and he told me he
was going to be evacuated. What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres had worked for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
since 1987. Having also attended Oxford University in Britain,
Caceres held three doctorates and spoke five languages. He had been
in Prague for the United Nations and then in Moscow for two years
before being posted in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent notes he sent to his family, Caceres described
receiving death threats and hinted that he was not getting much
help.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Caceres told his family, he came down with dengue
fever, but continued his work helping refugees trying to escape
bloody fighting in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres's sister, Elba, a Miami resident, got an email a month
ago from him saying the Indonesia-backed militias ``by the way,
hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she said she couldn't understand why her brother would
endure so much to help people so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what made him decide that he so wanted to help
others that he traveled thousands and thousands of miles to help
strangers,'' she said. ``He would evacuate thousands of refugees
from the militia, and the refugees would look at him as God because
he was helping them. He gave up his life to help these people.''

 &HT;    Astronauts brush up on new skills to make orbital outpost a home &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Impressive resumes may qualify the
Atlantis astronauts as skilled pilots, engineers and medical
doctors, but their upcoming journey to the slowly developing
international space station will reveal whether they can also call
themselves movers, plumbers, electricians and cable installers.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Atlantis and its crew of five U.S. astronauts and
two Russian cosmonauts was scheduled to blast off from NASA's
Kennedy Space Center today (FRIDAY) at 7:45 a.m. CDT. But a chance
of showers or cloudy skies could force a delay, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   During an 11-day spaceflight, the shuttle astronauts plan to
dock with the yet-to-be inhabited orbital outpost to equip it with
an air-generating system, a toilet, fire extinguishers and exercise
equipment. During a spacewalk, two of the men will hook up
communications and computer cables and install an external
navigation device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've got a house up there that we're trying to get
ready for somebody else to move into,'' said astronaut Ed Lu, 37, a
physicist who dropped a career in solar astronomy six years ago to
join the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis flight is the first in a new flurry of missions
intended by NASA to hasten the long-delayed assembly of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   If the efforts of its crew are successful, the fledgling outpost
will be ready for its first resident crew in early November, a
milestone that should initiate at least a decade of continuous
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic problems forced a lengthy suspension in the
station's assembly soon after the first two components were joined
in orbit in late 1998. More than two years overdue, Russia's Zvezda
crew module was successfully orbited in July, adding a 43-foot-long
compartment designed to house three astronauts and cosmonauts at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 42,000 pounds, Zvezda required Russia's most powerful
rocket for the ride into orbit. Even at that, it could not be
launched with all of its life support equipment in place because it
would have been too heavy even for Russia's Proton launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the missing gear followed Zvezda into orbit aboard an
unmanned Russian Progress cargo capsule that docked with the
station in early August. Other gear is mixed with more than 2 tons
of new station equipment stowed aboard the shuttle, including
essential but bulky power storage batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The task of installing the life support equipment and unstowing
hundreds of pounds of other equipment from the Progress and the
shuttle was too much to leave until the November arrival of
American commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and
Sergei Krikalev. The three men plan a four-month stay, most of it
preparing the outpost for the arrival of future components.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a tremendously important mission,'' said
Atlantis pilot Scott Altman, 41, a Navy test pilot. ``I feel a
heavy responsibility as far as making sure everything is ready when
they arrive so they can get right to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle skipper Terry Wilcutt, a Marine Corps test pilot, will
supervise a crew that also includes Lu; Rick Mastracchio, 40, an
electrical engineer and former NASA flight controller; Dan Burbank,
39, a former Coast Guard search and rescue pilot; Yuri Malenchenko,
38, a Russian Air Force colonel and former Mir space station
commander; and Boris Morukov, 49, a Russian medical doctor and
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great project for beginning the 21st century,'' said
Morukov, who has waited for 20 years for what will be his first
trip into space. He will supervise the unstowing of the Progress
capsule as well as serve as the shuttle crew's medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans three shuttle flights to the station before year's
end, equaling all U.S. activity there since late 1998. A half-dozen
flights are planned in 2001, the most NASA has flown in a single
year since 1997. The upcoming missions will greatly expand the size
of the station, add the first of its science laboratories and equip
it with huge power generating solar arrays.

WEST TIMOR SLAYINGS CAST PALL OVER UN SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ First they gave a moment of silence for the
three dead men. Then the most powerful leaders in the world
Thursday asserted they would change the way the United Nations
protects people around the world from war, even with the tacit
acknowledgement it now wasn't protecting its own.
</P>
<P>
   In a historic gathering of 14 heads of state and a foreign
minister representing the nations of the UN Security Council, the
gulf between the official deliberations on peacekeeping and the
realities of keeping peace on the ground were laid bare in the
aftermath of the three UN aides, among them an American, brutally
murdered Wednesday in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the lone leader to speak
without a prepared speech, called the murders an ``outrage,'' and
said the world must pay tribute to them and to all the ``brave
people'' who work on behalf of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   wircop But the most important reaction, he said, was for the
leaders to act. The Security Council did just that minutes later,
unanimously passing a draft resolution that called for
strengthening UN peacekeeping operations by improving training of
personnel and the caliber of weaponry, defining mandates much more
clearly and speeding the deployment of forces to areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And it also called for ``effective measures for the security and
safety of United Nations personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks today are a lot tougher and more difficult than ever
before,'' Blair said. ``We're putting our people in far greater
difficult situations. At the same time, the need for peace has
never been greater. It can be determinative between anarchy and
stability for people around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council's focus was almost squarely on the
continent of Africa, where the UN has suffered a series of
peacekeeping failures. In Rwanda, it didn't act quickly enough to
stop the genocide that killed about 800,000 people in 1994. In
Angola, it pulled out peacekeepers after the rebel UNITA group shot
down two UN planes in 1998. And in Sierra Leone earlier this year,
rebel fighters captured more than 500 UN peacekeepers who had moved
close to their treasured diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the deaths of UN workers on another continent, Asia,
that caused the outcry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the Security Council deliberated, halfway around the world an
airplane carried out the three caskets of the slain workers, the
caskets draped in blue UN flags and covered with tropical flowers.
Several dozen frightened UN relief workers also were evacuated from
West Timor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The UN suspended its operations as Indonesia's military arrested
15 people after the militia-led mob destroyed a UN office in the
West Timor town of Atambua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at the UN, urged Indonesia to
``bring those responsible to justice, to disarm and disband the
militias and to take all necessary steps to insure the safety of
those continuing to work on humanitarian goals there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, humiliated before about
150 world leaders at the UN Millennium Summit, promised he would
work with the UN administration in East Timor on removing the
hostile militias from the border region. ``But to remove such a
number of people needs time,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The almost providential timing of the deaths coming on the eve
of the Security Council debate tragically reminded leaders about
the dangers of allowing the peacekeeping operations to continue
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   It underscored Secretary General Kofi Annan's push that the
United Nations must remake itself in the new century if it is to
remain relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sadly commented, many nations see it as irrelevent.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a ``crisis of credibility facing this Council _ and
this organization _ in discharging its gravest responsibility: the
maintenance of peace and security. Too many vulnerable communities
in too many regions of the world now hesitate to look to the United
Nations to assist them in their hour of need. No amount of
resolutions or statements can change this reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only action can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Annan formed a commission to study the
failures of peacekeeping and its recommendations formed the basis
of the draft resolution. The matter will now face several months of
fine-tuning and planning in order to build upon the current forces.
</P>
<P>
   One necessary change, several leaders said Thursday, will be
paying of UN dues. The largest debtor is the United States, which
owes more than $1 billion, much of it for past peacekeeping
operations. The US has withheld money in a conflict over how much
it should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like several leaders, said that the Council needed to
address the root causes of conflict as well as broadening the
definition of security. No longer should war be seen as the only
cause of insecurity, he said. Now, the list should increase the
deadly spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just AIDS,'' he said, even though his
administration has only designated AIDS as the sole disease rising
to the level as a national security threat. ``It's malaria and TB,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The three diseases, he pointed out for the second consecutive
day at the UN, accounted for a quarter of all the world's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we can break the iron link between deprivation, disease
and war we will never be able to create the feat the founders of
the United Nations'' had intended, to free the world from the
scourge of war.
</P>
<P>
   There was some disagreement among members on when the UN should
insert peacekeeping operations, including determining the factor of
sovereignty, namely whether the UN should respect a nation's right
to enforce the law within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin, who have crushed opposition movements in Tibet
and Chechnya respectively, both argued that the UN should tread
very carefully when it came to sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the biggest concern Thursday was quickly putting together
an effective UN force.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders expressed embarrassment with the current state of
affairs. Some said they were shamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inadmissible for our organization to be held hostage in
conflicts,'' said French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations,'' said Jamaican Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson, ``is facing its most critical test.''

ARTISTIC BLOOMS FOR A CITY PARK; A PICASSO GOES TO AUCTION; A
9,000-SQUARE-FOOT WORK OF ART; AN ARTS FESTIVAL IN DOWNTOWN
MANHATTAN; PHILLIPS APPOINTS A BOARD

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Target Stores has given $1 million to a
contemporary-art program at Madison Square Park in Manhattan. The
initiative, part of a restoration of the park between 23rd and 26th
Streets from Madison to Fifth Avenues, will feature work by an
international group of artists including Tony Oursler, Ron Mueck,
Janet Cardiff and Yutaka Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, announced this week by the City Parks Foundation and
the Parks and Recreation Department, is an effort by Target to
establish a presence in Manhattan, where it does not yet have
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give $1 million each week to communities across America,''
said John Remington, Target's vice president for special events and
publicity. ``We thought this was a way we could make Madison Square
Park an exciting cultural destination.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Landau, director of the City Parks Foundation, said the
foundation wanted the park to have a distinct identity. It asked
the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that presents public
art projects around the city, to come up with a creative program.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the difficulties of a project of this scale is
fund-raising in order to be able to do a knock-your-socks-off kind
of program,'' said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art
Fund. ``At the same time, we learned of Target's interest in
getting involved in a meaningful art project.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A three-year plan for the park will begin with the installation
artist Tony Oursler's ``Influence Machine,'' in which the artist
will project ghostly images onto artificial smoke and the parks'
trees and paths. It will will be on view Oct. 19 to 31 from sunset
to 9 p.m. A group show is planned for late May. A PICASSO COMES UP
</P>
<P>
   Just as Christie's is packing up the highlights of its Nov. 8
sale of Impressionist and modern art for an international tour
beginning in London on Sept. 15, the auction house is approaching
important collectors about a rare painting from Picasso's Blue
Period. ``Woman With Crossed Arms,'' a portrait the artist painted
in Barcelona in 1902, is expected to sell for around $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which shows a glum-looking woman seated against a
background of rich blues, has been owned by Mr. and Mrs. Chauncey
McCormick, Chicago collectors, since 1936. Besides being included
in many Picasso exhibitions (including in the first retrospective
of the artist's work, in Paris in 1932), it was on view at the Art
Institute of Chicago as part of ``Picasso in Chicago'' in 1968. The
painting remained there on loan until 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The last Blue Period Picasso to come up at auction was a
portrait of the artist Angel Fernandez de Soto, bought by the
composer Andrew Lloyd Webber for $29.1 million at Sotheby's in New
York in 1995. TRANSFORMING DIA
</P>
<P>
   As Chelsea continues to boom, so does the Dia Center for the
Arts. With the increased traffic of gallery-goers to the West 20s
every weekend, Dia is so packed that its ground-floor space at 548
West 22nd Street needed to be renovated to accommodate the crowds.
Rather than hire a traditional architect or designer, Dia turned
over the challenge to Jorge Pardo, the Los Angeles artist known for
his design-based creations.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of transforming Dia's 9,000-square-foot ground floor
into an artwork fits nicely with other artist-created portions of
the institution. Eighteen trees and stone columns that line the
block are by Joseph Beuys; Dan Flavin's fluorescent work lights up
the stairways; and Dan Graham created a rooftop park.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo has changed the facade, adding windows and enlarging
existing ones. He also reconfigured the lobby, moving the main
entrance and making the reception and ticketing areas more
accessible. Perhaps the most noticeable part of his design _ one
that extends from the lobby into the gallery space and enlarged
bookshop _ is the addition of tilework in bright lime, lemon,
yellow and mustard green covering the floors and the columns.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo is also creating murals that will be abstract, biomorphic,
brightly colored forms throughout the floor and has added large
glass dividers while at the same time visually connecting the
entire space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about tempting the edges between art, design and
architecture, said Michael Govan, the director of Dia. FESTIVAL,
DOWNTOWN
</P>
<P>
   The eighth annual Downtown Arts Festival begins Friday and runs
through Sept. 24, with more than 40 galleries and 10 performance
venues participating. This year the festival has added a
contemporary French art and performance series. It will also
continue to present tours by dealers of galleries in Chelsea and
SoHo along with talks by artists. The art walks begin on Saturday
in Chelsea. Information and schedules are available at the N.Y.C.
Lab School, 333 West 17th Street (691-6119). BOARD FOR PHILLIPS
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly a year since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
bought Phillips and only now is the company putting together a team
to oversee the auction house. This week it announced the formation
of a six-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Powell of Bayswater, a former foreign affairs and defense
adviser to Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, was
named the company's chairman in April. The board also includes
Mario d'Urso, an Italian senator who lives in Rome; J. Carter
Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery in Washington; Sir
Joseph Hotung, a Hong Kong real-estate developer; Gert-Rudolf
Flick, a London-based collector; Lord Camoys, lord-in-waiting to
Queen Elizabeth II and a former deputy chairman of Sotheby's; and
the Duke of Lugo, a manager director and senior adviser at Credit
Suisse First Boston in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has also appointed Thierry Millerand as its director of
French and Contintental furniture worldwide. Millerand, who began
his new job this week, left Sotheby's in February after 27 years. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a remote jungle of Guatemala, among the remains of a
little-known ancient city with a name meaning Place of Serpents,
archaeologists have uncovered one of the largest and most splendid
palaces of Maya kings ever discovered. Its 170 high-ceiling rooms
were built around 11 courtyards and spread over an area greater
than two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has found anything like this since the turn of the last
century,'' Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville and leader of the discovery team, said
Friday in describing the palace, which dates from the eighth
century A.D. ``What is most incredible about this site is that most
of the palace is buried virtually intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said that in size and preservation the palace, at a
site Cancuen, rivaled the buildings at the central acropolis in
Tikal, one of the grandest seats of Mayan power in Guatemala.
Earlier expeditions had either overlooked or underestimated the
size and grandeur of the palace and the city around it, a
prosperous center of commerce and crafts at the head of navigation
on the Pasion River.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery and the first excavations at Cancuen were made by
archaeologists led by Demarest and Tomas Barrientos of Guatemala.
The expedition is sponsored by the Guatemalan Institute of
Anthropology and History, the National Geographic Society and
Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily important find,'' David Freidel, a
specialist in Maya studies at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas who has no connection to the work, said in an interview.
``It's been a long time since a major palace complex has come to
light. A scientific investigation of the ruins should help us
understand political life in the late classic period of the Maya.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maya civilization was at the peak of its power in Central
America and Mexico from 250 to 900, known as the classic period.
The king who completed the palace _ inscriptions give his name as
Tah ak Chaan _ ruled Cancuen for about 50 years, beginning in 740.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Freidel said, the focus of Mayan political life
and state ceremony had shifted from the grand outdoor plazas to the
palaces, which means that the buildings' art and architecture may
reflect the changing relationships of powerful rulers, nobles and
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a preliminary study of the site and its inscribed monuments
has already produced one surprise: There is no evidence that the
city's rulers engaged in any major wars with neighbors. Nor is
there any sign of pyramids, the typically spectacular bases for
temples and manifestations of the religious roots of a city's
power.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of pyramid temples was the main reason previous
archaeologists largely passed by the ruins and failed to
investigate the true size of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries alone may cause scholars to reconsider some of
their ideas about the Maya civilization, Demarest said. Here was a
city that appeared to prosper for hundreds of years without warfare
or the usual display of religion as sources of the power of Maya
kings, particularly toward the end of their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a book in press that I'll have to revise,'' Demarest
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Maya cities, Cancuen appeared to use its strategic
position at the foot of the highlands, a source of jade, obsidian
and other valuable commodities, to become a commercial power
throughout the lowlands. Demarest said the city must have been
larger, richer and more powerful than anyone had expected. Its
rulers appeared to have been single-mindedly dedicated to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first excavations of residences disclosed that the
city had a relatively wealthy middle class and many workshops for
artisans producing elite goods for trade far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Jade is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. A young
middle-class woman was found in her grave with 10 jade inlaid
teeth. Workmen were buried with fine ceramic figurines with
beautiful headdresses. At a workshop lay a 35-pound chunk of jade,
which artisans had been slicing for pieces to manufacture
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Other excavations turned up large amounts of pyrite, commonly
known as fool's gold. Thin sheets of it were being used in making
mirrors, one of the more prized possessions of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All this might never have been uncovered if Demarest had not
literally fallen into the discovery of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of excavations at Dos Pilas and other sites in
northern Guatemala, where he found ample evidence of a highly
militaristic city-state called Petexbatun, Demarest decided last
year to visit Cancuen to follow up a lead. Members of his team had
found records of a marriage alliance between a Dos Pilas prince and
a Cancuen princess. She then came to Dos Pilas to live in her own
small palace.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the architecture and crafts of Cancuen, Demarest said,
``It looks as if the princess brought her own artisans, because the
stonework on her palace is just like that at Cancuen and far
superior to anything in the Petexbatun region.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the archaeologists looked more closely at the ruins of what
turned out to be the royal palace. ``To the untrained eye, the
palace looks just like a great, jungle-covered hill,'' Demarest
said.

   While walking along the ruin's highest level, Dr. Demarest fell
up to his armpits into vegetation filling one of the courtyards.
``That's when I realized the entire hill was a three-story building
and we were walking on top of the roof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, archaeologists have only dug test holes into the palace
ruins, enough to estimate the dimensions of the building. The walls
are build of solid limestone. They enclose a densely packed
labyrinth of rooms with 20-foot-high corbel-arched ceilings. The
team's leaders estimate it will take at least 10 years to excavate
and partly restore the palace.
</P>
<P>
   They are making plans to deploy a larger team of researchers and
excavators at the site next February, at the end of the rainy
season. The region is free of civil war now, Demarest said, but the
government of Guatemala has little presence there and it is still a
virtually lawless place.
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said the expedition has mobilized and trained the
people of the nearest village, El Zapote, to stand guard over the
newfound palace.

BAD TIRE, BAD ADVICE LED TO FIRESTONE RECALL, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jacques Nasser, the chief executive at Ford Motor Co., told
a committee on Capitol Hill this week that the problem of shredding
Firestone tires on Ford SUVs was ``a tire problem, not a vehicle
problem'' he may have drawn too sharp a distinction.
</P>
<P>
   According to some tire specialists, what may have happened to
prompt the current tire recall is that a bad tire met with bad
recommendations for inflation, that Firetone's ``tire problem'' was
exacerbated by Ford's desire to make its SUVs more stable in turns
and to give them a softer ride.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this, Ford recommended that its very popular Explorer
SUVs be driven on tires inflated to 26 pounds per square inch.
Chevrolet recommends that the tires on its comparable model, the
Blazer, which are supplied by other manufacturers, be inflated to
35 pounds per square inch. On its Ranger pickup truck, which is 300
pounds lighter than an Explorer but is equipped with the same
Firestone tires, Ford recommends inflation to 35 pounds per square
inch. Drivers expect a harsh, stiff ride in a truck; they are
asking for softer rides in their SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave owners of SUVs, those with Firestones
that they rightfully worry about, and those with other brands whose
concerns are more vague?
</P>
<P>
   Keep your tires inflated properly, say those in the tire
industry. Underinflation is the leading cause of tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   Take a heavy SUV with badly underinflated tires, said Marvin
Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire &AMP; Rubber
Association Inc., load it with people and gear, and run it for a
long period down the highway, and there's a good chance the tires
could come apart, faulty or not. Hot weather increases the
possibility of this. Of course, not every tire failure results in
tragedy; the highways are littered with the remnants of failed
truck tires, victims of weight, heat, and distance running.
</P>
<P>
   Tire failure is generally caused by overheating, Bozarth said.
This can be caused by underinflation, overloading, tire defects, or
a combination of all these things.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about an hour of steady running at high speed to
approach the heat limits of a tire _ usually about 200 degrees. The
heating is caused by flex, a normal bending motion in the sidewalls
of a tire that occurs as the car moves up and down, bouncing on its
suspension, and side to side in turns. The motion stresses the
tire's sides as the tread maintains grip on the road surface.
</P>
<P>
   If the sidewalls are stiff _ and higher inflation makes them
stiffer _ they do not flex as much. Phillip Zaroon, a member of the
Society of Automotive Engineers and owner of a company that is
developing tire inflation monitoring equipment, likens a bending
sidewall to a coathanger. Bend it slowly in a large arc, it heats
up, but not much. Bend it tightly and repeatedly and it overheats _
as a sidewall will do in an underinflated tire.
</P>
<P>
   Add hot ambient temperatures and long drives, and you can get
tire failure. Most Firestone failures have occurred in hotter
climates and in states where the roads are more wide open and the
distances routinely traveled greater than in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinberg, president and CEO of Watertown's Direct Tire
and Auto Services, said he has not heard of a shredded Firestone
tire in the Northeast. He has seen Firestone tires distorted or in
the early phases of separation, and, in fact, his stores have long
recommended that tires on Ford SUVs be inflated above the
recommended 26 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bozarth, of the tire and rubber association, said it is ``pretty
clear that the tire pressure (on Ford SUVs) was dropped for two
reasons:'' to answer customer complaints about a rough ride and to
address problems in passing rollover tests.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are basically trucks and have long ridden like them. Also,
because they are high and heavy, they tip more easily than lower
vehicles. But people want to drive them like cars _ quickly,
zipping in and out of traffic _ and with their weight, height, and
stiff, heavy tires, they are unstable at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   What can SUV owners do if they are worried about their tires?
</P>
<P>
   Keep them properly inflated. Recommended inflation levels can be
found on the doorpost of your car, the glove compartment lid, or
the cover for the gas cap.
</P>
<P>
   Check the tire pressure at least every month. Tires lose 1-2
pounds of pressure per month in cool weather, more in warmer
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most people seldom check tire pressure. And
that, said Bozarth, may be where some customer fault can be found
in the Ford/Firestone controversy. Explorers delivered with 26
pounds per square inch in the tires could probably operate safely
at that level he said. But that is near the bottom limit.
</P>
<P>
   And after a few months of driver neglect, there probably were
Explorers on the roads with as little as 16 or 18 pounds of
pressure in their tires _ tires that may have already had inherent
faults.
</P>
<P>
   But bad tires or not, said Zaroon, ``the horrors of
underinflation are well-documented.''

 &HT;    Bush trailing Gore in national poll, but still strong in Texas
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It all looked so effortless just a few short weeks
ago. Now, Gov. George W. Bush _ down in the polls and plagued by
news reports of gaffes and missteps _ is taking very public
criticism from within his own party and promised Thursday to retool
a faltering campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring, ``I am the underdog,'' Bush promised to interact more
with real people.
</P>
<P>
   Four new polls, Three national, and one in Texas, show Vice
President Al Gore gaining momentum among voters and now locked in
an intense race with Bush less than a month after trailing Bush in
most polls.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters/Zogby National poll of 1,001 likely voters had Gore
leading Bush 46 percent to 40 percent. Adjusted for the margin of
error of three percentage points, Zogby said the poll shows Gore
with a ``slight lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is running especially well among Independents, African
Americans, Hispanics and other key Democratic groups, the latest
evidence that he has secured his once-elusive base. He gained
startling ground among women, who traditionally vote Democratic in
large numbers but have, until now, eluded Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll of 738 likely voters has Bush
with 49 percent and Gore with 47 percent with a margin of error of
four percentage points. The poll was conducted Sept. 4-6. In a four
way race, including Green Party nominee Ralph Nader and Reform
Party candidate Pat Buchanan, Bush and Gore are dead even at 47
percent each.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken over the same period put Gore
up 47 percent to 44 percent, just two weeks after Bush was up 46
percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And a new Texas Poll shows that although Bush, the Republican
nominee, still holds a formidable lead in his home state, it has
eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bush has had a dismal few weeks but has kept it
close because the swing groups are close,'' Zogby said. ``The swing
groups are independents, where Gore leads, parents and voters who
live in $25,000 to $50,000 households. No one's won the presidency
without winning that group, going back to '72. And the two are in a
dead heat among those two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The Summer 2000 Texas Poll released today shows Bush still
enjoying a generous lead in the state _ 53 percent to 30 percent _
but Bush's standing is down from June, when he led 57 percent to 24
percent. The poll of 1,000 registered voters was conducted Aug.
7-30 and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials ignored the tightening Texas numbers,
voicing confidence despite the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whopping 23 point lead shows once again that Texas is
solid George W. Bush country,'' spokesman Ray Sullivan said. ``As
we saw in the race against Ann Richards in 1994 and in the
primaries this year, George W. Bush runs strongest as the
challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly and privately, though, Republicans are expressing
concern. On Thursday, conservative columnist Robert D. Novak,
advising from the nation's op-ed pages, wrote, ``George W. Bush
needs to change the atmosphere to keep panicky backers from heading
for the high grass.'' He urged Bush to seek a, ``face-to-face
confrontation,'' with Gore before the Olympics steals away already
scant voter attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, one GOP adviser said the campaign has got to
marshal more forces to give Bush - who dubbed himself, ``the
underdog'' Thursday - much-needed support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole theme of the national convention was, 'Read the
polls. We're going to win,' `` the adviser said. `` There was no
serious discourse on the agenda and how to sell the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He revived a familiar criticism, that Bush's tight-knit Austin
team _ strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and
communications director Karen Hughes _ must branch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are all the governors? Where's the calvary that's
supposed to be coming over the hill? Poor Bush is out there all
alone defending himself,'' he said. ``I think the campaign needs to
understand this is a big deal. You need 15 or 20 guys out there
every day pushing your message. Traditionally, campaigns expand the
tent after you win the nomination and you expand it again after
your party convention,'' he said. ``This Austin one's stayed a pup
tent.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent GOP Bush supporter circulated a three-page e-mail
lambasting the campaign for ads attacking Gore, failing to reach
out effectively to black voters and muzzling running mate Dick
Cheney, whose Halliburton stock options presented public relations
problems for the campaign for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's a loser,'' the Republican said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's post- convention bounce has been more sustained than the
Bush team anticipated. Some insiders are wary of a Republican ad
poking fun at Gore for his appearance at a Buddhist temple and they
say Bush's use of a vulgarity to describe a New York Times reporter
_ picked up by microphone at a recent campaign appearance _ made
him look like an amateur at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush's efforts to keep his message front and center
have been eclipsed by his refusal to agree to all the debates set
by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the bipartisan group
established to avoid just such posturing. He has so far not
committed to all three scheduled metes, saying instead that he will
debate Gore on ``Larry King Live'' and on NBC's, ``Meet the
Press,'' and in one commission debate.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby called the debate over the debates, ``preposterous,'' and
added: ``Every day he's focusing on it he looks like a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for
the Social Sciences at Dartmouth College, said candidates
routinely, ``play games about format,'' but that Bush can ill
afford them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bush's case I think it's a little more problematic because
of perceptions among political elites that he's not going to be
good debater, that Al Gore is going to make hamburger out of him,
that it makes him look fearful,'' she said. ``That's kind of
insider baseball stuff. If, in the end he ends up debating, most
voters will forget how he got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, campaign manager of former Sen. Bob Dole's 1996
White House bid, said there's plenty of time for Bush to recover.
He called Bush's Medicare and prescription drug plans steps in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a very substantive campaign on paper,'' Reed said.
``The convention speech was great. They just need to go back to the
basics of blocking and tackling when it comes to message delivery
nationally.''

COLUMN: CORPORATE BONDS ARE AN OVERLOOKED BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Please use this final version; SUBS for rewriting thruout)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which market do you believe?
</P>
<P>
   A look at the U.S. equity market shows a generally positive
picture. Valuations are high, and indexes of major stocks are near
record levels. Clearly, productivity and profits are expected to
stay high for the indefinite future.
</P>
<P>
   But in the credit markets, the outlook appears much bleaker.
There, money is becoming harder to find, and the price is
expensive. Lower-quality borrowers always have to pay more than
safe ones, but this year the spreads have widened significantly.
That would be expected if people feared a recession, but then one
would also expect to see the stock market doing much worse than it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation for this split is simple supply and
demand. The government is buying back Treasury bonds, so yields on
those securities may have been pushed lower than they otherwise
would be. But companies are borrowing at a rapid pace even though
investors have not been very eager to buy bonds. Bob Prince, the
research di- rector at Bridgewater Associates, a money management
firm, says higher rates have been needed to lure overseas buyers,
who now buy about a third of corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the widening spreads meant that borrowers paid
more, but credit to companies that willing to pay the tab did not
really seem restricted. The banks have been willing lenders, but
there are now scattered signs that they are growing more cautious.
Since late last year, more and more banks have been telling the
Federal Reserve that they are tightening credit standards. The
default rate on junk bonds has been creeping up, even as the
economy hums along with rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   This fall may prove to be the testing time for capital markets.
Wall Street is gearing up for another big dose of initial public
offerings, and Europeans _ who have provided a lot of the capital
to finance U.S. markets _ need to raise a lot of money to finance
wireless telephone licenses that have fetched amazing bids at
government auctions in Europe. If investors don't put up enough
capital, stocks could suffer far more than bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, something can be said for buying what others
don't want. Just now, that is debt. Corporate bonds won't do well
if the economy goes belly up, and they will not perform as well as
stocks if corporate profits keep booming for years and years. But
within that range of economic outcomes is a middle ground that
favors bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Fridson, Merrill Lynch's junk bond guru, reports that the
spreads of junk bond yields over Treasuries are now far higher than
his economic model would forecast _ higher, in fact, than at any
time in the past save for a brief period in 1998-99 after the
Russian default and Asian crisis, when investors feared a worldwide
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, the Bridgewater analyst, calculates that the divergence
between the pricing of stocks and of corporate bonds ``is near a
40-year high'' because the bond market has priced in plenty of risk
of economic disappointment while the stock market sees little risk.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is not likely to last forever. There is plenty of
reason to conclude that corporate bonds are a bet- ter buy than
stocks just now, and investors may be starting to do just that.
Though mutual fund buyers have shunned corporate bond funds this
year, AMG Data Services Thursday night reported a surge of money
into such funds in the week ended Wednesday, with junk bond funds
doing particularly well. The tide may be turning.

   Let Al Gore and George W. Bush spend and debate and struggle;
it's already been a good presidential year for Josiah Bartlet.
</P>
<P>
   Played by Martin Sheen, Bartlet is the fictional chief executive
in ``The West Wing,'' the NBC drama favored to win the shiniest
statuette for outstanding drama Sunday night at the Prime Time Emmy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   After its first season, ``The West Wing'' has already won a
Peabody Award, three Television Critics Association Awards and, two
weeks ago, four Emmys in the technical categories.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it's up for a batch of major Emmys _ outstanding
drama, lead actor (Sheen), supporting actor (John Spencer, Richard
Schiff), supporting actress (Allison Janney), writing (Aaron
Sorkin, Rick Cleveland) and direction (Thomas Schlamme).
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, ``The Practice'' was voted best drama, as half of
producer David E. Kelley's unprecedented drama-comedy (``The
Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'') sweep. The ABC legal drama is
nominated again this year, but the HBO mob drama ``The Sopranos''
is believed to be the main competition for ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' would be favored in a perfect world. Emmy
historian Thomas O'Neil says its loss last year prompted a bout of
soul searching at the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences and was
partly responsible for a change in the Emmy voting procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the old blue-ribbon panels that met in strictly
monitored sessions to determine the major winners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, videotapes were mailed this year to all qualifying
academy members, who pledged to watch the tapes at home. The
process is seemingly more democratic, but O'Neil is skeptical about
the voters' diligence. He fears that reputation and sentiment will
count for more than the demonstrated skills on the submitted tapes.
</P>
<P>
   So why won't ``The Sopranos'' win this year? O'Neil says the
fact that it's a serial drama is a liability. There could also be a
regional bias. Most Emmy voters are in California; ``The Sopranos''
is an East Coast production.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``The West Wing,'' ``The Sopranos'' and ``The
Practice,'' the outstanding-drama nominees are ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' which won the Emmy in 1996 and 1997, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Other major categories and predictions:
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY SERIES: ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Frasier,''
``Friends,'' ``Sex and the City'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' are
nominated. And the winner is ... ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' Nope,
maybe next year. There's no clear favorite. ``Friends'' has never
won, and this seems an unlikely time to start. ``Frasier'' won five
times and then got old. I like ``Will &AMP; Grace'' as the freshest
show in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  MINISERIES: ``Arabian Nights,'' ``The Beach Boys: An
American Family,'' ``The Corner,'' ``Jesus'' and ``P.T. Barnum''
are nominated.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting should be between CBS' ``Jesus'' and HBO's ``The
Corner.'' ``Jesus'' is just all right with me.
</P>
<P>
   TV MOVIE: ``Annie,'' ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,''
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' and
``RKO 281'' are nominated.
</P>
<P>
   I'd vote for ``Annie''; I think ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' will
win. HBO's ``RKO 281,'' about the making of ``Citizen Kane,'' is a
not-so-dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD ACTOR IN A DRAMA SERIES: Dennis Franz (``NYPD Blue''),
James (``The Sopranos''), Jerry Orbach (``Law &AMP; Order''), Sheen
(``The West Wing'') and Sam Waterston (``Law &AMP; Order'') are
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Franz, for a fifth time, or Gandolfini? O'Neil says Franz has
once again submitted a powerful episode. He seemed almost
embarrassed to win last year. But he'll probably cop another Emmy,
tying him with Ed Asner, Candice Bergen, Don Knotts and Art Carney
for most Emmy victories in a single role.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD ACTRESS IN A DRAMA SERIES: Lorraine Bracco (``The
Sopranos,'' Amy Brenneman (``Judging Amy''), Edie Falco (``The
Sopranos''), Julianna Margulies (``ER'') and Sela Ward (``Once and
Again'') are nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Ward, in a minor upset over last year's winner, Falco.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD ACTOR IN A COMEDY SERIES: Michael J. Fox (``Spin City''),
Kelsey Grammer (``Frasier''), John Lithgow (``3rd Rock From the
Sun''), Eric McCormack (``Will &AMP; Grace'') and Ray Romano
(``Everybody Loves Raymond'') are nominated.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be nice to hear Fox's acceptance speech, and we probably
will. O'Neil says he submitted the season finale, in which Fox, who
has Parkinson's disease, took his leave from the show. The episode
was an hour long, an advantage for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD ACTRESS IN A COMEDY SERIES: Jenna Elfman (``Dharma &AMP;
Greg''), Patricia Heaton (``Everybody Loves Raymond''), Jane
Kaczmarek (``Malcolm in the Middle''), Debra Messing (``Will &AMP;
Grace'') and Sarah Jessica Parker (``Sex and the City'') are
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters actually watched the submitted tapes, O'Neil says,
Heaton should win for an episode about premenstrual syndrome. But
I'm thinking Kaczmarek.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRAM LENGTH: It's not an award category, but executive
producer Don Mischer is expected to bring the Emmys in under the
four-hour, 10-minute record set six months ago by the marathon
Oscars show. This despite plans for several taped comedy bits
featuring Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   He (set ital)has(end ital) &LR;   &LR; to bring it in on time. We
reporters have deadlines.

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MAMBO KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Growing up in the South Bronx and East Harlem in the
1930s and 40s, Miguel Angel Amadeo witnessed the first golden age
of Latin music in New York, from the imported Puerto Rican ballads
known as bolero, played at house parties, to the dance and music
craze that crystallized in downtown clubs as New York mambo.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he says, he would run down Prospect Avenue in
the Bronx hoping to collect a few snippets of wisdom whenever
Rafael Hernandez, one of Puerto Rico's most famous popular
composers, was visiting his sister's music store, Casa Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he bought the store from Hernandez and renamed it Casa
Amadeo. Now, from behind the glass counter at his legendary shop,
he is part of a resurgence in the music's popularity, and a new set
of Latin music aficionados arrive daily seeking his insight into
the music and its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York-style salsa is my bread and butter,'' Amadeo said.
``I'm 67 years old, and I've been 50 years in the same business.
Most of the time when people come into the store, they can't
remember the title of the song. They'll sing me a little line, and
80 percent of the time I can tell them what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dial on your radio three times these days, and chances
are you will tune in to at least one Latin artist, whether it's
Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez or Carlos Santana. Each time a Ricky
Martin makes it into the mainstream, scores of new converts to
Latin music are born. At least a few will become intrigued by the
musical influences that shaped today's sound.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has long been a crucible for the Latin-American
music now known as salsa, a term that encompasses a variety of
styles including mambo, merengue and rumba. The city also wins
credit, in many quarters, for transforming big-band mambo, the
music and dance form popularized at the Palladium in the 1950s by
the Mambo Kings: Tito Puente, Machito and Tito Rodriguez. It lays
claim to Cubop, a fusion of bebop's brass and Afro-Cuban
percussion, born of collaborations between jazz and Latin musicians
in Harlem and downtown clubs. Some music historians say that New
York is responsible for the various dance crazes that went along
with Latin music forms, like the cha-cha in the 1950s and the
pachanga a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   This year City Lore, a nonprofit cultural group, and the
Municipal Art Society, a preservationist group, have created the
South Bronx Latin Music Project to begin documenting the music's
roots in New York. As part of the project, historians and
ethnomusicologists working for Place Matters, a program of City
Lore, are interviewing scores of Latin musicians, collecting oral
histories and researching the places where salsa was forged.
</P>
<P>
   They are putting together a map of Latin music landmarks in East
Harlem and the South Bronx, from mambo to salsa clubs, so that
future generations will know where they once stood. This fall, in
conjunction with the Point Community Development Corp. in Hunts
Point, they will begin offering tours through the 92nd Street Y.
The schedule for the tours, which are expected to begin in October,
has not been set. But it isn't hard to explore the heritage of
Latin music on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two neighborhoods where you will find most sites are
separated by the Harlem River, the tour should be planned in two
legs. The first, in East Harlem, can easily be managed on foot and
takes about an hour. In the South Bronx, traveling by car can be
practical; the sites are more dispersed, though most can be reached
easily from three subway stops on the No. 2 and No. 5 line. It is
best to plan the trip for a Saturday, since the music stores are
closed on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   On a muggy summer day, Angel Rodriguez, a drummer who runs the
Hunts Point Academy of Music, picked up four Latinophiles at the
92nd Street Y in a small van for a trial run of the tour through
East Harlem and the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history being made today,'' he said, turning backward
in his seat, with a wide grin. ``It took this long to document our
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the sites on the tour are grouped into two distinct
areas, they represent a range of musical styles from the 1930s to
the early '70s. What holds them together, said Roberta L. Singer,
an ethnomusicologist and one of the two directors of the South
Bronx Latin Music Project, is their contribution to the creation of
a New York sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those places, over time, are where some of the best musicians
from Cuba came to perform, and where New York Cubans and Puerto
Ricans went to perform,'' she said. ``And so they became the places
where the New York Latino community created a sound based on the
roots of the music, but relevant to their contemporary world.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins in East Harlem, or El Barrio, where in the
1930's large numbers of new Puerto Rican immigrants created ``a
circuit of clubs, bars and theaters that produced the first
generation of indigenous Latin band leaders playing for Latinos,''
John Storm Roberts wrote in ``The Latin Tinge: The Impact of Latin
American Music on the United States'' (Oxford University Press,
1979). Among them, he noted, were many ``who were to be major stars
of the U.S. Latin music's Golden Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stop, in East Harlem, is Machito Square, named after
the singer and maracas player Frank Grillo, known as Machito, who
is considered one of the inventors of Latin jazz. Machito, who grew
up in a building on the southwest corner of 111th Street and Third
Avenue, was known to hang out and trade musical ideas with other
artists on the corner of 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, and played
in many local venues. He went on to become one of the most
influential and popular big-band leaders of the 1930s, and his band
was a crucial link between Latin dance music and the innovations of
jazz. HOUSES OF WORSHIP
</P>
<P>
   On the northwest corner of 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, just
across the street from Central Park, is sprawling La Hermosa Church
with its white stucco facade. This was once the Park Palace, one of
East Harlem's hottest dance clubs, serving up boleros (romantic
ballads), guaracha (a Cuban form with a chicka-chicka pulse), and
charanga (Cuban-style music that accompanied the suave dance called
the danzon) from the 1920s through the '50s. A large music hall
upstairs could hold 1,500 people, and there was a smaller hall
downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Latin music's major venues in New York were converted
into churches as their popularity waned. David M. Carp, a music
archivist who is working with the Latin Music Project, said that
when Latin music entered the mainstream with the mambo craze in the
1950s, some uptown Latin clubs lost their appeal for the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin people who were born here wanted to find their own
places and didn't want to go to the same places their parents and
grandparents had gone to,'' he said. ``There was less desire to go
to an all-Spanish theater in your backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Carp sees the purchases by church groups as a broad phenomenon,
since many former clubs in central Harlem have also been converted
into churches. He points out that many former clubs have been
preserved as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theaters turn easily into churches,'' he said, ``and if you
look at these old places now, many are remarkably similar inside to
the way they were in their heyday.''

 &HT;    Friendly rivals Anderson, Davis hope to meet on field Sunday
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flowery Branch, Ga. _ One week after blowing out his right knee
last season, Jamal Anderson got a call from a buddy. Terrell Davis
was complaining about how bad he had it the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve of that guy!
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at home (after the injury) that first weekend when (the
Falcons) were at St. Louis (losing 35-7), and (the Broncos) were at
Tampa Bay,'' Falcons running back Anderson said. ``He said, `Man,
did you see that game?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Yeah, they were all over you, but look at it this
way: At least you're not hurting like me while sitting around.' He
said, `Oh yeah, right, right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One week later, Davis, the Broncos' running back, was out for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks apart, the NFL's two leading rushers in 1998 _ Davis
with 2,008 yards and Anderson with 1,846 _ tore the anterior
cruciate ligaments in their right knees.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also suffered a partial tear of the medial collateral
ligament and cartilage damage.
</P>
<P>
   The two men share other similarities. Although their teams had
met 10 months earlier in Super Bowl XXXIII, won 34-19 by Denver,
their teams started last season 0-4. Atlanta finished 5-11, Denver
6-10.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after their surgeries, they resumed competition with
each other. Unless Davis fails to cooperate, when the Falcons (1-0)
play the Broncos (0-1) Sunday at Mile High Stadium, it will qualify
as the battle of wounded knees.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to the badly sprained left ankle of Davis, who missed
practice Thursday for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the NFL released schedules last winter, Anderson, 27,
and Davis, 27, have been keeping tabs on each other's
rehabilitations and talking about playing this one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of eyed this game for our returns,'' Anderson said.
``I hope he gets a chance to play, I really do. I hope we have the
showdown everybody anticipates.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a sixth-round choice of the Broncos in `95, got to know
Anderson, a seventh-round choice of the Falcons in `94, through a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   One of Davis' high school teammates at San Diego's Lincoln Prep,
Charlie Brown, was a teammate of Anderson at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would talk to him on the phone and we'd always talk about
Jamal,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Anderson, from Woodland Hills, Calif., and Davis became
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was one of those things where we kind of had a chip
on our shoulders being low-round picks,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   After his surgery in October, Anderson told Davis that if he
ever had to go through it again, he would retire. In so many words,
Davis said, ``Yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davis got ready to go into surgery, Anderson tried to warn
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him when he was in the hospital to kind of give him a
heads up as far as what to expect,'' Anderson said. ``He kept
saying, `It ain't going to be like that; I'm not going to hurt so
much.' I said, `All right, Terrell.' ``
</P>
<P>
   It hurt a lot. But before long, the two of them were rehabbing,
doing many of the same things, and competing without putting pads
on or even seeing each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of cool, not cool, but interesting, when you have
another person in the same situation who's a running back,'' Davis
said. ``The one thing about Jamal I wish I had was that stiff
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the talk was in jest, as they occasionally called each
other by nicknames -- Davis ``The Dominator'' and Jamal ``The
Juggernaut.'' But much of it was serious.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, for example, knew that if he worked out on the field
before a Monday night game late in the season, chances were good
ABC would show footage of it on that night's telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me one time when Denver was going to be on Monday
night, and said, `Check me out. I'm going to be running,' ``
Anderson said. ``I hadn't been running like that yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking the next time we had a Monday night game,
I was going to run, too. There were competitive things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson drove Falcons' trainers nuts every week by telling them
what Davis was doing in his rehab. In Denver, for example, they
have a pool in which injured players rehab.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' old facility in Suwanee had no such pool, although
the team has one at the new facility in Flowery Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell was somebody to push me in a competitive sense,''
Anderson said. ``Our rehabs were very, very similar, except for
some philosophical beliefs that were different among the
trainers.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a bet, although Anderson won't get specific about the
subject or the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The two have played telephone tag this week, but Anderson is
willing to make another bet: Davis won't be a spectator Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's going to play,'' Anderson said. ``The only way he
wouldn't play against us, and particularly me, would be if his
ankle was broken in several places, and then he'd try to tape it up
and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect Mr. Davis to be in uniform, on the field, and
running like he never got hurt.' ``

 NEW YORK: their heyday.''  
  SOUNDS OF THE PAST
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turning back toward the center of El Barrio, you can find one of
the neighborhood's oldest music stores, Casa Latina, at 151 East
116th Street. When the first Latin music recordings in New York
were released on 78s, music aficionados would gather at this
unassuming narrow shop on East Harlem's main street to get the
first copies.
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner, at 1735 Madison Ave., is the site where
in 1927 Victoria Hernandez opened Almacenes Hernandez, which most
historians believe was the first Puerto Rican-owned music and
clothing store in El Barrio. Hernandez was the sister of the
composer Rafael Hernandez. In the back of her tiny shop she gave
piano lessons to several notable players, including the young Tito
Puente and the pianist and bandleader Joe Loco, who in the 1950s
was known for Latinizing popular American tunes like ``Blue Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Hernandez sold the store. (It is now a furniture store,
but a sign bears the shop's old name.) Two years later, she opened
Casa Hernandez, another music and clothing store, in the South
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   While you're in the neighborhood, you can stop in at the Museo
de la Salsa, a tiny museum devoted to the history of Puerto Rican
and Nuyorican music in a bodega called Made in Puerto Rico. A small
room in the back of the shop is packed with memorabilia, including
a conga drum and jacket worn by Joe Cuba, a Latin jazz innovator;
posters of early salsa concerts; and the trombone mouthpiece Mark
Weinstein used during the recording of Eddie Palmieri's classic
album ``El Molestoso.'' `THE ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL'
</P>
<P>
   The second focus of the tour is a stretch of the South Bronx
from Mott Haven to Hunts Point that became the center of Latin life
in New York after World War II. With East Harlem overflowing in new
immigrants, many Puerto Ricans and other Latinos began to move
north to the Bronx, where landlords were offering inducements like
a month of free rent to fill their vacant units.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who left El Barrio for the Bronx were some of the
most prominent musicians of the era, including Ray Barretto and
Hector Rodriguez, said Max Salazar, a music historian and writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the entertainment capital,'' Salazar said. ``From the
Hunts Point Palace, the Tropicana, the Caravana Club _ they've seen
the best performers from Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the Dominican
Republic and Brazil, Peru. They would be transported here to
perform for those audiences and they would always sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the buildings are now shuttered or have been
converted to churches or supermarkets, the facades convey a sense
of their former grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The southernmost site on the tour is the former Teatro Puerto
Rico, a family-oriented theater at 490 E. 138th St., at Brown
Place, now the Iglesia Universal del Reino de Dios (although the
sign also still says Teatro Puerto Rico). Regarded as the Latino
equivalent of the Apollo, it was once the hub of la farandula, a
vaudeville-style package of Spanish-language events that began with
singing, dancing and small bands or a chorus line, led into
acrobatic, magic and contortionist acts, and ended with a movie
double feature. The legacy of those spectacles lives on at the
church, which presents Latin gospel music, with full jazz bands on
its stage on Sundays. EVOLUTION OF SALSA
</P>
<P>
   The van headed northwest across the South Bronx toward the
neighborhood known as the Hub, home to a group of clubs that were
crucial to salsa's evolution. At 149th Street and Bergen Avenue is
the breathtakingly ornate Beaux-Arts Bronx Opera House, built in
the 1910s, which, through various incarnations, was one of the most
important Latin music sites in this neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The terra cotta cornice and pilasters framing double-arched
windows are now obscured by a meat market and the entrance to its
the Templo de Renovacion Espiritual. But you can still get a sense
of the size of the club, which once had a magnificent auditorium
with two balconies, a central skylight and a crystal chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   When it was the Bronx Casino, regular performers included Tito
Rodriguez, Charlie Palmieri and Johnny Pacheco. As the Caravana
Club in the 1950s and 60s the theater was pivotal to the emergence
of the pachanga dance craze; later it became El Cerromar, which
held dances even while the Bronx was burning; then it was La
Campana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where New York Nuyoricans made their mark,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, up Longwood Avenue and beneath the Prospect Avenue
elevated tracks, is Casa Amadeo, where the visitor might find
Miguel Amadeo standing in front of painted portraits of the Puerto
Rican composers Rafael Hernandez and Pedro Flores, and of Amadeo
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing north toward Hunts Point, at 915 Westchester Avenue,
you'll see the neglected former home of the Tropicana Club,
originally a Turkish bathhouse named for the famous club in Havana.
When Manolo and Tony Alfaro, two Cuban brothers, took over the
space, they covered the central pool with plexiglass so people
could dance above the water (the pool has since been filled with
cement, Rodriguez said) and put on grand floor shows accompanied by
Cuban cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The final stretch of the tour includes Southern Boulevard, once
known for a multitude of glamorous Latin nightclubs. There was the
Tritons Club, where Al Santiago's Alegre All-Stars had a regular
Tuesday night jam session; the Hunts Point Palace, the largest
(with room for 2,500 people) and most famous of the South Bronx
venues; and the Alhambra Supper Club, now gone.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING THE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   The tour doesn't offer many opportunities to venture inside the
old clubs, since most are now closed, but three music stores along
the way offer a sampling of the music that once filled those rooms.
(You'll need cash, since Casa Amadeo doesn't accept credit cards.)
Made in Puerto Rico sells only a few musical titles, but it has a
good selection of music-related books in Spanish and in English
that are hard to find elsewhere, and offers other nifty items
direct from the island.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Latina and Casa Amadeo are genuine troves of Latin music
run by owners who can help a novice delve into the most obscure of
obscure recordings. Amadeo's father was the popular Puerto Rican
composer Alberto Amadeo, known as Titi, who played in clubs and at
house parties in New York in the 1930s and '40s. Miguel followed in
his father's footsteps and took up guitar and singing. As a
teen-ager, he began writing songs, and now he has several hundred
copyrights to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early '60s, he performed in trios,
including Los Tres Reyes. He is received as a celebrity on his
annual visits to his hometown, Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Puerto
Ricans traveling in New York are known to make pilgrimages to his
store, where they can buy music unavailable at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what we call a community historian,'' said Singer,
``someone who's of the community and an archivist of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to him for ideas on a tune they want to perform or
record,'' she said. ``He's very humble and extraordinarily
knowledgeable. He knew and knows everyone. So if you go in there
and say, `I don't know anything about it, but I want some of that
romantic ballad music from the '50s,' he'll know what to give
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Amadeo is one of many people whose memories offer a link to the
music's past. Although many of the clubs covered by the tour no
longer exist, a surprising number of East Harlem and Bronx
residents still talk about them as if they closed weeks ago. As you
walk the streets gazing upon the landmarks, let them regale you
with tales of the old street life, their cultural lodestones and,
above all, the people who made the music. &QL;

 &HT;    Qwest plans to cut 11,000 jobs
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Qwest Communications announced plans Thursday for
massive job cuts along with a major restructuring aimed at slashing
costs and focusing on growth.
</P>
<P>
   About 11,000 of the company's 70,000 jobs will be trimmed by the
end of next year, most in the 14 states served by US West, the
regional Bell company that Qwest bought in June after a short and
unpleasant bidding war with Global Crossing. The Denver-based
company also created a new digital media unit and named David
Woodrow _ who had retired a week ago as executive vice president of
Cox Communications _ to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this because we need a streamlined company,''
Qwest Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio told analysts.
``We want to create an entrepreneurial atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort is a test _ not only of Nacchio's skill and vision _
but also of the notion that an upstart provider of high-speed
services can be melded with an old-time phone company. Like
BellSouth, US West was one of seven Baby Bells created in the 1984
break-up of AT&AMP;T. With US West's $35 billion acquisition, BellSouth
became the only Bell not part of a merger in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth did make a $3.5 billion investment in Qwest, a
stake now worth about 4 percent. Because Qwest offers long-distance
service and BellSouth has still not won entry into long-distance,
BellSouth can hold no more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, BellSouth and Qwest can market their services together,
and they have landed 150 contracts worth $310 million, said
BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher. For instance, the companies
recently won a $20 million contract to handle telecom services for
Winn-Dixie. ``That arrangement has been a success, especially with
corporations and big businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth is no longer the presumed senior partner, even
though its $26 billion-a-year in revenues best Qwest by nearly 50
percent. Qwest stock is now valued at $81 billion compared to $72
billion for the public shares of BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Qwest's expansive worth, it is still an enticing
takeover target for a foreign interloper looking for a foothold in
the United States. Most likely suitor is Deutsche Telekom, said
analyst Patrick Comak at Guzman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest was lambasted for buying US West by some analysts who
argued that the slower growth rates of a Bell would be an albatross
for the high-flying company. But Nacchio indicated Thursday that he
means to juice expansion, especially in Internet and wireless
markets where demand is growing quickest.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest predicted it will finish this year with sales of more than
$18.8 billion to $19.1 billion _ higher than previous forecasts.
Company predictions for next year's revenues were also ratcheted
up. Qwest said it expects to generate $1 billion in cash by selling
its stake in 15 companies at the same time that it is creating new
units in high-growth markets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the digital media unit will provide various
services using broadband _ the word given to describe any line
``wide'' enough to handle huge amounts of data needed for video and
other data-intensive transmissions. Those services can be delivered
either to television or computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted with some distaste to the announcements,
dropping Qwest stock $2.56 to $48.94. Some analysts were apparently
disappointed that Qwest's announcement was not more of a
blockbuster. The company also announced plans to increase capital
spending to $9 billion this year and $9.5 billion next year to push
construction of high-speed lines, but some investors may fear it
will also drain earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring to cut costs, the company is chopping overlapping jobs,
and most of those targeted jobs were in US West pre-merger, said
spokesman Tyler Gronbach. About 40 percent of Qwest's legal staff
has already been cut or moved to different places in the company.

&HT;     IMPEACHMENT PROSECUTORS' FUND GROUP PUTS OFF TRIBUTE TO STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (FILED in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political action committee raising campaign funds
for the House Republican impeachment prosecution team has postponed
a tribute to former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr scheduled for
Oct. 4, the PAC's director said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Roney, the House Managers PAC director, attributed the
decision to scheduling difficulties. He said the Oct. 4 date would
conflict with the end of the legislative session on Capitol Hill
and the desire of House members to resume campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But Roney acknowledged that the event ``was turning out to be a
little too political.''
</P>
<P>
   Roney and Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of 13 House Republicans
who served as prosecutors (also called managers) in last year's
Senate trial of President Clinton, decided to pull the plug after
the event piqued media interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was our blind ignorance, but we didn't think it would
be described as being political,'' Roney said. ``Even though it was
a fundraiser, we didn't want it to be viewed as political _ as a
lot of media were beginning to portray it.'' The managers group did
not want to put Starr in the midst of another political
controversy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The event might be rescheduled for some time after Congress
adjourns next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC has raised $70,000 to $80,000, ostensibly for the
re-election of the 11 managers running for re-election to the
House, as well as one _ Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. _ running for a
vacant U.S. Senate seat. The 13th manager, Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla, is not seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12, only McCollum and Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., are in
tight election battles. McCollum is neck-and-neck with popular
Florida insurance commissioner Bill Nelson. Rogan is battling
California state Sen. Adam Schiff in a contest that could become
one of the most expensive House races ever. Rogan and Schiff
together have raised $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998
and the failed Senate bid to remove him from office in 1999 have
always been a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   In polls would-be voters rank ``moral values'' high on the list
of significant issues, and most prefer Republicans on issues
relating to these values.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush regularly tells audiences that if he wins the election,
he'll swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, polls taken during the impeachment effort
showed that while voters disapproved of President Clinton's
personal conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, they opposed
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said people ``don't like what (Clinton) did, but they
want to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans such as Rogan cannot back away from their role in
the matter either, Sabato said, adding, ``When politicians show
fear, they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Rogan stresses issues of local concern in his
Southern California district encompassing Pasadena, Glendale and
Burbank. He talks about impeachment only when a questioner brings
it up at a meeting, his press spokesman Jason Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   The district is undergoing rapid demographic change, with
Hispanics, Asians and Armenians _ who tend to prefer Democrats _
gradually replacing Republican-leaning Anglo voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates, including Schiff, have
tried using impeachment to their own advantage. They have accused
Republicans of being consumed with scandal and investigations at
the expense of bread-and-butter issues such as saving Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican strategists view the impeachment imbroglio as a
nonstarter. ``It's not in our interest to keep talking about
Clinton and Monica,'' said one senior Republican official, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Starr now teaches law at George Mason University in Northern
Virginia and volunteers as an instructor at a high school in
Washington's predominantly black Anacostia section.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder.
Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing
1940s-style weepie, Gere is a superstar Manhattan chef and ``older
man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old
hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a
rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the
actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of '40s suds (Ryder's
character grows more ethereally beautiful the sicker she gets) and
millennial sexual angst doesn't jell (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``BLESS THE CHILD,'' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and
Jimmy Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny
supernatural soap opera _ the first thriller of the ``Touched by an
Angel'' era _ that tries for the elegant calm of ``The Sixth
Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly
cheesy reflexes. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the
gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target
of an evil cult leader (Sewell, chewing his English accent as if it
were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before Easter; you may
feel the need to leave long before then. ``Bless the Child'' seems
derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it doesn't
have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they
sample songs. With Smits as an F.B.I. agent and Ian Holm as a
priest who does a laughable steal from ``The Usual Suspects''
(Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``BRING IT ON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and
Eliza Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even
though it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy
outfits, this cheerleader comedy directed with giddy, sometimes
sloppy pep-rally intensity by Reed from a brisk, slangy script by
Jessica Bendinger is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery.
Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie and the
teen-age romantic comedy, ``Bring It On'' has a fine satirical
edge, and at least glances at some serious issues of race and
sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of
Dunst, ably supported by Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love
interest, and Dushku as his sister (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CELL,'' starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and
Vince Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes). A serial
killer named Stargher (D'Onofrio), who abducts women and imprisons
them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with water, has a
seizure and goes into a coma. His latest victim is trapped in his
cell, and she has to be found before the automated torture takes
her life. An FBI agent (Vaughn) talks a child psychologist (Lopez)
into using an experimental technique to enter the killer's
subconscious. Singh's talents haven't quite jelled into
storytelling yet. He folds this tale over and over on itself,
working with a script that blends elements of ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``The Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape''
and ``Spellbound'' with the stop-motion animation of the brothers
Quay (``Street of Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt
Mahurin, the paintings of Francis Bacon and so many other things
that there's no there there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CREW,'' starring Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan
Hedaya and Seymour Cassel. Directed by Michael Dinner (PG-13, 88
minutes). This sloppy, cliche-ridden comedy about four aging
mobsters blundering their way through a series of unlikely capers
has moments of wit provided by Barry Fanaro's overplotted script
and Hedaya's priceless goofing. But the picture, with no clear idea
of what it wants to do, lurches between slapstick and
sentimentality, wasting the talents of Dreyfuss, Cassel and Lainie
Kazan. Reynolds, meanwhile, absurdly cast as a New Jersey mafioso,
looks as bored and grouchy as the audience will be after 88 minutes
of this mess (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``HOLLOW MAN,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
Directed by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Verhoeven's sluggish
new special-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise _ the
corrupting effects of invisibility _ and drowns it in horror-movie
hack work. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself
with a serum that disrupts his ``quantum synchronization with the
visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his
colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Shue) through a
labyrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to
computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a
rampage (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``MADADAYO,'' starring Tatsuo Matsumura. Directed by Akira
Kurosawa (not rated, 134 minutes). In the course of his long
career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998, made a number of great movies.
His last film, ``Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the
narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his
masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a
kind of perfection. The story is not much: A retired professor in
postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his
former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say
farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's
absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for
his characters make ``Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way
inexplicably, satisfying movie (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,'' starring Eddie Murphy and
Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In
this sequel Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on
the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every scene in
which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth of
transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family _
all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``ORFEU,'' starring Toni Garrido and Patricia Franca. Directed
by Carlos Diegues (not rated, 110 minutes). The Brazilian
director's updating of _ and corrective to _ Marcel Camus' beloved
1959 film ``Black Orpheus'' _ suffers from trying to do too much at
once, to be both mythic and realistic, to celebrate Rio's rich
culture while exposing the brutality and cynicism that dominate
daily life in its slums. But in spite of uneven acting and a
chaotic script, ``Orfeu'' manages to keep its contradictory
energies from exploding all over the place, and in the end its
satisfactions outnumber its frustrations. This is partly thanks to
Caetano Veloso's eclectic score, though Alfonso Beato's lovely
cinematography and the violence and vitality of Rio itelf don't
hurt (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY,'' starring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike
Lee (R, 117 minutes). Filmed before a live audience on two nights
in February in Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy
swagger across the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits.
Until a couple of years ago the comedians' exposure was limited
mostly to cable television. Here their comedy gives audiences that
have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new world.
They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE REPLACEMENTS,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible
jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for
pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: Is
that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Reeves as
the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback. (He glides through.)
Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic
fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry Collection,
mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines
commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a pair of
violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a
violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league
(Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not
to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from
L.A., a union town: A film that celebrates antiunion activity
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SAVING GRACE,'' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of
comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British
eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case
a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a widow whose husband
committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of
losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener
(Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse
into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee
hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and
Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Eastwood. The
second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the
standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself leading a
heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones, Sutherland and
Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic,
tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is a
boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TAO OF STEVE,'' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-O'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex (Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless
pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance
as a nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring
with the ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee
over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less
interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a
steady relationship with a woman (Goodman) whose feelings were
trampled in Dex's compulsive fox hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem the
moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great time
getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Zemeckis'
film takes its time laying out the story of high-strung Claire
(Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria regularly. Her daughter
has just gone off to college and Claire is still recovering from
the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs
of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Ford), is a driven research
scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chilling
as any ``X-Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes, your interest
will have long vanished (Mitchell).

SENATE MOVES CLOSER TO DECISION ON TRADE WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate took an important step closer to a final
vote on President Clinton's major trade bill with China on
Thursday, as momentum built for final passage next week after
months of delay.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for the White House and the business community,
senators voted 92-5 to end preliminary debate and proceed to final
consideration of a measure that would establish permanent trade
relations with China and end Congress' annual review of Beijing's
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then rejected the first of several amendments that
threatened to undercut the bill. An amendment by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., calling on China to increase religious freedom
was defeated, 69-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration is focused on trade, which it is
now promoting as its human rights policy,'' Wellstone said. ``But
trade alone will never guarantee change.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee and one of most conservative
senators, joined Wellstone, one of the chamber's leading liberals,
in support of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in America still stand for something _ something other than
profit,'' Helms said. ``We don't believe China should be welcomed
into international organizations such as the World Trade
Organization while China continues to repress and to jail and to
murder and to torture their own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment, this one by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to
support the export of non-polluting energy technology to China,
lost, 65-31.
</P>
<P>
   A third measure, by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., to continue
Congress' annual review of China's trade status, was defeated,
81-13.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the contentious trade bill in May, 237-197,
and more than 70 senators are likely to support the measure in the
final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The only mystery left is whether senators will vote to link
passage of the trade measure to concerns over China's record on
human rights, religious freedom and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In any other context, many of the amendments would have broad
support. But if the Senate adopts any amendments, the bill would
have to be returned to the House, where supporters say there is not
enough time to reconcile differences before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation is necessary for U.S. companies to
benefit fully from a deal reached last year by the United States
and China that paves China's way into the World Trade Organization,
the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how lawmakers vote, China will enter the WTO. But
without the blessing bestowed by Congress, Beijing could withhold
some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other
members of the group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to passing a clean bill is a possible
amendment by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It would require the administration to monitor China's record on
the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technology,
and would impose sanctions if there is evidence of certain types of
prohibited weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top aides oppose the measure, arguing that the
legislation would hamper the administration's efforts to combat
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Support for it as an amendment to the trade bill appeared to be
eroding on Thursday. Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader who backs
the idea, met with supporters and opponents on Thursday to try to
arrange a separate vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Torricelli and another sponsor of the original
legislation, Michael D. Crapo, R-Idaho, said the senators had
strong reservations about supporting it as an amendment to the
trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Thompson-Torricelli measure expressed optimism
that they had enough support to defeat it..
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that we've got the votes, and I'm reasonably
optimistic that we do,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader. ``But in any election or any vote, only the
paranoid survive, and I think we've got to be sufficiently
paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will debate other potentially crippling amendments
through next week.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, for example, introduced six amendments on Thursday that
could come up in the next several days. They include measures
requiring the president to call on China to improve its human
rights record, to stop interfering with broadcasts of Radio Free
Asia or the Voice of America, and to condemn forced abortions in
China.

 &HT;    UPS slams FedEx, postal plans
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service Corp. officials said Thursday
they will seek to block a proposed alliance between FedEx Corp and
the U.S. Postal Service on legal and public policy grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can't favor one private company to the
exclusion of all others,'' said Tad Segal, a UPS spokesman in
Washington. ``There's going to be a lot of pressure to analyze
whether this is in the best interest of U.S. taxpayers. . .and
whether it's fair to government workers. It's far from certain that
the Postal Service is going to be able to pull this off.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Black, a UPS spokesman in Sandy Springs, said the company
also intends to fight any FedEx/Postal Service collaboration in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone pay FedEx prices for postal service?'' he
asked. ``They have the worst reliability and package tracking in
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Postmaster General William Henderson said Thursday that he hopes
to reach an agreement by October that would allow FedEx cargo jets
to carry Postal Service next-day deliveries. In exchange, the
Postal Service would deliver some FedEx Ground packages. The Postal
Service also would allow FedEx to install retail drop boxes at
38,000 U.S. post offices.
</P>
<P>
   The planned ``strategic alliance'' is far more sweeping than any
previous agreement between the Postal Service and a private
delivery firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``FedEx is the most efficient air carrier, and we're interested
in having FedEx carry all our (Express Mail and Priority Mail)
shipments,'' Henderson said. ``In residential deliveries, we're the
most efficient. We could deliver, in some instances, (FedEx's)
ground packages.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx is a leader in information technology and could give the
Postal Service package tracking, online ordering and billing, and
other electronic capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance requires approval from the Postal Service Board of
Governors, and Henderson expects to bring the panel a detailed
proposal in October. If it is approved, the organizations would
begin coordinating their operations early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no legal prohibition to our doing this,'' Henderson
said. ``The notion that we're seeking more efficient air
transportation shouldn't surprise anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the legal issue isn't clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot for FedEx and the Postal Service to gain,'' said
Paul Schlesinger, transportation analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette in New York. ``But the idea of an agency favoring one
private company in an industry where there's lots of competition
brings up some enormous public policy questions. In the end, it may
be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   An alliance between private, entrepreneurial FedEx and the
quasi-governmental Postal Service would represent a sea change in
the delivery industry and a direct challenge to Sandy Springs-based
UPS. UPS is the world's largest transportation firm with $27
billion in annual revenue, and FedEx is second with $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service brings in $63 billion in annual revenue,
primarily through its monopoly on first-class mail. UPS and other
private delivery firms have long accused the Postal Service of
abusing its mail monopoly by subsidizing next-day deliveries and
other products that compete with private firms. The Postal Service
also enjoys structural advantages since it doesn't pay taxes,
license fees or even parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Postal Service has been under pressure from recent
declines in first-class mail and chronic losses in next-day and
international deliveries. This year, the Postal Service expects to
lose about $300 million, its first annual loss since 1994. The
Postal Service has struck limited deals in recent months with
Airborne Freight Corp. and DHL Worldwide Express _ but those
agreements aren't nearly as sweeping as the alliance being
discussed with FedEx.
</P>
<P>
   UPS officials say the Postal Rate Commission and Congress should
ultimately decide the public policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   A Postal Service/FedEx partnership seems an odd marriage. Some
of FedEx's national TV ads in the 1980s mocked Postal Service
employees, and two years ago the Postal Service launched its own
series of ads taking aim at FedEx and UPS. FedEx sued to halt the
ads, but the Postal Service campaign continued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the acrimony, FedEx and the Postal Service have worked
together in the past.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx, founded in 1971 as Federal Express, was designed to speed
the delivery of canceled checks for the Federal Reserve Bank. The
idea never caught on, but Federal Express survived its lean years
by carrying U.S. mail at night on its small jet aircraft. Revenue
from the Postal Service kept the young company afloat as it
struggled through the mid-1970s to create a market for next-morning
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   When premium-priced, next-morning deliveries caught on, FedEx
dropped its mail routes.
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide currently handles the bulk of the Postal
Service's air shipments. But the two organizations have been at
odds since April when Emery sued claiming breach of contract.
Postal Service officials said Thursday that a deal with FedEx would
replace the existing Emery contract.

THE GREENING OF SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SYDNEY _ They are 400,000 strong, these gutsy competitors
gathered in an Olympic village the size of a gold medal podium.
They are the worms of the 27th Olympiad, a writhing mass of
spineless participants in what Olympic organizers promise will be
the most environmentally friendly Games in history.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a large bin in the basement of the Sydney organizing
committee's headquarters, the tiger and red worms eat, process, and
turn into compost an estimated 165 pounds of organic waste daily
from a staff cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The worm farm is among scores of ``Green Games'' projects _ from
a solar-powered athletes' village to roads pitched so that they
channel storm water for recycling _ designed to minimize waste and
resource consumption by the 500,000 people expected to converge
here each day from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the efforts represent an unprecedented bid to
expand the Olympic credo of ``faster, higher, stronger,'' to
include the environmental mantra: ``reduce, reuse, recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Care for the environment has been integrated into all the
planning, design and construction of the Games,'' said Michael
Bland, a former Greenpeace official who is environmental spokesman
for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. ``It's
not some kind of public relations campaign that was slapped on at
the last minute with a can of green paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the environment is surprisingly difficult at the
Olympics, which create, in essence, overnight cities with all the
sewage, waste and air pollution of major urban areas. Making
matters worse, most ``residents'' are tourists who are living on
the run and giving little thought to Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental concern has increasingly been part of Olympic
planning since the 1994 winter games in Lillehammer, Norway. There,
organizers recycled many of the buildings themselves once the Games
were over, even hauling the 500-room athletes' quarters most of the
way to the North Pole to house tourists and students. Sydney won
the 2000 Olympics in part because of planners' ambitious
environmental agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups have complained that Sydney Olympic
organizers could have done more and failed to achieve all the goals
they set for themselves. But even most of the harshest critics
acknowledge that Sydney has done something remarkable, going far
beyond the achievements of previous Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far and away the best Olympic Games from an
environmental standpoint,'' said Rupert Posner, an Olympics
campaign worker with Greenpeace Australia. The Greenpeace flagship,
the Rainbow Warrior, sailed into Sydney Harbor last week to pay
tribute to Olympic organizers' green achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, has gone so far as to declare that, in light of Sydney's
efforts, protecting the environment will be the ``third dimension''
of the Olympic movement, along with sport and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sydney seemed the least likely city to become a
role model for Olympic environmentalism, if only because of the
industrial wasteland where it decided to stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the competition and ceremonies will take place at the
Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay, a 1,900-acre site with a
two-century history of environmental abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles from downtown, its first industrial use began in the
early 1800s, as a saltworks, and later as a naval armaments depot.
In 1907, part of the site was set aside for a state abattoir that
eventually became the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, employing
1,600 people who slaughtered more than 20,000 animals daily.
</P>
<P>
   Futher degrading the site, part of Homebush Bay was home to a
brickworks for much of the 20th century, creating a landscape so
barren and ugly it was chosen as a location for the
post-apocalyptic movie ``Mad Max III: Beyond Thunderdome.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s and 70s, as Sydney grew up around it, Homebush Bay
became an enormous dump. Domestic, commercial and industrial waste
was strewn throughout one-quarter of the site, with enough refuse
to cover a football field with a mile-high trash mound.
</P>
<P>
   Wetlands had been filled, creeks had been converted to concrete
channels, and waterways were badly contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Although reclamation work began in the 1980s, it wasn't until
1993, when Sydney was awarded the 2000 Summer Olympics, that the
cleanup moved into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated into Sydney's proposal to the IOC was a detailed plan
to restore Homebush Bay's natural beauty at the same time sports
facilities were being built. The sweeping efforts fell into five
main categories: energy conservation; water conservation; waste
avoidance; pollution avoidance; and protection of significant
natural and cultural environments.
</P>
<P>
   From the first shovel of dirt to the eventual choice of
packaging used at the ubiquitous McDonald's restaurants at Homebush
Bay, environmental considerations frequently trumped commercial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results:
</P>
<P>
   -- The 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium was designed to save energy
with a sophisticated natural ventilation system that draws in cool
air while allowing warm air to escape. Similarly, the Aquatic
Center was designed to cool only the air surrounding the spectators
_ not around the pool _ which saves both on cooling the stands and
heating the pool. The Aquatic Center also was designed to
significantly reduce the use of toxic chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Existing wastes were consolidated into four containment areas
on the site _ large mounds essentially _ each of which was capped
with clay, topsoil and landscaping at a cost of $90 million.
Contaminated runoff from the mounds is collected in drains, pumped
into tankers, and taken to a nearby waste treatment plant.
Meanwhile, formerly damaged wetlands are being restored to a more
natural creek system.
</P>
<P>
   -- The design of the Olympic Village _ through methods including
shading, cross-ventilation, and energy-efficient appliances _
reduces energy demand by 50 percent compared to conventional
construction. Most of that demand is met by solar power, making it
the world's largest solar-powered suburb. After housing 15,000
athletes during the Games, the village will become a private
neighborhood _ prices start around $200,000. Solar power is also
used in numerous other places in the Olympic Park, including 19
huge solar towers that line, and light, the main thoroughfare,
Olympic Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   -- A dual water system was developed to provide drinking water
through one set of pipes and non-drinkable water _ recycled from
storm water and sewage effluent _ through a second set. The
non-drinkable water is used for irrigation and toilet flushing.
Streets and buildings were designed to catch and channel as much
storm water as possible to a complex filtration system.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plans to build the Olympic Tennis Center at the former
brickworks were changed when it was discovered that, despite its
polluted past, the site was home to the rare green and golden bell
frog. Special tunnels were built to allow the frogs to move through
the site without the risk of being squished. In a stroke of
particularly good luck for the frog, its green and gold coloring
matches Australia's sporting colors, instantly turning the
amphibian into an unofficial national mascot.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Sydney Games will be the first car-free Olympics, with
nearly all spectators using public transportation to Homebush Bay.
New train lines that can handle 50,000 people an hour were built at
a cost of $54 million to reduce pollution and increase access and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   -- To offset greenhouse gases, Olympic organizers have
undertaken the planting of 2 million trees, not just at Homebush
Bay but across Australia.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Olympic Torch was designed to be both energy-efficient
and non-polluting; ``solar buggies'' will move athletes around the
site; and building materials throughout Homebush Bay were chosen
for environmental friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers say there is no way to calculate the added
costs of the environmental efforts. ``They were integral to
everything, so it's not like we added them separately and asked,
how much could we save by not doing this,'' Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few items with environmental price tags are the
initial waste cleanup, which cost about $90 million, and the water
recycling plant, $10 million. The total cost of transforming
Homebush Bay and building the sports venues was about $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results have generally won praise, but some skeptics have
wondered whether the environmental efforts have been overplayed by
a public relations machine eager to polish Olympic rings tarnished
by bribery scandals and various smaller missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Take the worms as an example.

<P>
   There are four worm farms, including two at the main press
center and one at the Novotel Hotel at Homebush Bay, a javelin
throw from the Olympic Stadium. Their combined effect on waste
reduction, when compared to the 10,000 tons of waste anticipated at
the Olympic venues, will be something like removing a fraction of a
grain of salt from a super-sized Big Mac meal.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials, however, say the worms are only a tiny part
of the effort, despite their appeal to journalists looking for a
story. Organizers say they hope to recycle or compost fully 80
percent of the waste generated at the Games using more traditional
means.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite its general praise for the work at Homebush Bay,
Greenpeace Australia last month gave Games organizers an overall
grade of ``C'' for environmental performance _ one activist called
it a ``bronze medal.'' The grade was based on goals Olympic
organizers had set for themselves with Greenpeace's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace grades for individual elements of the Olympic effort
ranged from an A-plus for the athletes' village to Fs for
abandoning plans for a solar power station, and placing a
volleyball stadium in the middle of Sydney's Bondi Beach, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they've crossed the line in terms of delivering
Green Games, but they haven't delivered on everything they promised
to the world,'' said Posner, the Greenpeace official.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's biggest complaint was aimed at the presence of air
conditioning and refrigeration units that contain chemicals that
deplete the ozone layer and contribute to the buildup of greenhouse
gases. ``That's a real disappointment,'' Posner said. ``None of the
air conditioning on site will comply with their own guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bland, the Olympic environmental spokesman, acknowledged that
was ``the biggest downfall in terms of construction and
development.'' But he said the blame should be shifted onto
Australia's air conditioning and refrigeration industry, which he
said failed to make cleaner equipment available.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, officials of Olympic sponsor Coca-Cola _ the
largest user of refrigeration units at the site _ promised to phase
out greenhouse gases called HFCs in all its new cold drink
equipment in time for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also faulted organizers for failing to move more
quickly to clean up what it described as ``hundreds of tons'' of
dioxin still contaminating the land and mud around Homebush Bay. In
1997, Greenpeace discovered 69 barrels of highly toxic materials
abandoned on a peninsula adjacent to Homebush Bay, and Greenpeace
officials said they remain there, untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said cleanup work has been planned, and the government of
New South Wales, the Australian state where Sydney is located, has
committed $14 million for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said Greenpeace ``has a legitimate position because they
were there at the beginning of the process and now they're there at
the end.'' However, he dismissed the group's overall conclusions as
``a bit of a whinge,'' an Australian term for whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairly cheap publicity ploy,'' Bland said. ``At the
end of this process, I think it's pretty clear we've set a new
benchmark, not just for the Olympics, but for any major new
development.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush declares himself the underdog in race against Gore
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   YPSILANTI, Mich. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, once enveloped by
an aura of inevitability, officially went from presidential
front-runner Thursday to self-declared underdog and challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after exiting the Republican National Convention with
a 16 percentage point lead over Democrat Al Gore, Bush suddenly
found himself either tied with or trailing the vice president in
three new national public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the underdog. Sure I am. But I was the underdog when I
first started and nothing's changed about underdog status,'' said
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised a record $90 million for his campaign and led in
almost all previous poll match-ups with Gore over the past year.
Gore went to a Halloween party last year dressed as the cartoon
character Underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a very tough opponent. He is the incumbent,'' Bush
said. ``And a challenger is somebody who generally comes from the
pack and wins, if you're going to win, and that's where I'm coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane alluded to Bush's successful
fund-raising in reacting to the governor's newly acknowledged
status. ``He's the first $100 million underdog I've ever seen,''
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his campaign team promised to retool his effort, to
give his policy proposals more of a human face and to get more
aggressive with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may go more alpha male going down the stretch,'' Bush joked,
referring to Gore's hiring of a feminist consultant last year to
reshape his image from that of an underling of President Clinton to
that of a top dog _ an alpha male.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's statements were his first public admission that momentum
may have shifted from his campaign to Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week dismissed a Houston Chronicle report that his
advisers were privately concerned about trends in the campaign, but
Thursday he was confronted with a New York Times story that openly
quoted Washington Republicans as saying they were afraid Bush might
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he always expected the race to tighten this
fall. He said Washington insiders who talked to the New York Times
should have more confidence in his campaign's ability to turn
things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's people getting ready to jump out of the foxhole before
the first shell is fired in Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said. ``But
when you get out here in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and you
talk to the troops on the ground, they're excited and they want to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his battlefield analogies, Bush on Thursday
picked up formal endorsements from former Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Colin Powell and retired Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   In two new national polls, Bush and Gore are in a statistical
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News poll found the pair tied at 47 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, Gore led 47 percent to 44
percent over Bush, but that was a statistical tie because of the
poll's margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The
poll of 777 likely voters was taken Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore held a solid lead over Bush in a Reuters/Zogby
International poll. Gore led Bush 46 percent to 40 percent in a
survey that found 5 percent support for Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader and 2 percent support for Reform Party candidate Patrick
Buchanan. In a two-way race, Gore led 49 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby survey of 1,001 likely voters also found a tremendous
gender gap. Gore held a 21 percentage point lead among women and
Bush an 11 percentage point lead among men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held a major lead over Bush on issues such as
education, health care for children and campaign finance reform.
And he led Bush by 9 percentage points on prescription drugs issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a system teaming Medicare, the federal health
program for seniors, with private insurers to provide prescription
drug insurance policies. Gore would directly subsidize
prescriptions through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's advantage in the national polls, Zogby found a
virtual tie in the battleground states of the Midwest, with Bush
leading in the region 47 percent to 45 percent. A victory in key
states could deliver Bush an Electoral College win even if he
trailed in national popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very competitive race, especially among key swing
groups,'' said pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed. ``The vice president has run a strong race. But so
have I,'' Bush said. ``If people asked me a year ago if by Labor
Day would I be happy with a close race, if the economy was still
strong, I'd say sure. I'm under no illusions and neither should our
supporters be. It's going to be a tough contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush adviser Charlie Black of Washington said some of the
nervousness reflected in the New York Times story was caused by an
``artificially high'' lead Bush took out of his convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find more people nervous inside of the Beltway than
outside,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But Black said Gore did a good job with his convention speech
and benefited from three weeks of positive media coverage that the
vice president had not previously obtained in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be hand-to-hand combat for a while,'' Black
said, saying things could change with the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to give some ground Thursday in what had seemed an
impasse over debates, offering to begin negotiations. On Sunday,
Bush challenged Gore to meet him on NBC television next Tuesday,
but Gore refused until Bush agreed to all three events sponsored by
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Bush agreed to
only one of those, and had been unwilling to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I want to make it clear to you. I want there to be
debates,'' Bush said. ``I'm confident that there will be debates.
As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out
in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal Jillson
said Bush lost his lead because Gore capitalized on his convention
and dominated the issues for three weeks, especially with his
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jillson said then Bush's verbal gaffes and inability to explain
his budget plan one day distracted from his campaign efforts to get
his own message out.
</P>
<P>
   Jillson said Bush's personality may make it difficult to come
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a much better front-runner than a candidate trying to
make up ground,'' Jillson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a front-runner he tends to be buoyant and amiable,''
Jillson said. ``He's much more tight when he's trying to come from
behind. His face is tight and his posture is drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush is used to this
position, having come from behind in 1994 to defeat Texas Gov. Ann
Richards and then having turned his Republican presidential primary
campaign around after losing New Hampshire to Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has recaptured some of the traditional
benefits of incumbency, but Governor Bush likes his position as a
challenger. He likes being the challenger. We're going to work very
hard. Every day is going to be a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the campaign will do more activities like visiting
the homes of taxpayers to show how Bush's proposed tax cut will
save them money. Bush said he may start doing town hall meetings
again and hold fewer news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he is not going to let one bad set of polls
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been down in the polls before in this campaign, and I've
been up,'' Bush said. ``Every time I went up, a lot of folks in
Washington were right with me. And when the polls went down, they
started getting a little nervous.''

RED SOX OVERCOME EARLY TWINS LEAD TO TRIUMPH, 11-6 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For one dark moment on a glorious September afternoon,
grand old Fenway Park Thursday felt like Bleak House.
</P>
<P>
   A game the struggling Sox sorely needed to win was slipping
away. Fans who had cashed in comp days to cheer the hometown team
were all but covering their eyes at the ugliness. And it was only
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just when a crescendo of boos suggested all faith had been
hijacked, the Sox stormed back from the precipice, overcoming a 5-0
deficit to dump the Minnesota Twins, 11-6, and keep hope alive in
their quest for a place in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The win stopped the bleeding from a rough loss to Oakland the
night before and bolstered the Sox for Friday's opener of a
four-game showdown with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge,'' said third baseman Lou Merloni, whose three
hits and two RBIs were instrumental. ``Every game from now on is
big, but this one, it just seemed like we had to have this game.
There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial comeback was powered by a late-blooming power
hitter, Jose Offerman, and a supporting cast led by the
no-longer-dizzy Merloni, returning to full-time action from a mild
concussion, and the increasingly reliable newcomer Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   But it might have failed without a timely turnaround by Ramon
Martinez, who swiftly righted himself after the Twins shelled him
for the five first-inning runs. The game was a makeup of a July 26
rainout.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blow in the first was a grand slam by David Ortiz,
which was the third first-inning slam Martinez has yielded in his
last five starts. Jay Buhner hit one against him in Seattle July 31
and Will Clark crushed one in Baltimore July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Corey Koskie followed Ortiz's shot with a solo homer
to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out there and give up five runs, you don't have to
give up,'' Martinez said. ``You can never give up. You have to give
your team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did splendidly. After Koskie's bomb, Martinez retired
the next 10 batters and 16 of the next 17. He then yielded a bloop
single to Koskie and a run-scoring triple to Torii Hunter before
manager Jimy Williams inserted Jeff Fassero as the first of five
relievers who helped seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Martinez departed, the Sox were sitting on a 9-6
lead. And Williams credited Pedro's big brother for withstanding
the first-inning pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a sign of a guy who has been through the war, so to
speak,'' Williams said. ``He's a professional, to be able to
maintain his composure. He bent a little, but he didn't break.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez received a standing ovation when he left, not long
after many of the same patrons jeered him. And he can thank the Sox
hitters for giving him the lead that helped make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, power starved for much of the season, launched the
comeback by lacing a home run into the left-field screen in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   And Bichette, who doubled to open the second, scored on
Merloni's two-out single to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing to do when you're down 5-0 is try to get all
five back right away,'' Merloni said. ``You just chip away.''
</P>
<P>
   They chipped plenty in the fourth. Bichette made the first dent
with a leadoff homer into the screen, his second homer in as many
games. He said he is trying to use the pressure of the pennant race
to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is at stake right now,'' Bichette said, ``so I'm
just trying to enjoy it and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the inning ended, the Sox batted around, chased starter
Eric Milton, and scored five runs on three more hits and two walks.
The big hit other than Bichette's homer was a two-out, two-run
double by Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Sox a 7-5 lead, which they increased to 9-5 in the
fifth on a single by Jason Varitek, an RBI double by Merloni, and
Mike Lansing's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've always had since I've been here, the
ability to come back,'' said Varitek, who joined the team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the Twins scored the run off Martinez in the sixth, the
Sox countered in their half of the inning. Offerman led off with a
double to the gap in left-center. A batter later, Garciaparra lined
a single that left fielder Matt Lawton let scoot past him for an
error, allowing Offerman to score, making it 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's second homer of the day, another screen job, made it
11-6 in the eighth. It was his third homer in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in our offense,'' Williams said, ``and they did an
outstanding job on a day when he had to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday brings a new test, as Roger Clemens goes against rookie
Tomo Ohka, who was in grade school in Kyoto, Japan, when Clemens
was winning 24 games and pitching the Sox into the 1986 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of games and we've got to make up some
ground, so every game is big,'' said Bryce Florie, who pitched a
scoreless ninth to preserve the victory. ``But if we can do
something against those guys, we can put ourselves right back in
the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing bleak about that.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS FALL 14 VOTES SHORT ON INHERITANCE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans failed Thursday in their effort
to separate death from taxes, falling 14 votes short of overriding
President Clinton's veto of legislation to repeal the federal
inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to use the vote against Democrats in this fall's
campaigns, Republicans who supported the repeal argued that the
inheritance tax unfairly punishes families by taxing them twice:
first on the income and again when the estate is passed on to
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``are up to their old class-warfare tricks,'' said
Representative Sam Johnson, Republican of Texas. ``We don't want
Washington tax collectors operating a toll booth on the way to
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax, created in 1916 to raise funds for World War I, imposes
a levy on inheritances over $675,000. Congress passed legislation
during the summer that would phase out what Republicans derisively
call the ``death tax,'' giving $105 billion in targeted tax relief
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton vetoed it, saying it would frustrate efforts to pay
down the national debt while benefiting the wealthiest 2 percent of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a misguided bill that provides a huge tax cut for the
most well-off Americans at the expense of working families,''
Clinton said. ``It is a key ingredient of a Republican tax plan
that would leave nothing for Social Security, Medicare, education,
or a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and House Democrats were willing to work on a
compromise bill to help small business owners and farmers _ two
groups, both parties agree, who may be wrongly victimized because
the value of their family firms and farms is more than $675,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House leaders, however, insisted on attempting to
override the president's veto, forcing Democrats to vote a second
time against a politically popular measure two months before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   While the House in June approved the estate tax repeal by an
overwhelming 279-136, it failed Thursday, 274-157, to get the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, Democrat of Quincy, voted to
repeal the tax on both occasions. All other Massachusetts
representatives voted against the bill both times, except for
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Malden, who did not
vote the first time and voted against it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people can tell the difference between a
political ploy and those who want to provide a legislative solution
to what is a real problem,'' said New York Representative Charles
Rangel, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote, which followed an angry and often partisan
debate, began what is expected to be a series of congressional
floor fights on issues likely to be raised in both the presidential
and congressional campaigns in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Governor George W. Bush intends to use the
inheritance-tax issue against Vice President Al Gore, said Bush
spokesman Ken Lisaius. The attack could be especially potent in the
battleground states in the Midwest, which is home to many family
farms.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaius said Bush would have signed the bill into law. Gore
spokesman Doug Hattaway said the Republican bill would help the
wealthiest Americans first, giving relief to small farmers only
after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also hoping to embarrass Democrats by
highlighting their opposition to a bill that would eliminate the
so-called marriage penalty that forces many married couples to pay
higher taxes than they would if both were single. Democrats support
modified versions of the two tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a Republican-crafted measure to eliminate the
penalty, but Clinton vetoed it. The matter will come up again next
week when the House attempts to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Capitol Hill Republicans are starting to soften their
reluctance to support prescription-drug coverage and raising the
minimum wage, both issues Democrats have been using against their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Senator William Roth, Republican of Delaware, Thursday offered
legislation to provide $31 billion for temporary, quick help for
low-income seniors to buy prescription drugs. Democrats immediately
dismissed the plan as inadequate and a desperate attempt to cash in
on what has been largely a Democratic issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush this week released his $198 billion plan to cover
prescription drug costs for the elderly, arguing that Gore's plan
was too expensive and bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   But Hattaway of the Gore campaign said the Republicans are
``wrong on the issues, and they're scrambling to cover that up.''

ON WORKPLACE SLEEVES,   FEW POLITICAL HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ark., Fla., Calif., Colo.)   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By LINDA LIGOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention in Philadelphia last month,
Dean Dennis, an alternate delegate from Colorado, stood on the
convention floor shouting his lungs out for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Back at work, though, Dennis keeps his mouth shut about the
election campaign. As the facilities manager for the Pueblo
Convention Center, he said, he tries to keep his work life and
political life separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the type to back somebody into the company water
cooler and fill them with rhetoric,'' said Dennis, whose wife,
Ginette, is a Republican state senator.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall political campaign season gathering speed, many
politically active workers in corporate America find themselves
downplaying their activism while on the job, or at least keeping
their politicking below the radar of frowning managers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say overt political activism can cut both ways,
advancing some careers while retarding others, depending on the
circumstances. As a rule, though, both managers and workers seem to
prefer keeping it low-key, an approach made easier by the Internet
and e-mail communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political activism within the workplace is divisive,'' said
David Heller, chief executive of Internet Business Systems in
Campbell, Calif. ``If someone's got strong views, we don't want to
hear about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal bans are rare, but informal taboos are widespread. ``Most
companies operate on a `don't ask, don't tell' policy when it comes
to political involvement,'' said Eric J. Wallach, who heads the
employment practices group at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &AMP; Friedman,
a law firm based in New York. ``They don't want to act like Big
Brother and tell people what to do outside of the workplace. But
they want employees to be discreet while they're on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   That describes the attitude of Dennis' boss. ``I don't care if
our employees are involved in politics, as long as they don't bring
their activities into the workplace,'' said Mich Sauers, chief
executive of Global Spectrum in Tampa, Fla., which manages the
Pueblo center and others.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Erives' involvement in the Democratic Party is hardly a
secret to her boss at Qwest, a telecommunications company in
Denver: She took time off to serve as a delegate for Al Gore at the
party's national convention in Los Angeles. But neither Erives, an
operations analyst, nor her co-workers talk politics on the job.
``It's kind of an unwritten rule that we stay apolitical,'' she
said; the furthest she goes is reminding colleagues to vote each
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Why do politically active workers keep such a low profile? Some
do so because companies insist. While most states have laws
forbidding discrimination against private-sector employees because
of political activity outside the workplace, they also allow
employers to restrict the use of company time and resources for
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies do not deter some employees from engaging in
quiet, behind-the-scenes politicking beyond the boss' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick A. Sweeney, an assistant public defender for Allegheny
County, Pa., which does not have such a policy, said he is quiet
around his mainly Republican superiors, but often discusses his
Democratic views with co-workers, and even recruited several
interns to attend a fund-raising luncheon for Representative
Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of us who hash out a lot of the issues,''
Sweeney said. ``Lately, the biggest debates have been about
national health care and HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Company computer systems are often used by employees to quietly
send politically motivated e-mail messages or to surf political
sites on the Internet, often without management's consent. The
great majority of people who visit E-ThePeople.com, a nonpartisan
Web site that helps users sign petitions and send memos to elected
officials, do so from 9 to 5 weekdays in their time zones. ``People
are definitely using company time to get out their political
messages,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, the Web site's president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all employers try to ban politics at work; some
welcome activism, while many more look the other way. Daniel Lysk,
an asset administrator in Little Rock, Ark., said he proudly
displays his activism in the animal-rights movement and other
causes. His cubicle is decorated with anti-fur posters and
photographs of him dressed as a cow for a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   He once had to tell his boss that he might not make it back to
work on time after a trip to Indianapolis because, while there, he
planned to throw animal feces into the crowd at the Pork Expo and
might be arrested as a result. (He wasn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely influenced people at work to support animal
rights,'' Lysk said, adding that he also sends e-mail messages to
fellow activists elsewhere during the workday. ``I don't smoke, so
to me, these activities are my cigarette break,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many bosses might not appreciate such activities at work, but
Dave Dillon, who supervises Lysk, said he doesn't mind. ``He isn't
obnoxious about it,'' Dillon said. ``I let it pass.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw advantages in having politically active
employees. ``I find that people like Dan who are passionate about a
cause bring that same level of passion and caring to their jobs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing his view, for a somewhat different reason, is Douglas S.
Stone, a law partner at King Hershey Coleman Coch &AMP; Stone in Kansas
City, Mo. Its lawyers are accustomed to working with city officials
in navigating real estate deals. They feel at home in political
circles and are encouraged to be politically active. Stone was a
Democratic convention delegate last month and ran for a seat in the
Kansas Legislature in 1998. One partner is a former councilman; two
others have run for other offices.
</P>
<P>
   In such a firm, unanimity helps: all the politically active
lawyers are Democrats. ``We all sit around and tell George Bush
jokes,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses in other fields encourage employee involvement
in politics as well, often because the chief executive is
politically active. Many create political action committees and
encourage employees to contribute, said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington: ``At
some companies, soliciting political donations has become part of
the corporate culture.''
</P>
<P>
   An example is Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate, which even
suggests how much employees should give. Kenneth L. Lay, the
chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his stationery
asking them to contribute $1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said
Steven J. Kean, an executive vice president. This year, Enron and
its employees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush
campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ``We might
tell employees to go out and vote, but nobody tells them who to
vote for or passes out brochures,'' Kean said. ``That kind of thing
is just not acceptable in today's workplace.''  &QL;

RAMON MARTINEZ GOES FROM GOAT TO HERO IN ONE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You might be able to count on one hand the number of
times a Red Sox starter has surrendered six runs and eight hits in
5 2/3 innings _ and left to a standing ovation. Maybe even one
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez saw and heard both sides of the Fenway fan
Thursday. He was booed in the first inning, when five of the first
six hitters he faced scored, two on home runs. He then was treated
to the standing O five innings later, having allowed only three
more hits and, by that time, one incidental additional run. The
early 5-0 hole was quickly erased in Boston's 11-6 win over
Minnesota and Martinez won for the ninth time this season and for
the first time since July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, about this early stuff, Ramon. It's becoming a habit. How
many pitchers can lay claim to surrendering three first-inning
grand slams in a single season? (Five others also have given up
three grand slams this season, but Martinez has the first-inning
distinction all to himself.)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there are good signs for Boston when this happens. In
all three instances, the Red Sox rallied to win, so they are 3-0 in
games in which Martinez gives up a granny in the first. In two of
those three, Martinez himself picked up the W.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the first three Minnesota batters reached on singles,
and David Ortiz then deposited a 2-2 delivery into the right-field
stands. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan came out for a chat. Three
pitches later, Corey Koskie homered to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, much of Martinez's early troubles have been due to
wildness. In Seattle on July 31, he walked the bases loaded and
then gave up a granny to Jay Buhner. Eleven days earlier, he had
given up a first-inning slam to Will Clark in Baltimore. He has a
first-inning ERA of 11.35.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, Martinez had two strikes on each of the first
four hitters, so it wasn't control. What was it, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Martinez said. ``It was a rough first inning,
that's for sure. It happened before. I missed a couple pitches and
they took advantage of that. But I didn't change anything. I kept
throwing strikes and everything was better after that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a mild understatement. In a remarkable 180, Martinez
closed the first by striking out Torii Hunter and getting Jacque
Jones on a grounder to second. Thus began a stretch in which he
retired 10 in a row and 16 of 17, the only blemish being a two-out
single to center in the fourth by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Sox had caught and passed the Twins, thanks to
a five-run fourth which gave them a never-look-back 7-5 lead. It
was 9-5 after five.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the sixth, however, Martinez gave up a single to
Koskie. Manager Jimy Williams came to the mound. There was a chat.
Martinez remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   What did Williams say?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's between a manager and his pitcher. Good question,
though,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Hunter, tripled off the center-field wall.
Williams came out again and Martinez departed after 5 2/3 innings,
five runs, eight hits, seven strikeouts, no walks, 96 pitches, 25
batters faced. His ERA rose from 5.83 to 6.02. He he has pitched
more than six innings only three times. He still got a big ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sign of a guy who has been through the war, so to
speak,'' Williams said. ``A true professional. He kept his
composure and fought back. After that first inning, he was
outstanding.''

PRICE HIKES EXPECTED TO HIT OIL, GAS CONSUMERS THIS WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers of home heating oil should brace for stiff price
increases this winter after crude prices this week hit their
highest level in 10 years, speakers at an energy forum said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Supply is unlikely to be interrupted, panelists at the event
held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston agreed. But price is
another story, and hikes are expected to hit gas as well as oil.
</P>
<P>
   --Fearing recession, Clinton urges OPEC to boost output. C5.
</P>
<P>
   A US Department of Energy official cited projections of an 18
percent rise, to $900, in the cost of heating an average Northeast
household for the winter with oil, assuming ``normal'' weather.
Even though the gas supply to this area is now seen as more
reliable than oil, a larger price increase _ 25 percent _ was
forecast for a household using gas.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci opened the session with a stern warning
about the heating fuel challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average price for a gallon of heating oil already is
running well above last year's level and is expected to rise as the
weather turns colder,'' Cellucci said. ``And, unlike last year, the
price of natural gas also is on the rise, primarily because of
market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   New England was hit last winter with its worst heating oil
crisis since the 1980s after OPEC cut the world supply of crude and
a January cold snap set in. Heating oil prices spiked as much as
150 percent, to $2 a gallon, and glitches in the supply line
reduced the region at one point to a 10-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a disaster for elderly and low-income
people across New England,'' Cellucci said. Thursday's forum,
sponsored by the New England Governors' Conference and the New
England Council, was called in hopes of getting a jump in preparing
for another crunch this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for doing much at the state level are limited.
Two of the biggest factors affecting supply and demand _ OPEC
production levels and the severity of this winter's weather _ are
outside state control.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci urged everyone from President Clinton to individual
consumers to take a variety of steps he said could help. He called
for Clinton to:
</P>
<P>
   --Increase the size of a planned Northeast heating-oil reserve
recently announced by the president. Federal officials have said
they would buy 2 million barrels and store them at two regional
sites.
</P>
<P>
   --Approve the early release of federal funds earmarked to help
low-income families in the Northeast buy heating fuel. Making the
funds available sooner would allow the states to better prepare for
a heating emergency and encourage distributors to set up larger
reserves, according to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci advised consumers to winterize their homes at first
opportunity, buy heating fuel early before prices go up further,
and consider buying fuel at fixed rates. Distributors have stopped
writing fixed contracts, but probably only temporarily, according
to other speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter remains we are consuming just too
much,'' said Jack Sullivan of the New England Fuel Institute. ``If
there's one lesson that should be brought to every consumer, it's
conserve, conserve, conserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers noted that the price spike follows oil plunging
as low as $10 a barrel only two years ago. West Texas Intermediate
crude for October delivery closed Wednesday at $34.90 a barrel. It
closed Thursday at $34.39.
</P>
<P>
   Oil inventories were reported below normal, but industry
speakers said financial incentives to replenish them are lacking
with prices so volatile. Cellucci said the state will consider
offering to buy surplus oil after the winter so that suppliers
don't have to worry about being stuck with excess inventory.

NAKED MEN AND OTHER   SEASONAL PLEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By   JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a long, somnolent summer, Broadway came alive
again this week. Just hours after Labor Day turned into that
terrible Tuesday, rehearsals began for ``The Full Monty,'' the
musical version of the hit 1997 movie and a show promising more
male nudity than any Broadway production since ``Love! Valour!
Compassion!''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also brought the first preview of ``The Best Man,'' Gore
Vidal's 1960 political satire. Earlier, at an dress rehearsal,
Vidal took to the stage to trumpet the quality of this revival. ``I
haven't changed a word,'' he said proudly. Whether that was wise
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday two more fall entries began their out-of-town
tryouts: ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the
Universe'' in Seattle and ``Seussical'' in Boston. (More on this
later.) Farther afield a pair of productions from the same
household but on opposite sides of the globe may also gather some
serious attention from New York producers.
</P>
<P>
   The first is ``The Late Henry Moss,'' Sam Shepard's new play,
which opens with an all-star cast (Nick Nolte, Cheech Marin, Sean
Penn and Woody Harrelson) at the Magic Theater in San Francisco on
Nov. 14. Less certain but equally intriguing is the possibility
that Jessica Lange, who lives with Shepard, may take on Mary
Tyrone, the ephemeral mother of despair in Eugene O'Neill's ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night,'' in a November production in London.
Nothing is confirmed, but if it comes together, expect some
jet-lagged audience members at that premiere.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the big action was closer to home,
where a mix of the musical, the comical and the lyrical promised an
interesting Broadway season. At very least it won't put anyone to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSICALS
</P>
<P>
   The musical carrying with the heaviest burden of expectation is
the season's most lighthearted. On Nov. 9 ``Seussical'' is
scheduled to open at the Richard Rodgers Theater, having run the
gamut of gossip, from reports of early ecstasy to more recent
signals of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The costume designer was fired recently, and if the critics in
Boston can be trusted, the show still needs work. Writing Thursday
in The Boston Globe, Ed Siegel said the show was overearnest and
clunky, faulting its ``middle-of-the-road literal-mindedness.''
That said, he also predicted success on Broadway, thanks to a
catchy score.
</P>
<P>
   With the questions hanging over ``Seussical,'' ``The Full
Monty'' has emerged as a contender for the title of Big Musical.
The show finished a sold-out run at the Old Globe in San Diego in
July and, on the strength of supportive reviews, booked the Eugene
O'Neill. The show's advance buzz and advance sales have been
strong. It also has the jump on the competition; with a Oct. 26
opening it is the first musical offering of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The final new musical of the fall is ``Jane Eyre,'' which
bounced around the regional circuit for several years before a
successful run at La Jolla Playhouse in California over the summer.
In November it lands at the Brooks Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of dominance of revivals, the fall's only
return engagement is ``The Rocky Horror Show,'' and one would be
hard-pressed to categorize this 1975 camp favorite as standard
Broadway fare. (For those of you who missed the long-running
midnight movie, here's a synopsis: A couple gets lost and finds a
haunted castle. Freaks emerge.) The show, which opens on Nov. 14 at
Circle in the Square, has already won the award for the most
eclectic cast, luring a rocker (Joan Jett), a talker (Dick Cavett)
and a mocker (Lea DeLaria) into Frankenfurter Castle.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYS
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 new Broadway productions planned for the fall 6 are
plays. ``The Best Man'' will be the first, opening on Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   October will bring something of a modern rarity: two new plays
in a single week. The first is ``The Dinner Party'' from Neil
Simon, mounting his first new comedy on Broadway since
``Proposals'' in 1997. It opens on Oct. 19 at the Music Box.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24 ``Proof,'' David Auburn's mathematically tinged drama
about a father and daughter, opens at the Walter Kerr. It is one of
two transfers from the Manhattan Theater Club; the second, the
comedy ``The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' opens on Nov. 2 at the
Barrymore. Its advance stands at about $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``The Best Man,'' and ``Search for Signs,'' the other
revival of the fall is the Roundabout Theater's ``Betrayal,''
Harold Pinter's time-bending dissection of infidelity. The cast was
set this week: Juliette Binoche, Liev Shrieber and John Slattery.
The director is David Leveaux, whose stewardship of another
adultery-laden classic, ``The Real Thing,'' was a high point of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   As usual Off Broadway offers far more new drama. One proven
Broadway talent, the French playwright Yazmina Reza (``Art''),
opens her newest work, ``The Unexpected Man,'' at a big small
house, the 399-seat Promenade, on Oct. 24. Eileen Atkins and Alan
Bates star as strangers on a train.
</P>
<P>
   Some A-list American writers also have new work in store,
including Wendy Wasserstein (``Old Money,'' at Lincoln Center),
Craig Lucas (``Stranger,'' at the Vineyard), Susan Sontag (``Alice
in Bed,'' at New York Theater Workshop) and Horton Foote (``The
Last of the Thorntons,'' at the Signature Theater). Let's not
forget Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer cum showman, who brings
his one-man show, ``Les Mizrahi,'' to the Drama Dept. in October.
Mizrahi promises to sing, dance and sew every night.
</P>
<P>
   For clowning, however, it is tough to compete with the master
vaudevillian Bill Irwin, who will return to familiar territory with
Samuel Beckett's ``Texts for Nothing,'' opening in October at the
Classic Stage Company.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, known for his near-silent clowning with David Shiner (the
Cat in the Hat in ``Seussical''), performed an adaptation of
``Texts,'' directed by Joseph Chaikin, to critical acclaim in 1992.
This time Irwin is directing himself and doing just 4 of the 13
short monologues in ``Texts.'' The process sounded appropriately
Beckettian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage manager and I are in here alone every day,'' Irwin
said. ``It's different. And every day I work on it, it gets more
different.''
</P>

ON PRO FOOTBALL: SYSTEM FAILS, BUT PLAYER PROSPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.C.)   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding a franchise player in the NFL draft is one of the great
challenges of our time, even more difficult than deciphering the
latest rap lyrics or discovering intelligent life on other planets.
A scout once compared the excitement of watching a top quarterback
prospect to the day that he got married. It is true the scout needs
to get a life, but his words explain just how desperate teams are
to select that special player.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Philadelphia Eagles running back Duce Staley,
a franchise player if there ever was one, and someone who
exemplifies what happens when professional football's anal,
fat-pinching, stopwatch-obsessed system completely misses the boat
on a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Staley may prove to be one of the great runners of the next five
years, but when he was coming out of the University of South
Carolina in 1997, scouts called Staley too small and too slow.
Eight running backs were picked ahead of him in the draft that
year, none of whom have proven to be better than Staley.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's scouts try so hard. Each year they log tens of
thousands of miles going to various college campuses, staying at
hotels, motels or their brother-in-law's basement, just so they can
get up at 5 in the morning to time some college prospect in the
40-yard dash. Then, when the scouting process is done, teams design
computer graphs and flow charts that rival NASA's. They know what a
player ate last Thursday and if his children's children will prefer
boxers or briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone like Staley sneaks through the cracks and makes the
system look ridiculous. Last week against Dallas it was Staley,
practically an invisible man to the NFL as a college prospect, who
rushed for 201 yards on 26 carries, the fifth-best opening-game
performance since 1933. He became the Eagles' first 200-yard runner
since Steve Van Buren in 1949 and gives the team hope of capturing
the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Staley, after rushing for 1,273 yards last season, is
probably one of the top five to seven runners in the game, a
younger version of the St. Louis superstar, Marshall Faulk. But
where did Staley come from? He emerged despite an NFL system that
sometimes relies too heavily on numbers and not enough on what
happens on the field, which should be the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Staley transferred from Itawamba Community College in Fulton,
Miss., to South Carolina, where he stunned coaches with his
quickness and toughness. Still, NFL scouts were not impressed. At
barely 5 feet 11 inches and just over 200 pounds, Staley simply did
not fit the NFL prototype for a featured running back. So he was
picked in only the third round of the draft by Philadelphia, not an
obscenely low selection, but too low for someone with his apparent
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick Dunn, Antowaine Smith, Tiki Barber, Byron Hanspard,
Corey Dillon, Sedrick Shaw, Troy Davis and Jay Graham were all
chosen before Staley. Dunn has been mediocre; Smith and Barber are
solid but not as durable as Staley; while Hanspard, Shaw, Davis and
Graham _ supposedly bigger or faster players who would fit better
in the professional ranks than Staley _ were all busts. Dillon has
exceptional talent but is a troublemaker off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Staley is cognizant he was an afterthought in the scouting
process, and it remains a source of motivation. ``Sometimes you
have to fight through things and be a man who makes it happen
yourself,'' Staley said. ``Especially in what I do for a living, no
one is going to hand you anything. You have to pick yourself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the NFL does get it right, teams go against the
system, and pick that obscure player who fails to fit into the
picture-perfect frame. The Giants selected the Lambuth University
wide receiver Ron Dixon in the third round despite the fact he was
not from a football powerhouse. Dixon might be one of the best
picks of the entire 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   But too many teams stick to the numbers. One team's scout, when
rating Staley as an NFL prospect in 1997, was disappointed in his
speed _ he was timed at 4.65 seconds in the 40-yard sprint,
considered slow for a runner. A scout on a different team felt
Staley's smallish frame was too slight to accommodate his inside
running style in the pros. And yet another team's scout wrote the
following in a report, ``a backup at most.''
</P>
<P>
   The system hiccuped. It goofed, but Staley prospers. Now Staley
can only laugh, and his chuckle will grow louder as those
supposedly slow legs carry him to the Pro Bowl.

 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Bette Midler &LR; , who started her career singing in gay bathhouses in
New York and now has a 13-year-old daughter and a new TV series,
has changed her mind about raunchy material. The morality of the
modern entertainment industry, she tells Good Housekeeping magazine
this month, is ``grotesque. I mean, `There's Something About Mary'
_ that stuff used to be private. What happened? There are some
things that are completely off the table: really terrible language.
And drugs. And behavior that is uncivilized. Violence. Sex before
you're ready for it. Violent sex. Grossness. There are other ways
to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Midler's early material was created for her by  &UR; Bruce &LR; 
 &UR; Vilanch &LR; , the comedy writer who was in town this week promoting his
new book, ``Adventures in the Skin Trade.'' During an appearance on
BayTV's ``The Show,'' Vilanch seemed genuinely fond of Midler but
joked about having worked with her for 30 years and suddenly
realizing that on her new show she portrays herself as being merely
30ish.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends think Midler's new stance is ``ironic,'' said
Vilanch, but understand that it's a natural result of being the
mother of a teenager. Midler's husband,  &UR; Martin von Haselberg &LR; ,
used to do nude performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch laughed and remembered the old days when audiences would
shout, ``Gross us out, Miss M.'' And she would.

   &UR; Al Gore &LR;  has made a personal apology, by telephone, to reporter
 &UR; Chad Swiatecki  &LR; of the Flint (Mich.) Journal, who was told by the
candidate's spokespeople that he couldn't cover a Gore campaign
appearance in Michigan because the campaign stop was inaccessible
to wheelchairs. Swiatecki, who has used a wheelchair since
childhood, was told that both the press entourage bus and General
Motors plant site of Gore's appearance could not accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Swiatecki's first-person story about the denial of access
appeared in his newspaper on Tuesday, Sept. 5. ``They say the
squeaky wheel is the one that gets greased,'' he wrote. ``Well, Al,
I've got four of them. Can you hear them yet?''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Christie Brinkley &LR;  told  &UR; Colin Powell &LR;  at a New York
luncheon sponsored by Redbook magazine this week, ``I'm really
scared of  &UR; George W &LR; . I mean really scared.'' Said Powell, who was
quoted in the New York Daily News, ``You don't have to be afraid of
him.''
</P>

   Meanwhile, at the Deauville Film Festival, director  &UR; Robert &LR; 
 &UR; Altman &LR;  said that if Bush is elected, ``I'm leaving for France.''

will be very lucky to have a man of his stature _ and we'll welcome
him back to America in 2009.''

he has dictated a new song to her, entitled ``It's Heaven That
We're Dying For.'' But in Berkeley, Calif., &UR; Country Joe &LR; 
 &UR; McDonald &LR; , whose 1965 song ``I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin-to-Die Rag''
included the phrase ``It's heaven we're fighting for,'' says he
usually gets licensing fees for such usage.

   Collecting royalties from heaven would be difficult, he adds.

doesn't seem like the most flattering question). His answer:
``People will wonder what I have been up to all these years.''

MY MONEY, MY LIFE: AROUND THE WEB WORLD IN 44 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
(Catherine Bergart is a Web channel producer and writer.) 
 By   CATHERINE BERGART   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What can we do to get you?''
</P>
<P>
   Those are seductive words to hear at a job interview. I tell
them I want $145,000, when not long ago $90,000 sounded exciting.
They come back with an offer of $140,000 and 30,000 stock options.
I hit the ball back: $140,000 and 35,000 options. With those
options, I can buy shares at $1; I'll make $35,000 if I sell at $2,
or $350,000 if I hold out for $10.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deal. I'll get all that for helping to create a Web site
that will change the world for people with disabilities and their
friends and families, a job that will be more exciting, more
stimulating than any I've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   I've arrived. The world has finally recognized my true value. My
three major work needs have been satisfied at a shot: a position
that is commensurate with my age; success by the most common
standard _ money; and an opportunity to spend my time and energy on
something that I and my liberal friends and family respect.
</P>
<P>
   I give three weeks' notice at the ad agency where I'm working.
It's more than necessary, but I like it there, and I don't want to
burn any bridges.
</P>
<P>
   When I start at the dot-com the company has 70 employees _ up
from 20 just four months earlier _ and is already running out of
space. Thinking big is where it's at _ hire, spend, go all out,
win. Everybody gets a brand new ThinkPad, a good chair and an
ergonomic mouse pad and wrist support. We hire freelance writers at
$1 a word to create content, and we bring in professional
photographers to spice it up.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is high; the hiring continues. We're committed to the
value of the Web site, to the validity of what we're doing. We
aren't kids. This isn't one of those hipper-than-thou downtown
sites with hoops over the desks, music as loud as a club's and
20-year-olds trying to make a business. We have years of experience
behind us, as well as maturity and, of course, talent.
</P>
<P>
   I put in long hours, but no one is pressuring me _ I've got
goals and a personal commitment to making it work. For the first
time in a long time, I'm not dragging by 4 or 5 p.m. In fact, by
7:30, I have to force myself to leave my Manhattan office and catch
the 8 o'clock train so that I can get home by 9:15, get to sleep by
10:30, and get up at 5:45 rested and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is ever as good as it seems. A few weeks into the
job, there are cracks in the bliss. Roles aren't clearly defined.
Where does one person's power give way to another's? Who makes this
or that decision?
</P>
<P>
   What did the chief executive tell you? That's not what he told
me. People are whispering at the copying machine. We need better
technology. We need better content. We need better marketing. We
need to produce income faster. The investors are antsy. They're
breathing down the chief executive's neck. He's got to slow his
burn rate. He's got to find and eliminate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive schedules a 9:30 a.m. meeting. Another pep
talk, no doubt. We'll hear that we're all in this together; the
competition is good but not as good as us. He will say he has made
mistakes. We've all made mistakes. Let's just learn from our
mistakes and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But he reschedules the meeting to noon and asks that everyone be
available until then. Over the course of that morning, he dismisses
the chief financial officer, the chief technology officer the chief
Web site officer and some of us higher-paid staff. It's been six
weeks and two days, a sizable experience in Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   Mourn the loss of a job I loved. The stars and planets won't
ever be so perfectly aligned again. But by the remarkable rules of
the new economy, my six weeks' experience at a dot-com has
propelled me up the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunters now cast me about at an even higher salary and title
than before, and the fish are biting.

JUDGE ORDERS CULT MEMBER CONFINED UNTIL HER BABY IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATTLEBORO _ Saying he has heard the voice of a cult member's
fetus pleading from the womb, a judge ordered the woman to remain
confined and closely monitored to ensure the child is born healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol County assistant District Attorney Gerald Fitzgerald
told reporters that, towards the end of a day-long closed hearing,
District Judge Kenneth P. Nasif said that his role in protecting
Rebecca Corneau's fetus had enabled him to hear that unborn child's
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it says `I want to live. I do not want to die. I do not
want to die like my brother Jeremiah did,' '' Fitzgerald said,
quoting Nasif's words from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said the judge also told the courtroom: ``I believe
that Jeremiah died by asphyxiating some contents of the birth
canal. And I believe that this baby could die like Jeremiah.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the religious cult have been jailed for almost a year
because they have refused to provide authorities with information
about Jeremiah and another baby who are missing and believed dead
but whose bodies have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Corneau was ordered into custody by Nasif on Aug. 31 at
the request of prosecutors who feared for the welfare of her unborn
child.
</P>
<P>
   While Corneau still refuses a medical exam or even to answer
medical questions about her fetus, Judge Nasif ordered that a
medical `command post' be created using staff from Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center to stand by in case there's a medical
emergency during the birth.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, Judge Nasif confirmed his
quotes in a case which continues to draw national attention as
women's rights activists challenge Corneau's confinement as a
violation of her rights
</P>
<P>
   ``A case of this nature quite frankly for me is difficult from a
technical, legal, right-or-wrong point of view,'' the judge said.
``But in terms of the morality of my decision, it is not difficult
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasif said that during the entire hearing, Rebecca Corneau never
asked to be allowed to go home, but she consistently and pleasantly
refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very polite,'' said John J. Rego, a Rhode Island
attorney appointed to represent Corneau's fetus. ``She doesn't show
any emotion. She just looks straight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rego said the judge took under advisement a contempt of court
order against Corneau filed by him on behalf of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Thursday's hearing, Corneau's husband, David,
sought legal counsel for the first time since he was jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a criminal investigation into the
disappearances of the two children.
</P>
<P>
   After attorney Jane Sullivan agreed to represent him, David
Corneau, 32, asked both she and the judge if arrangements could be
made for him to be notified in jail about the birth of his child.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Corneau, also 32, who is estimated to be about 8 1/2
months pregnant, was placed in a Roxbury facility for pregnant
women in state custody last week after repeatedly refusing a
court-ordered medical examination.
</P>
<P>
   Corneau and the group she belongs to have rejected conventional
medicine as blasphemy, believing instead in the power of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian sect, whose members reside in Attleboro and
Seekonk, came under scrutiny in November when they were suspected
of covering up the deaths of Jeremiah Corneau and 10-month-old
Samuel Robidoux, son of cult leader Jacques Robidoux.
</P>
<P>
   David Corneau has told police Jeremiah was stillborn and buried
by the group. Police believe Samuel starved to death when he
stopped breast feeding. But, according to court records, members of
the sect have refused to provide the whereabouts of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Searches throughout Massachusetts and Baxter State Park in Maine
have turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the investigation a number of children from the
cult were taken into state custody and Rebecca Corneau was declared
an unfit mother.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nasif extended the order keeping Rebecca Corneau in
custody for another 30 days or until her child is born, which was
expected to be soon.
</P>
<P>
   The fetus, known as `Unborn Child Corneau' in court papers, has
dropped, according to medical staff at the facility where Corneau
is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not far away...from a childbirth here,'' said Bristol
County District Attorney Paul F. Walsh Jr.
</P>
<P>
   If a medical emergency does take place during birth, Walsh said
the judge would have to issue a court order allowing others to help
Corneau and the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Because Corneau has been declared an unfit mother, her newborn
would immediately be turned over to the custody of the state
Department of Social Services. At that point, Walsh said, Corneau
would be free to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Nasif's latest rulings come a day after Walsh defended his
office's actions in the face of a rare legal appeal before the
state's Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   In that petition, a Norfolk County woman identified in court
papers only as Barbara F. asked the state's highest court to throw
out Nasif's ruling against Rebecca Corneau, saying it imperils the
rights of all pregnant women. Thursday the American Civil Liberties
Union filed a friend of the court brief in support of Corneau's
release.
</P>
<P>
   An SJC decision is expected sometime soon.

 &HT;    Suit by ex-safety inspector attacks processes at GM
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Motors Corp. has delivered possibly tens of
thousands of dangerous vehicles with loose fuel lines, missing
steering-gear bolts and other defects, alleges an Atlanta-area
employee with a whistle-blower lawsuit in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Richard Story will probably keep GM's
vehicle inspection data sealed under a protective order for the
time being, he said Thursday during his first hearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to put this in front of the public,'' said William
McAleer, a former GM safety inspector who alleges that owners of
most of GM's millions of cars and trucks produced since the
mid-1990s are ``playing Russian roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that GM forced McAleer, 51, out of the
vehicle final inspection program he managed and helped develop
after he tried for years to get GM to fix production problems
causing life-threatening defects in one-quarter of 1 percent to 1
percent of the automakers' cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really have a job,'' said McAleer's Atlanta
attorney, Rose Goff. She said McAleer, still a GM employee who
lives in Woodstock, currently works with a supplier in Alabama
about once a week.
</P>
<P>
   GM denies the allegations. The automaker says McAleer
overestimated the number of quality problems and was told of his
new assignment before he raised the alleged defect issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reassignment had nothing to do with him raising quality
concerns, as evidenced by the fact that GM responded to issues he
raised in a positive fashion by enhancing our quality procedures,''
the company said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   McAleer originally filed suit in Fulton County Superior Court
last October after GM refused a settlement offer for ``$12 million
and to get the cars off the road,'' said Goff. The lawsuit was
later transferred to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Story said he will consolidate a related age
discrimination lawsuit, filed last week, with McAleer's
whistle-blower case.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawsuits ask for back pay and unspecified damages for
emotional distress, plus punitive damages against Detroit-based GM
under Michigan's whistle-blower law.
</P>
<P>
   ``His career at GM is effectively over,'' said Goff.
</P>
<P>
   McAleer alleges that GM forced him from the safety inspection
program in 1998 and tried to get him to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Goff asked the court to order GM to release its safety
inspection data as open court records. But Story instructed GM's
and McAleer's lawyers to draft a proposed confidentiality agreement
before he will order GM to produce the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Story also said his ``inclination'' is not to order GM President
G. Richard Wagoner Jr. and another top executive to testify in
depositions, as Goff requested. Story is expected to rule next week
on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   McAleer said he and other inspectors inspected about 30 vehicles
monthly from each of GM's North American plants. They found two to
eight ``catastrophic safety defects'' each month, he said, out of
the 1,000 vehicles they inspected and drove over a short test track
designed to reveal squeaks and rattles.
</P>
<P>
   The defects included loose or missing fasteners that secured
such critical components as steering gears, tie rods, gas tanks,
seats and other parts that might cause a driver to lose control of
the vehicle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokeswoman Kelly Cusinato said McAleer's small samples and
method of selecting test vehicles didn't produce a reliable
estimate of the number of defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any problem is too much of a problem,'' she said, ``(but) it's
our position that it's not appropriate to extrapolate from such
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still responded to his issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said GM's quality audit process ``evolved'' as a result of
McAleer's complaints to include more inspections and follow-up at
assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company conducts multiple inspections, halts
shipping of any cars with defects and requires the affected auto
plant to go through more ``error-proofing'' steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not aware of any injuries or deaths related to matters
alleged by Mr. McAleer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Goff also said that McAleer doesn't know if the alleged defects
caused any accidents that resulted in fatalities or serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Courtland Kelley, the GM employee who replaced McAleer as
manager of the so-called Global Delivery Survey program, testified
in a June 1 deposition that he thought the problems ``would be
fixed in short order'' once GM was informed, but that they still
crop up in about one in every 200 to 400 cars tested. McAleer was
formerly Kelley's supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Goff said McAleer had already taken his complaints to National
Highway and Traffic Safety Administration officials last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told him ... that they could not investigate problems
across model lines,'' she said. ``
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA officials could not be reached for comment.

REPUBLICANS FAIL TO OVERTURN CLINTON'S ESTATE TAX VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mo.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of a bill to repeal the federal tax on
large estates failed Thursday to overturn President Clinton's veto
of the measure, killing the issue for the year in legislative terms
but leaving it very much alive politically.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were eager to take the debate to the
campaign trail, where they said it would attract support from
small-business owners, farmers, entrepreneurs and other voters who
object to having a portion of their wealth taxed when they pass it
to their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, the majority of whom lined up with Clinton in
opposition to the bill, said they would continue to make their case
that while the estate tax should be reduced for family-owned farms
and businesses, the measure that was rejected Thursday would eat up
too much of the projected budget surplus and disproportionately
reward a tiny percentage of the richest families.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had passed both the House and the Senate earlier this
year, with nearly all Republicans and some Democrats voting in
favor. Clinton vetoed it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Overriding the veto would have required a two-thirds vote in
both chambers, and in the House Thursday supporters of the bill
fell well short.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 274 votes in favor of overturning the veto and 157
in favor of sustaining it. It would have taken 290 votes to
overturn the veto if all 435 House members had voted, or 288 of the
431 votes cast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When the House passed the bill in June by a vote of 279-136, 65
Democrats voted in favor. Thursday, after pressure from party
leaders and phone calls to some of those 65 from Clinton, 53
Democrats bucked their party to support overriding the veto.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the vote, Clinton commended those members
of the House who voted to uphold the veto and kept up his attack on
the bill and the overall Republican effort to push through a series
of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a misguided bill that provides a huge tax cut to the
most well-off Americans at the expense of working families,''
Clinton said. ``It is a key ingredient of a Republican tax plan
that would leave nothing for Social Security, Medicare, education
or a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week the Republican leadership in Congress is expected to
try to override the president's veto of its other main tax bill
this year, a tax cut for married couples. Republicans acknowledged
that they will probably fail, but said that again highlighting
Clinton's opposition to tax cuts would help them in their efforts
to retain control of the House and put Gov. George W. Bush in the
White House by motivating their core base of supporters to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore opposed the estate tax bill passed by
Congress, but he has supported a smaller plan to reduce the tax on
family-owned farms and businesses. Bush, who included repeal of the
estate tax in his $1.3 trillion tax cut proposal, said in a
statement Thursday that if he is elected president, ``there will be
no veto to override'' because he would ``sign the abolition of the
death tax into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have phased out the federal estate and
gift tax over the next 10 years, with much of the tax disappearing
only at the end of that period.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the tax is levied only on estates valued at
$675,000 or more, an amount already scheduled to rise to $1 million
by 2006. Family owned businesses and farms have a special exemption
up to $1.3 million. Above those levels, estates are subject to a
graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the exemptions, the tax actually affects relatively
few estates _ fewer than 48,000 this year, or about 2 percent of
all deaths _ but is of concern to interest groups with considerable
political clout, including the small-business and farm lobbies as
well as wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats renewed their call Thursday for a compromise measure
they offered earlier in the year. The Democratic alternative would
immediately raise the exemption for family-owned farms and
businesses to $2 million per individual, or $4 million per couple.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans rebuffed the Democratic plan again, saying it is
built around tax rules that are complicated and narrowly drawn and
that they would benefit only a tiny percentage of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair
and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it,'' said
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that Congress should be concentrating on issues
that are of concern to all voters, not just the 2 percent who have
to worry about estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that his constituents never mention the estate tax when
talking to him about their concerns. Instead, he said, they pressed
him for action on adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare,
education, shoring up Social Security and keeping guns out of
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not want to spend the majority of this surplus on
tax cuts, and they sure don't want to spend it on tax cuts for the
wealthiest Americans,'' Gephardt said.

ONLINE GROCER STREAMLINE SELLS OPERATIONS TO RIVAL PEAPOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streamline.com Inc., an online grocer based in Westwood, averted
a looming financial crisis Thursday by selling its Washington,
D.C., and Chicago operations to rival Peapod Inc. for $12 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Following the sale, Streamline.com will operate only in northern
New Jersey and the Boston area, where it competes with Peapod. The
company had planned to expand to the Minneapolis area but now says
it has terminated a lease for a new facility in Shakopee, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a short time ago, rapid national expansion was the focus
and expectation for companies in our industry,'' said Timothy
DeMello, who founded Streamline.com in 1993. ``Now, you clearly
need to show that a (distribution) center that you put in a market
can be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   By retreating to the Northeast, Streamline.com will be able to
drastically reduce its costs and move more rapidly toward
profitability, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital provided by the divestiture of these markets will
allow us to prove the profitability of our business model, which we
plan to demonstrate by next year,'' said DeMello, the company's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Streamline.com has made some progress, making a profit per
customer order in the Boston area despite competition from several
Web grocers, including Peapod, HomeRuns, and Shoplink. In addition,
growth in the New Jersey market has exceeded expectations, said
Edward Albertian, Streamline.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Like many dot-com executives, Albertian is hoping for a more
favorable climate on Wall Street. Over the last several months,
Streamline.com has struggled to interest investors. And though
Thursday's sale is a lifeline, executives will need to seek
additional funding in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many financial analysts say they have lost interest in
virtual grocery retailers, citing low profit margins in the
supermarket business and high costs of delivering to consumers'
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that doesn't look like it has a promising
future,'' said Jeffrey Siegel, an analyst with Innovative Research
Associates in New York. ``There are too many risks. There were too
many players in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel and other analysts are more optimistic about online
grocers backed by supermarket chains. Those include Peapod, an
ailing Internet retailer based in Chicago, rescued in June by Dutch
grocery conglomerate Royal Ahold NV.
</P>
<P>
   Ahold, which also owns Stop &AMP; Shop, has made it no secret that
it plans to use Peapod in its drive to become a major force on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Peapod said it would shed its Columbus, Ohio, and
Texas markets in favor of expanding into areas where Ahold's
supermarkets operate.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's market acquisitions, Peapod will strengthen its
presence in the Chicago market, gaining 4,000 new customers and a
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington area, where Peapod snaps up 2,000
Streamline.com customers and a distribution center, the company can
take advantage of Ahold's relationship with market leader Giant
Food.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also gives Peapod a head start over Webvan Group
Inc., a California-based online grocer that plans to enter the
Washington market, according to Marc van Gelder, Peapod's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making a strategic move,'' van Gelder said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in Streamline.com's old markets will likely see some
changes in their services. Van Gelder says Streamline.com caters
more to higher-end customers, while Peapod aims for more mainstream
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod will continue stocking refrigerators that Streamline.com
installed in its customers' homes, van Gelder said. But new
shoppers will have their food delivered in totes _ Peapod's method
of delivery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gelder declined to say whether Peapod will continue with
video rentals, dry cleaning, and other services that Streamline.com
now offers its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Streamline.com's stock price fell 15.625 cents to close at
84.375 cents Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock market. Shares of Peapod
rose 18.75 cents to close at $2.1875 on the Nasdaq.

 &HT;    Losing streak behind them, Gamecocks ready for Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ South Carolina coach Lou Holtz says he had an
Internet Web site long before he knew how to turn on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Until last weekend, however, putting together three ``W's'' _ as
in www. _ seemed unlikely at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, in his second season with the Gamecocks, is trying to
keep his team's fans realistic. But he might be fighting a losing
battle. Fans in Columbia have renewed optimism after the Gamecocks
ended their 21-game losing streak with a 31-0 victory over New
Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a question on my Web site this week: 'Do you think
we can go to a bowl game this year?''' Holtz said. ``You make a
first down and the fans automatically think that you're a great
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks, who on Saturday host No. 9-ranked Georgia in the
Southeastern Conference opener for both teams, are by no means
great. But this year's edition is certainly better than last year's
0-11 squad, which ranked last in the nation in both scoring and
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   The offense showed dramatic improvement against the lowly Aggies
by gaining 353 yards in offense and scoring four touchdowns. Last
season, the Gamecocks gained 300 yards only once and didn't score
their fourth touchdown until the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a football team that has really started to make
improvements,'' Holtz said. ``We're not a good football team by any
stretch of imagination, but I think we have the focus of just
trying to get better. Nobody mentions our losing streak now. . . .
Fortunately, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, the former Notre Dame coach who was lured out of
retirement in December 1998, said the biggest challenge was
convincing his players that they could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offseason, we put the past behind us,'' he said. ``The
past is dead, and what's dead should be buried, so we buried that.
I thought everybody got fired up to play us when we were at Notre
Dame. But they really got fired up to play South Carolina once we
had that losing streak. Nobody wanted to be the team that lost to
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia doesn't want to become the first SEC team to lose to the
Gamecocks in 19 games. South Carolina hasn't beat a conference
opponent since a 35-3 victory over Vanderbilt on Oct. 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since that losing streak persists, South Carolina's players
aren't celebrating their first victory in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys aren't talking about New Mexico State too much,''
Gamecocks linebacker Andre Offing said. ``That was the past. We've
got more to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Snapping a three-game losing streak to Georgia would earn South
Carolina a lot of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a longer winning streak than half the teams in the
country,'' Holtz said, ``but nobody writes about that.''

ODD COUPLE OF GERMAN POLITICS: LEFT-RIGHT ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ They are the unlikeliest of allies _ a former West
German army officer trained in the United States and a longtime
member of the East German Communist Party who spent much of his
life teaching Marxist theory.
</P>
<P>
   But Udo Voigt, who still sports a military mustache, and Michael
Nier, who still quotes Lenin, have found common cause in the
rightist National Democratic Party, creating the heady platform of
nostalgic nationalism and ``German Socialism'' that the movement
now proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Since neo-Nazi violence, much of it directed against foreigners,
became the chief object of debate here after a bombing on July 27
in Duesseldorf, the government has discussed at length a possible
ban on the party, whose youth wing is widely seen as providing a
meeting point for rightist thugs.
</P>
<P>
   But little of the talk has focused on the diffuse makeup of a
party that has tried to broaden its support by grafting East German
grievances onto its West German tradition of revisionist
nationalism. In their different frustrations, Voigt and Nier
suggest the diversity of German anger and the potential difficulty
of quelling it.
</P>
<P>
   They also display how the extreme right in Germany, as elsewhere
in Europe, awkwardly mixes traditional conservative values like
nationalism with traditional left-wing values like the defense of
workers in an effort to build a new power base.
</P>
<P>
   The migration of center-left parties toward the embrace of the
market has opened new opportunities for such parties with the less
well-off, as Joerg Haider's Freedom Party has illustrated in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the odd alliance _ Voigt is the party leader and Nier
is its chief theorist _ seems to have had some limited success. The
party has doubled its membership, to 6,600 members in the last
three years, with many new members younger than 30 and coming from
Nier's state, Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of inquiries about membership have poured in since the
discussion of a ban began, and the party's new aim is to attract
20,000 members. ``Then we could have real influence,'' Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as the defender of the ``ordinary German
under siege by foreigners,'' Voigt, 48, traced his convictions from
the time when his father, Richard, slapped him in a dispute over
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about 12 and I had been shown films of Auschwitz at
school, so I believed that anyone who fought with Hitler was
evil,'' he said. ``I came home and confronted my father. I told him
he was a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Voigt had served as a Wehrmacht soldier in a tank
division, first on the French front and then in Russia. He told his
son that he had known nothing of Auschwitz or other camps until
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   He told his son that ordinary Germans like himself were not
criminals. He recalled, in defense of the army, how he had
witnessed the execution of a German soldier condemned by a military
court for the rape of a Polish girl.
</P>
<P>
   So began Udo Voigt's transformation into a nationalist,
convinced that his father's generation had been unfairly sullied,
that the Holocaust had become an industry intended to impose
permanent shame on Germany and that other genocides, including
``killing the native Indians in America,'' had been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Jews speak of collective German guilt for the Third
Reich, we get angry,'' he said. ``Their aim is an extension of the
Morgenthau plan for the dismemberment of Germany, an attempt to
paralyze us by passing guilt from generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr.
proposed turning Germany into a politically meaningless state by
destroying industry and allowing only an agrarian economy. His
ideas were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generation that was responsible for Hitler's crimes has
had to pay for them, and the criminals were judged,'' said Voigt,
who spent 12 years in the West German army, rising to captain. ``We
have handed out more than $100 billion in reparations. I was born
in 1952, and my generation had no responsibility. Those who are
young today have even less. But the imposition of guilt
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Voigt said the constant ``intimidation'' of Germany is intended
to ensure that no new national sentiment is possible. It is also
meant to create a guilt complex feeding a sense of obligation in
Germany that leads it to take in more and more foreigners to prove
its tolerance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But foreigners, to Voigt, are Germany's chief problem. In his
time in the United States in 1973 and 1974, training on missile
systems in El Paso, he saw what he called severe racial problems in
the U.S. Army. There lay one seed of his opposition to a
``multiethnic and multicultural state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if his party gained power _ an extremely remote
possibility, given that it has about 1 percent of the vote _ any
foreigner without work for three months would immediately be sent
back to his home country. Foreigners would not be allowed to own
real estate and would be excluded from welfare, ``because that is
one of the main reasons they come to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have a five-year plan to send foreigners back,'' he
said. ``A large number will go. Not in 24 hours. But I believe that
in the end 80 to 90 percent would leave.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than seven million foreigners in Germany, 9
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt deplored recent anti-immigrant violence and said his party
had nothing to do with it. But, he said, high unemployment and high
immigration were bringing Germany to a breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our course of action now is to represent the frustrated German
worker,'' he continued. ``The Social Democrats have deserted the
worker for foreign capitalist interests. Yet poverty is growing.
Ours will be a new German Socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Nier, born into the Third Reich in Dresden in 1943, the
son of a convinced Nazi, a member of a family traumatized by the
Allied bombardment of Dresden that forced them to flee, a child of
the postwar East German Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   His is a different frustration, far from that of a Rhineland
military man who feels Germany has been on the receiving end of
American- or Jewish-led claims and criticism for too long. Nier's
is the frustration of a man who feels he lost his Communist home.
Both frustrations are potent and, in some degree, widespread, if
seldom expressed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Nier joined the Communist Party in 1965, worked in an automobile
factory and moved on to study philosophy in Dresden. ``Then,'' he
said, ``I started teaching at the Technical University in Chemnitz
and other technical institutes, before the Berlin Wall fell in
1989, and I lost my job like just about everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding a succession of jobs _ he describes the latest as
``teaching history to 15 women who have no reason to learn
history'' _ Nier remained in his party until two years ago. Then he
abruptly switched to the extreme right and the National Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Voigt is a former officer and I'm a former Communist,
but we have one shared perception,'' he said. ``That is, that the
Social Democrats and Christian Democrats have abandoned ordinary
people. The only party for the simple people today is ours. That is
why I developed the slogan, `Socialism in Germany.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nier insisted that the party should have nothing to do with the
terror of the Third Reich and said a pivotal battle was engaged
between ``the destructive Nazi side of the party, which is stronger
for now, and my battle for a progressive people-based national
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that German pride would have to be restored by
``building back the European Union to acceptable levels,'' making
clear to immigrants that ``this is our land, clear and simple'' and
preventing German soldiers' serving as ``pawns'' of Americans in
places like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That message would eventually prevail, Nier insisted, adding
that he would welcome a party ban, because it ``would be seen as
antidemocratic and give us a huge boost.'' He smiled confidently
and said, ``Even Lenin had small beginnings.''

 &HT;    `Nurse Betty' is all sweetness and bite
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No doubt ``Nurse Betty'' is friendlier and more
accessible territory for Neil LaBute. The director secured his
notoriety with ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and
Neighbors,'' dark comedies that revel in emotional barbarity
between the sexes. Both hailed and hated for their brute candor,
the films are misanthropic masterpieces, cringing snapshots of bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a jerk, the movies reveal LaBute as an A student
of our crueler impulses, and he shrewdly weaves these insights
through ``Nurse Betty's'' sunny fantasy. He flecks the comedy with
vulgarities and shocking eruptions of violence. This gives it teeth
and heft, and makes it the terrific movie it is.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's a wizard at wringing real and cracklingly alive
performances from his actors. Even the tentative Renee Zellweger,
whose face here is a dumpling rolled in flour, shines as naif Betty
Sizemore. Betty's a floaty waitress who moons over the hospital
soap ``A Reason to Love.'' She's infatuated with its glistening
hero, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear, master of bland irony), while
slogging through a bad marriage with a piggish used-car salesman
(superb LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart).
</P>
<P>
   In a pat narrative leap, Betty witnesses a murder that hurls her
into an amnesic fugue. Suddenly, she thinks she's the ex-fiancee of
Dr. Ravell and decides to leave Kansas (shades of ``Oz'') to rejoin
her true love in L.A. dressed as a nurse. But the killers, Chris
Rock and Morgan Freeman, are on their witness's trail. (Freeman and
the explosive Rock produce the film's funniest friction.)
</P>
<P>
   This is conventional stuff about chasing dreams, but LaBute and
his writers punch holes in the template. The plot curlicues,
hitting jolts of violence and poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is a mix of bonhomie and bite that would have
fit in last year's crop of highly original, tonally volatile movies
(``Three Kings'' to ``American Beauty''). LaBute joggles tones like
a snow dome, and the result is a surprisingly textured oddity.
Usually less concerned with viewer amity, LaBute here meets us in
the middle, donning one boxing glove, one kid glove, and scores a
knockout.

COMMENTARY: THE SECRET OIL TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heads of state from the OPEC oil countries will gather in
Venezuela Sept. 26 to 28 for only their second top-level meeting
since OPEC was founded in 1960. The meeting comes as oil prices hit
a 10-year high this week at $34 a barrel. Venezuela's president,
Hugo Chavez, the host of the summit, just broke the ring of
isolation around Iraq and personally flew to Baghdad to consult
Saddam Hussein. Here's what I imagine was their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: Hurricane Hugo, how are you? I love the way you snub the
Aericans. You remind me so much of Fidel. I'm sorry I can't attend
your OPEC summit, but the minute I get on a plane, the Americans
will either shoot it down or force it down. Just promise me you
won't let the Saudis talk everyone there into keeping prices low.
The Saudis keep repeating this mantra to OPEC: ``The stone age
didn't end because they ran out of stones. People invented
alternative tools. And the oil age won't end because of a shortage
of oil, but because we drive the price up so far, so fast, we
stimulate alternatives.'' But the fact is, the price of oil today,
in real terms, is a fraction of what it used to be in 1973. That's
why Americans all drive SUV's. Why should we subsidize their gas
guzzling?
</P>
<P>
   Chavez: Brother Saddam, I couldn't agree more. Let's face it, I
need the money now. Iran needs the money now. You need the money
now. We all have soaring populations, we've all, frankly, destroyed
the entrepreneurial middle class in our countries, and none of us
want to go through the restructuring, deregulation or privatization
required for globalization, because it would mean ceding power. So
pushing up oil prices is our only means of economic survival. Bush
and Gore say, how dare we raise prices? Oh, give me a break. I
think we should propose this at our summit: We'll stop acting like
a cartel if Microsoft stops acting like a monopoly. We'll cut the
price of oil to its real production cost when Microsoft cuts the
price of Windows 2000 to its real production cost. How's that?
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: I love it! And the Americans are just playing into our
hands. You'd think I was their energy secretary. They're totally
unprepared for winter: U.S. heating oil inventories are down nearly
40 percent from a year ago, and crude inventories are at a 24-year
low! Heating oil prices have jumped to a 10-year high because of
panic that U.S. refiners won't be able to produce enough fuel to
heat homes by winter. I read one story where U.S. experts were
quoting something called The Farmers' Almanac as predicting it was
going to be a mild winter, so they don't have to worry about us.
Can you imagine? Betting your whole economy on some almanac written
by farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Chavez: They're cocky. They think everything runs on silicon now
_ it's all this new-economy stuff. The fact is, we're still the
biggest threat to their prosperity and new economy. Without oil,
baby, there ain't no bits and there ain't no bytes. We're the real
dot in dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   They're just depending on the Saudis to increase production. The
fools don't understand the Saudis' real situation. The Saudis are
$140 billion in debt, with a huge public payroll and an electricity
grid so in need of upgrading they had blackouts this summer. They
need cash too. Show me the money, baby! Moreover, the excess
capacity the Saudis have is largely in heavy oil, not in the sweet
crude the market wants. If Iran, Iraq and Venezuela cut production
just a bit we could soak up any Saudi increase.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: Maybe it's time for a little October surprise. I've
waited nine years to get revenge on George Bush. Now I'll get it on
his son. Can you imagine if we make oil prices an issue in this
U.S. election, with Bush Jr. and Cheney _ the embodiments of Big
Oil _ running for office? Gore and Liebowitz, or whatever that
Jewish guy's name is, will eat them alive.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez: If either of these candidates was a real leader he would
be telling Americans that they actually need to push energy
conservation immediately, by raising gas taxes and aggressively
reducing their dependence on us. Look who their dot-com economy
depends on today _ Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria. Hah!
The rogues' gallery! No serious U.S. presidential contender would
tolerate that.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: Then we're safe _ $40 here we come!

 &HT;    Samsung plans to increase chip manufacturing capacity
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. plans to
spend heavily to increase its chip manufacturing capacity for at
least the next two years, a top company official says.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung, the largest maker of memory chips for computers and
other products, said it sees no signs of a softening in the market
for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips until 2003 at the
earliest. The company employs 1,100 people in Austin at its only
chip manufacturing plant outside South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Rising chip prices and strong demand have bolstered the
profitability of memory chip makers like Samsung, who were ravaged
by a three-year slump in the market from 1996 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mercurial growth of the Internet and digital media
products will lead to a shortage of DRAMs until the year 2002,''
said Samsung President Lee Yoon Woo this week in story reported by
Bloomberg New Service.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's bullish comments were made in response to press questions
about the recent slide in the company's stock price. Samsung shares
dropped 33 percent from July 13 to early September, Bloomberg said.
Some financial analysts were concerned about reports of slowing
computer sales growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung projects that its chip sales will reach $13 billion this
year and $30 billion by 2005. Samsung's 1999 sales were estimated
at just over $7 billion, by IC Insights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samsung has been one of the earliest memory manufacturers to
start increasing its capital spending in response to the uptick in
the market,'' said analyst Jim Handy with the Dataquest market
research company in San Jose, Calif. ``Most of the other
manufacturers are waiting until they see hard profits. Most other
manufacturers are just on the verge of profitability right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said rising demand for memory chips in products like digital
cameras, videodisc players and television sets will offset slowing
growth of computer sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The largest portion of Samsung chip manufacturing investment is
going on in South Korea, where the company is bringing one new chip
factory into production and where it expects to start work this
month on a new, larger factory -- Line 11 -- that can process
silicon wafers that are 12-inches in diameter, compared with the
industry standard 8-inch wafers.
</P>
<P>
   The new factory will cost more to build -- an estimated $2
billion -- but its production costs are expected to be much lower
than costs for a conventional factory.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Samsung has expanded the employment of its chip
factory by 200 people over the last year, but top management has
not yet decided whether to build a second factory in Northeast
Austin. Samsung's first factory, which went into production in
1997, makes 64-megabit and 128-megabit chips and operates at close
to full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Company management should make a decision on whether to build a
second factory in Austin sometime next year, said spokesman Bill
Cryer. When Samsung announced in 1996 that it would build a chip
factory in Austin, company officials said the Northeast Austin site
was large enough to handle from three to give chip factories.

 &HT;    A `Gipper Game' in store as Huskers come calling?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Notre Dame scheduled a home-and-home series against
Nebraska several years ago, officials from both schools knew fans
would want tickets. The schools haven't met in the regular season
since 1948. Notre Dame is second in all-time college football
victories with 768, Nebraska third with 744.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing prepared the schools for the incredible demand to
get into Saturday's 2:30 p.m. NBC game between the No. 1
Cornhuskers (1-0) and the No. 23 Fighting Irish (1-0) in Notre Dame
Stadium
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you guys got any extra tickets?'' were the first words
out of the mouth of Notre Dame coach Bob Davie when he met with the
media early in the week. He wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Face value of the tickets is $36, but they were selling on eBay
for $200 and up. Some alumni told the school of offers of more than
$1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's remodeled stadium holds just over 80,000 fans, but
the school had only 32,000 tickets available to sell to alumni. The
school received more than 47,000 requests, its second-largest
demand for a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   At Nebraska, the demand was even greater. The Cornhuskers, who
got only 4,000 tickets to the game, received 28,000 requests.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in Lincoln this week is that as many as 10,000 Nebraska
fans might show up in South Bend, Ind., without tickets because
they just want to be near the stadium when the game is played. They
will fill up the local bars so that years from now they can say
they were there.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd for Notre Dame's pep rally tonight is expected to be
so large that for only the third time in school history it is being
moved from the Joyce Center, which seats just over 11,000, to Notre
Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is thinking that this could be a Notre Dame
moment,'' said Chuck Lennon, the executive director of the school's
alumni association.
</P>
<P>
   In Notre Dame lore, such contests are known as ``Gipper Games,''
in which the Irish summon the ghosts of their storied past _ George
Gipp and Knute Rockne _ to vanquish a seemingly unbeatable foe.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame has had some of those moments against the No. 1 team
in the nation. The Nebraska game will be the seventh time Notre
Dame has been home to face No. 1. They are 3-3 in the first six
games. Notre Dame is 8-13-1 when facing the nation's No. 1 team,
and the eight wins over No. 1 are more than by any other school.
One of those losses was to Georgia in the Jan. 1, 1981, Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, which opened the season by thumping San Jose State
49-13, will be a heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, when Notre Dame was licking its wounds from a
5-7 season, Davie stood before a large copy of the schedule during
a team meeting. He drew a rectangle around the Sept. 9 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to raise the bar as a football team,'' Davie said,
``you raise that bar by comparing yourself to Nebraska.''

STATE CHIEF JUSTICES PLAN TO MEET ON ABUSES BY JUDICIAL
CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Attn: Ala., Calif., Fla., Ga., Idaho, Ill., Ind., Mich., Mo.,
N.Y., N.C., Ohio, Pa., Tenn., Texas, Wash. and Wis.) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief justices of 15 states are planning an unusual ``summit
meeting'' to try to limit what some of them describe as increasing
abuses in bitter election contests for judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the chief justices call the conference a response to
growing concerns about the million-dollar war chests, attack
advertising and even outright distortion of an opponent's record
that seem to have become more widespread in judicial races this
year and threaten public confidence in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the last few years, this has become a national problem
and one that has to be looked at nationally, not just in whatever
state is having an election at the moment,'' said the chief justice
of Texas, Thomas Phillips, an organizer of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is to be held in Chicago this December, attended
by the chief justices of the 15 most populous states where at least
some judges are elected.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, himself an elected official, and others said that
rather than proposing wholesale changes in judicial selection
systems that vary widely by state, the participants would look for
limited reforms that can be more easily achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the chief justices, who will be accompanied by
legislative leaders and court-reform advocates, are likely to
evaluate official voter information projects that already exist in
several states, with an eye to extending them elsewhere, said Roger
Warren, president of the National Center for State Courts in
Williamsburg, Va., which is coordinating the conference. These
voter information projects try to present neutral information on
judges' records so that voters do not have to rely on campaign
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible proposals, Warren said, include trying to remove
judicial elections from the broader political fray by scheduling
them when there are no other elections, and increasing the length
of judges' terms so that they need not face election so frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Shepard, the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court,
said several chief justices discussed the idea of a summit meeting
when they gathered at a judicial conference in Rapid City, S.D.,
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was general agreement,'' Shepard said of the
increasingly rough-and-tumble nature of some judicial campaigns,
``that this trend is not good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two states elect judges at some level, according to the
American Bar Association. Until recent years, races for judgeships
in many of those states were polite, low-profile affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But aggressive campaigning has now grown sharply. Some
candidates make false charges against their opponents. Others,
despite rules intended to forbid the practice, indicate how they
would decide on issues like the death penalty or abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on judicial politics agree that the campaigns this year
are among the most aggressive ever. Several candidates in primaries
in Illinois each spent $1 million in races for the Supreme Court,
and Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Alabama and other states have seen
particularly bruising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chief justices said they had grown alarmed at the
changing climate even if they had not yet noticed it in their own
states.
</P>
<P>
   New York's chief judge, Judith Kaye, said she was not aware of
campaign problems there. But Kaye said, ``we have a very cynical
public generally, and this just feeds the cynicism of the public to
have people raising these huge sums for judicial campaigns and
running campaign ads that are false.'' (Since 1977, judges on New
York's top court, the Court of Appeals, have been appointed by the
governor after screening by a commission. But many other judges in
New York are elected.)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the current state of affairs say incumbent
judges are unlikely to come up with meaningful reform of a system
from which they have benefited. Tom Smith, the director of Public
Citizen's Texas office, said his group was supportive of the summit
idea, but skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our fear,'' Smith said, ``that what will result is a
strategy for defense of the system rather than an effort to find
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the organizers, top judges from these states are
expected to attend the conference: California, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.

 &HT;    U.N. VOTES TO BEEF UP PEACEKEEPING CAPABILITY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Haunted by a string of recent failures in its
core mission of preserving peace and security, the United Nations
pledged Thursday to beef up its capacity to head off wars and
intervene in civil conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Heads of state from the 15-member U.N. Security Council voted
unanimously to increase the funding and improve training and
equipment for U.N. peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to turn around what Secretary General Kofi Annan
called ``a crisis of confidence'' over the U.N.'s ability to
fulfill its central mission. The U.N.'s reputation has been damaged
in recent years by high-profile failings of its peacekeepers to
halt the killing of innocent civilians in places such as Bosnia,
Rwanda and East Timor, formerly part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the present generation are losing confidence in the
ability of the United Nations to make a difference between war and
peace,'' Annan said during the Security Council meeting. ``No
amount of resolutions or statements can change this reality; only
action can.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, one of 15 heads of state who endorsed Annan's
call for strengthening U.N. peacekeeping operations, said the body
must also become more effective at embracing the root causes of
conflict, including the abject poverty that afflicts much of the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease
and war,'' said Clinton, ``we will never be able to create the
peace that the founders of the United Nations dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is one of about 150 world leaders here this week
attending the U.N. Millennium Summit, the largest gathering of
heads of state in history.
</P>
<P>
   The club became a little too cozy for Clinton on Wednesday, when
Cuban leader Fidel Castro approached Clinton after a U.N. luncheon,
shook his hand and started a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the exchange was
cordial, but signaled no thaw in four decades of estrangement
between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance encounter that Mr. Castro initiated,''
Albright told reporters. ``They talked for a couple of minutes, and
there was no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the enduring divide between the two countries,
Clinton pointedly left Castro off a list of 350 heads of state,
spouses and diplomats he hosted Thursday night at the Metropolitan
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   On the margins of the U.N. summit, but very much at the center
of his foreign policy agenda, Clinton continued to press for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, though he said there was no clear
path forward on the difficult issues that divide the longtime foes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met into the night Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and, separately, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Clinton was willing to meet again with the Mideast
leaders before the U.N. summit concludes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is obviously prepared to be engaged at any
time,'' she said. ``He's still here.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while the process is fluid, she said, diplomacy remains
very much under way on a number of levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a floating operation,'' she said, ``and we're working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted Arafat and Barak for two weeks of summitry at
Camp David in July. That effort collapsed, though, over the
leaders' inability to agree on the future of Jerusalem, a city holy
to Christians, Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   With Barak facing a possible rebellion from the Israeli
parliament by the end of October, he told reporters that ``time is
running'' out on his own efforts to reach an accord with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that he was ready to reach an agreement with Arafat
that called for setting the Jerusalem question aside for some
period of time, but Arafat rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``After quite painful hesitation, we were ready to say that we
are ready to contemplate it if the other side is ready to negotiate
it,'' said Barak. ``It happened that the idea was refused by the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another U.N.-related initiative, Clinton hosted roughly
200 African leaders and diplomats for a midday reception. There,
Clinton called for a multibillion-dollar global effort to rescue
the continent from the ravages of a devastating AIDS epidemic, the
legacy of generations of debt and poverty that prevents millions of
children from access to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed for the long run,'' said Clinton. ``I believe
America is moving inexorably to be a much better partner over the
long run for Africa.''

TRUCKERS' STRIKE SPREADS IN FRANCE AS FUEL SHORTAGES GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``Friday'' to ``Thursday'' thruout.)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A strike begun three days ago by truckers who blockaded
fuel depots to protest spiraling fuel costs spread Thursday as
workers from other sectors of the economy joined the
demonstrations, disrupting transportation systems throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, airline workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers and even the
owners of river barges and sightseeing boats that cruise the Seine
have now joined in the protest. Their actions, along with the
truckers' blockade, have combined to produce the growing fuel
shortages and varying degrees of inconvenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, for instance, farmers set fire to piles of tires on
train tracks, leading to havoc with train schedules in the area. In
the north, they blocked border posts between France and Belgium. In
other towns, private ambulance drivers used their vehicles to block
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Paris had largely been spared in the last few days. But Thursday
hundreds of taxis poured into the city in a slow-moving column that
created a traffic jam that lasted hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the truckers' blockade of the country's fuel depots
has begun to be felt the pumps. France's three major oil companies
said that up to 80 percent of their stations were reporting
shortages. Some drivers also found it difficult to get fuel because
police officers were patrolling gas stations to make sure that
police, hospital and emergency service vehicles got the first
chance to buy the gas that was available. In other towns, officials
sought only to limit hoarding by putting a cap on the amount of
fuel that could be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has quickly become a huge political problem for Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, who on Wednesday broke off negotiations
with the truckers after two of the country's three major unions
refused to ratify an offer of a 15-cent reduction per liter in fuel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Jospin did not comment on the strike. But his
transportation minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, talked tough, saying,
``If we let things go on, that could break the process of growth
and development that's going on in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest began gathering steam on Sunday after a week in
which the government offered a series of financial measures to
fishermen, who had also blockaded the country's ports in August
because of rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the truckers believed that they would get relief in a
long-awaited package of tax cuts that Jospin's government unveiled
last week. But the government instead chose to use a budget surplus
from a booming economy in other ways. The plan included a cut in
the taxes on home heating oil, but not fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fuel has been rising even faster in Europe than in
the United States because of the decline in the value of the euro.
On top of that, fuel carries a government surcharge of more than 70
percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of diesel fuel in France has risen about 40 percent in
the last year. A gallon of diesel fuel costs about $2.84 here.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jospin's problem in negotiating with the truckers is
that even his latest offer has been sharply criticized by
environmentalists in his governing coalition. The Greens say his
concessions break earlier promises to continue to push France
toward use of rail traffic over more polluting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to blocking various border posts, farmers scuffled
with the authorities at the Channel Tunnel as they tried to block
freight trucks from boarding trains to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the European Union asked France to prove that it
was taking measures to ensure the free movement of goods and access
to its ports.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' blockades, set up at some 80 depots throughout the
country, were beginning to take a heavy toll in some areas. One
French newspaper reported that school cafeterias in the Vosges
region, in eastern France, faced shortages because food suppliers
ran out of gas for their delivery trucks. Some school bus routes
were shut down in the central city of Lyon. In other areas, rental
car agencies said they had to turn away customers because they
could not give them any gas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, leaders of the truckers union tried to blame
the government for backing out of the negotiations and urged that
they return to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reach a solution quickly,'' said Rene Petit, the
leader of the trucker's union. ``We simply must resume dialogue
with the authorities.''

   AUSTRIA: EU REPORT DUE
</P>
<P>
   A report commissioned by the European Union to help it decide
whether to continue sanctions against Austria is to be presented
Friday to the current holder of the rotating EU presidency,
President Jacques Chirac of France. The sanctions were imposed in
February after the far-right Freedom Party joined Austria's ruling
coalition. The report was to evaluate the ``respect'' of the
Austrian government for ``common European values'' as well as the
evolution of the Freedom Party, which has been accused of taking a
xenophobic stance.

   Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece met in Belgrade
with President Slobodan Milosevic, the first NATO foreign minister
to do so since the alliance bombed Yugoslavia last year. There was
speculation about what larger message from the West Papandreou
might be passing on to Milosevic, given the lavish pre-election
coverage his meeting with Milosevic, indicted for war crimes,
received on state television. Papandreou also met opposition
leaders.

   Public Order Minister Michalis Chryssochoides will sign an

   The police provided extra security in Istanbul for about 800 gay
Americans who toured historic sites without incident after being
refused access to other locations in Turkey. The group told the
State Department they were discriminated against after the police
in the Aegean port of Kusadasi refused to allow them to tour

CAUSE OF GULF WAR SYNDROME A MYSTERY, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of researcher to Sox.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no conclusive evidence that nerve gas, uranium or
military vaccinations caused the Gulf War syndrome ailing thousands
of Desert Storm veterans, according to a massive study released
Thursday that strongly suggests the affliction's actual cause will
forever remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 118,000 Persian Gulf veterans suffer from the
chronic fatigue, headaches, muscles spasms, joint pain, and rashes
that characterize the syndrome, and the new results left many of
them yet again frustrated at the inability to properly diagnose
their decade-old problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most veterans expected this outcome. Most of them don't have
faith in government to resolve this,'' said Bill Frazure, a Gulf
War veteran from New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Institute of Medicine in Washington, was
designed to help devise a way to compensate ailing Gulf War
veterans. Its immediate implication was that veterans petitioning
the government for financial compensation cannot cite exposure to
the chemicals and vaccines studied as proof they are sick.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's more sweeping suggestion was that the apparent
nonexistence of data on what each soldier was exposed to in the
Persian Gulf permanently cripples scientists' ability to diagnose
the syndrome's causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that crucial piece of information, we cannot draw
conclusions regarding whether the agents present in the Gulf War
theater are the cause of the health problems among veterans who
served there,'' said the study's chair, Dr. Harold C. Sox, a
medical professor at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center at a news
conference Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sox's crew of researchers continue to examine 30 other possible
causes of the syndrome. But even if they eventually determine some
of the chemicals veterans were exposed to have long-term health
effects, they will not know which individual soldiers are ailing
from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know who was actually exposed to what. The
Department of Defense really doesn't know who was where when,''
said Dr. Samuel Potolicchio, a professor of neurology at George
Washington Medical Center and one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure data, he said, will ``probably never be available.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has spent an estimated $145 million
studying Gulf War Syndrome, and still classifies it as an
``undiagnosed illness.'' One-sixth of the 700,000 veterans who
helped wrest Kuwait from the Iraqi army in 1990-91 have filed
medical complaints since returning.
</P>
<P>
   Most have gotten treatment for each symptom, one by one, at
Veteran's Administration hospitals. But an underlying cause has
been frustratingly elusive. Initially, many thought the cause was
in veterans' heads, that war-time stress and hysteria provoked the
symptoms. The accusation irked many veterans, creating an
atmosphere of hostility and distrust of the government that
continues to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're blaming it on the vets. They want to tell guys it's
all in their heads,'' said Frazure. ``We're so used to this, we're
just kind of at the point where we just shrug our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the causes eliminated Thursday was the anthrax vaccine
injected in thousands of soldiers in the event Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein unleashed the lethal virus. But that didn't convince Paul
Perrone, 35, of Methuen, who served as a military police officer at
the US-led coalition's base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty convinced that the vaccines are the culprit. What
they say means nothing to me one way or another. They're either
stonewalling or just blind to the issue,'' he said Thursday, just
after returning from his neurologist's office where he is being
monitored for multiple sclerosis symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's study was an effort by the federal government to
corral a decade's worth of research to determine if the scientific
establishment had made any progress on Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reviewed thousands of studies on the chemicals
thought most likely to be the source behind the syndrome: sarin, a
deadly nerve gas that Iraq has deployed in the past; military
vaccines for anthrax and botulism given to many soldiers to guard
against chemical weapon attacks; pyriodostigmine bromide, a
compound taken by many soldiers to strengthen them against possible
chemical attacks; and depleted uranium, which many were exposed to
when military equipment was destroyed during combat.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concluded there is not enough evidence to say these
substances cause any long-term health problems. However, with
sarin, they said further study is necessary because the evidence is
extremely limited, most of it comes from victim studies from a 1995
terrorist attack on a Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside researchers criticized the study's approach in
examining the substances in isolation. They theorize that Gulf War
syndrome is a product exposure to multiple toxic substances that,
perhaps, make veterans more sensitive to everyday chemicals used
here. They worry the new evidence will lead to a new round of
skepticism about the veterans' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors who treat vets are very much influenced by studies
like this,'' said Dr. Claudia Miller, associate professor of
environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With President Clinton and other government
leaders filling seats usually occupied by their envoys, the
Security Council moved on Thursday toward a new role for itself in
a world where the rules have been rewritten by warlords, and the
poor kill the poor over dwindling natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual meeting, with 14 heads of government and a foreign
minister gathered around the council table, was intended to
concentrate on peacekeeping problems, with a special emphasis on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But it very quickly turned to a far broader discussion about the
causes of war in an age when ethnic cleansing, rape and mutilation
have become the tactical hallmarks of pickup armies that terrorize
populations often already weakened by poverty or disease. The issue
was raised most prominently a year ago by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, and was addressed vigorously on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing makes a big difference in the type of debate we will
have today versus what it might have been 15, 20, 30 years ago,''
said Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He told the council that peacekeeping was often all that stood
``between anarchy and some form of stability.'' Sierra Leone, where
Britain has sent hundreds of peacekeepers, is an example, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is poverty or debt or aid and development, or
infectious diseases or governance and the rule of law, we need a
far broader concept of how we deal with these security issues for
today's world,'' Blair said. ``We cannot isolate conflict from the
root causes of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Security Council moved into new territory on
Thursday, other leaders addressing the summit meeting in the
General Assembly kept to familiar attacks against the deep
disparities between rich and poor nations. With passion and often
eloquence, they demanded that the industrialized world offer more
tangible aid to countries that have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Like Annan and Blair, Clinton argued that peacekeeping meant
thinking not only about weapons but also about water, schools,
health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will listen to this discussion and say, well,
peacekeeping has something to do with security, but these other
issues don't have anything to do with security and don't belong in
the Security Council,'' he said. ``This is my last meeting _ I just
have to say I respectfully disagree. These issues will be more and
more in the Security Council. Until we confront the iron link
between deprivation, disease and war, we will never be able to
create the peace that the founders of the United Nations dreamed
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton soon discovered he was not alone. Except for President
Jiang Zemin of China, who argued stonily for the most restrictive
definition of the Security Council's role, and Vladimir Putin of
Russia, who in an unspoken reference to NATO was more preoccupied
with opposing the use of force outside the council's control, a
significant number of national leaders echoed Clinton's call.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   China and at times Russia argue that social issues should be
left to the Economic and Social Council, which was established by
the U.N. Charter to be a body parallel to the Security Council. It
was given wide authority in social issues, including human rights
and crime.
</P>
<P>
   But ECOSOC, as it is known, has proved unwieldy with 54 members,
ineffective and rarely innovative, despite the considerable efforts
of U.S. and European diplomats to reform it and give it greater
authority.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh and President Jacques
Chirac of France spoke at the council on Thursday of large-scale
human rights abuses and disasters of other kinds affecting large
numbers of vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk moved the council to its first high-level debate, on
the thorny subject of when it has the right to intervene to save
citizens, even if that means intruding on national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the discussion, despite lingering differences of
opinion, the leaders unanimously adopted a resolution that called
for, among other things, the development within the United Nations
of ``comprehensive and integrated strategies to address the root
causes of conflicts, including their economic and social
dimensions.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the last year, since Annan first raised this issue in the
General Assembly, it has been the fodder of academic and
policymaking debate. Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada on
Thursday told the council _ meeting at head-of-state level for the
first time since 1992 _ that it could not back away from the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if the Security Council is unable to adapt,'' Chretien
said, ``it will seriously undermine its credibility as a guarantor
of peace, credibility that is essential to maintaining the moral
authority of the U.N. as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a speech in the General Assembly, Chretien announced
that Canada would establish an international panel of legal and
political experts to study the issue of military intervention on
humanitarian grounds, taking a major step toward making the
discussion more concrete.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The credibility factor lurked behind much of what was said about
peacekeeping and how the United Nations has been stumbling
disastrously in trying to meet new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the council session, Annan laid bare the background
against which U.N. peacekeeping operations must work when he said,
``Many in the present generation are losing confidence in the
ability of the United Nations to make the difference between war
and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, a former head of peacekeeping who moved into the top job
just as the United Nations was floundering over its role in the
post-Cold-War era, has ordered reviews of peacekeeping debacles in
Rwanda and Bosnia and of the overall functioning of the department.
The results have been very critical not only of the organization
but also of its leading members, especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many vulnerable communities in too many regions of the
world now hesitate to look to the United Nations to assist them in
their hour of need,'' Annan said on Thursday. ``No amount of
resolutions or statements can change this reality. Only action can
_ prompt, united and effective action, pursued with skill and
discipline to halt the conflict and restore the peace. Only such
determined action can restore the reputation of the United Nations
as a credible force for peace and justice.''

   The U.N. peacekeeping department has 32 officers to provide
military planning and guidance for 27,000 troops. An additional
8,600 civilian police officers are supervised by only nine police
experts in New York. Fifteen political desk officers look after 16
operations. Only 1.25 percent of the peacekeeping budget goes to
headquarters administration, far too little, experts say, to allow
for adequate planning.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council itself _ or at least its leading members _
is often the problem, said Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian
foreign minister who was chairman of the expert panel that studied
overall U.N. peacekeeping and issued a critical report last month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Brahimi said interference from powerful nations
in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations _ known by the letters
DPKO _ should stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big boys on the Security Council come through the back
door and tell the DPKO and all of us here: `Don't say this; don't
say that. Don't ask for this, don't ask for that,''' he said.
``They really influence us into self-censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States put another brake on peacekeeping when the
Clinton administration agreed to give Congress 15 days' notice
before voting for a new operation. The agreement can stall any
action, even in a crisis.

<P>
   Less than four years ago, a little-known personal-injury lawyer
named Edward D. Fagan stood next to an Auschwitz survivor at a news
conference in New York and announced an audacious lawsuit, accusing
Swiss banks of stealing money 50 years ago from those who died in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fagan has a new and glamorous career and is likely soon
to earn millions of dollars in legal fees. He has since filed
lawsuits against banks, insurers and other companies in Austria,
Germany and elsewhere, charging that they too profited from Nazi
ties or exploited victims. Settlements of actions against Swiss
banks and German industry worth over $6.2 billion were recently
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawyers got involved in the Holocaust claims. But the
47-year-old Fagan cast himself apart as a media-savvy street
fighter who became the public point man in the cases. This July, he
hopscotched in a few days from Berlin to Vienna to Warsaw on behalf
of tens of thousands of people that he and lawyers associated with
him represent.
</P>
<P>
   They have also opened a second front, charging Japanese
companies in lawsuits with using thousands of Asians and others as
forced labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a posse,'' the tall, curly-haired and engaging
lawyer said. ``There are all these bad guys all over the world and
we have to track them down one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   His mission, he said, is to reach back into history and force a
reckoning with those who profited from evil. But an investigation
by The New York Times and the ABC News program ``20/20'' has found
that Fagan is facing his own reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   As he recast himself as a ``human rights'' lawyer, Fagan left
neglected personal-injury clients in his wake, abandoning their
claims or not returning their phone calls for years, according to
court papers and interviews. One former client recently won a
malpractice judgment against Fagan and ethics officials in New
Jersey filed a misconduct complaint against him last month on
behalf of another client.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, so at ease with using the emotional force of the
Holocaust as a weapon, also ignored for months scores of plaintive
calls and letters from aging Nazi-era survivors anxious about
whether their claims had been received, according to a paralegal
who worked last year for him and his partner at the time. That
paralegal, Jane Warshaw, was so distressed by what she saw that she
wrote in January to the federal judge overseeing the Swiss banks
case to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to witness what I have seen at this office,''
Warshaw wrote. `What is happening to these poor, old, injured and
neglected people is heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fagan conceded he may have failed some clients by
taking on too much work. But he insisted that he did his best to
represent his personal-injury clients and that he labored
ceaselessly in the Holocaust cases without financial guarantees,
winning results few would have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable to be a lawyer and to be able to use your
profession to do good,'' he said. ``To change history. To stand up
for people's human rights is incredible, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's conduct does not appear to have jeopardized the
financial claims of his Holocaust clients. In any settlement, they
would be eligible to get the same compensation as clients of more
attentive lawyers. But several survivors he represented say that
his failure to return calls for months, even years, took a
wrenching emotional toll. Legal-ethics experts say lawyers are
obligated to answer client queries within a reasonable period, even
in a huge class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan is a frenetic man who appears inseparable from his cell
phone. He had hoped to be a rabbi, failed at business and ran a
struggling legal practice before he stumbled into the Holocaust
litigation and a potential gold mine in legal fees. In the Swiss
banks suit alone, he is seeking $4 million, the most sought by any
lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Fagan played a leading role in
promoting the Holocaust claims, cases whose moral charge made them
a public cause. He specialized in shaming companies and
governments, orchestrating demonstrations and prayer vigils. Some
Holocaust survivors and advocates view him as their champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a master in public relations,'' said Hannah Lessing, an
official of a state-financed group in Austria for Holocaust
victims. ``Behind all the facade of yelling and screaming, there is
a man who cares for survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also made it his business, while other lawyers were
painstakingly developing legal claims, to be first at the
courthouse, gaining leverage with a hasty filing. A news conference
with an aged survivor would soon follow, drawing in a flood of
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan represents far more Holocaust claimants than most other
lawyers, giving him a powerful role in negotiations. The actual
number of clients is apparently a matter of some confusion. In one
interview, Fagan put the figure at 82,000, but his own lawyer cited
a different one _ 52,000 _ in a March response to a client
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers in the Holocaust cases say Fagan's ambitions
vastly outstripped his resources to deal with the vast numbers of
clients he took on and added that he was often absent for the
grinding legal work. Burt Neuborne, who had worked with Fagan
before breaking with him, said Fagan's filing in the Swiss banks
case was so inadequate that a judge asked him to rewrite it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an ordinary man who got swept up in issues that were
bigger than he was,'' said Neuborne, a law professor at New York
University. ``He didn't understand and eventually didn't really
know how to behave and just got swept away in the current of his
own ego and his own ambition.''

  Veteran rocker holds little animosity now that CCR has been
`Revisited'

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Fogerty's rootsy classic rock songs have always been best
appreciated in a live setting.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is ask any of the countless club bands which
keep the customers satisfied and the cash register jingling on any
given Saturday night with renditions of ``Green River,'' ``Proud
Mary'' or ``Born on the Bayou.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty's music is clearly designed to be heard in person and
that opportunity is at hand. The Creedence Clearwater Revival
founder, along with New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas and the
great Big Easy jazz-funk pianist Dr. John, appear Sunday in the
``Acura Music Festival: Destination New Orleans'' show at the L.A.
Tennis Center on the UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a traveling mini-jazz festival,'' said Fogerty,
who has been touring across the country this summer with a similar
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Much to Fogerty's chagrin, Creedence Clearwater Revisited, a
tribute group consisting of a couple of estranged original members,
is also on the road at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have stronger feelings about it,'' he said. ``It's
more sadness than anything. But I can't do anything about it. Way
back, when I thought I could stop it from happening, I thought I
could keep the name Creedence kind of virginal. But they've long
since proven what they are. I don't go through lots of angst about
it. I mean, the world isn't sitting around in the midst of a
presidential election worrying about some old rock 'n' roll band.
But, yes, it did affect me, but I don't think it does anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based Fogerty's disputes with his old band,
which split in 1972, and former label, Fantasy, are well
documented.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's writing new material, but hasn't released an album
since 1998's ``Premonition,'' an 18-track career-spanning live
disc. He is currently between labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a time when you admired the great American
songwriters all the way back to Stephen Foster, who didn't have a
drum beat and wasn't able to record something and play it over and
over again in the studio,'' Fogerty, 55, said.
</P>
<P>
   His songs for Creedence, including the Top 40 smashes ``Bad Moon
Rising,'' ``Down on the Corner,'' ``Fortunate Son,'' ``Travelin'
Band,'' ``Up Around the Bend'' and ``Lookin' Out My Back Door,''
all penned and produced by Fogerty, are beloved rock staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote those songs 30 years ago to hold up,'' the
singer-guitarist said. ``Just using 'Proud Mary' as an example,
when I was finished with it, I played back the chorus and said,
'That's my first Tin Pan Alley song,' and I meant that in all the
positive ways. I grew up learning about the great early popular
composers even though their era was well over. I very much wanted
to be able to do something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt if I was casting my fate to the wind as a
songwriter, I wasn't going to model myself on some guy who had one
novelty hit.'' &QL;

<P>
   `Here Are Defendants'
</P>
<P>
   Fagan has said that two pieces of information led him to the
Swiss banks case. The first was a 1996 article in The New York
Times that discussed Nazi gold and Swiss banks. The other came from
a longtime client, Gizella Weisshaus, an Auschwitz survivor who
told him about her family's Swiss account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the article,'' he recalled, ``and I thought, `Oh my
goodness, I'm a lawyer, here are defendants. I don't know who the
plaintiffs are, I don't know who the plaintiffs are going to be,
but someone is going to pay.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss banks case would also apparently be the way to satisfy
his gnawing hunger for acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlingen, Texas, Fagan grew up in nearby San Antonio
with two brothers and a sister, all from his mother's first
marriage. Fagan's father abandoned the family, according to Wayne
Fagan, the lawyer's oldest brother. His other brother, Avraham,
embraced Orthodox Judaism and Fagan followed him to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a rabbi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His religious ardor waned, and Fagan returned to the United
States and enrolled in Cardozo Law School in New York, a part of
Yeshiva University, graduating in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years with a large law firm that represented
corporate defendants. But in the late 1980s, Fagan, searching for
something with more panache, tried to start an exploration club for
the wealthy. Travelers would sail by yacht to exotic locales,
accompanied by ocean scientists and environmentalists. In 1991 he
set up the Odyssoe Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the business, to
support environmental research. But the whole venture fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, soon after returning to law, he rented the entire 21st
floor of the former Standard Oil building in New York City,
complete with the original, opulent board room. He tried to support
his tiny firm, Fagan &AMP; Associates, by subletting space to other
lawyers and advertising for personal-injury clients in the yellow
pages.
</P>
<P>
   He was eager, however, for the spotlight, trying to interest a
tabloid in one case. In 1994, he asserted in a fax to the Star
magazine that the actor Sylvester Stallone had tried to defraud a
client of his who owned three paintings by Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been been an article of this nature with a
celebrity (of this stature) involving fraud and his artwork,''
Fagan wrote, according to papers in a libel lawsuit that Stallone
filed against him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine never published the article and Stallone withdrew
his libel action.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Fagan got on television representing a
6-year-old Queens girl who had been stabbed with a hypodermic
needle by a homeless man on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   But at same time, his finances and his business ties were
unraveling, public records show. He began to owe large amounts of
federal income taxes, a debt he said he has recently mostly paid
off. In 1996, the yellow pages unit of the former Nynex Corp. filed
a $228,000 lawsuit against the Odyssoe Foundation in a New Jersey
state court for unpaid services like advertising for his legal
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he had ordered the ads through the nonprofit, rather
than his law firm, because it was also the billing address of some
telephone lines at his firm. He said he believed the matter had
been resolved, but a spokeswoman for Verizon, the successor company
to Nynex, said the bill was still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an eviction proceeding for unpaid rent, he was forced
in 1997 to leave his lavish offices and rent space from a law firm
in the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony of his professional life spilled over into his
closest relations. In the mid 1990s, Fagan severed ties with his
three siblings, said his brother Wayne, a lawyer in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Fagan, whose clientele has included Arab royalty, said:
``Eddie was a warm, jovial person who was like a pied piper. But
something happened and Eddie just changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cases Left Behind
</P>
<P>
   With Fagan's claim against the Swiss banks on behalf of
Weisshaus and others in late 1996, he embraced a new mission. But
the claims of some of his personal-injury clients were apparently
abandoned or forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   One was Hector Ortiz. In 1992, Ortiz, a 49-year-old truck
driver, smashed into the back of a slow-moving crane, shattering
bones and sustaining head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fagan filed a $35 million lawsuit on his behalf in
federal court in Brooklyn and brought a similar action in state
Supreme Court there. He aggressively pursued the federal claim
until late 1996, court papers and interviews indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson Jr.
dismissed Ortiz's federal lawsuit, noting, among other things, that
Fagan had ``failed to prosecute'' it for three years and had
ignored court orders. Ortiz's claim in Brooklyn state court has
lain dormant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said that Ortiz came to his office about a year ago and
that he had told him then that his federal claim was dead but had
yet to inform him that his state case also appeared at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who has not worked since the accident, disputed that
account, saying in a phone interview that he had not seen or spoken
with Fagan for more than two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting in vain,'' he said. ``I didn't know something
like this could happen. Right now I'm confused. I don't know what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another client, Tomas Giron, was struck and severely injured in
1992 by a car that its owner had reported stolen. Fagan said he had
made a claim on Giron's behalf to a New York state fund that
compensates victims of uninsured motorists but that it had been
denied.

   Jeffrey Rubinton, the fund's president, though, said in an
interview that its records showed that such a claim had not been
pursued and that the statute of limitations on making such a claim
had long expired.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former client, Offer Salmoni, won a $167,000
malpractice judgment against Fagan, which the lawyer did not
contest. Fagan had filed a lawsuit on Salmoni's behalf in 1993 to
contest an eviction. Salmoni charged in a 1998 lawsuit that Fagan
had allowed that claim to be thrown out by repeatedly failing to
make court appearances and had let the statute of limitations
expire without refiling. Fagan, who is licensed to practice in New
York and New Jersey, said he planned to settle with Salmoni.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New Jersey ethics officials, after a preliminary
inquiry, filed a misconduct complaint before a grievance committee
against Fagan on behalf of another former client, Diane Gibbons.
Gibbons had complained to the ethics board that Fagan's failure to
file required papers in her personal-injury action led to its
dismissal. Fagan said he could not comment on the matter because it
was pending.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a legal-ethics expert at New York University
who is not involved in the Holocaust litigation, said that lawyers
face sanctions if they ignore existing claims when the prospects of
bigger awards beckon. ``Your loyalty to your original client is
undiluted,'' he said.

   Some personal-injury clients, whose names were provided to The
Times by Fagan, said that the lawyer fought difficult cases on
their behalf, adding that they would not hesitate to use him again.
But Fagan acknowledged that he failed to withdraw _ as lawyers are
required to _ from suits that he did not pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in over my head a lot of the time,'' he said. ``But now
I'm digging out, for me and for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unanswered Calls, New Inquiries
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999, with the Holocaust cases on the way to settlement,
Fagan had established his place on the world stage. When Jane
Warshaw, a paralegal, was sent by a temporary-help agency to work
that fall for him and his then-partner at the World Trade Center,
she was deeply thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were doing God's work,'' said the paralegal,
who at 57 is spunky with reddish hair.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Fagan's partner at the time, Carey R. D'Avino,
asked her to check the office's telephone answering system. On it,
she found more than 100 unanswered messages from Holocaust
survivors as well as personal-injury clients, including Ortiz. It
sounded like many had been desperately calling for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Stacks of unopened letters from Holocaust survivors or their
heirs were scattered around and stuffed in a drawer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have gotten their hopes up and then, there again,
they were told that they just didn't matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said she suggested to D'Avino that she prepare a
newsletter to keep clients updated, an accepted practice in
class-action suits. The lawyer said he told her that their clients
were already getting periodic newsletters. He described her as
``well-meaning'' but ``out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, troubled by what she viewed as a pattern of client
neglect, the paralegal sent a tape recording of those calls and
office correspondence to U.S. District Court Judge Edward R. Korman
of Brooklyn, who is overseeing the Swiss banks case. She also
provided that material to The Times and ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from the documents and recordings is
chaotic. New York disciplinary officials were investigating
complaints by three of Fagan's clients. Calls from Holocaust
claimants were bounced from one answering machine to another.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Bella Ross, said that her parents, concentration
camp survivors, were ecstatic when Fagan first took their case in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, you know, they had this savior,'' said Ross in a
recent interview. ``I mean, this is the man. You saw him on TV. You
heard about him on the radio. You see him in print. He is
everywhere. It was like finally they were blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, however, the family was so concerned about Fagan's
lack of response to dozens of messages and faxes that she filed a
complaint against him with New York disciplinary officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, Mr. Fagan has done nothing to update my parents on
the status of their case and is literally unreachable,'' Ross wrote
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Lieberman, a lawyer who represented Fagan in the matter,
told investigators in a March letter responding to Ross' complaint
that Fagan could not possibly deal with each of his tens of
thousands of clients. Both D'Avino and Fagan said in interviews
that they had fulfilled their ethical obligations to their clients;
to date, there have been no findings against them.
</P>
<P>
   Other Holocaust lawyers, though, were devoting more extensive
resources to client communication. While some used paralegals to
handle calls, Neubourne, the New York University professor, said he
set aside four hours a week to deal directly with survivors,
including many of Fagan's clients who called him out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who lived with these memories for so long,''
Neubourne said. ``The memories were then opened up, somebody told
them something was going to happen. And then they just got cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clients said Fagan returned phone calls promptly and others
involved in Holocaust-related issues said they also had had far
happier experiences with Fagan. They described him as a passionate
advocate who took up a fight that traditional Jewish groups had
allowed to languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was the only true source of light,'' said Dr. Thomas Weiss,
an ophthamologist in Miami Beach who has been active in Nazi-era
claims against insurers. ``He saw himself as picked by Providence
to lead this charge.''

 &HT;    N.C. governor's race heating up
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C._ Richard Vinroot arrived in a dark suit, blue shirt
and necktie with gold stripes. A former Charlotte mayor running for
governor, he seemed out of uniform for the remarks he would soon
deliver to fellow Republicans in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up the three middle fingers of his right hand,
59-year-old Vinroot recited the Boy Scout oath, a gesture of
integrity that he says separates him from his Democratic rival,
Attorney General Mike Easley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a full-grown governor as well,'' said Vinroot,
a lanky, 6-foot-7-inch former bench warmer for the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill basketball team. ``I tell them it is
clean living that does this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot, an Eagle Scout as a teen who now stands about a foot
taller than Easley, is swinging hard at the gubernatorial
front-runner and what Vinroot calls Easley's misuse of public money
for thinly veiled campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   With a sizable lead in the polls and in fund-raising for the
Nov. 7 election, Easley says he's braced for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they said I did, I didn't do it,'' Easley said to
laughter Wednesday during a private fund-raiser in Cary packed by
Democratic dignitaries, including outgoing Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they want to do is win,'' Easley said after the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Easley and Vinroot will debate publicly for the first time next
week in Raleigh, following a forum Saturday in Greensboro where the
two candidates are scheduled to address state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, 50, a two-term attorney general and former state
prosecutor, frequently attacks Vinroot as an enemy of public
education and rural North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care if they destroy my reputation or anybody
else's along the way,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby in Durham, Vinroot said his campaign will focus on
capping state spending and setting priorities to improve schools
and roads.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are going to tell the truth about Mike Easley the
rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   UNC-Chapel Hill political scientist Thad Beyle said he believes
negative ads from the opposing campaigns will shape voters' views
of Easley and Vinroot.
</P>
<P>
   In this state with a well-deserved reputation for political
mudslinging, Vinroot ``hired the toughest gun he could,'' Beyle
said of political strategist Carter Wrenn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Wrenn created the television commercial for U.S. Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that showed the hands of a white man slowly
crumpling a rejection letter. The ad linked Helms' black opponent,
Harvey Gantt, another former Charlotte mayor, to racial hiring
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Wrenn couldn't be reached Wednesday or Thursday at Vinroot's
campaign headquarters in Charlotte. In Durham on Wednesday, Vinroot
bristled at the suggestion Wrenn was calling the shots, saying,
``This is Richard Vinroot's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   An Easley supporter, retired state Sen. Jim Johnson (D-Concord)
said he believes Vinroot is ``one of the last Southern gentlemen''
and thus wouldn't resort to tactics such as the 1990 Helms
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   In what Easley calls ``silly stuff'' and his supporters decry as
negative campaigning, Vinroot has accused Easley of misusing as
much as $3 million in tax dollars since 1995 in a series of public
service ads.
</P>
<P>
   In the spots, Easley, as attorney general, warned of the dangers
of telephone fraud, predatory lending practices and other schemes
taking advantage of North Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   Easley used, in part, proceeds from the settlement of lawsuits
by his office under a state justice department program set up by a
previous attorney general, Robert Morgan. During an audit earlier
this year, State Auditor Ralph Campbell found nothing illegal about
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Easley's opponent in last spring's Democratic primary, Lt.
Gov. Dennis Wicker, criticized the ads as thinly disguised
political ads for Easley's gubernatorial bid.
</P>
<P>
   Easley beat Wicker easily. Nonetheless, Vinroot's criticism of
the ads has been central to his portrayal of Democrats _ from
Easley to President Clinton _ as untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to do with character,'' Vinroot said. ``He had the
public trust and he abused it, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley's supporters say Vinroot's criticism of Easley will
backfire on voters tired of negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinroot's people are making a major mistake,'' said Wayne
Troutman, chairman of the Democratic Party in Concord, where Easley
stumped at a poorly attended event Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a statewide poll and fund-raising records,
Easley is out front.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Mason-Dixon poll of 625 likely voters in July put
Easley 10 percentage points ahead of Vinroot, 47 percent to 37
percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot said Wednesday his campaign's polling shows the gap is
now ``about 7 percentage points,'' putting him within striking
distance. , he said. , as his campaign raises ``$25,000 to $50,000
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month, Vinroot said his campaign raised $900,000,
with ``a lot of help from the National Republican Governors
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Easley had a sizable advantage in fund-raising at the end
of June, the conclusion of the latest reporting period. Easley had
$850,000 on hand to spend, while Vinroot had $117,000 _ including
$100,000 of which he loaned himself in April.
</P>
<P>
   During the second quarter of this year, Easley raised $1.2
million while Vinroot raised $765,000, their campaign finance
statements show.

 UNDATED: this charge.''  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fagan described Warshaw as a ``disgruntled former
employee,'' though he conceded that some of her concerns were
legitimate. He added that only a tiny fraction of clients had
complained. ``You know the truth of the matter is that some people
are going to be unhappy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korman referred Warshaw's complaint to court officials and
D'Avino said that a court investigator contacted him. Fagan said an
assistant was hired in June to answer calls and he believed the
matter was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Korman said that court officials did not
confirm or deny the existence of an inquiry until a judge issued a
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling at the Top
</P>
<P>
   In July, Fagan arrived in Berlin as part of a victory lap in two
of the most significant cases. To settle slave-labor claims against
German industry, the government and companies there had approved a
$5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era survivors. Not long after,
Korman in Brooklyn approved the $1.25 billion settlement of the
Swiss banks case.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan savored the moment as he joined government officials,
industry leaders and the heads of Jewish groups at the signing
ceremony for the German agreement. ``I know for a fact that the
majority of these cases wouldn't have happened without me,'' he
said. ``That's not bravado, it's just a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   During the historic signing, though, Fagan dickered by cell
phone with Stuart E. Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary,
about lawyers' fees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German plan, two arbitrators are to decide how to
award legal fees. Fagan argued with Eizenstat, who led negotiations
in the case for the U.S. government, that he understood that the
arbitrators had up to $75 million to award, not the $62.5 million
to which some other plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the call, Fagan telephoned a partner and said, ``I got the
legal fees up.'' But his excitement was premature; documents show
that the lower figure became the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that Fagan, after failing to get higher fees,
then asked for a letter testifying about his efforts in the German
case because he feared that lawyers critical of his conduct would
seek to reduce his payout. Eizenstat said he agreed to write such a
letter because he felt Fagan had played a constructive role.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's fears are well-founded. He is seeking $4 million in the
Swiss banks case, twice as much as any other lawyer. In that case,
as in other class actions, a judge or court-appointed expert will
determine fees. Lawyers like Fagan argue in such proceedings that
they deserve the fees they seek because they took great financial
risks and played a central role in a case's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuborne and others said in recent interviews they would
argue before Judge Korman for a far lower sum for Fagan in the
Swiss banks case, contending that his contribution was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only gift was for publicity,'' said Martin Mendelsohn, a
lawyer in Washington who worked on the Holocaust claims. ``But this
was a lawsuit. It was not theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   New Clients to Pursue
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Berlin on the day of the signing
ceremony, Fagan tried to tantalize reporters: ``Nobody wants to
know where we're going next?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, Fagan and lawyers associated with him had set
their sights on a new target, Japan. They fanned out to
destinations like Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand
and the Philippines in a bid to sign up thousands of people who
claimed they were used as forced laborers, including former
American and Allied prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Hair, director of a group in Miami that represents American
civilians interned by the Japanese, said that Fagan called him in
December and characterized himself as the ``hero of the Holocaust''
cases before he began his sales pitch. Hair, who already had a
lawyer, declined.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Fagan flew to Tokyo to make client contacts at a
conference held by groups representing victims of Japanese wartime
aggression, said several people who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Public demonstrations, Fagan's stock in trade, soon followed.
This summer, hundreds of old men and women passed into a downtown
park in Seoul, South Korea, under a banner that, roughly
translated, read, ``For the first time in 55 years we have brought
action by human rights lawyers from the United States against the
Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rally's end, a Korean folk band playing drums and cymbals
led the crowd down a Seoul street as a man chanted through a
loudspeaker ``The Japanese government should repent and compensate
for their atrocities of World War II. Repent. Repent. Repent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he plans to move forward, addressing more World War
II wrongs and other human rights causes. But some, like Warshaw,
can only see the trail of broken promises and failed hopes he has
already left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can ignore someone, especially when you've
said, `I'm here to help you, I'm going to help you''' she said.

TEAMSTERS UNION ENDORSES AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long after most other unions had backed Vice President Al Gore,
the Teamsters executive board gave him its endorsement Thursday.
Despite the long wait, James P. Hoffa, the union's president, said
the decision was easy.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he pushed his board to make the endorsement after he
held extensive talks with Gore during the past few months and after
the vice president began speaking on issues important to working
families, something Hoffa said he had urged him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has come out of the Democratic convention speaking about
issues that are important to working families,'' said Hoffa, who
was in New York for a campaign rally with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
``He's talking about the middle class. He's talking about the fact
that we need help on health care, education, paying off the debt,
and I think what he says makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa denied suggestions by some political analysts that he was
a fair-weather friend who embraced Gore only after the vice
president became the front runner.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa insisted in an interview that he had planned all along to
put off an endorsement until after the conventions and after
Teamster members and leaders were polled.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor officials said Hoffa, as the new leader of the
Teamsters, also wanted to show that he is his own man and would not
automatically join the union leaders who heeded the AFL-CIO's
president, John Sweeney, and quickly endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore lobbied for the China trade bill last May, Hoffa
sometimes sounded so angry with the vice president that there
appeared to be little chance the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters would back him. Hoffa attacked the China trade deal
because it did not provide protections for workers and because he
feared it would encourage American companies to transfer operations
to China.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa said Thursday that Gore had given assurances on trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's said he's going to try to work on trade issues to make
sure there is input from labor and environmentalists with regard to
future trade deals,'' said Hoffa, who describes himself as a
progressive Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   While some labor leaders, like Gerald McEntee, president of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, seek
to endorse candidates early, believing that is the best way to
maximize influence, Hoffa's strategy has been to hold off in the
hope that candidates will make significant promises and commitments
to secure his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore had indicated that he was far more likely than Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas to pick judges and members of the National
Labor Relations Board favorable to labor. He added that Gore had
made no commitments on one of Hoffa's priorities: persuading the
federal government to end 11 years of intensive supervision aimed
at rooting out corruption in the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hoffa's aides said the Republican Party had vigorously
wooed Hoffa. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Republicans promised to make Hoffa labor's main liaison with
the White House and give him a say in labor-related appointments if
he endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa declined to criticize Bush, saying the Teamsters wanted to
improve relations with Republican lawmakers. He said the Teamsters
have endorsed several Republican congressional incumbents who have
often sided with labor, including Peter King of New York and
Christopher Smith of New Jersey.

JEWISH GROUP EXTENDS HAND TO CHRISTIANS ON HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A large group of influential Jewish scholars and rabbis have
signed a theological statement to be released this weekend calling
on Jews to relinquish their fear and mistrust of Christianity and
to acknowledge church efforts in the decades since the Holocaust to
amend Christian teaching about Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, called ``Dabru Emet'' _ which means ``speak
truth'' in Hebrew _ was signed by nearly 170 Jewish thinkers and
leaders from all four branches of Judaism _ Orthodox, Conservative,
Reform and Reconstructionist, including heads of theological
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In what is probably the most controversial point, the document
says that ``Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   It says, ``Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism
and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have
taken hold,'' but that ``Nazism itself was not an inevitable
outcome of Christianity.'' It asserts that if the Nazis had
succeeded in exterminating all the Jews, Christians would have been
the next targets.
</P>
<P>
   The document also claims major commonalities between the faiths,
saying that Jews and Christians worship the same God; seek
authority from the same book, the Bible; and accept the moral
principles of the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   A result of a scholarly dialogue that began five years ago, the
statement was the idea of Dr. Michael Signer of the University of
Notre Dame, who wrote it with Dr. Tikva Fryer-Kensky of the
University of Chicago divinity school, Dr. Peter Ochs of the
University of Virginia and Dr. David Novak of the University of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we needed a statement,'' Novak said, ``is that
major Christian groups and thinkers have in the past 30 or 40 years
come up with a major rethinking about Jews and Judaism and have
issued statements about how they can respect the legitimacy of
Judaism. It seems to us to behoove Jewish thinkers to respond
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Novak noted that as Jewish academics at non-Jewish institutions,
the four co-authors could write without seeking approval from any
denomination or religious body. Christian theologians have
expressed interest in such a statement for years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The document will be printed in paid advertisements this Sunday
in The New York Times and The Baltimore Sun. It is being released
by the Institute for Christian &AMP; Jewish Studies, an independent
interfaith organization in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In history and in contemporary times there are reasons for
Jews to be very wary of Christians,'' said Rabbi David Sandmel of
the institute. ``But the Christian world today is very different
than it was 50 or 100 or 500 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people refused to sign, many because they disagreed
with the section on the Holocaust, Sandmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi James Rudin, senior interreligious advisor at the American
Jewish Committee, said he objected because ``Christianity and
Christian teachings over the centuries created the seedbed for
Nazism to grow in. This document lets Christian teaching off too
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amy-Jill Levine, Carpenter professor of New Testament
studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School, said she was
concerned about the assertion that Jews and Christians learned from
the same Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share many of the same stories, but the interpretive
traditions are substantially different, and even the canonical
order of the books creates different texts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Levine added her signature. ``Overall, this struck
me as a hopeful and needed document at this time,'' she said,
adding that she tries to counter anti-Jewish thinking among her
Christian divinity students so that they will not spread it from
the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews do not really understand Christianity either,'' Levine
said, ``and there is no way to break down bigotry or prejudice
unless there is education, on both sides.''

DOCUMENTS SHOW FIRESTONE KNEW OF RISING WARRANTY CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Vt.)  (With TIRE-VENEZUELA and TIRE-SAFETY) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internal documents from Bridgestone/Firestone show
that officials of the company were concerned as early as February
about rising warranty costs for the tires that the company recalled
last month.
</P>
<P>
   At congressional hearings on Wednesday, Firestone executives
testified that the company's data on warranty claims did not show a
problem with the tires.
</P>
<P>
   But documents obtained by investigators working for Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., who is the chairman of the House Commerce
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, show that Firestone's sales
staff was aware of a growing problem with the company's light truck
tires even as Firestone, the U.S. unit of Bridgestone of Japan,
denied it to the Ford Motor Co. and regulators. The documents were
distributed to members of the subcommittee in preparation for its
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Tauzin questioned how Firestone's
safety officials could not have known of a problem if the sales
staff was told. ``You can't have that much information floating
around not to have noticed a problem that should have been notified
to federal authorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents include charts prepared for the sales staff's
annual meeting in February that repeatedly and prominently mention
the high cost of warranty claims for tread separation in light
truck tires.
</P>
<P>
   The label on one chart read ``Separations increasing'' in large,
underlined letters. The chart showed that the number of warranty
``adjustments,'' or claims, for tread separation had climbed to
4,694 in 1999 from 4,200 in 1998, an increase of 11.8 percent. The
chart also described how the tires were coming apart and the rates
at which each type of separation was increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Five more charts analyzed patterns in tread separations and
emphasized tires for light trucks, a category that includes the
Ford Explorer. One of these charts, labeled ``separations,'' showed
that the number of separations involving Wilderness tires had risen
194 percent in 1999 from the level a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A separate collection of charts, prepared for the same sales
meeting in February and labeled ``Critical Performance Issues,''
also singled out recreational light truck tires of the sort
installed on Explorers, with one chart stating in large letters:
``Wilderness AT needs improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone recalled 6.5 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT
tires on Aug. 9 after Ford analyzed the tire maker's data on crash
claims and found a pattern of property damage and injury claims
dating back at least to 1997. Firestone officials said then, and
have said repeatedly since then, that they missed the trend of
crash claims because they were focusing on warranty data that did
not show a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Crigger, Firestone's executive vice president for business
planning, testified before a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday that
the company's safety program relied on warranty data, quality tests
at factories and field research into the performance of tires in
use. ``None of those indicators pointed to any kind of a problem
with the tire line that we are talking about here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wyant, Firestone's vice president for quality assurance,
said that the company's warranty data was the most reliable. ``You
can see trends, there is volume there and it is statistically
significant,'' he told the Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials did not return telephone calls Thursday
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials expressed anger when told Thursday about the
Firestone documents, saying that they asked the tire maker
repeatedly to check whether the tires had a problem and had been
told every time that no problem existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flabbergasting,'' said Jason Vines, Ford's vice president
for public affairs. ``You'd think if they saw a pattern like that
they might tell us, as their largest customer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Tauzin's subcommittee, said
Thursday evening that investigators would look next at how
Firestone and Ford went about testing the tires a decade ago,
before the Explorer was introduced in late 1990 as a 1991 model.
Tauzin accused Ford in an interview earlier this week of not having
tested the tires at 26 pounds per square inch, the pressure at
which Ford recommends that they be inflated. Firestone began
recommending at the time of the recall that the tires be inflated
to 30 pounds per square inch, which would increase their capacity
to carry weight.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin told Firestone's Wyant at the hearing on Wednesday night
that the subcommittee had been trying unsuccessfully for a week to
obtain from the tire maker the original test data for the tires.
Wyant said that Firestone had been engaged in an ``around-the-clock
search'' for the test results and that he did not know what had
become of the information.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of lawmakers have been calling for a criminal
investigation of Firestone and Ford. Attorney General Janet Reno
said Thursday morning that she was reviewing such a request from
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. But Justice Department officials said
that an investigation was not likely because the federal law
covering auto defects is fairly weak.
</P>
<P>
   The law provides for fines of no more than $925,000 on
manufacturers and does not authorize criminal penalties. Firestone
and Ford, and possibly their executives, could still face
prosecution by state or local authorities, however, if it is proven
that they knowingly sold products with deadly defects.  &QL;

 &HT;    Fund-raising pace remains hot
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President AL Gore's fund-raising trip to Atlanta
today _ coming less than two months before the Nov. 7 general
election _ underscores the way the thirst for campaign money has
dominated the 2000 presidential race like never before.
</P>
<P>
   It also shows how post-Watergate reforms designed stop
fund-raising during the general election have all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when candidates ended their fund-raising
obligations with the party nominating conventions. Campaign 2000
will be a money dash into October. As with Gore's visit today, the
focus on money is often driving when and where candidates campaign,
cutting into their time to meet and greet average voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we are seeing this year is that
wherever the candidates are going along the trail, they are doing
fund-raising,'' said Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at
Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ``That was most obvious at the
conventions, where an unprecedented amount of fund-raising was
done, and I think we are now going to see that carry right through
the month of September and into October, because the demand for
this money has become so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Including tonight's activities, Gore has attended eight
fund-raising events since the Democratic convention wrapped up
three weeks ago. That doesn't include events headlined by his wife,
Tipper, or his running mate Joe Lieberman, who the party is
beginning to cycle into the mix of scheduled fund-raisers. More
events are scheduled. Gore and Lieberman and the DNC can't say when
the candidates will participate in their last one before the Nov. 7
election.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the GOP nominee, also has kept up
the fund-raising pace, after shattering the record for the most
money raised by a candidate in a primary. Bush has done four
fund-raising events for the Republican National Committee since the
GOP convention and will continue to help state Republican parties
raise money. Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Bush's running
mate, also is pitching in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney are occasionally helping''
the state and national parties raise money, said Ray Sullivan, a
Bush spokesman. ``It is certainly not a priority, when you compare
it to the importance of going to states and reaching voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fund-raising is a relatively new phenomenon. When Congress
passed the first campaign reform legislation in 1974, after the
Watergate scandal, it established a system of public financing for
presidential candidates in the general election, barring them from
raising money for their campaigns if they accepted public money.
This year, Gore and Bush each became eligible for $67.56 million in
public funds after their respective conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the 1974 legislation was to free candidates from
the burden of fund-raising and allow them to focus their general
election campaigns on communicating with voters. The law also was
meant to insulate candidates from the perception that raising large
sums obligated them to donors.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal of public financing began to unravel with the
advent of soft money, unregulated donations from corporations,
unions and wealthy individuals that parties could collect and spend
on generic ``party building'' activities like voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1988, the parties began expanding the definition of
what constituted a party building activity. The floodgates opened
in 1996, analysts say, when when President Clinton and the
Democrats used soft money to finance issue advertising, ads that
advocate positions but not candidates. The Republicans quickly
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created an insatiable demand for this money,'' Corrado
said. ``Because no matter how much you raise, you can spend (it) on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   So while presidential candidates can't raise money for their own
campaigns during the general election (except for legal and
administrative expenses), they are free to continue raising money
for their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the two major parties are on pace to raise
a record $500 million in unregulated, soft money this election
cycle _ twice the amount raised in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in 17 battleground states already are seeing what the
money is buying _ tens of millions of dollars worth of 30-second
commercials from the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the two parties are spending more than $10
million a week on ads that prominently feature the two major
candidates. The latest Republican spot is an attack on Gore's
credibility; the Democrats responded with one that attacks Bush's
record on health care policy in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't had this large an air war this early in the
campaign,'' said Clifford May, a spokesman for the RNC. ``The
genteel era of taking breaks may be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the DNC, said the fund-raising
activities scheduled by the party since the Democratic convention
are serving a dual purpose as the election nears: raising money and
energizing supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC has scheduled two music concerts later this month, one
New York and one in Silicon Valley in California, as a way to raise
money and draw bigger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fund-raising is designed to . . . gather a lot of folks
together, talk about the issues, and then get people to go forward
to knock on doors and bring us to victory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the larger events, money is driving the process.
Federal election laws prohibit the parties from using only soft
money to pay for issue advertising; the parties must mix the soft
money with donations that are subject to limits _ $1,000 from an
individual and $5,000 from a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are scrambling to raise enough of this regulated
hard money so that they can spend their soft money. All the
fund-raisers Gore has done since the convention, for example, have
been to raise hard money. Party officials have sought to broaden
the base of their hard money donations by scheduling concerts and
bigger events where ticket prices are lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these events are more political or more fund-raising
is kind of a relative question right now,'' said Backus.
``Everything we are doing now is motivating people to bring them
out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts caution that the candidates could face a
public backlash if they are perceived to be putting fund-raising
ahead of connecting with average voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters may begin to say, `What about us?' '' said Larry
Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ``
`Enough with the fund-raising.' ''

POLL RESULTS PRESENT NEW WORRY FOR BUSH CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Not two months ago, George W. Bush enjoyed such a
wide lead in the polls that many Democrats had given up hope,
assuming Al Gore could never shed the albatross-like mantle of the
vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But with the election two months away, all the hand-wringing
Thursday was found in GOP circles. New polls showed Gore even or
ahead of Bush, and senior Republicans expressed concerns that
Bush's campaign is adrift, lacking a forceful message and frozen on
the defensive by a series of campaign miscues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself, resigned to a close contest _ or in the view of
some Democrats, hoping there will be one _ called himself the
underdog. And the Bush campaign, admitting it will have to retool
its strategy, was clearly shaken by the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   To some Bush partisans, this is deja vu all over again: The
intra-party complaints were almost identical last February when
Bush, the consensus choice of party leaders and fundraisers, was
badly bloodied by Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has had two or three bad weeks. But some
Democrats and Republicans say Gore's surge since his own party's
convention ended on August 13 is bound to become permanent for a
simple reason: Bush is asking voters to oust the Democrats from
power at a time of almost unprecedented peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, some Republican political strategists say Bush
faces additional problems of his own making: His issues, especially
his call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut, are not resonating with
voters, according to two of the new polls. And through a series of
key errors _ including his handling of the presidential debates and
the financial disclosures of his vice presidential running mate _
Bush has shown a willingness to ignore outside advice, a
characteristic that some Republicans believe could spell greater
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of ups and downs in the polls,'' said Andy
Kohut, executive director of the Pew Research Center for People and
the Press, which tracks voter views. ``When they bounce around, I
see it as a lack of voter conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kohut said, if the current trend continues into next week,
``then George Bush has something to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's poll numbers were enough to cause some Republicans to
start worrying right away.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters/Zogby poll of 1,001 likely voters showed Gore leading
Bush, 46 to 40 percent, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent. The
poll, taken over three nights, also indicated a notable gender gap,
with women favoring Gore by 21 points _ nearly twice as much as men
favor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Washington Post-ABC News poll reflected a dead heat,
with both candidates attracting 47 percent. But on issue after
issue, those polled said they agreed more with Gore's position than
that of Bush. And although the polls will most certainly shift
again, the close numbers suggest the race has changed markedly
since July, when Bush led by eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush's firm grip on several key swing states,
including Missouri and Pennsylvania, has slipped. Even Florida,
where his brother, Jeb, is governor, Bush no longer has an
advantage but is waging a fierce fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, one of the Democrat's most respected poll takers,
has been saying for several months, even when Bush held wide leads
in many polls, that the ``underlying dynamics'' of peace and
prosperity would eventually draw the electorate back to the party
in power, and to Gore. And other strategists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a much tougher election for us than it
may have looked from some of the earlier polls,'' said one senior
Republican strategist consulted by the Bush campaign. ``The two
major issues were always going to be peace and prosperity, and the
country has both. It's hard to make the case for a change agent in
those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if that were not the case, Bush has made some decisions
that appear in retrospect to be blunders. He released two negative
personal ads against Gore in the last week, making himself
vulnerable to criticism that his call to ``change the tone in
Washington'' was insincere.
</P>
<P>
   His running mate, Dick Cheney, has failed to inspire crowds in
the way Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph I. Lieberman
has. And Cheney has come under fire for a massive retirement
package he received from Halliburton, the oil company he ran before
quitting to join the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, Bush is still facing a basic problem
he faced more than a year ago: Convincing voters he is a serious
candidate, rather than light on policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has put him on the defensive, accusing Bush of failing to
provide details of his prescription drug plan and ridiculing his
tax cut. Bush has spent entire days responding to various attacks
by Gore, somehow unable to get his own pet topic _ education _ into
the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has always been, would George Bush have the forensic
ability to get his message out in the face of Gore's onslaughts and
counterattacks?'' said one former strategist to President Ronald
Reagan. ``The results so far do not inspire confidence in Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenges from Gore aside, Bush has been his own worst enemy at
times. While Gore rooted his appeal in a detail-oriented agenda,
Bush took long detours away from his platform to contest the debate
schedule, launching a series of negative ads and mentioning the
controversy in his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot see what Al Gore did to explain this (polling
lead),'' said one longtime Republican strategist who is no longer
certain Bush will win. ``But I think Bush and the Republican Party
have really failed because they have not been talking about the
issues. Instead, this week, they have been debating the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategist continued: ``The voters are saying, `If I vote
for him, what do I get?' And he's not answered that question. When
he does that, he can turn this around.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in the wake of much Republican hand-wringing and the
new set of polls, Bush softened his stance on the debates for the
first time, saying he was confident he and Gore ``work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be debates. What they look like, where they are,
will be worked out in due course,'' Bush said, a full reversal of
his position just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will shift gears in other cosmetic ways _ holding
press conferences outdoors instead of a dimly-lit airplane, and
focusing on more real people as he campaigns. He will also return
to a more intimate style of campaigning, staging ``one on one''
events.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remained characteristically calm in the wake of the polls,
shrugging and grinning as he greeted reporters on the tarmac
Thursday morning. He repeated a favorite line _ ``This is going to
be a tough race'' _ but dwelled on the topic of his strategy longer
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a very tough opponent,'' he said. ``He is the
incumbent. He represents the incumbency, and a challenger is
somebody who generally comes from the back and wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was suggesting he is now the underdog, Bush
said: ``Yeah, I am the underdog. Sure I am.'' It was a line Gore
later mocked, citing the nearly $100 million in campaign funding
Bush has raised, but it suggested the tactic the Texas governor may
now pursue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than four years ago, a little-known personal-injury lawyer
named Edward D. Fagan stood next to an Auschwitz survivor at a news
conference in New York and announced an audacious lawsuit, accusing
Swiss banks of stealing money 50 years ago from those who died in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fagan has a new and glamorous career and is likely soon
to earn millions of dollars in legal fees. He has since filed
lawsuits against banks, insurers and other companies in Austria,
Germany and elsewhere, charging that they too profited from Nazi
ties or exploited victims. Settlements of actions against Swiss
banks and German industry worth over $6.2 billion were recently
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawyers got involved in the Holocaust claims. But the
47-year-old Fagan cast himself apart as a media-savvy street
fighter who became the public point man in the cases. This July, he
hopscotched in a few days from Berlin to Vienna to Warsaw on behalf
of tens of thousands of people that he and lawyers associated with
him represent.
</P>
<P>
   They have also opened a second front, charging Japanese
companies in lawsuits with using thousands of Asians and others as
forced labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a posse,'' the tall, curly-haired and engaging
lawyer said. ``There are all these bad guys all over the world and
we have to track them down one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   His mission, he said, is to reach back into history and force a
reckoning with those who profited from evil. But an investigation
by The New York Times and the ABC News program ``20/20'' has found
that Fagan is facing his own reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   As he recast himself as a ``human rights'' lawyer, Fagan left
neglected personal-injury clients in his wake, abandoning their
claims or not returning their phone calls for years, according to
court papers and interviews. One former client recently won a
malpractice judgment against Fagan and ethics officials in New
Jersey filed a misconduct complaint against him last month on
behalf of another client.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, so at ease with using the emotional force of the
Holocaust as a weapon, also ignored for months scores of plaintive
calls and letters from aging Nazi-era survivors anxious about
whether their claims had been received, according to a paralegal
who worked last year for him and his partner at the time. Fagan
conceded he may have failed some clients by taking on too much
work. But he insisted that he did his best to represent his
personal-injury clients and that he labored ceaselessly in the
Holocaust cases without financial guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable to be a lawyer and to be able to use your
profession to do good,'' he said. ``To change history. To stand up
for people's human rights is incredible, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's conduct does not appear to have jeopardized the
financial claims of his Holocaust clients, but several survivors he
represented say that his failure to return calls for months, even
years, took an emotional toll.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Fagan played a leading role in
promoting the Holocaust claims, cases whose moral charge made them
a public cause. He specialized in shaming companies and
governments, orchestrating demonstrations and prayer vigils. Some
Holocaust survivors and advocates view him as their champion.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made it his business, while other lawyers were
painstakingly developing legal claims, to be first at the
courthouse, gaining leverage with a hasty filing. A news conference
with an aged survivor would soon follow, drawing in a flood of
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers in the Holocaust cases say Fagan's ambitions
vastly outstripped his resources to deal with the vast numbers of
clients he took on and added that he was often absent for the
grinding legal work. Burt Neuborne, who had worked with Fagan
before breaking with him, said Fagan's filing in the Swiss banks
case was so inadequate that a judge asked him to rewrite it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an ordinary man who got swept up in issues that were
bigger than he was,'' said Neuborne, a law professor at New York
University. ``He didn't understand and eventually didn't really
know how to behave and just got swept away in the current of his
own ego and his own ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlingen, Texas, Fagan grew up in nearby San Antonio
with two brothers and a sister. He once wanted to be a rabbi, and
studied in Israel. After his religious ardor waned, Fagan returned
to the United States and enrolled in Cardozo Law School in New
York, a part of Yeshiva University, graduating in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As Fagan began his claim against the Swiss banks in late 1996,
the claims of some of his personal-injury clients were apparently
abandoned or forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   One was Hector Ortiz. In 1992, Ortiz, a truck driver, smashed
into the back of a slow-moving crane, shattering bones and
sustaining head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fagan filed a $35 million lawsuit on his behalf in
federal court in Brooklyn and brought a similar action in state
Supreme Court there. He aggressively pursued the federal claim
until late 1996, court papers and interviews indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson Jr.
dismissed Ortiz's federal lawsuit, noting, among other things, that
Fagan had ``failed to prosecute'' it for three years and had
ignored court orders. Ortiz's claim in Brooklyn state court has
lain dormant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former client, Offer Salmoni, won a $167,000
malpractice judgment against Fagan, which the lawyer did not
contest. Fagan had filed a lawsuit on Salmoni's behalf in 1993 to
contest an eviction. Salmoni charged in a 1998 lawsuit that Fagan
had allowed that claim to be thrown out by repeatedly failing to
make court appearances and had let the statute of limitations
expire without refiling. Fagan, who is licensed to practice in New
York and New Jersey, said he planned to settle with Salmoni.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New Jersey ethics officials, after a preliminary
inquiry, filed a misconduct complaint before a grievance committee
against Fagan on behalf of another former client, Diane Gibbons.
Gibbons had complained to the ethics board that Fagan's failure to
file required papers in her personal-injury action led to its
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a legal-ethics expert at New York University
who is not involved in the Holocaust litigation, said that lawyers
face sanctions if they ignore existing claims when the prospects of
bigger awards beckon. ``Your loyalty to your original client is
undiluted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal-injury clients, whose names were provided to The
Times by Fagan, said he fought difficult cases on their behalf,
adding that they would use him again. But Fagan acknowledged that
he failed to withdraw _ as lawyers are required to _ from suits he
did not pursue.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999, with the Holocaust cases on the way to settlement,
Fagan had established his place on the world stage. When Jane
Warshaw, a paralegal, came to work for him that fall, she was
thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were doing God's work,'' said the paralegal,
57.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Fagan's partner at the time, Carey R. D'Avino,
asked her to check the office's telephone answering system. On it,
she found more than 100 unanswered messages from Holocaust
survivors as well as personal-injury clients, including Ortiz. It
sounded like many had been desperately calling for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Stacks of unopened letters from Holocaust survivors or their
heirs were scattered around and stuffed in a drawer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by what she viewed as client neglect, Warshaw in
January sent a recording of those calls and correspondence to U.S.
District Court Judge Edward R. Korman of Brooklyn, who is
overseeing the Swiss banks case. She also provided that material to
The Times and ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from the documents and recordings is
chaotic. New York disciplinary officials were investigating
complaints by three of Fagan's clients. Calls from Holocaust
claimants were bounced from one answering machine to another.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Bella Ross, said that her parents, concentration
camp survivors, were ecstatic when Fagan first took their case in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, you know, they had this savior,'' said Ross in a
recent interview. ``I mean, this is the man. You saw him on TV. You
heard about him on the radio. You see him in print. He is
everywhere. It was like finally they were blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, however, the family was so concerned about Fagan's
lack of response to dozens of messages and faxes that she filed a
complaint against him with New York disciplinary officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, Mr. Fagan has done nothing to update my parents on
the status of their case and is literally unreachable,'' Ross wrote
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Lieberman, a lawyer who represented Fagan in the matter,
told investigators in a March letter responding to Ross' complaint
that Fagan could not possibly deal with each of his tens of
thousands of clients.
</P>
<P>
   Other Holocaust lawyers, though, were devoting more extensive
resources to client communication. While some used paralegals to
handle calls, Neubourne, the New York University professor, said he
set aside four hours a week to deal directly with survivors,
including many of Fagan's clients who called him out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who lived with these memories for so long,''
Neubourne said. ``The memories were then opened up, somebody told
them something was going to happen. And then they just got cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan called Warshaw a ``disgruntled former employee,'' though
he conceded that some of her concerns were legitimate. He added
that only a tiny fraction of clients had complained.
</P>
<P>
   Korman referred Warshaw's complaint to court officials and
D'Avino said that a court investigator contacted him. Fagan said an
assistant was hired in June to answer calls and he believed the
matter was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Fagan arrived in Berlin as part of a victory lap in two
of the most significant cases. To settle slave-labor claims against
German industry, the government and companies there had approved a
$5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era survivors. Not long after,
Korman in Brooklyn approved the $1.25 billion settlement of the
Swiss banks case.
</P>
<P>
   During the signing of the settlement, though, Fagan dickered by
cell phone with Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury
secretary, about lawyers' fees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German plan, two arbitrators are to decide how to
award legal fees. Fagan argued with Eizenstat, who led negotiations
in the case for the U.S. government, that he understood that the
arbitrators had up to $75 million to award, not the $62.5 million
to which some other plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the call, Fagan telephoned a partner and said, ``I got the
legal fees up.'' But his excitement was premature; documents show
that the lower figure became the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that Fagan, after failing to get higher fees,
then asked for a letter testifying about his efforts in the German
case because he feared that lawyers critical of his conduct would
seek to reduce his payout. Eizenstat said he agreed to write such a
letter because he felt Fagan had played a constructive role.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's fears are well-founded. He is seeking $4 million in the
Swiss banks case, twice as much as any other lawyer. In that case,
as in other class actions, a judge or court-appointed expert will
determine fees. Lawyers like Fagan argue in such proceedings that
they deserve the fees they seek because they took great financial
risks and played a central role in a case's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuborne and others said in interviews they would argue
before Korman for a far lower sum for Fagan in the Swiss banks
case, contending that his contribution was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only gift was for publicity,'' said Martin Mendelsohn, a
lawyer in Washington who worked on the Holocaust claims. ``But this
was a lawsuit. It was not theater.''

 &HT;    Gore stops in Atlanta today for two fund-raisers
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore attends two events in Atlanta
today, but only those willing to spend at least $1,000 will be able
to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will appear at a reception at the Hyatt Regency at 6 p.m.
and deliver remarks to ticketed guests and the media. Then, he's
off to a private dinner with 100 guests at the home of Anne Cox
Chambers, the media heiress who had backed former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to raise $1 million for the Democratic National
Committee at both events, said event co-chairman Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers is chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers, which owns the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and also a stakeholder in Cox
Enterprises, the fifth-largest cable operator in the country. Her
father, James M. Cox, was a Democratic governor of Ohio and was the
Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, a former ambassador to Belgium under President Carter,
has come full circle in her support for Gore. She was a major
backer of Gore's failed presidential bid in 1988, but she fell out
with Gore in 1992 over cable rate regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who could not be reached for comment, has in the past
declined to talk about her relationship with Gore, but Alexander
Netchvolodoff, Cox Enterprises' vice president of public policy,
and Gore aides previously said the rift occurred because Gore
supported legislation regulating cable rates while he was a U.S.
senator.
</P>
<P>
   The two also disagreed over provisions of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, said Greg Simon, who was then Gore's chief
domestic policy adviser. The act included a three-year phaseout of
cable rate regulations instead of an immediate phaseout that was
supported by Chambers and other cable operators. Last year,
Chambers contributed to Bradley's unsuccessful bid for the
Democratic nomination and hosted a fund-raiser at her home that
netted the New Jersey Democrat $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Coles approached Chambers about contributing to the
Democratic Party and its efforts to elect Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take any coaxing whatsoever to get her help,'' said
Coles, the cookie company executive who was the Democratic Party's
senate nominee against Paul Coverdell in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers donated $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee
in April, matching the largest individual contribution by any
Georgian to either political party. Coles has also donated $100,000
to the Democrats. Coles described Chambers' relationship to Gore as
one of mutual respect, despite their past disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between the vice president and Mrs. Chambers
goes back a very, very long time,'' Coles said. ``Any support she
may have given to Bill Bradley early on had to do with just sending
a message that maybe that she hadn't approved, or had some
disagreements with the vice president in the past. But I think the
loyalty to the vice president has always been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Farley, a spokesman for Cox Enterprises, said Chambers was
out of the country and would not attend the fund-raiser herself.
Gov. Roy Barnes, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) and Sen. Zell Miller
(D-Ga.) are expected to be among the guests. The minimum donation
to attend the dinner was $5,000, said Keith Mason, Gore's state
co-chairman. The suggested donation for the reception beforehand
was $1,000.

MIDEAST PEACE TALKS AT UN HANG IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first strong indication that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks weren't going anywhere this week in
New York came late Wednesday. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
stormed out of a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright after Albright pressured him for concessions on Jerusalem,
US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The highly pressured negotiations flew apart Thursday. Though
not finished, the negotiations remain in limbo until the
Palestinian Council decides this weekend whether to back the
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on Sept. 13, as
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility remains unlikely, but if the lawmakers do so,
with the blessing and encouragement of Arafat, the peace talks
would end. If the lawmakers push back the date, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday that the two sides and President
Clinton would have only a few weeks to put together a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the best-case scenario, the odds are long for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few weeks we have to find if we have a partner or
this is the end of the road of this part of the stage,'' Barak said
in Hebrew at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed his senior Middle East mediator, Dennis Ross,
to keep talking to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. The US
president also is prepared to begin talks again, although no
meetings were set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is available and everyone is quite flexible,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   From interviews with US officials and the blunt comments made by
Barak Thursday, the crux of the remaining division between the
Israelis and Palestinians remained the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The specific divisive issue has become the fate of the Temple
Mount, location of the ancient Jewish temples and the holiest site
in Judaism. The elevated compound, known in Arabic as Haram Sharif,
or Noble Sanctuary, is also site of the Dome of the Rock and
al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and other members of the Palestinian delegation have
alleged that Israelis were digging underneath the Temple Mount, US
officials said, a charge that has recurred from time to time over
the years. Israeli officials denied the claim in negotiations, US
officials said. In 1996, Israel's opening of a tunnel near the holy
site sparked violent confrontations in Jerusalem and the West Bank,
killing nearly 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   According to US officials, Clinton has proposed awarding
sovereignty to the Palestinians over the mosques and recognize
Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall, remnant of the perimeter
wall of the Jews' Second Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the wall around the Temple Mount and the enclosed
area apart from the mosques would be placed under ``divine
sovereignty,'' the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that religious claims could destroy the negotiations,
US officials had tried to push old issues to the sidelines during
the Camp David talks, which broke up six weeks ago without
agreement but with substantial progress on addressing the core
issues for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But for Arafat, the suspicions about digging underneath the
Temple Mount have risen to foremost importance, according to US
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. US government
lawyers, in response, have begun researching the legal boundaries
of the Temple Mount compound.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat Thursday indicated that religious issues dominated his
approach to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I . . . promised my people, my nation, my
religions _ Christian and Islam _ I am not going to betray them,''
Arafat said in an interview with CNN. ``You must remember with whom
you are speaking, you are speaking to Yasser Arafat. I will
continue to liberate all the Muslim and Christian holy places. It
is clear and obvious. If not, another one will come to liberate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Arafat walked out of the meeting with Albright, stunned US
officials briefed Clinton, who had just spent an hour talking with
Barak. Clinton, because of Arafat's anger, decided not to confront
him as Albright had on Jerusalem, said a US official who described
the 90-minute meeting between Clinton and Arafat as cordial.
</P>
<P>
   The president's hope, according the official, was that the talks
could continue in a week or so. The official said he didn't want to
risk the talks breaking down completely in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But among US officials there are disagreements about whether
Arafat's outburst was genuine or staged. If the anger was
calculated, it may have been done to delay tough negotiations until
after the meeting with Palestinian legislators, officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Barak have publicly accused Arafat of
intransigence in the talks, US officials also acknowledge that the
decision on Jerusalem is not Arafat's alone to make. They also say
that because discussions moved so quickly at Camp David, US
officials did not have enough time to brief leaders in the Arab
world about the potential scenarios of a final Israeli-Palestinian
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton has spoken in person or on the telephone
with several Arab leaders, and Edward Walker, the assistant
secretary of state for Near Near Eastern Affairs, traveled from
Morroco to Oman to brief kings, sultans and prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak said Arafat was giving no ground. The Israeli prime
minister also disclosed details that revealed the Americans as
preparing specific proposals to break the logjam.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton raised several far-reaching ideas on the
core issues such as Jerusalem, refugees and borders and security,''
Barak said. ``I told President Clinton that some of the ideas he
raised were beyond the ideas we would accept. But if Arafat was
ready to take the ideas as a basis for negotiations, we would be
ready to enter the negotiations with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now,'' Barak said, ``Arafat has not been ready to use
that as a basis for negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also specifically mentioned the need to win a large
monetary package from Congress as a cornerstone for the deal.
Israel has asked for at least $17 billion in new US aid for
security upgrades, including a request for state-of-the-art fighter
jets, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not lost hope that a solution could be found and would
be found,'' Barak said. ``But it's clear time is running out. In
October, Congress will adjourn and there is a clear need to
mobilize a major sum of money.''

GOP SWITCHES COURSE AND PLANS VOTE ON DRUG COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading Senate Republicans, under intense pressure
from Democrats and some of their own members, changed course
Thursday and said they would try to pass legislation in the next
few weeks to help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments guarantee that senators will soon be able to vote
on legislation similar to the competing proposals offered by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After months of resisting Democratic efforts to offer drug
coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries, the Senate Republicans said
they would schedule a debate and a vote on the issue, which has
reverberated through the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said that Democrats, eager to highlight
differences between the parties, would seize every opportunity to
force votes on the issue before Congress adjourns next month. And
Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance
Committee, said that Republicans would try to push through
legislation to subsidize state programs that help low-income
elderly people buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Votes in the Senate do not mean that anything will become law
this year. But they would permit lawmakers to tell constituents
they had tried to address one of the most pressing concerns of many
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who is in a tight race for re-election, introduced two
bills Thursday to provide federal money to the states for
pharmaceutical assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This temporary legislation offers an assurance to low-income
seniors that they will be able to receive the help they need while
Congress completes the larger task of overhauling the Medicare
program,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's proposal resembles a major element of a plan unveiled by
Bush on Tuesday. Roth described his proposal as an interim measure
to provide drug coverage ``outside the Medicare program.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, has
opposed Democratic efforts to call up prescription drug
legislation. But he is no longer in a position to stop a debate and
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said Thursday night:
``Senator Lott strongly supports the effort to provide seniors in
need with prescription drugs now. That's why he is a co-sponsor of
the Roth bills. This is the first step in what Governor Bush has
outlined as a two-step process. Ultimately, we want to see
modernization of Medicare, with reforms to guarantee its long-term
solvency.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said his proposal, modeled on the Children's Health
Insurance Program, would offer $51 billion to the states over the
next four years to assist Medicare beneficiaries with annual
incomes up to 75 percent above the poverty level _ up to $14,600
for an individual or $19,700 for a couple.
</P>
<P>
   At least 22 states already have pharmaceutical assistance
programs. Roth's bill would encourage states to establish or expand
them, and the federal government would offer its own program in any
state that did not have one.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, many
above the income limits specified in Roth's bill, do not have any
insurance for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth proposal fleshes out ideas he had been considering
before the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, where
many speakers declared their commitment to drug coverage for
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said Thursday that they would test that
commitment by forcing votes on the Senate floor. The votes could
occur this way: Democrats offer their proposal as an amendment to
some legislation pending on the Senate floor, and Republicans offer
their proposal as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight is going to be conducted at every opportunity for
the remainder of this session of Congress,'' Graham said. Graham is
one of the main architects of the Senate Democrats' proposal for
Medicare drug benefits, which closely resembles the plan developed
by Vice President Gore and the Clinton White House over the last 20
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected the Democratic proposal by a vote of 53-44
on June 22. Two Republican senators, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island
and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, voted for it; one Democrat, John
Breaux of Louisiana, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate
Democratic Policy Committee, asked Thursday: ``What has changed
since the last vote? We now have a stack of speeches delivered in
Philadelphia. Let's see whether those who talk about prescription
drug benefits are willing to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either there has been a genuine change of heart by Senate
Republicans, or the speeches in Philadelphia were not a true
reflection of what they really believe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial, the Republican Party of Rhode Island
boasts that Chafee ``voted against his own party for a real
patient's bill of rights and a prescription drug benefit that gives
seniors the drugs they need at a price they can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said elderly people would, in many states, have
to go to welfare offices to qualify for pharmaceutical assistance
under state programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Roth insisted that no stigma would be attached to drug coverage
under his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services,
criticized Roth's proposal for other reasons. ``It doesn't cover
everyone, and it's not fair because the benefits would not be
consistent across the country,'' Shalala said. ``Where you live
would determine what benefits you get.''  &QL;

<P>
   It's T-minus 168 hours, give or take a time zone, before the
Autumn Games begin as spring arrives to a lingering winter-struck
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything.
</P>
<P>
   And the big minus, if you hadn't heard, hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Not some, not half, not even the bulk of, but all 441 hours of
what NBC will send back prepackaged and wrapped in preservatives to
the 13 colonies and its subsequent possessions will be about a day
ol So not only is it not live, or even ``plausibly live,'' it'll be
part of your kids' world-history class curriculum by the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, the network might reintroduce itself to the
technological advances that started with the Ben Franklin era of a
kite and Fortunately, much of the current population has heard of a
gizmo called the computer, which can tap into a netherworld called
the Internet, which _ get this _ provides nearly instantaneous
information.
</P>
<P>
   Which, as we have come to understand it, are what make sporting
events that much more enjoyable to experience.
</P>
<P>
   The network continues to stick with its story. The time
difference _ 18 hours between the place where kangaroos run wild
and where the L.A. Zoo has them caged _ is why tape-delay is the
only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as NBC pooh-bah Dick Ebersol says: ``In order to bring the
competition to the greatest number of viewers, it will be all on
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay no attention to the fact that in 1992, the same network gave
Americans the option of !ital!three live pay channels to watch the
events from Barcelona, Spain. But that, as it turned out, did not
serve the greatest number of viewers. So that option isn't one any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what NBC has done with its $705 million investment in
these athletic events is basically say it's not sports, it's
entertainment, and you'd better get used to that concept now or
else you'll just be another confused passive consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At least NBC tried to deliver some live coverage during the '88
Games in Seoul. But it didn't get the ratings outpouring that it
expected. This time, it feels it has to protect itself. And the
chance that if it did carry stuff live overnight, we'd just tape
them anyway and watch the next morning, speeding through the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And since NBC announced Thursday that it has sold out its
advertising space to reach a record high $900 million in revenue _
which secures the network turning a profit _ this approach must
work.
</P>
<P>
   That's the American way, bub.
</P>
<P>
   But what NBC has done is condescending, as it condenses the
athletic achievements of the world's elite into viewer-friendly
tidbits, first with the prepackaged bio feature, then with the
result of an event.
</P>
<P>
   It's restrictive and it tricks you into thinking that if you
don't want to know the results, you can effectively tune out all
other TV, radio, newspapers, Internet and co-worker's bellowing. No
problem, right?
</P>
<P>
   It's insulting, insinuating that live results really aren't that
important.
</P>
<P>
   And it's demeaning. As well as plain mean.
</P>
<P>
   So on behalf of this newspaper, which will likely have stories,
pictures and expanded results on events from Sydney before you
actually have a chance to see them on TV, we're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Just thought you'd like to know.
</P>
<P>
   __ In other words: Dick Enberg's essays were at least something
to look forward to during the Olympics telecast, but even that
won't be an option this time.
</P>
<P>
   Having jumped from NBC to CBS earlier this year, he'll be
covering the last few matches at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in
New York, then be off to his NFL assignments with partner Dan
Dierdorf, starting with the Bills-Jets game a week from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will be carried live by that network.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe New York is a far cry from Australia, but he's not crying
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so involved here that when someone mentioned it the
other day, asking if I didn't wish I was doing the Games, I said,
`Are they about to start?' '' Enberg said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His take on the non-live Olympic coverage:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now that when I sit down to watch, anything I see will
only be the creme de la creme. I won't have to wade through an
event that's not so interesting or doesn't have a dramatic outcome.
They'll handpick all the best moments. The fact that I'll know some
of the results, they'll probably be a instance where I might say,
`There's something else instead I might do this hour.' But I
suspect there's a magnetism once you become drawn in that makes it
pretty tough to walk away.''

<P>
   __ The other games: ESPN's newest foray into the game-show
business starts Monday at 4 p.m. with ``ESPN's 2-Minute Drill,''
hosted by crossover ``SportsCenter'' deadpan anchor Kenny Mayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe is probably somewhere in between Dick Enberg on
`Sports Challenge' and Regis on `Millionaire,' '' admits Mayne.
``One benefit for this show is that we did not have a wardrobe
allowance and we got the suits at the same place where Regis went
to start his show. They are nice suits and I'm happy to be wearing
them, but we're not going to start any fashion trends.''

WHAT SMOKES __ ``One Day In September,'' which won the Academy
Award for this year's best documentary feature, has a one-time-only
play on HBO on Monday at 8 p.m. before it heads toward theater
distribution. Anything but a stuffy rehash of the events
surrounding the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches during
the '72 Olympics in Munich, West Germany, this 1-hour film narrated
by Michael Douglas includes remarkable recounting by the lone
surviving Palestinian terrorist, who has been hiding in Africa for
the last 25 years, contrasted with the story told by Ankie Spitzer,
the widow of Israeli fencing coach Andre Spitzer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Last time the same athlete simultaneously made the cover of
Time and Newsweek . . . heck, who keeps track of these things?
Anyway, Marion Jones won't go unnoticed when the Games begin next
week. Oh, and she's also on the cover of Sports Illustrated For
Women. &QL;

<P>
   __ The Kings' new radio spots for season tickets. This year,
they have soundbites from coach Andy Murray addressing the team in
the locker room and on the bench, which highlight not so much a
``Win One For the Gipper'' approach but a no-nonsense,
here's-what-it-takes mentality that the hockey fan really finds
intriguing. Here's a coach who not only won't shy away from wearing
a mike but turns out is good enough to sell tickets. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES __ ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' Web site
(www.espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/sights_sound s/dmiller.html) has a
new weekly feature: Dennis Miller's ``top lines of the week.'' Such
as, from the Rams-Broncos' opener, the No. 1 quip: ``Everyone's
worried about me using profanity _ the only f- word I might say a
lot this year is Faulk.'' Ah, the Disney family must be proud. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking things a step dumber, The Encyclopedia Britannica's
Web site (www.britannica.com) introduced an ``Annotated Dennis
Miller'' feature, breaking down his historical, literary and
sociological references. It details what he was referring to, tries
to explain what he meant and speculates on what he was implying.
Here's a rule of thumb: Anytime you need a joke explained to you,
or in this case translated, it kinda loses its effect.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a cold night last December, a white limousine
stopped near Il Boschetto restaurant in Yonkers. Two large men
stepped out and hurried through the restaurant's tinted front door.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were suspected of being mob racketeers. One, Joseph
Datello, was an inducted member of the Lucchese crime family. The
other, Sean J. Richard, was the son-in-law of John Riggi, the
imprisoned boss of the New Jersey-based DeCavalcantes. Richard had
recently been in a car accident. He wore a bandage on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   In the restaurant, they met Steven L. Crea, the Luccheses'
acting boss, who greeted them from the first stool at the bar. For
about an hour, the three men talked about bribery and extortion,
the authorities say. Richard remembers that Crea was angry. He
speculated darkly about a man he thought might be a snitch.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, Richard dropped Datello off at his home
on Staten Island, as he had after many meetings before. Then he
broke from the routine.
</P>
<P>
   He directed his driver to a motel parking lot and switched cars,
taking a seat in a sedan with another group of men. Reaching into
his sweatsuit, he unrolled the bandage and removed a hidden
recording device.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Richard had just betrayed his Mafia boss. Crea had guessed
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was a fellow boss' son-in-law, worried that his
future held either jail time or a violent death, who had turned
against him. In the parlance of mobsters, Richard had become a rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the kind of circumstances you want to gain fame
and notoriety for,'' Richard said in a recent interview. ``But I
didn't have many options, and that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who while in hiding agreed to several interviews, is
the mob's latest embarrassing, tell-all turncoat. He is an eager
raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, unsealed racketeering indictments against Crea and 37
other defendants, accusing them of participating in a criminal
enterprise that drove up the prices of construction projects
throughout the city. The indictment identifies Crea as the acting
boss and Datello as a soldier in the Lucchese crime family.
</P>
<P>
   As the prosecutions go forward, they will rely on years of
investigation and wiretaps by the New York Police Department. And
they will rely on Richard, who agreed to plead guilty to attempted
enterprise corruption in exchange for a new identity and a sentence
of five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   In return, he plans to testify with zeal about how the
Luccheses, through persistence and payoffs, maintained a grip on
construction projects at a time when the Mafia was supposedly in
decline. Dozens of contractors, union officials and mobsters are
said to be vulnerable to his testimony, which will recount, in
detail, bribes doled out in bars and restaurants, coercion at
construction sites and the Mafia's aggressive, if somewhat
bumbling, management of a sprawling criminal scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a godsend,'' said a lawyer who is familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable reversal. As Riggi's son-in-law and the
father of two of the boss' granddaughters, Richard, 35, is
literally married to the mob. And he is displaying an almost
gloating disrespect. In interviews, he went beyond discussing
details of labor corruption. He spoke with disdain for the mobsters
he once served.
</P>
<P>
   He described Emmanuel Riggi, one of his brothers-in-law and a
man prosecutors describe as a member of the DeCavalcante crime
family, as ``so fat he breaks chairs at every family function.'' He
said John Riggi, the feared crime boss, ``ought to thank me for
feeding his useless kids.'' He said Datello, his 6-foot-5 former
partner, was ``a big idiot, like Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say, `Hey, Joey, I've got to take you in to get the
bolts for your neck,''' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is a gritty man and can emanate the blunt, coarse
demeanor of a thug. He is utterly unlettered. He says ``mob
fractions'' when he means ``mob factions.'' But he is also capable
of warmth and charm, and the people who know him say he is very
smart, a man who passed easily through many different roles until
arriving at his latest: witness for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a chameleon,'' said Tommy, a friend of nearly 20 years
who spoke only on the condition that his last name not be
published. ``He became a gangster better than one of them, and he
thought circles around them while he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 30 years of his life, Richard was a virtual
nobody, a laborer from the Bronx who trained as a union apprentice
and, by his mid-20s, started a small subcontracting company in New
Jersey. His insider's tour of the mob did not begin until 1995,
when he began dating Sara M. Riggi, the daughter of the
DeCavalcantes' boss.
</P>
<P>
   The DeCavalcantes are the smallest of the region's Mafia
families, and considered by law enforcement to be the weakest,
often relying on cooperation with the five families in New York.
But they have long specialized in labor rackets: extorting
contractors in exchange for labor peace, or replacing unionized
employees with nonunion workers and then spiriting away savings on
wages or fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard became fascinated with Riggi, whom he said he first
visited in the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Md.,
in 1996, when the boss was serving a sentence for extortion. Riggi,
75, appeared in prison khakis, yet somehow managed, Richard said,
``to have an almost presidential bearing.'' He sat briefly with
Richard and Riggi before sending his daughter to a vending machine,
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she left, he looked at me and said: ``Who you with?
Who you indentured to?'' Richard said. ``I said: ``Nobody. I don't
answer to nobody.' And after we talked for a while, we hit it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Riggi married on Sept. 13, 1996. ``Friday the
13th,'' Richard now says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Riggi's three sons, who law enforcement officials say
were unable to run the rackets (Richard calls them ``goofballs,
three guys you wouldn't take miniature golfing''), his son-in-law
seemed smart and aggressive. Soon, Richard's legitimate business
was a sideline; labor rackets were his game.
</P>
<P>
   He and law enforcement officials said that in 1996 he began
circulating his father-in-law's instructions to corrupt New Jersey
locals and pursuing larger plans. ``Sean was a significant
player,'' said Robert T. Buccino, who retired last month as deputy
chief of New Jersey's Organized Crime Bureau. ``He was more trusted
than the sons were.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Richard established a link with the Luccheses, working
for Datello, who prosecutors say also specialized in labor rackets.
In one of his first schemes, Richard and prosecutors assert, he and
an associate bribed Michael Forde, the president of Local 608 of
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, to help limit the
number of unionized carpenters at a Park Central Hotel renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first payment _ $10,000 in cash _ was made over
afternoon beers at a Hooters on West 56th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the ten thousand, and he says, `You know, I really
shouldn't be drinking beers while I'm working; the union is
cracking down on that,''' Richard said. ``It was the funniest
thing. I said: `You're worried about the beers? What do you think
your guys would think about that ten thousand you just took?'''
</P>
<P>
   Forde was indicted this week; through his lawyer, he said the
meeting with Richard never took place.
</P>
<P>
   As he worked for Datello, Richard lived a high roller's life,
canvassing Manhattan and spending freely from wads of $100 bills.
He bought pedigreed Rottweilers. He leased a new luxury car every
few months. He bought a $320,000 home on two acres in Holmdel,
N.J., putting $145,000 down. The house had a sauna, a Jacuzzi, an
in-ground pool and separate yards: one for his two infant
daughters, the other for his menacing black dogs.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, he had become a fixture at the Oak Room at the Plaza
Hotel, where the manager, Patrick Littlejohn, remembers he sat in a
corner booth and ordered heaping plates of chilled seafood and
seared prime rib, washing both down with 1982 Lafite-Rothschild.
Sometimes he stood by the piano, singing Frank Sinatra or Perry
Como. ``All the classics,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   He also passed long hours at the Paradise Club, an adult
nightclub near the Empire State Building, where he tipped the
raven-haired striptease dancer he fell in love with as much as
$1,000 a night, he and the dancer both say. ``If I dropped dead
tomorrow, I lived, baby, I lived,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   He and the authorities also say he attended the meetings of a
secret three-member construction panel that the Luccheses used to
plan rackets, mediate disputes and divide spoils. By his telling,
these meetings illustrated the paradox that the latter-day Mafia
has become.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the mob was resourceful enough to cheat the
construction industry of millions of dollars. On the other, many
members and associates were almost pathetic: grown men who groveled
to get jobs as flagmen at road crews, or who talked relentlessly on
cellular phones about secret meetings, all while the detectives
were listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be a secret society, but we'd get 20, 25,
30 guys turning up, all asking for something,'' Richard said. ``It
was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one panel meeting last year at Little Charlie's Clam
Bar on Kenmare Street in Manhattan, for which, he and investigators
say, two dozen mobsters and associates arrived in flashy cars,
lining the block with Cadillacs and Lincolns. Later, he learned
that police had watched the entire show. ``It was kind of
comical,'' Richard said. ``The detectives were right across the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard's life began to unravel last June, when police raided
several dozen homes and offices in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, searching for records documenting the suspected
rackets. One of the targets was the Linden, N.J., office of S &AMP; S
Contracting, the business he had formed with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The raids filled him with dread. ``It was the beginning of the
end,'' he said. ``For them to get 40 warrants in three states? Come
on. That's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five months, he fell into a funk. He began to use
cocaine, marijuana and heroin, he said, and drank more heavily than
usual. He spent even more money, dipping into the weekly cash
tribute he said he was supposed to pay Datello as a member of his
crew.
</P>
<P>
   He also began to think about becoming the state's witness, in
part because friction within the Luccheses rose after the raids,
and he worried that Datello had been given orders to kill him. The
fear, he said, intensified late last fall when he was told to wait
outside the Tick Tock Diner in Clifton, N.J., to meet Dominic
Truscello, a Lucchese capo. Datello told him he would be picked up
in a van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What do you guys need a van for?''' Richard recalled.
``A van is never a good sign in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so spooked that he armed himself, he said, carrying a
pistol in his belt. The van ride passed without violence, but
during the meeting that followed, he said, Truscello stared icily
at him and said, ``What are your sins?'' Richard interpreted the
question as a sign that he was marked for execution. He defected
soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the case is public, some of Richard's former Mafia
associates seem astounded at the breadth and tone of his
confessions. A few, through lawyers or associates, declined to
comment, including John Riggi, his sons and Datello, who has eluded
arrest so far.
</P>
<P>
   Others, through associates or lawyers, said Richard is little
more than a wild exaggerator and a serial manipulator who drew
attention to the Luccheses through a foolishly flamboyant style.
``This guy was a wannabe, and he conducted business that was not
authorized by organized crime,'' said a person who is familiar with
the Lucchese family.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the state's star witness was a traitor on many
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is now in hiding with his girlfriend, the stripper, who
performed under the name Lola. His wife, Sara Riggi, has not seen
him in months. She has been left in disarray, alone with their
daughters and facing foreclosure proceedings against their home.
She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July and for
divorce in August. ``It's very upsetting,'' she said in a brief
interview, which she ended in tears.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richard has the appearance of a man who has long
been resting. He has lost weight and added tattoos. He has a rich
tan. Now and then he talks about book or movie deals. He takes
precautions, of course, but they are almost comically half-hearted,
like his tendency when venturing away from police to wear a hat and
sunglasses, or his request to a reporter not to describe his
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The Luccheses' latest racketeering case, and his probation will
be over one day, he says. Then he will have a new life. ``The last
thing anybody wants to be is a rat,'' he said. ``But you know
something? I'll be a rat and I won't be in prison. I'll be a rat
and I'll be alive.''

   After a sustained effort to seal a Middle East peace accord, the
White House has begun to sense in the last several days that a
solution is slipping away and will not come during President
Clinton's time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not about to abruptly give up what has been one of
his most cherished and hard fought foreign policy goals, but senior
administration officials said that the momentum created at the Camp
David summit meeting in July had been lost and appeared unlikely to
be regained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met this week with both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak as well as with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, while
all three men were in New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit
meeting. But senior administration officials said that Arafat had
failed to give sufficient assurances that he would agree to a
solution on Jerusalem and, in particular, on sovereignty over the
sites there that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements on Thursday, Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright kept open the possibility of future meetings.
But Clinton suggested that he would not meet again this week with
Arafat or Barak. And in private, administration officials had an
even gloomier assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is not prepared to keep talks between Israel
and the Palestinians going for the sake of talking, a senior
administration official said. ``It's not our job to give it life
support if it's not breathing,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we heard some movement, but not sufficient and
not with the kind of precision that we need to hear that looks
anything like a process that goes to closure,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Since they arrived in New York, neither Barak nor Arafat have
threatened to walk away from the Middle East talks. They have both
pledged to keep going, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight years of his presidency, Clinton has spent more
time than any other president talking and negotiating with the
Israelis and the Palestinians in search of a final peace agreement.
But on Thursday even Clinton sounded uncertain about future steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there will be any more meetings while we are
here,'' Clinton said before meeting Thursday morning with the South
Korean president, Kim Dae-jung. ``We'll see where we are and
whether anything else can be done while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright told a news conference, ``The truth is, just look at
the calendar, and there is not a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton's senior advisers are beginning to
talk about their achievements at Camp David as possibly being
material for another administration to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Camp David there was a huge iceberg, we sent an
icebreaker through it, and we cracked it open 100 different ways _
refugees, Jerusalem, security, borders,'' said Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``The good news is that this is no
longer just an iceberg, it's 100 pieces of ice. Can this be
reassembled into something like a bridge _ I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official put a best-face on a deteriorating situation
that came after so much work. ``It's not entirely pass-fail,'' he
said of Clinton's Middle East negotiations. ``The best thing is to
get an agreement. But we are not going back to where we were.''

DUTCH RESEARCHERS QUESTION USE OF TAMOXIFEN IN HEALTHY WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers in Holland are questioning the safety of a practice
that has been widely endorsed by cancer experts in the United
States: prescribing the drug tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer in
healthy women who are at high risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen is the world's most widely prescribed breast-cancer
drug. The new doubts about it are based on a study of more than
1,000 women, reported Friday in the London-based medical
publication The Lancet, showing that women who took tamoxifen for
two years or more had a greater risk than previously reported of
dying from endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the
uterus.
</P>
<P>
   American researchers questioned the findings, which do not match
results in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and American scientists did agree on one point:
tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer as well as prevent it, and
women who have already had breast cancer, and who are taking
tamoxifen to prevent a recurrence, should not stop. In those women,
breast cancer is a far greater threat than endometrial cancer, and
tamoxifen has been proved to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No breast cancer patient should stop tamoxifen because of this
paper,'' said Dr. Flora E. van Leeuwen, an author of the study and
a professor of cancer epidemiology at the Netherlands Cancer
Institute in Amsterdam. ``It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   But cancer experts from Holland and the United States disagree
on whether healthy women at high risk for breast cancer should take
tamoxifen for prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say I find it a problem to treat healthy women with a
drug that may induce a fatal disease,'' van Leeuwen said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer in the United
States since 1977. In 1998 it was proved to prevent the disease as
well in a study that was the first to show that any drug could
reduce the risk of breast cancer, and women at high risk were urged
to consult doctors about whether they should take it.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved tamoxifen as a
preventive for high-risk women. It is not known how many women are
taking the drug for that reason, but officials of AstraZeneca, the
London-based company that makes the drug, say the use of the
tamoxifen has been increasing steadily in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Wickerham, associate chairman of the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, which has conducted
extensive studies of tamoxifen in North America, said that the
Dutch findings should stimulate further research but should not
influence medical practice now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a valuable drug that's been around for a long
time,'' Wickerham said. He and other researchers said that the type
of study the Dutch team did, looking back at what patients did in
the past, was not as convincing as a study in which patients are
divided into groups, given different treatments and the results
compared.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen inhibits the growth of breast tumors by blocking the
hormone estrogen, which can stimulate cell growth. Women are
generally advised to take it for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the lining of the uterus, tamoxifen can speed up cell
growth. Researchers have known since 1988 that the drug could
increase the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women.
Studies in the United States, including the 1998 prevention study,
showed the endometrial tumors to be uncommon, easy to diagnose
early and highly curable. The main symptom is abnormal vaginal
bleeding, and women who experience it while taking tamoxifen are
warned to see a doctor immediately.
</P>
<P>
   American studies showed that in 1,000 women over 60 who did not
take tamoxifen, there would be one case of endometrial cancer per
year. In those who did take the drug, there would be two cases. The
risk was considered acceptable when compared to the benefits of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, however, found that some endometrial cancers in
breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen for more than two years
were more advanced and aggressive, and therefore more likely to be
fatal, than those found in previous studies.
</P>
<P>
   The study included 309 women who had breast cancer and later
developed endometrial cancer from 1972 to 1996, and 860 control
patients who had breast cancer but not endometrial cancer. Of the
309 with endometrial cancer, 108 had taken tamoxifen, as had 245
control patients.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the patients with endometrial cancer died of it,
including 11 who had taken tamoxifen. The researchers found 17
percent of the women with endometrial cancer who had taken
tamoxifen for two years or more had advanced cancers, compared to
only 5 percent of those who never took the drug. Tamoxifen users
were also more likely to have more aggressive types of tumors than
nonusers, and their three-year survival was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming 20 cases of endometrial cancer over a 10-year period in
1,000 women who took tamoxifen for five years, the researchers
estimated that 3 to 5 cases would be of the more dangerous types.

 &HT;    Sorority accused of race bias suspended
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ After she heard her sorority sisters allegedly
disparaging an African-American who was seeking to join them, a
member of Alpha Gamma Delta decided to listen to her conscience and
share her concerns with University of Georgia officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, the sorority member said the African-American
membership candidate was discussed separately from other potential
members.
</P>
<P>
   Sorority members who had given her a low score ``attributed
their ratings to her race, making comments such as `Why did she
want to go through White Rush?' (and) `If we had a black girl in
our sorority, none of the fraternities would want to do anything
with us,' '' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   The letter set in motion a series of events that has led UGA to
temporarily suspend the sorority and launch an investigation into
possible racial discrimination in the member selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident should prove a wake-up call for the entire Greek
system,'' said Richard Mullendore, UGA vice president for student
affairs. ``We've focused on issues relative to substance abuse,
hazing and leadership more than we have diversity. It's probably an
issue we need to give a lot more attention to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Cretin, national director of Alpha Gamma Delta, said her
organization takes the allegations of racial
</P>
<P>
   discrimination ``very seriously.'' She and other officials will
be in Athens today to conduct their own investigation, talking with
the women in the UGA chapter, including the young woman who
complained.
</P>
<P>
   The student addressed her letter to Rick Rose, assistant vice
president for student affairs. UGA would not identify the student
who wrote the letter or the African-American student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock and was extremely disappointed,'' the letter
says. ``It is hard for me to believe that our society still harbors
cruel and exclusionary clubs that encourage their members to
embarrass and humiliate others in order to make themselves feel
superior. I am confident that the University of Georgia would not
knowingly permit such blatantly discriminatory behavior on its
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   As far he knows, Mullendore said, the allegation marks the first
time a UGA sorority has been accused of racial discrimination. A
contributing factor may be that few African-American students
choose to participate in membership recruitment, or rush, which
shepherds participants from one predominantly white sorority to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The four predominantly African-American sororities at UGA don't
conduct a collective rush. Instead, each does an ``intake'' once a
year, usually in the fall or spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of guts for a black student to go through rush
like this girl did,'' said Kendree Zaic, a sophomore who was a
member of Pi Beta Phi sorority last year. ``It surprises me that
(discrimination) has never come up before. (Alpha Gamma Delta)
probably aren't the only ones who do it. The systems are kind of
separated here.''
</P>
<P>
   Though UGA doesn't keep records on the racial breakdown of
individual Greek organizations, some sororities and fraternities
are known to have members who are not of the predominant skin
color. But by and large, they remain primarily self-segregated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at it from a regional perspective,''
Mullendore said. At large Southern universities like UGA, the
system is much more segregated that in other parts of the country
or at smaller institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Because many Greek groups began in the South, they have a longer
history, traditions, many more alumni ``and a certain way of doing
business that's been in existence for a long time,'' he said. ``As
a result, it's a little more difficult for them to embrace
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter writer wanted to move out of the sorority house, but
found she couldn't get out of her housing contract at Alpha Gamma
Delta. Rather than continue to live with people ``who found
outright prejudice acceptable,'' she withdrew from the university,
the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my sisters made insulting faces at me and made
insensitive comments to me,'' the letter says. ``No one offered to
help as I removed my belongings from the house. They accused me of
overreacting 'to an issue that just wasn't that important!' ``
</P>
<P>
   The student's comments ``tear at my heart,'' Mullendore said.
``Judgments about people are rendered on a daily basis, but
shouldn't be based on the color of someone's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   While on temporary suspension, Alpha Gamma Delta cannot hold
social functions or participate in UGA activities as an
organization. Supporters said no matter what the investigation
yields, the damage to Alpha Gamma Delta's reputation is almost
irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   If investigators determine the allegations are true, Alpha Gamma
Delta could informally resolve the situation by admitting what
occurred and coming up with a resolution, or it could deny the
allegations and request a judicial hearing. Probation, suspension
or expulsion are all possible outcomes, Mullendore said.

EXPERTS SEE VENEZUELA ILL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH TIRE DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIRE-RECALL and TIRE-SAFETY) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The offices at the decaying headquarters of
the government consumer protection agency here are threadbare and
sparsely furnished, and the elevators do not always work. The
concept of class-action suits does not exist in the local legal
code, and even if it did, there is no network of consumer advocacy
groups or lawyers to promote them.
</P>
<P>
   Tire failures and rollovers involving Bridgestone/Firestone and
the Ford Motor Co. have emerged as the biggest product liability
controversy in years, and Venezuela as one of the scandal's main
focal points. But neither the legal system nor the government
regulatory structure here is prepared for a case of this magnitude,
experts here agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In North America, the theme of consumer protection is
constantly on the agenda, to the point that you even make movies
like `Erin Brockovich,''' said Liliana Ortega, a leading human
rights lawyer here. ``But this is an extremely disjointed society,
with consumers who are badly educated as to their rights and very
little tradition of asserting those rights. So this case is
emblematic and sets a very important precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, citing what it described as evidence that both
Firestone and Ford were aware of defects in their products, the
Venezuelan government recommended that criminal charges be filed
against both companies, and this week Firestone agreed to recall
62,000 of its tires here. More than 60 deaths have been caused by
blowouts on Ford Explorers on Venezuelan highways, government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Firestone-Ford debacle would seem
tailor-made for President Hugo Chavez. A 46-year-old former army
colonel, cashiered after leading a failed coup in 1992, Chavez won
a landslide victory in 1998 on a platform that promised social
justice and a new, more equitable economic order. Then, after
gaining passage of a new constitution, he repeated that feat in
July.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to China last year, Chavez visited Mao's tomb and
announced, in a variation on one of the Great Helmsman's most
famous phrases, that ``Venezuela has stood up.'' He has also led
the recent resurgence of OPEC that has pushed oil prices to their
highest level in a decade, and in speeches here he regularly
lambastes ``savage neo-liberalism'' and the ``rotten oligarchy''
that puts profit ahead of the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under previous governments, nobody took an interest in things
like this, and the directors of this agency were businessmen
themselves, Chamber of Commerce types, foxes guarding the chicken
coop,'' said Jorge Dominguez, chief inspector of the Consumer
Defense and Education Institute, the consumer agency. ``But now,
because we have a new president, this has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet to describe Indecu, as the agency is known in Spanish, as a
bare-bones operation is to be generous. With a budget of just over
$3 million and 300 employees, it has a limited ability to monitor
the safety of products and respond to consumer complaints in this
nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, for example, is an agronomist whose main area of
expertise is spoiled food and who has to make do with a staff of
just 20. In the Firestone-Ford case, the chief investigator is
actually a civic-minded volunteer, Carlos Salanova, an auto dealer
and former tire salesman from the same town as Indecu's president,
Samuel Ruh Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Ruh said this week that he had been invited to testify at
congressional hearings in Washington and that he was willing to go
if Chavez authorized him to do so. But it is not clear how much new
information Indecu would be able to add to what is already known in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation began much more than two months ago, but the
beginning was very slow,'' Dominguez said. ``The first problem we
ran into was that there were no statistics, no entity we could turn
to and say, `Give me the list of all accidents involving
Explorers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the gap has been filled by Franklin Hoet, a prominent
lawyer here whose daughter and son-in-law were injured and their
nanny killed when their Explorer rolled over in 1998. Hoet's
clients included both Firestone and Ford, but he has severed ties
with both and is now encouraging other Venezuelan victims to join
the effort to ``force them to take responsibility for their
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's new constitution includes an article that guarantees
consumers the right to safe, high-quality products. But Hoet
describes the provision as ``more an ideal than a reality,'' noting
that ``there is also a right to life, but every day people are
killed or raped in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, legislation that would establish standards for
consumer products and put teeth into regulations is feeble or
riddled with loopholes. ``What is lacking is more solid
institutions to control the quality of production,'' said Gerardo
Blyde, a leading constitutional lawyer and member of Congress. ``A
consumer protection law exists, but it has to be reformed to
include a more effective control mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest impediment to resolving the case is probably the
judicial system. ``Venezuelan courts are severely questioned and
criticized because they cannot offer even the minimum guarantees of
judicial security,'' Ortega said. ``There are problems of impunity,
corruption, lack of professional training and resources, and cases
derailed in deference to political or commercial interests.''
</P>
<P>
   With his own actions, Hoet has made it clear that he agrees with
that assessment. The civil complaint and demand for damages to be
made on behalf of his family will be filed in the United States,
not here, he said, adding that he finds it odd that Firestone and
Ford might object.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years the business community has complained about the
lack of a reliable justice system, saying that it is one of the
problems that discourage foreign investment,'' he said. ``Now, all
of a sudden in a complicated case like this, with all these deaths
and injuries, they are suddenly going to say everything is just
fine?''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion is not universally shared here. ``I don't think a
U.S. court has jurisdiction over this matter,'' Blyde said. ``These
tires were produced in Venezuela, and both the buyer and the seller
are Venezuelan. If you buy a Sony television and there's a problem,
it should be Sony of Venezuela who responds, not Sony in Japan.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in a country that is undergoing what Chavez calls a
``peaceful social revolution,'' legal and administrative criteria
may not be the only relevant factors. Countervailing political
currents could also complicate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the roughly 25,000 Venezuelan owners of
Explorers, which sell for about $27,000 here, several times the
average annual income, are hardly Chavez's natural constituency. He
presents himself as the paladin of the poor, and those with incomes
high enough to afford such vehicles voted overwhelmingly for his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chavez has had a largely cordial relationship with
Ford, the No. 2 automaker here, with 18 percent of the market. One
of Chavez's central populist initiatives has been production of a
``people's car,'' and Ford was an early supporter of the program,
and its generous tax advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government that has focused almost exclusively on
politics during the 18 months it has been in power, and has not
dedicated itself to the themes of administration and law,'' Hoet
said. ``I think it is more convenient for everyone involved in this
matter that the case be resolved in the United States.'' &QL;

LOUISIANA SETTLES LAWSUIT, ENDING TEST OF PRIVATE JUVENILE
PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State of Louisiana agreed in federal district court in Baton
Rouge on Thursday to sweeping changes in the way it runs its
juvenile prisons, including steps to protect inmates from abusive
guards and promises to provide medical, dental and mental health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was intended to settle several lawsuits against
the state, including one by the U.S. Department of Justice, which
charged that teen-age inmates were being deprived of food, clothing
and medical care and were routinely beaten by guards.
</P>
<P>
   While providing better treatment for inmates, the agreement
would effectively end Louisiana's experiment with privately run
juvenile prisons, where the worst abuses had occurred, said David
Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, a
civil rights group that represented some inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Louisiana was prohibited from placing any
more young inmates in a prison at Jena, which had been run by the
Wackenhut Corrections Corp., a subsidiary of Wackenhut Corp. and
the world's largest operator of for-profit prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Utter said the state had also agreed to prohibit a company
operated by friends of former Gov. Edwin Edwards, which owned a
juvenile prison at Tallulah, from managing the prison. The state
took control of the Tallulah prison in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stalder, the secretary of the department of public
safety and corrections, said in a news conference Thursday with
Gov. Mike Foster that the increase in youthful offenders had forced
Louisiana to expand its juvenile prisons but that ``the state's
efforts to provide some of these services through privately
operated facilities were a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Louisiana's secure juvenile facilities now are operated
directly by our department,'' Stalder said. ``The state is
confident that difficulties experienced in the past will not recur.
We are pleased to be able to put this litigation behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana had tried to privatize its juvenile prisons as a way
to cut costs, but the effort raised questions about whether
for-profit corporations can operate prisons more efficiently than
state governments without skimping on essential services and
training.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As often in Louisiana, the plan was enmeshed in a political
scandal. Another friend and business partner of Edwards, Cecil
Brown, is awaiting trial in federal court in Baton Rouge in
January, along with the former mayor of Houston, Fred Hofheinz, on
charges of conspiracy, extortion and bribery for trying to obtain
the contract to operate the juvenile prison at Jena.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been accused of funneling $845,000 from Hofheinz to
Edwards to secure the Jena contract. Edwards was named an
unindicted co-conspirator, and was convicted in a separate bribery
trial last May involving the award of a riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut abandoned the Jena prison last spring after a juvenile
court judge in New Orleans and investigators hired by the Justice
Department found that the teen-age inmates there had been deprived
of underwear, sweaters, blankets and food and that a 17-year-old
boy had been forced to lie face down on the concrete floor, with a
guard's knee in his back, even though he had recently undergone
stomach surgery for a gunshot wound and was wearing a colostomy
bag. Wackenhut said it would convert Jena to an adult prison, but
it is now empty.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the assistant attorney general for civil rights,
said the agreement ``does not mean everything will be magically
solved.'' But, Lee said, ``It does mean that there are now over 100
pages of detailed obligations and responsibilities that the State
of Louisiana has agreed to, with timetables and mechanisms to make
sure they are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, Lee said, was the role of medical
personnel from Louisiana State University.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, doctors from the university's School of
Medicine would provide medical, mental health and dental care at
the state's five juvenile prisons, and independent monitors would
have the right to inspect the facilities to make sure guards were
no longer beating inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Staff from the university would also help provide training to
guards in an effort to lessen the amount of physical force that has
been used, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent monitors, chosen by the Justice Department,
Utter's group and lawyers for other juvenile inmates, would also
conduct annual inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If the problems continue, the agreement allows the Justice
Department and the others to file motions to reopen their lawsuits
with Judge Frank Polozola of federal district court in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Polozola, who has overseen prison conditions in
Louisiana since 1973, had played a crucial role in reaching the
agreement after he ordered all sides last spring to keep talking
until a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   But several lawyers who took part in the talks said that while
pressure from Polozola had been helpful, the troubles had taken
place during the very time he was supposed to be supervising the
juvenile prisons.

 &HT;    NFL censure sought on Falcons investor
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A rabbi has asked the National Football League to
censure a part-owner of the Atlanta Falcons for remarks concerning
the notorious 1915 lynching of Leo Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson Brown, whose great-grandfather was editorialist and
later U.S. Sen. Tom Watson, whose writings are blamed for whipping
up anti-Semitism before the lynching, owns 6 percent of the
Falcons. He says Frank, a Jew, was properly convicted of killing
13-year-old Mary Phagan, and he was lynched because Frank's
supporters in effect bought off the governor to get him to commute
his sentence. In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article
Brown said, ``Maybe the Frank people should apologize for bribing
the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Rabbi Steven Lebow of Temple Kol Emeth, in metro
Atlanta, fume. The words he says, perpetuate the stereotype of
``rich Jews'' controlling the system while most historians believe
the governor acted ethically. He wrote a letter asking the NFL to
rebuke Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Harvard-educated lawyer, Mr. Brown should be more careful
of what he says when he slanders people,'' said Lebow, who placed a
plaque in Frank's memory at the site of the lynching in Marietta.
``An NFL owner should not be making bigoted statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he plans to respond to Lebow, but he won't retract
his statements.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will respond when he receives
Lebow's letter, said spokesman Greg Aiello. The Falcons aren't
commenting because the dispute involves a minority owner whose role
is as an investor, said spokesman Aaron Salkin.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a Northern-born Atlanta factory manager, was sentenced to
death in the death of Phagan, whose family was from Marietta. Gov.
John M. Slaton, a law partner of Frank's lawyer, commuted his
sentence to life. A group of Mariettans kidnapped Frank from his
cell and hanged him near where the Big Chicken now stands.
</P>
<P>
   Brown argues the governor was bribed because as a partner in the
law firm he shared in its proceeds, including a promised bonus if
it won a commutation.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Oney, a writer who has spent 13 years researching and
writing a book on the case, said there is no evidence the governor
received a dime from the action that ruined his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Slaton made a decision of conscience,'' he said.
``That said, there was a clear and troubling appearance of a
conflict of interest.''

A HANDSHAKE AND SMALL TALK FOR CLINTON AND CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro were in
the same room, in October 1995 at a United Nations reception in New
York, the Secret Service deftly kept the two men apart. Not a word
or a handshake was exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   So anyone tracing the glacial progress in Cuban-American
relations _ always a sensitive political issue, especially in
Florida, New Jersey and New York, three key states in the coming
presidential election _ should note that the White House this week
quietly reversed its Cuban handshake policy. After changing its
story several times, the White House press office said Thursday
that Clinton and Castro actually shook hands on Wednesday, on the
edges of a luncheon for the summit meeting of world leaders at the
United Nations. It was apparently the first time Castro, 74, had
ever shaken hands with a sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president of the United States and the leader who
has bedeviled every occupant of the White House since the
Eisenhower administration apparently spoke to each other for the
first time. But on Thursday afternoon, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who usually describes all conversations between her boss
and other national leaders as deep and important, was quick to
caution that ``there was no substance'' to the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But in relations with Cuba, even empty talk is brimming with
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Vice President Al Gore talked Cuba policy _ about
the fate of Elian Gonzalez, the young boy who was ultimately
returned to his father in Cuba over the objections of his Miami
relatives _ it dominated campaign news for days. So even the
thought of Clinton and Castro making polite conversation is bound
to be viewed with suspicion by Cuban Americans already smarting
from the Elian affair. Perhaps that explains why the White House
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, when first asked about the encounter, said
reports of a handshake were ``not true.'' Later, other officials
said Lockhart had been insufficiently briefed. ``On background,''
one official said, ``I can confirm there was a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   With all this diplomatic sensitivity on display, Albright and
the White House went to some lengths Thursday to make the point
that Clinton did not seek out one of the world's last true
communist leaders. ``As I understand it,'' Albright said, ``it was
a chance encounter that Mr. Castro initiated, and they talked for a
couple of minutes, and there was no substance.'' Administration
officials were under strict orders not to detail the small talk.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time Castro has had a close encounter
with a top American leader.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after coming to power in 1959 after the Cuban revolution,
Castro flew to Washington and met the sitting vice president,
Richard M. Nixon. President Eisenhower had decided that it was not
appropriate for him to see Castro because of the unsettled
situation in Cuba. So Eisenhower's secretary of state, Christian
Herter, asked Nixon to meet the Cuban leader and give the president
his assessment of him.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when the White House spokesman finally confirmed
that President Clinton and Castro had indeed shaken hands, he
pointed out that President Bush had also come close to Castro
several times, including at a conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
in June 1992. But the two apparently never spoke, and certainly
never shook hands, according to reports at the time, although Bush
applauded several times during a speech by Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is not about to repeat his handshake with Castro.
Almost all the world leaders attending the summit meeting here were
invited to a reception Thursday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
But the White House made a point of keeping Castro's name off the
list.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a remote jungle of Guatemala, among the remains of a
little-known ancient city with a name meaning Place of Serpents,
archaeologists have uncovered one of the largest and most splendid
palaces of Maya kings ever discovered. Its 170 high-ceiling rooms
were built around 11 courtyards and spread over an area greater
than two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has found anything like this since the turn of the last
century,'' Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville and leader of the discovery team, said
Thursday in describing the palace, which dates from the eighth
century A.D. ``What is most incredible about this site is that most
of the palace is buried virtually intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said that in size and preservation the palace, at a
site Cancuen, rivaled the buildings at the central acropolis in
Tikal, one of the grandest seats of Mayan power in Guatemala.
Earlier expeditions had either overlooked or underestimated the
size and grandeur of the palace and the city around it, a
prosperous center of commerce and crafts at the head of navigation
on the Pasion River.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery and the first excavations at Cancuen were made by
archaeologists led by Demarest and Tomas Barrientos of Guatemala.
The expedition is sponsored by the Guatemalan Institute of
Anthropology and History, the National Geographic Society and
Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily important find,'' David Freidel, a
specialist in Maya studies at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas who has no connection to the work, said in an interview.
``It's been a long time since a major palace complex has come to
light. A scientific investigation of the ruins should help us
understand political life in the late classic period of the Maya.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maya civilization was at the peak of its power in Central
America and Mexico from 250 to 900, known as the classic period.
The king who completed the palace _ inscriptions give his name as
Tah ak Chaan _ ruled Cancuen for about 50 years, beginning in 740.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Freidel said, the focus of Mayan political life
and state ceremony had shifted from the grand outdoor plazas to the
palaces, which means that the buildings' art and architecture may
reflect the changing relationships of powerful rulers, nobles and
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a preliminary study of the site and its inscribed monuments
has already produced one surprise: There is no evidence that the
city's rulers engaged in any major wars with neighbors. Nor is
there any sign of pyramids, the typically spectacular bases for
temples and manifestations of the religious roots of a city's
power.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of pyramid temples was the main reason previous
archaeologists largely passed by the ruins and failed to
investigate the true size of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries alone may cause scholars to reconsider some of
their ideas about the Maya civilization, Demarest said. Here was a
city that appeared to prosper for hundreds of years without warfare
or the usual display of religion as sources of the power of Maya
kings, particularly toward the end of their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a book in press that I'll have to revise,'' Demarest
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Maya cities, Cancuen appeared to use its strategic
position at the foot of the highlands, a source of jade, obsidian
and other valuable commodities, to become a commercial power
throughout the lowlands. Demarest said the city must have been
larger, richer and more powerful than anyone had expected. Its
rulers appeared to have been single-mindedly dedicated to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first excavations of residences disclosed that the
city had a relatively wealthy middle class and many workshops for
artisans producing elite goods for trade far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Jade is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. A young
middle-class woman was found in her grave with 10 jade inlaid
teeth. Workmen were buried with fine ceramic figurines with
beautiful headdresses. At a workshop lay a 35-pound chunk of jade,
which artisans had been slicing for pieces to manufacture
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Other excavations turned up large amounts of pyrite, commonly
known as fool's gold. Thin sheets of it were being used in making
mirrors, one of the more prized possessions of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All this might never have been uncovered if Demarest had not
literally fallen into the discovery of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of excavations at Dos Pilas and other sites in
northern Guatemala, where he found ample evidence of a highly
militaristic city-state called Petexbatun, Demarest decided last
year to visit Cancuen to follow up a lead. Members of his team had
found records of a marriage alliance between a Dos Pilas prince and
a Cancuen princess. She then came to Dos Pilas to live in her own
small palace.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the architecture and crafts of Cancuen, Demarest said,
``It looks as if the princess brought her own artisans, because the
stonework on her palace is just like that at Cancuen and far
superior to anything in the Petexbatun region.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the archaeologists looked more closely at the ruins of what
turned out to be the royal palace. ``To the untrained eye, the
palace looks just like a great, jungle-covered hill,'' Demarest
said.
</P>
<P>
   While walking along the ruin's highest level, Dr. Demarest fell
up to his armpits into vegetation filling one of the courtyards.
``That's when I realized the entire hill was a three-story building
and we were walking on top of the roof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, archaeologists have only dug test holes into the palace
ruins, enough to estimate the dimensions of the building. The walls
are build of solid limestone. They enclose a densely packed
labyrinth of rooms with 20-foot-high corbel-arched ceilings. The
team's leaders estimate it will take at least 10 years to excavate
and partly restore the palace.
</P>
<P>
   They are making plans to deploy a larger team of researchers and
excavators at the site next February, at the end of the rainy
season. The region is free of civil war now, Demarest said, but the
government of Guatemala has little presence there and it is still a
virtually lawless place.
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said the expedition has mobilized and trained the
people of the nearest village, El Zapote, to stand guard over the
newfound palace.

BLAKE'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ For Rob Blake, it was like any other summer
_ charity golf tournaments, volleyball in the sand near his home in
Manhattan Beach, even a couple of visits to the family farm outside
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, life is good for the Los Angeles Kings captain.
The team finished last season with 94 points, fourth-best in
franchise history. Blake was third to NHL MVP Chris Pronger in
voting for the league's top defenseman. In June, he and wife,
Brandy, celebrated their second wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the club opens training camp today at its swanky new
facility in here in preparation for its second season at the $400
million Staples Center, there's a sense of urgency in Blake's
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the season ended last year is not something you easily
forget,'' Blake said. ``We went into the playoffs believing we had
a chance and we got wiped out. It's hard not to take that
personally. I can't remember a time when training camp seemed more
critical than now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Kings lose four straight to the Detroit Red
Wings last April in the first round of the postseason, they were 0
for 23 on the Blake-run power play.
</P>
<P>
   For an organization that made the playoffs for just the second
time in seven years, it appeared to shatter the momentum of the
regular season. And during the summer, the Kings did not add a big
name the way they had the year before when plucking Ziggy Palffy
from the lowly New York Islanders. They flirted with the thought of
acquiring injured superstar Eric Lindros, a restricted free agent
whose rights were retained by the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, first-year players Steven Reinprecht, Lubomir
Visnovsky and Andreas Lilja are expected to make the club and play
prominent roles.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and the fact Blake is entering the final season of a
three-year, $15 million contract. Although Blake, 30, is the team's
top player, the Kings are not close to a new deal. The club's top
priority right now is re-signing first-line center Jozef Stumpel,
who is expected to miss at least part of training camp in a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a lot to think about,'' said Mattias
Norstrom, Blake's defensemate last year, who missed all of the 1999
camp with a holdout. ``I talked to Rob a couple of times this
summer and we didn't talk at all about Detroit. I think he has
gotten past it, but he cares so much about this team so you never
know. He puts so much of what happens on himself. That's part of
being a leader, but the rest of us have to take some
responsibility, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings weren't expected to beat the Red Wings, a veteran team
that had won the Stanley Cup two of the previous three years. But
the failure of the Kings power play landed directly at Blake's
skates.
</P>
<P>
   He had missed the final week of the regular season with a
sprained left knee and returned out of sync. The knee is again
sound. The team's emotional condition is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   After playing their best game of the Detroit series, a 8-5 loss
in Game 2, the Kings returned to Los Angeles and were defeated 2-1
and 3-0. They now have dropped 12 consecutive playoff games dating
back to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray, entering his second year as Kings coach, was as
excited as anyone at the possibility of obtaining Lindros, whose
hockey future is clouded by six career concussions.
</P>
<P>
   When Philadelphia retained the right to Lindros, Murray the
motivator went a different direction. He started to sell Kelly
Buchberger and Nelson Emerson _ players acquired at last March's
trading deadline _ as leaders who could help take the pressure off
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger was the captain in Edmonton and played on Stanley Cup
winners before going to Atlanta in last year's expansion draft.
Emerson has been a regular 20-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important messages of camp is getting the players
to take more ownership of this team,'' Murray said. ``It's
important that they feel they can influence the outcome of the
season, not just feel they are along for the ride. I think that
happened last year and it put an awful lot of pressure on Rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blake is concerned the Kings are asking too much of
unproven players in a year they are hoping to raise the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Visnovsky and Lilja are defenseman. During the summer, the Kings
did not re-sign veteran Garry Galley and lost Sean O'Donnell to
Minnesota in the expansion draft. Galley and O'Donnell were the
Kings' second defensive unit and valuable members of the power
play. They also were alternate captains along with Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did sign free-agent defenseman Mathieu Schneider from
the New York Rangers at Blake's recommendation. Schneider and Blake
worked out together this summer at Gold's Gym in Venice Beach and
will be paired on the power play this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schneider is the only one who is a proven player,'' Blake
said. ``It would be great if the other guys all contributed, played
a full season and helped us get back to the playoffs. But that
could be a lot to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you'd love to go out and get as many players as you can,
a (Jaromir) Jagr, a Lindros and Brian Leetch. But in this business
you don't always get what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the issues facing Blake, his contract future is not an
immediate concern. Just days before signing his last deal three
years ago, a frustrated Blake said that even though he loved L.A.,
he knew there was a chance he might finish his career elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the latest negotiations are on hold between Kings GM Dave
Taylor and Blake's agent Ron Salcer. Taylor said Wednesday he could
see getting it done after the season begins. Unlike Stumpel, who is
using the leverage of training camp to secure a new deal, Blake has
been skating, and participating in meetings with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's out there,'' said Blake, acknowledging that
Pronger is seeking a five-year deal worth between $8-10 million per
season. ``But after last year, there is a lot unfinished. This is
an organization that needs to keep the momentum going. We did well
last year. But we need to do much more.''

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nurse Betty seems as if it were patched together from parts of
other films.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is reminiscent of (beginitalic)True Romance(enditalic),
in which a spunky girl and her beau make off with a passel of drugs
and are chased down by vicious thugs. In this case, Betty (Renee
Zellweger) steals the drugs unknowingly, but the result is pretty
much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The movie even includes an interrogation scene similar to the
one in (beginitalic)True Romance(enditalic), except it's more
gruesome, less clever and lacks two vital elements: Dennis Hopper
and Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the characters in (beginitalic)Nurse
Betty(enditalic), which all seem familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Freeman plays a philosophical hit man named Charlie, the
same character he has played in films such as (beginitalic)Seven
(enditalic)(philosophical cop) and (beginitalic)Hard Rain
(enditalic)(philosophical bank robber). Freeman does a nice job,
but he should. He's had plenty of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock is Wesley, a wisecracking sidekick, much as he was in
(beginitalic)Dogma(enditalic). This is hardly casting against type.
Besides that, Rock's performance is uneven, as if he's not sure
when to fly into his stand-up act.
</P>
<P>
   Betty is married to Del (Aaron Eckhart), a jerk ripped straight
out of (beginitalic)Thelma &AMP; Louise(enditalic). He fools around on
her, forgets her birthday and has poor table manners, the universal
movie shorthand for rotten husbands. The penalty, of course, is
death.
</P>
<P>
   All these familiar characters don't necessarily make the movie
unwatchable. It does, however, make it predictable.
(beginitalic)Nurse Betty (enditalic)also can't decide whether it's
a black comedy, a crime drama or a romance. It has elements of all
three. Sometimes they mesh, and sometimes they don't.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Zellweger does an admirable job as Betty, a
waitress who suffers a psychotic break after seeing Del get
murdered by Charlie and Wesley, who are after stolen drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Betty is so traumatized, she plunges into a fantasy world where
she is engaged to her favorite soap-opera character, Dr. David
Ravell (Greg Kinnear), who is actually an actor named George
McCord. In a sort of trance, Betty writes a note to her dead
husband and heads off to California to locate and marry Dr. Ravell.
</P>
<P>
   While the soap fantasy deserves some points for creativity, much
of the story plays out conventionally. Betty has unwittingly taken
the drugs (hidden in the trunk of her car), forcing Charlie and
Wesley to track her across the country. As they flounder around,
she struggles to hook up with her fictional finance.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the energy of this movie hits a low ebb. There's
also some big gaps in internal logic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Charlie keeps saying he can't believe Betty would
head to California because of a soap opera. But in the movie's
opening scene, Charlie watches Betty pour coffee while being
engrossed in the show. As a cagey master crook, you'd think it's
something he'd remember.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's not much memorable about (beginitalic)Nurse

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday dismissed
criticism from some Republicans over the direction of his campaign.
But he also called himself the underdog in the race and said he
would restyle his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides said he would start appearing at town hall
meetings again as early as next week. Such sessions disappeared in
March after Sen. John McCain dropped from the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said the Texas
governor was also likely to start visiting coffee shops and
cafeterias and might begin to visit families to discuss how his tax
cut plan would affect them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he wanted to hold such events, Bush said, ``Well, it's
a better picture.'' He said that if his unscripted encounters were
mostly with reporters on his campaign plane, ``people don't get a
sense of my ability to relate to people. They don't get a sense
that my plan has got real purposes for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes repeatedly used a similar phrase, ``real plans for real
people,'' making it clear that this was the Bush campaign's new
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments at an impromptu news conference on an
airport tarmac in Detroit after prominent Republicans across the
country expressed concern over the state of his campaign and after
a series of national and state polls showed that Vice President Al
Gore was solidifying the gains he had made after the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Thursday by ABC News and The Washington Post
found the race tied, with Bush and Gore each attracting 47 percent,
while a Gallup Organization poll for CNN and USA Today found Gore
with a 7-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   And while he said he would change some events, Bush also waved
off some of the second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Washington,'' he said. ``That's people getting ready to
jump out of the foxhole before the first shell is fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the military analogy on a day when he campaigned with
two of the most prominent figures of his father's administration,
Colin L. Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
J. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded U.S. troops during the Persian
Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Both voiced support for Bush's contention that President Clinton
had allowed the military to deteriorate, leaving it unprepared for
post-Cold War conflicts. And Powell called Bush ``a man with a
mission, a man with vision, a man who is committed to making sure
the armed forces of the United States will always be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans who had voiced concerns about the shape
of the Bush campaign seemed particularly concerned about Bush's
refusal to agree to debates sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates. They said his stance had made him seem timid
and had taken him into an unproductive fight over political process
rather than issues.
</P>
<P>
   While he continued to criticize Gore for rejecting his offer for
a different set of debates _ two of them shorter and before smaller
audiences than the commission debates _ Bush for the first time
gave some suggestion that there was give to his position. ``There
will be debates,'' he said. ``I am confident there will be debates.
As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out
in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush even joked that he ``may go more alpha male coming down the
stretch.'' That was a dig at Gore, who had a feminist author on his
payroll last year, advising him how to dress and act like an alpha
male. ``I'm under no illusions and neither should our supporters be
_ it's going to be a tough contest,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was the underdog, Bush jumped at the label.
``Yeah,'' he said. ``I'm the underdog. But I was the underdog when
I first started.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new campaign style is reminiscent of the retooling of his
primary campaign in South Carolina in February after his drubbing
by McCain in the New Hampshire primary. Bush began holding town
meetings, which had been his opponent's trademark. And he tried to
appropriate McCain's reform mantle, calling himself a ``reformer
with results.''
</P>
<P>
   The events Bush and his aides were describing Thursday,
similarly echoed of the style of Gore, who has been holding town
hall meetings, visiting teachers in their homes and stopping into
coffee shops to talk to workers. Gore often talks of fighting for
``working people.'' Bush is now speaking of working for ``real
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the governor and his aides had thought they were not
being ``creative'' enough. She said the campaign had fallen into
auto-pilot, simply using the rally formats that had worked for well
for the governor on his ride into the Republican National
Convention. She said Bush wanted to put a human face on his policy
proposals by meeting with people and showing how they would benefit
under his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign derided Bush's portrayal of himself as an
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who raised $100 million in this campaign, a
record, from the special interests _ the HMOs, the prescription
drug companies and the big oil industry,'' said Chris Lehane,
Gore's spokesman. ``It's Al Gore who has an agenda that represents
the underdog and George W. Bush who has an agenda that represents
the special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new style was not visible Thursday, however, as he turned
to military themes and showcased at his side Powell and
Schwarzkopf. At Wright University in Dayton, under a banner
proclaiming ``Respecting America's Military,'' Bush introduced the
former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Desert Storm
commander, and each one gave him a strong endorsement as the best
man to be commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush also hinted at stops across the day that he would name
Powell to his administration. ``The general talked about being
retired from public service,'' he said here, then glanced at Powell
and added puckishly, ``If all goes well. ...'' The crowd erupted in
cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged that he would push for modernization of the
military to meet the new threats in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the nation had the chance to ``redefine how war
is fought and won in the future, and therefore we have the
opportunity to redefine how the peace is kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if elected he would assemble a task force of
military leaders to come up with a ``strategic plan'' for what the
military of the future should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's not going to look like the great American moment
of Desert Storm and Desert Shield,'' Bush said. ``A military of the
future is not going to be that heavy, and it's not going to be that
hard to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events were designed to put the gulf war leaders at
center stage in order to endorse the son of the man they served
under. Schwarzkopf called himself proud to ``stand up and endorse''
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Powell lambasted the Clinton administration for hurting military
readiness, a theme that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
have been hitting hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and frankly deeply disappointed the other day
when the president's spokesman attacked Dick Cheney because he
dared to tell the truth about the state of readiness, and said he
was attacking the military,'' Powell said. ``Dick Cheney has never
attacked the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney pressed the same theme in appearances at military
contractors in New England. He recalled a telephone call he had
made to former President Ronald Reagan after the gulf war, saying
he had thanked Reagan the money his administration had spent on the
military. ``I ask myself,'' he said, ``is anybody going to call
Bill Clinton or Al Gore in the future to thank them for what they
did to the U.S. military? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, challenged several
of the assertions Bush made in his speeches Thursday. Bacon said
that the administration, along with Congress, had increased defense
spending by $150 billion over the next several years. That included
an increase in spending on weapons and other equipment _ an area
where Bush was sharply critical _ from $43 billion in 1998 to $60
billion today, as well as three straight years of pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also noted that the number of troops qualifying for food
stamps _ which Bush has often cited as evidence that the Clinton
administration had neglected men and women in uniform _ had
declined significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that 19,400 service members, 0.9 percent of the
total, collected food stamps in 1991, when Bush's father was
president and Cheney Cheney was secretary of defense. Today, Bacon
said, 5,100 are on food stamps, or 0.4 percent of a smaller force.

 UNDATED: we were.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albright's emphasis on the shortage of time was prompted by
several factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the belief within the administration that the
longer the two sides remain apart, the harder it becomes to put the
pieces back together.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said that confidence was being lost,
not unlike the drift that occurred after talks between Israel and
Syria ended in Shephardstown, Va., earlier this year and were never
reconvened.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Barak must start to remedy his weak political
situation at home by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli parliament returns to session at the end of October,
and if a peace agreement looks impossible, Barak wants to spend
most of October reconfiguring his government by joining with the
rightist Likud Party and others.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton made conceptual breakthroughs at Camp David,
there was not enough time to delve into the finer details of issues
like religion and national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, this issue may have too far to go _
from 2000 years of history and 52 years of not really coming to
grips with shared aspirations,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle remained the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as
Haram al-Sharif, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been saying since the Camp David talks in July, when
the question of sovereignty over the site was raised, that the
temple does not exist, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   By insisting that what the Jews consider to be the most sacred
of their holy sites was not even a Jewish place, Arafat was denying
a basic respect to his main negotiating partner, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be solved by denying the beliefs of one of the
great religions,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the Temple Mount is the most sacred of all places, the
site, according to Jewish beliefs, of the First and Second Temples
destroyed by the Babylonians and the Romans. Among the Muslims, the
site and its two Muslim shrines, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa,
are among the holiest of all Islamic sites.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak tentatively agreed to the notion that the
Palestinians could be granted religious sovereignty over the mount,
with the Israelis retaining political sovereignty. But after
leaving Camp David, Barak made clear that nothing was agreed to
until every aspect of the peace deal was in place.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the United Nations on Thursday, Barak,
who has come under fire at home for conceding too much at Camp
David, reiterated that Jerusalem and the Temple Mount ``are the
cornerstone of Jewish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Israeli prime minister will ever be able to sign a document
that gives up sovereignty to the Temple Mount to the
Palestinians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak then went on to chide Arafat for his attitude toward the
Temple Mount and toward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the time, the prime minister said, for Arafat ``to
rewrite the history of the three monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very word of Temple Mount tells the real story of Temple
Mount,'' Barak said. When Jesus Christ walked in Jerusalem, Barak
said, he did not see Christian churches or Islamic mosques. ``What
he could see is the Jewish Temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Barak went on to criticize the Palestinian for
inflexibility, saying he was not willing ``to take Clinton's ideas
as the basis of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The fairly harsh words about Arafat appeared to reflect the
Israeli leader's increasing frustration with what he considers the
Palestinian's refusal to seriously negotiate. In private meetings
with American Jews since he has been in the United States, Barak
has said that he cannot give more in negotiations. He has also been
pessimistic about the chances for a peace deal, describing them as
well under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, the administration will keep working at
the issues, senior U.S. officials said. They will try to encourage
Arab leaders to take more initiative in moving Arafat toward a
solution on Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians have been helpful in recent weeks in devising some
ideas, including the notion of ``divine sovereignty'' for the
Temple Mount, meaning that the site belonged to God. But a senior
U.S. official said that the Egyptians and other Arab countries have
only said that they will support Arafat in whatever he chooses to
do. They stopped short of recommending solutions to him, the
official said.

 &HT;    Atlanta council mulls naming street after Young
 &HT;    By Mae Gentry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who helped put Atlanta on the world map may get his own
International Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta City Council is considering changing downtown's
International Boulevard to Andrew Young International Boulevard in
honor of the globe-trotting former mayor and U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is that it's time that we give some recognition
to Andy,'' said Councilman C.T. Martin, who introduced the
legislation with Debi Starnes. Her council district includes the
downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   Martin cites Young's involvement in Atlanta's bid for the 1996
Olympic Games. ``We know that he provided, from his ambassadorship,
those relationships with those 17 African countries that helped put
the vote over the top,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Starnes anticipates council approval ``in the absence of any
objections or any reason why we shouldn't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bond, one of eight council co-sponsors, favors lauding
the civil rights activist, ordained minister and former U.S. House
member and thinks International is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a street that, in some respects, is the gateway into
Atlanta from I-75 and I-85,'' he said. ``And it leads right into
(Centennial) Olympic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a short street, so few businesses would need new
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hulata, a Czech immigrant who manages Pittypat's Porch
restaurant, remembers the last name change in 1977. ``It was kind
of messy a little bit, because it was Cain Street forever. For
major customers coming from the suburbs, it was messy. Mail
disappeared or was lost because of that. It was not pleasant for a
little while.'' As for the proposed name, Hulata said, ``If they're
going to leave it International Boulevard, just put a person's name
in front of it, I don't see any problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a partner in the consulting firm Good Works
International, declined to comment. His assistant, Maggie Womack,
liked the idea. ``It should have been done a long time ago,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The council's City Utilities Committee will hold a public
hearing on the proposal at 9 a.m. Tuesday in Committee Room 2. The
council is expected to vote on it Sept. 18. If passed, it would
require Mayor Bill Campbell's approval.

   e-mail messages.

<P>
   These are among the efforts helping parents teach kids about
safe Internet use in ways that will interest and entertain. The
reason: 25 million children are online in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: Canadian Media Awareness Network has released
``Cybersense and Nonsense,'' in which children help three
skateboarding pigs learn that not all wolves blow houses down;
Circle 1's kidscom charged its safety word puzzles with cartoon
characters; and Disney Online established ``Surf Swell Island,''
where children guide characters through spooky scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are noticing. More than 75 percent of the nearly 1,000
kids surveyed (ages 8-12) say their parents restrict the sites they
can visit and more than half say their parents limit their time
online. Both figures are up sharply over the last five years, says
the survey by SpectraCom Inc. and Circle 1 Network.

   CBS' WEB: If you like the Web-enhanced Emmys this weekend on ABC
(abc.com.), then you'll love the latest media coupling: CBS and
WebTV. The network will soon offer interactivity on 500 hours of
programming, including comedy and drama series, an industry first
(unless you consider ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' a comedy).
Those with an eye on the Eye Network and a hand on the remote will
``experience'' enhanced content on demand (including sports and
cast bios), take part in live polling, have access to programming
updates and have e-commerce and chat options. The expanded service
will be available only via WebTV Networks and Microsoft's

everything from how to get a tattoo to how to pitch a TV show to
how to eat sushi, so hot? The high traffic may be because of the
hip, clever tone of its advice. But it probably has more to do with
the obvious target audience: the 18- to 29-year-old demographic,
which spends more than $200 billion annually. Since it went live in
March, it has grown from about 800,000 page views in June to 3.3

 &HT;    How baseball stirs the melting pot
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmmaker Aviva Kempner has a unique suggestion for people
turned off by Atlanta Braves closer John Rocker's racist comments:
``Throw him flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   No, she's not a Rocker fan, by any means. But having spent more
than 12 years putting together her documentary ``The Life and Times
of Hank Greenberg,'' she knows a little bit about the powers of
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is true in Rocker's case, but (hearing
insults) was a spur for Hank to do better,'' she says during a
recent stop in Atlanta. ``I'm sure Rocker feels that _ `I'm gonna
show you, I'm gonna strike you guys out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Born to immigrant parents in New York, Hank Greenberg was one of
many first-generation Americans who found a sense of national
identity through playing baseball. But he took it a lot further
than most kids, getting signed to the Detroit Tigers, nearly
beating Babe Ruth's single-season home-run record and being chosen
most valuable player twice at two positions. All the while he had
to deal with, on one hand, racist epithets from the crowd and
fellow ballplayers, and, on the other, the heightened expectations
of his fellow Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Detroit,'' Kempner says. ``My dad was an
immigrant Jew. He himself had come to America in the late '20s, and
part of the way he became American was to follow baseball.'' So did
Kempner, who arrived on U.S. shores at age 4. ``I also was an
immigrant who grew to love baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the same trend _ baseball viewed as a sign of
patriotism and assimilation _ working for different races: ``I've
met Dominicans in New York who follow Sammy Sosa, and the way they
talked about Sammy, they were bursting with pride,'' she says.
``That's the way fans talked about Hank, and still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempner, a Washington film critic and lecturer, never met
Greenberg. The idea of making a film about his life came to her
when she heard of his death in September 1986, while she was in Los
Angeles presenting her first documentary, ``Partisans of Vilna,''
about Jewish resistance fighters during World War II. She compiled
her new movie by talking to the baseball star's family and friends,
and mixing them with pre-existing interview clips of Greenberg.
Vintage footage of his games and a nostalgic soundtrack of popular
songs of the '30s and '40s fuel the movie, which lacks a
traditional narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story is a dramatic story,'' Kempner says of her decision
to dispense with the disembodied voice found in many documentaries.
``You don't need narration.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Greenberg's story seems a natural for the movies, it took
Kempner, 53, more than 12 years to raise enough money to complete
the film. Maybe that's because another little project, Ken Burns'
TV series ``Baseball,'' was also in the running for funding at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   In traveling with her film and speaking to audiences, Kempner
has found ``Life and Times'' has had an especially strong effect on
men. ``A lot of men have come out with tears in their eyes,
crying,'' she says. ``So I decided to change my epitaph. I'm going
to have them put on my epitaph, `She Made Men Cry.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times
</P>
<P>
   of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg. Directed by
Aviva Kempner. Not rated. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A grand slam.

 &HT;    Lisa Lopes' vanishing act spurs frenzy
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Post reported Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes missing
Thursday, and a mini-media frenzy erupted, with the likes of TV's
``Inside Edition'' and Rolling Stone magazine trying to chase down
the story.
</P>
<P>
   But the singer's friends in Atlanta weren't worried.
</P>
<P>
   Business partner and longtime friend Ian Burke said he hadn't
seen Lopes _ one third of the Atlanta R&AMP;B trio TLC _ since the
start of Labor Day weekend. And he had no idea why she skipped a
news conference Tuesday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But he said her ``disappearance'' sounded to him more like
``Lisa Lopes simply being Lisa Lopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post quoted Lopes' publicist as ``pleading'' with his
client: ``Lisa, if you're reading this, please call us _ we're very
worried about you.'' On Thursday, though, he didn't seem so
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' Matt Shelton told the Journal-Constitution.
``Since she was last seen with Sean (Newman, her boyfriend), I'm
sure the pair of them are somewhere safe and will turn up or make a
grand appearance soon _ as only Sean and Lisa can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes, of Stone Mountain, Ga., has a reputation as the trio's
most unpredictable member _ she once torched the house of former
Atlanta Falcon Andre Rison _ which undoubtedly fueled the media
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   To her friends, however, this episode was hardly newsworthy.
``She takes these little `sabbaticals' all the time,'' Burke said.
``It's just that most of the time, no one does a story about it.''

 &HT;    Launch tickets sold on Internet
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It took a while, but the Kennedy Space Center
finally went high tech.
</P>
<P>
   You can now go online to buy space shuttle launch tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, space buffs had to show up at the visitor complex
no earlier than five to seven days ahead of a launch to buy
tickets, said Michelle Salyer, public relations manager for the
Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.
</P>
<P>
   A couple from Switzerland was the first to buy tickets for
today's scheduled 8:45 a.m. launch shortly after online sales began
Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much easier to plan your vacation around the launch
now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 tickets to today's launch sold out Tuesday, she said,
but plenty of tickets remain for the Oct. 5 and Nov. 30 launches. A
basic ticket sells for $15, while the maximum access ticket sells
for $34.50 and comes with lots of extra goodies.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to go, bring a lawn chair or blanket, but no
food or drinks are allowed, Salyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing area is about 6 miles from the launch pad, Salyer
said, miles closer than the free public viewing areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can definitely hear the launch,'' she said. ``It's
tremendously loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course buying tickets doesn't guarantee you will see a
launch; after all, this is rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   If the mission is delayed or scrubbed before you get to the
viewing area, you can just come back for the mission's next launch
attempt, she said. But if the mission is delayed after you get to
the viewing area, you're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are selling a launch viewing opportunity,'' she said. ``We
are the real thing here.''

 &HT;    Consumers give mixed signals
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consumers may not be spending as freely, but their
confidence levels rebounded during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation concerns are easing, and interest rates have peaked
for the year,'' said Roger Tutterow, co-director of Kennesaw
State's Econometric Center, which released its latest metro Atlanta
consumer confidence survey Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of interest rate boosts, only 59 percent of the
survey's 400 respondents expect them to rise in the coming year.
That's a drop from the record level of 73 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A record 87 percent of employed respondents are not worried
about job security. That's 10 percent higher than a year ago in the
same quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs are mixed, Tutterow said. Consumers have not
loosened the grip on their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen improvement in buying habits, especially in
big-ticket items,'' he said. ``I though we would see more of a pop
on the buying conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists, including Tutterow, monitor consumer confidence
because spending fuels two-thirds of the country's growth. When
consumers feel good about the economy, they are more likely to
splurge on luxury and big-ticket items, such as major appliances,
new homes and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday outlook is not bright. August retail sales were
stagnant. Federated Department Stores saw its sales rise only about
1.1 percent at stores open a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Retailing analyst Kurt Barnard, of Barnard Retail Trend Report,
said consumers have cut spending since the spring. He forecasts
same-store retail sales growth of 4 percent this holiday season,
down from about 6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will spend more cautiously than they've spent in a
decade,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer debt on credit cards is $630 billion, almost 10 percent
higher than a year ago, and that could restrain holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennesaw State survey, co-sponsored by the Greater Atlanta
Home Builders Association, is modeled after a national survey by
the University of Michigan. That survey showed a slight decline in
consumer sentiment from the second quarter.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventures in Wild California'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   An Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Review: You've got to hand it to the makers of the Imax movie
``Adventures in Wild California.'' Their movie will keep kids
slack-mouthed with excitement as they watch the extreme-sport
antics of athletic daredevils: tree climbers, snowboarders, skiers
and surfers. (SM) B
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage'' Rated R (strong language, nudity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A hip-hop documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A hip-hop documentary, the behind-the-scenes film about
the 1999 Hard Knocks Life tour is less a documentary than a home
movie, intercutting stage-show clips with endless bad-boy behavior.
To its credit, ``Backstage'' doesn't pull any punches. It never
tries to show its rapping crews as misunderstood artists. As Kevin
Liles, president of Def Jam Records puts it, ``It's all about
getting the (expletive) money.'' (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content and brief
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl
with special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs.
evil, the film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The
Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' PG-13 (sex-related material and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (BL) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is
a cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG)1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' R (profanity, sex, violence and substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith and Stephen Dorff.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Not quite demented enough. There are some amusing bits
and some savvy cinema in-jokes in John Waters' movie about a
Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) kidnapped by underground
filmmakers and forced to star in their no-budget flick. Like Patty
Hearst (who appears in the film), Griffith becomes a convert to
their cause and their wild-eyed leader (Stephen Dorff). Too much of
the film is slapdash and just plain silly. (ERG)1 hour, 27 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell''R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an
intrepid child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi
technique, can enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince
Vaughn) asks her to stroll through the brain of a serial killer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) so he can find where he's stashed his latest
victim. Visually provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1
hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is
about some hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their
villainous owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in
chickens. If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily
deadpan, this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained
entertainment. (ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and John
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving
liquor in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the
bar and set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big
pitchers of water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young
waif, a struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (BL)1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' PG-13 (sexual content, violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny. The stars are old mafia
wiseguys trying to fight a rent increase. (SM) 1 hour, 28 minutes.
F
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM)1 hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   R (extreme violence, perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects,
200,000 _ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell
Crowe as a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take
revenge on the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' PG (monster violence, mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Takehiro Murata, and Tsutomu Kitagawa (as Godzilla).
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``Godzilla 2000'' is everything hard-core fans want it
to be. So corny and campy. And, God bless it, so badly dubbed in
English it soars. Sure it's bad filmmaking. Sure it's a guy _ actor
Tsutomu Kitagawa _ clad in a nearly vintage latex Godzilla get-up
and stomping through Tokyo, knocking down cardboard mini-buildings
and upending toy-sized cars with his gnarly feet. But that's the
point. (BL) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief
called back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal
for a British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula
garbage, ``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily
outdoes the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be
lost while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence, nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship
Troopers,'' ``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome,
state-of-the-art computer effects and exercise his gleeful brand of
brutal action. But his filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script
and characters so two-dimensional, they're virtually all
transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewed: Aviva Kempner's documentary is a rare film indeed _ a
celebration of Hank Greenberg, a pro baseball player in the 1930s
and '40s who became the first Jewish sports superstar. Greenberg
broke rcords, was voted most valuable player twice and led his
team, the Detroit Tigers, to two World Series _ even as he was
being subjected to anti-Semitic baiting by fans, rivals and,
sometimes, his own teammates. Jackie Robinson puts it best: ``Mr.
Greenberg was class.'' So is his movie. 1 hour, 35 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Sex''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated (sexual situations, adult language)
</P>
<P>
   Review: A charming trifle with a sparkling performance by Famke
Janssen as a magazine writer in her early 30s who's had plenty of
sex in her life but not enough love. A magazine assignment sets her
thinking about her past romances, especially one with a good-guy
artist (Jon Favreau). The movie skims when it should take the
plunge and the lead players don't quite match, but at least it's a
romantic comedy that eschews contrivances and admits that it's hell
just being in the dating zone. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max''
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan. Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan
has his own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest
sports story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the
back, it's a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones
in on the 1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team
to a sixth championship before retirement. (BL)45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' Rated R (violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and Greg
Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Renee Zellweger's otherworldly sweetness is used to
great effect in ``Nurse Betty,'' a dark-farce fantasy. Like a
collision between ``Being There,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and early
Coen brothers, you've seen it before, but you've never seen
anything quite like this. Zellweger play's a nurse in search of her
long-lost love, a soap charcter named Dr. David Ravell, and steals
a Buicks to find him. Two problems. The Buick is full of drugs, and
two hitmen _ Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock) _ are
soon hot on her trail. (ERG) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
the nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea''
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short. Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like
the author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly
beautiful. It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't
get, from ``Fantasia/2000.'' (BL) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' R (language and sex-related
humor)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley and
Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny
stuff knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike
Lee's direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years.
The routines get raucous and rude, but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution,
among other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich
takes the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it
to a feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye
and crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13(profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so
does the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang
Petersen. Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates
the collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and
the battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' PG-13 (some crude sexual humor and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp
about adult scabs taking over for striking pro players. (BL) 1
hour, 58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' R (drug content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned
Devine'' mold. The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly
twee: steaming teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a
rowdy pub and some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the
credit of everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title
role, the comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM) 1
hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and
Donald Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in
Clint Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on
the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tao of Steve'' R (profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A slight and slightly obnoxious romantic comedy about a
chunky non-hunk (Donal Logue) who's a babe magnet because he
practices the so-called tao of Steve, i.e., the way to get girls is
to emulate the sheer coolness of Steve McQueen. The twist comes
when this lumpen Lothario falls for a set designer (Greer Goodman)
impervious to his method. Logue can be charming, but the whole
premise seems contrived and a bit false. (ERG) At Tara. 1 hour, 30
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' Rated G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone over 6 or who
isn't already a fan of the immensely successful British TV series,
this could be subtitled The Little Engine Who Couldn't. Things
start to go wrong in a magical land where talking trains are
menaced by a bullying Diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor
(Alec Baldwin). It's not total a wreck, but if you can, avoid being
railroaded into sitting through it unless there's no choice. (ERG)
At metro theaters. 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn It Up''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pras, Ja Rule, Vondie Curtis-Hall. Rated R (strong
violence, language, and some drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Based on ``Ghetto Supastar,'' both the CD and
young-adult novel by hip-hop star Pras (a.k.a. the Fugee's
Prakerzel Michel), ``Turn It Up'' is a flashy, loud urban thriller
that wants to critique the guns-and-bullets world of thug life,
while at the same time reveling in its perks. It's a cautionary
tale that isn't quite sure what it wants to caution the audience
about. (SM)1 hour and 23 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Watcher''
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Spader, Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for violence and language.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's a resonant 21st-century theme in ``The
Watcher,'' an otherwise standard serial-killer thriller. A sicko
named Griffin (Keanu Reeves) stalks pretty women and uses a burnt
out detective, named Campbell (James Spader), as his main pawn.
Debut director Joe Charbanic manages to wring some suspense out of
stock situations. Too often, though, he falls back on cliches,
including heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and an arty reliance
on blurry slo-mo flashbacks. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ryan Phillippe,
</P>
<P>
   Benicio Del Toro, Juliette Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R (violence/gore, language and some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: An Oscar winner for his ``Usual Suspects'' screenplay,
Christopher McQuarrie makes a sluggishly paced directing debut in
the tale of a couple of lowlifes named Parker (Phillippe) and
Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro). Though it's not exactly original, the
movie is so intent on an air of existential grunge, it becomes
suffocating and pretentious. (SM) 2 hours. D
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Review: What lies beneath this film is a script that could have
come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but boosted
by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford and
suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback to
haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than great effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' R (profanity and sexuality.)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gina McKee and Shirley Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: In Alice's Wonderland, things got curiouser and
curiouser. In Michael Winterbottom's ``Wonderland,'' things get
grimmer and grimmer. The movie is a series of interconnected
vignettes (a la ``Magnolia'') showing the unfulfilled lives of
three sisters (Gina McKee, Shirley Henderson, Molly Parker) in
South London. Besides the film's bleakness and hyper-realism of
Mike Leigh or Ken Loach, the acting is fine and the observations
acute. It's one of those hurts-so-good films. (ERG) 1 hour, 49
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best
movie to work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly
entertaining ``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his
collaborators treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and
respect (unlike other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn''
and ``Blade''). It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's
littered with duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Waitress, soap opera and hitmen collide in `Nurse Betty's'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger may have the most chuckable chin in show biz.
Plus the most pinchable cheeks and the widest blue eyes. She's a
cherub with sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Her otherworldly sweetness is used to great effect in ``Nurse
Betty,'' a dark-farce fantasy that exists in some cinematic
collision course with ``Being There,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and
early Coen brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a long-winded way of saying you've seen bits of it
before, but you've never seen anything quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dorothy, Betty Sizemore (Zellweger) is a Kansas naif. A
waitress at the local coffee shop, she muddles through her mundane
life and loveless marriage to Del (Aaron Eckhart), a sleazoid car
salesman, by keeping her eye on, well, not the prize but her prized
favorite soap opera, ``A Reason to Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one night, she sees something that sends her over the
psycho-rainbow. She enters a fantasy life in which it is imperative
that she find her long-lost love, Dr. David Ravell. She hops in one
of Del's Buicks and heads for _ where else? _ La-La Land.
</P>
<P>
   Two not-so-small problems. First, the Buick is full of drugs,
and two hitmen _ Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock) _
are soon hot on her trail. Second, there is no Dr. Ravell. He's a
character on her soap, played by a self-infatuated actor named
George McCord (Greg Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is a kind of fugue for romantic fantasists. Against
all odds, Betty meets McCord, who mistakes her madness for Method.
As in Method acting. He thinks her delusional behavior is an
extended audition for the show, and he's thrilled by her
commitment. ``I haven't felt this way since I was with Stella Adler
in New York,'' he rhapsodizes.
</P>
<P>
   Betty, naturally, has no problem incorporating McCord/Ravell
into her own private fantasy; she just can't understand why he
spends so little time at the hospital. Meanwhile, Charlie is
beginning to have fantasies of his own _ about Betty as his ideal
woman. Except, of course, that he has to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is directed by Neil LaBute, best-known for his
corrosive brilliance as the writer-director of ``In the Company of
Men'' and the less successful ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors.'' This
time, LaBute has left the writing to John C. Richards and James
Flamberg, who shared the screenplay prize at Cannes. What he brings
to the table is a gift for character, which, underneath its
convoluted structure, is what ``Nurse Betty'' really is all about.
Who we are, who we think we are, who others think we are, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger's pixilated performance is the movie's Crazy Glue. If
you don't like her _ you first saw her in ``Jerry Maguire'' _ don't
bother going. She's our tragicomic touchstone, looking for a reason
to love and a reason to live.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the rich supporting cast that makes the movie special.
Rock is rock-solid in a role that asks for more than his bristling
attitude and razor-sharp wit. Kinnear gives shallow charm a
surprising depth. Allison Janney as the soap's producer channels
the acerbic ghost of Eve Arden.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Freeman, who brings a courtly elegance to his
killer in cowboy boots. His growing love for Betty is, in its own
demented way, as true as Heathcliffe's for Cathy, and his rapport
with Rock is a thing of beauty. Maybe this performance will be the
one that brings him his long overdue Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-

Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute. Rated R for violence and
language. 1 hour,

   Good medicine.

   Veto by Clinton Is Upheld On Repeal of Estate Tax
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a bill to repeal the federal tax on large estates
failed in an attempt to overturn President Clinton's veto of the
measure, killing the issue for the year in legislative terms but
leaving it very much alive politically. Republicans said they were
eager to take the debate to the campaign trail, where they said it
would attract support from small business owners, farmers and
entrepreneurs. Democrats said they would continue to make their
case that while the tax should be reduced for family-owned farms
and businesses, the measure that was rejected would eat up too much
of the budget surplus.

 &HT;    Touch of real life gilds `Love &AMP; Sex'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when love and marriage went together like a horse and
carriage? The premise of ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' a charming trifle with a
star-making performance by Famke Janssen, is that love and sex go
together like, well, oil and water. That, all too often, they don't
go together at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kate (Janssen) is a single modern woman in her early 30s.
Translation: She's had plenty of sex, but true love is still
elusive. She works at a glossy woman's magazine, where her most
recent article _ a somewhat autobiographical how-to on oral sex _
has sent her editor (Ann Magnuson) ballistic. Now she has 24 hours
to turn in 2,500 ``happy perky words'' on how to find that perfect
man.
</P>
<P>
   The new assignment starts Kate thinking about all the imperfect
men she's known. Especially an artist named Adam (Jon Favreau). A
sort of thicker Woody Allen (his head alone is roughly the size of
Woody in his entirety), Adam may not be male model material, but
he's funny, smart, sweet, supportive, intuitive and too
strong-minded to be a ``sensitive guy'' doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they're getting settled, fate intervenes and they split.
He starts dating people with names like Peaches while she falls for
a hunky but vacant actor given to atrocious De Niro impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   Like its protagonist, ``Love &AMP; Sex'' doesn't always have its act
together. But, in a way, that's part of the good news. This movie
doesn't have an act. It dares to be a romantic comedy that's not
twisted around some contrivance to create an obstacle for its
lovers (as in the dead wife's heart transplant in ``Return to Me''
or the he-fathered-my-child-but-he's-gay plot of ``The Next Best
Thing''). Rather, this romantic comedy says what every single
knows: It's hell in the dating zone, and finding someone you want
to love, let alone have sex with, is hard work under the best of
circumstances. As Kate says, ``Love is a minefield, but I guess it
hurts so much to be alone, we'd all rather be blown up than be
single.''
</P>
<P>
   Where filmmaker Valerie Breiman goes somewhat wrong is in
casting Favreau. Likable as he was in ``Swingers,'' he's just not a
good match for Janssen. We're asked to believe that they're made
for each other, but it's a stretch. Janssen, however, is a treat.
And something of a revelation. As self-deprecatingly funny as she
is gorgeous, she suggests a more exotic Sandra Bullock. Cast mostly
for her looks in movies like ``X-Men'' and ``GoldenEye,'' she
clearly relishes the chance to deliver comic dialogue and generally
act like a three-dimensional person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Sex'' can be annoyingly predictable, and it skims when
it should take the plunge. But at least it tries to scale itself to
the pitfalls of real-life romance. And besides, how can you resist
a flick in which the lovelorn heroine's favorite movie is
``Nosferatu''? The original silent version.

 &HT;    Exec quits, is replaced at Bass Hotels division
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thomas Arasi has resigned as president of Bass Hotels
&AMP; Resorts' Atlanta-based Americas division, effective Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Arasi, who was named to the post a year and a half ago, will be
succeeded by John Sweetwood, a veteran marketing executive.
Sweetwood is president of Bass' midscale hotel group for North
America, which includes Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge Suites
by Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remain on the same path,'' said Sweetwood, who joined
the company five years ago as executive vice president and chief
marketing officer. He said he plans ``to increase the synergies
between the brands to the extent that we have not been able to
achieve to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The move, which surprised many, comes as London-based Bass PLC,
the parent company of Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts, puts greater emphasis
on its hotel business following the sale of its brewing operations.
Bass is eyeing Europe, Asia and Latin America for development.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say one of Sweetwood's strengths is his
marketing background. Prior to joining Bass, he held several
positions at Ralston Purina, including marketing for the Eveready
Battery Division. Under his leadership, Eveready launched the
``Energizer Bunny'' advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the more innovative changes that have occurred in the
lodging industry in recent years have come from nonindustry
people,'' said Mark Woodworth, executive managing director of PKF
Consulting's hospitality research group.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Lister, senior editor of Lodging magazine, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, I would have said that operations was
probably the most important thing,'' he said. ``Now, marketing is
just as important as anything else. It's like the brand is the
thing now and building brand loyalty and awareness are the
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership of the Americas division is important because the
bulk of Bass hotels are in the region, which includes the United
States, Canada, Mexico and South America. Its flagship brand _
Holiday Inn _ has its greatest presence in the Americas,
particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americas is the absolute crux,'' Lister said.
</P>
<P>
   Arasi is leaving to start his own business, but he will remain a
consultant for the company. Arasi plans to form a holding company,
based in Atlanta, that will be involved in hotel investment,
development, finance and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Arasi said he is leaving now ``because there is so much change
and volatility in the global hotel industry. I felt that this was
an opportunity for me to use my experience, to use my relationship,
my industry presence and capital to create opportunities for myself
and investors.''

   BALTIMORE _ The shuffleboard players here at the John T. Booth
Senior Center all have a horror story or two about how they, a
friend or a relative has been saddled with crushing prescription
drug costs. And so they are thrilled that the issue has moved
center stage in the presidential contest between Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They did not claim to understand the details of the two
candidates' competing plans to create prescription drug policies
through the Medicare system. But on one issue they were in
complete, clear agreement: They do not want the system
significantly changed. Expand it, make it more generous, but do not
overhaul it, they all said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they change it, they'll just foul it all up,'' said Helen
Mirabile, 80, a retired sewing machine operator, as her friends
nodded in ascent.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one political lesson to be gleaned from a 90-minute
conversation Thursday morning with 15 retirees in this
working-class neighborhood of modest row houses, it might be this:
Bush could have trouble selling his plan for redesigning the
Medicare system among the very people who depend on the system now.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Tuesday, Bush called for retooling the
35-year-old system to encourage the use of private insurance plans,
some of which would provide prescription drug coverage. By breeding
competition among private insurers for the Medicare market, Bush
contends, costs will be lowered and elderly people will have more
choices.. To help people with drug costs, he proposed subsidizing
the premiums of the low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also vowed to modernize what he called a ``rigid and
sluggish and slow to change'' Medicare bureaucracy that he said
increasingly poses ``a hazard to your health.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the elderly gathered here Thursday, nary a bad word
about Medicare could be heard. A few people recalled a bureaucratic
error here or there. Others bemoaned cuts in services or rising
premiums. But all praised the system for providing services they
said they could never have afforded on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Medicare has been a godsend,'' said Florence Barnes,
81, a former city employee.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush's proposal for prescription drugs sounded
appealing to members of the group, even though most of them already
have supplementary insurance plans that cover most of their
prescription drug costs. But his attacks on the bureaucracy did not
resonate with them. Only one woman could offer a complaint: She had
been improperly billed for an X-ray. But after several phone calls,
the matter was worked out to her satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   And most of them found his proposal to increase the role of
private insurance companies troubling. Though only a few of them
are enrolled in health maintenance organizations through Medicare,
almost all of them had viscerally negative reactions to the idea of
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's proposal would make participation in private health
plans voluntary, its goal would be to encourage more people to join
HMOs, which now cover 6.2 million, or 16 percent, of the 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Rose D'Ambrosio, an 86-year-old retired federal employee,
offered the kind of story that many people in the room said they
had heard before. Her daughter's HMO, she said, took several months
to approve major treatment for cancer, creating all kinds of
anxieties for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs more operations,'' D'Ambrosio said. ``They have to
refer you to a doctor. And it takes a long time. A person who has
these types of decisions needs care right now, not six months from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other people said they did not like the idea that
managed care companies could tell them to use different doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not only a regular internist,'' said Syd Goldfield, 71,
``I have a urologist. I have a bone doctor. I have an eye doctor.
Etc., etc. I know who I am seeing, and I like them. And I don't
like to have a strange doctor working on me for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Hemmeter, 71, said, ``Some people have the same doctors
for like 15, 20, 30 years and they aren't going to switch and go to
another doctor after they've been with that doctor for that many
years.'' Several people also questioned whether Bush's plan for
greater competition was realistic, noting that several HMOs, some
in the Baltimore area, have pulled out of the Medicare system in
recent years, citing low reimbursement rates from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The group, most of whom said they were Democrats, seemed more
comfortable with Gore's plan, though it would cost more than
Bush's: $253 billion over 10 years compared with $198 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That plan would create a voluntary prescription drug benefit
inside the traditional Medicare program. Beneficiaries would pay
monthly premiums, but like Bush, Gore would subsidize coverage for
the low-income elderly. Unlike Bush, the vice president would offer
a uniform, standardized package with the same premiums for most
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   To many people in the group, having more choices among health
plans was not their major concern; reliability was. And to them, a
system run by the government rather than by private managed care
companies seemed like the better alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the best, you have to pay,'' said Hemmeter,
referring to Gore's more expensive plan. ``And I want the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The group praised both candidates for focusing on high
prescription drug costs. All knew people who have struggled to get
by without prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmeter, for example, said her sister's insurance plan does not
cover the cost of drugs to control her cholesterol and blood
pressure, which run about $170 a month. Consequently, she said, her
sister takes only half the prescribed dosages.
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the group said Gore's populist attacks on
``big drug companies'' struck a chord with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other countries have price controls and get their drugs
cheaper,'' said Eulalia Pereira, 76, a retired federal employee.
``We should too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Melton, 71, a retired nurse, said she often saw patients
who were ill because they could not afford prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are low-income families who have to make a decision
about whether they are going to eat or buy medication,'' she said.
``That's really sad. There should be some kind of prescription
plan.''

OPEC IS LIKELY TO RAISE OIL OUTPUT AFTER MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As OPEC prepares to meet this weekend in Vienna, it finds itself
on familiar ground, with oil prices hovering at worrying heights
and nervous industrialized nations demanding more oil, fearful of
an end to good economic times.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two months ago, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries convened under similar circumstances and
responded by increasing production by 708,000 barrels a day. In
fact, since the beginning of the year, OPEC has raised production
by nearly three million barrels a day, a significant amount over a
short period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the price of crude oil, despite occasional dips, has stayed
stubbornly high. Thursday in New York, the price of oil rose as
high as $35.46 a barrel, the highest price since the Persian Gulf
war, before slipping back to $35.39, a gain of 49 cents, or 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a U.N. summit meeting in New York Thursday, President Clinton
said the price of oil was too steep and encouraged OPEC to raise
output. On Wednesday, Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said
that energy costs were ``unacceptably high'' and that oil-producing
nations should increase production enough to reduce prices to $20
to $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such pressures, OPEC is expected to open the taps once
again when its session concludes on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of oil will most likely remain high, with few
analysts expecting it to fall far below $30 a barrel in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a cooling-off, prices will go from $34 a barrel to
maybe $31, not $25,'' said Roger Diwan, managing director of the
Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting group in Washington. ``The
problem is not, are prices going to stay high, but more, are they
going to go up? How will OPEC avoid a flare-up to $40 a barrel?''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the political fallout from high heating oil
prices in an election year, the Clinton administration has
increased pressure on Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the
cartel, to coax a large production increase from OPEC. But the
cartel is already exceeding its official quota by about 670,000
barrels a day, industry experts estimate. An increase of 700,000
barrels a day would preserve the status quo, making the
``cheating'' official. Oil traders say that an increase of at least
800,000 barrels would keep prices stable, and one million barrels a
day would dampen them a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But the persistence of high prices has as much to do with
conditions within the countries that import oil as it does with
OPEC's tinkering on the supply side. The increased OPEC supply has
been quickly consumed by thriving economies that demand greater
amounts of fuel to keep goods and people moving.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the anxiety that has buoyed oil prices has
less to do with OPEC and more to do with federal statistics that
show supplies of heating oil, especially in the Northeast, are far
lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since gasoline inventories were low going into the summer
driving season, refiners concentrated their efforts on producing
gasoline, which meant they have not been able to rebuild distillate
stocks ahead of the winter heating season,'' said Vincent Lauerman,
senior economist with the Canadian Energy Research Institute in
Calgary, Alberta. ``We were playing catch-up with gasoline stocks
before and we're playing catch-up with heating oil now,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. refineries are now exporting more heating oil
than the country imports, industry experts say. A Kuwaiti refinery
that supplies much of the world's heating oil was disabled by an
explosion this summer, which drastically cut the amount of heating
oil available. In Europe, Mexico and Brazil, tight supplies of
heating oil have driven prices higher than they are here, drawing
fuel to those regions and out of the United States. The federal
government is now looking at ways to curb such exports.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the great lag in stockpiling, few think that even a
drastic increase in production by OPEC will allow American
refineries to replenish their heating oil reserves by the winter.
If the weather turns bitter, the Northeast, which consumes most of
the country's heating oil, could face the same price increases as
it did last winter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   OPEC members, while publicly agreeing that crude prices are too
high, have also said that it was a problem of demand, not supply.
The fragmented priorities of the 12 sovereign states within OPEC
has made it hard for the cartel to answer the pleas of oil-hungry
nations like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the OPEC members are producing at capacity, except
for Saudi Arabia. If overall production rose sharply and prices
fell, few countries could make up for the loss in revenue by
increasing volume. That revenue, in turn, often constitutes up to
75 percent of the budgets of OPEC nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a good balance at this point between offer
and demand,'' said Hector Ciavaldini, president of Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A., the state oil company.
</P>
<P>
   With revenue so high, there are also differing views about a
fair and favorable price for a barrel of oil. ``The reasonable
price keeps shifting,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist for
the Centre for Global Energy Studies, a British research group.
``When the price was $10, OPEC said $15 would be reasonable. When
it was $17, they said $20. Now some think $30 is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartel is also afraid of overproducing and touching off a
free fall in prices, which occurred two years ago. Cartel members
and non-OPEC countries are developing new wells as fast as possible
to take advantage of the high oil prices. Over the next year or
two, new fields will bring supply closer in line with high
worldwide demand and probably lead to a downturn in oil prices,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC is terrified that if they push too many barrels out now,
in three months they'll be looking at rapidly falling prices,''
Drollas said. ``And then, it won't be easy to pull things back.'' &QL;

 DuPONT SHARES DROP 10 PERCENT AS COMPANY WARNS ON PROFITS  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DuPont Co., the nation's biggest chemical company, warned
Thursday that soaring costs for fuel and raw materials, the
declining value of the euro and potentially lower sales would push
earnings for the rest of the year below Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent shares of DuPont and those of other big chemical
companies into a tailspin, but many analysts said investors
overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont said its earnings for the year were likely to come in 2
percent to 5 percent below expectations, at $2.85 to $2.95 a share
instead of the $3.01 that analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   But DuPont executives said that they still expected earnings for
the year to be 10 percent to 14 percent above results for the
previous year and that 2001 earnings were likely to increase at
least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those projections, shares of DuPont fell $4.88, to
$42.13, their lowest point in four years as more than 17.5 million
shares changed hands compared with a daily average of 2.7 million.
Shares of Dow Chemical Co. fell $1.88, to $25.56, while Rohm &AMP; Hass
fell $2, to $29.38, and Eastman Chemical Co. dropped $1.19, to
$45.31. Shares of the European chemical companies BASF and Bayer
also fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market oversold the stock today,'' said Frank J.
Mitsch, a senior chemical industry analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``I think
this is an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to put this into perspective,'' he added, ``and
consider that at the beginning of the year, DuPont's expectation
for 2000 was $2.96. Then they saw some positive trends and adjusted
upwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander A. Hittle, a chemical industry analyst at A.G.
Edwards, said he, too, was ``a little surprised that the stock
pulled back as much as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   A.G. Edwards has recommended that investors maintain or hold
their positions in DuPont. But Hittle said: ``We're being a little
bit greedy. We'd like to pick it up in the high 30's.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the drop in DuPont's expectations, Hittle said: ``It's a
bunch of things that DuPont didn't really have control over. And
we've already seen the chemical companies pull back on exactly this
collection of concerns about high raw material prices and slowing
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitsch said investors, wary of a possible further slowing in the
economy and its effect on sales, clearly took the warning as ``a
signal for them to lighten up their portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We're now seeing DuPont stock trading at levels
close to where it was trading in 1996 and, I can guarantee you,
it's a much better company today than it was in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have also been encouraged by DuPont's earlier
announcement that it planned to buy back up to 5 percent of its
outstanding stock, which would help to maintain share prices, if
not raise them.
</P>
<P>
   A.G. Edwards has a buy rating on Dow Chemical. ``Dow has been
more oversold than DuPont,'' Hittle said, ``and Dow pays a bit
better dividend. It's really the same bet as DuPont, that global
economics will stay strong and that oil prices will cool off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, Gary M. Pfeiffer, DuPont's chief financial
officer, said the company expected to achieve its new goal of more
than 10 percent in earnings growth this year by increasing prices,
cutting operating costs and being ``more prudent and selective in
use of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as July, DuPont increased its earnings expectations
as cost cutting appeared to be running ahead of schedule and sales
were up. But oil prices have jumped 20 percent since then, the
company said, while United States natural gas costs have leaped 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont makes products like auto paints and lacquers, fabrics and
health care products. Crude oil and natural gas make up 40 percent
of the company's raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsch estimated that 30 percent of the company's sales were in
Europe, making it particularly vulnerable to the euro's recent
slide against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference call, DuPont executives said they saw some
weakening in volume from customers in the clothing business. They
also said sales would be hurt by the shutdown of some Ford truck
plants, which were closed for two weeks to make more tires
available to replace those recalled by Bridgestone/Firestone last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hittle said DuPont had been trying to put itself on a path of
steady growth and to step away from the traditional volatility of
the chemical industry, partly by diversifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``DuPont has made a substantial effort to recast itself and move
into the life sciences and away from the commodity chemical
business,'' Hittle said. ``This announcement today reminds us that
the life science vision of the company isn't mature and that for
the time being this is still a chemical company, subject to the
kinds of macroeconomic factors that make chemicals a difficult
business.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a sustained effort to seal a Middle East peace accord, the
White House has begun to sense that a solution is slipping away,
and senior administration officials say they are preparing
themselves for the likelihood that a deal will not come during
President Clinton's time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not about to abruptly give up what has been one of
his most cherished and hard-fought foreign policy goals, but senior
administration officials said that the momentum created at the Camp
David summit meeting in July had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met this week with both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak as well as with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, while
the men were in New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But senior administration officials said that Arafat had failed
to give sufficient assurances that he would agree to a solution on
Jerusalem and, in particular, on sovereignty over the sites there
that are sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements on Thursday, Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright kept open the possibility of future meetings.
But Clinton suggested that he would not meet again this week with
Arafat or Barak. And in private, assessments were even gloomier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barak nor Arafat have threatened to walk away. They have
both pledged to keep going, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is not prepared to keep talks between
Israel and the Palestinians going for the sake of talking, a senior
official said. ``It's not our job to give it life support if it's
not breathing,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we heard some movement, but not sufficient and
not with the kind of precision that we need to hear that looks
anything like a process that goes to closure,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight years of his presidency, Clinton has spent more
time than any other president talking and negotiating with the
Israelis and the Palestinians in search of a final peace agreement.
He oversaw the momentous signing ceremony for the Oslo peace
accords in 1993 at the White House, where he extended his arms to
ensure a handshake between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. And the president also helped broker the accords
reached after great pain at Wye Plantation in 1998. But on
Thursday, even Clinton sounded uncertain about future steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there will be any more meetings while we are
here,'' Clinton said before meeting Thursday morning with the South
Korean president, Kim Dae-jung. ``We'll see where we are and
whether anything else can be done while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said at a news conference, ``The truth is, just look at
the calendar, and there is not a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton's senior advisers are beginning to
talk about their achievements at Camp David as possibly being
material for another administration to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Camp David there was a huge iceberg, we sent an
icebreaker through it, and we cracked it open 100 different ways _
refugees, Jerusalem, security, borders,'' said Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``The good news is that this is no
longer just an iceberg, it's 100 pieces of ice. Can this be
reassembled into something like a bridge _ I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official put a best-face on a deteriorating situation
that came after so much work. ``It's not entirely pass-fail,'' he
said of Clinton's Middle East negotiations. ``The best thing is to
get an agreement. But we are not going back to where we were.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Albright's emphasis on the shortage of time was prompted by
several factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the belief within the administration that the
longer the two sides remain apart, the harder it becomes to put the
pieces back together.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said that confidence was being lost,
not unlike the drift that occurred after talks between Israel and
Syria ended in Shephardstown, Va., earlier this year and were never
reconvened.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Barak must start to remedy his weak political
situation at home by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli parliament returns to session at the end of October,
and if a peace agreement looks impossible, Barak wants to spend
most of October reconfiguring his government by joining with the
rightist Likud Party and others.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton made conceptual breakthroughs at Camp David,
there was not enough time to delve into the finer details of issues
like religion and national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, this issue may have too far to go _
from 2000 years of history and 52 years of not really coming to
grips with shared aspirations,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle remained the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as
Haram al-Sharif, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been saying since the Camp David talks in July, when
the question of sovereignty over the site was raised, that the
temple does not exist, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   By insisting that what the Jews consider to be the most sacred
of their holy sites was not even a Jewish place, Arafat was denying
a basic respect to his main negotiating partner, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be solved by denying the beliefs of one of the
great religions,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the Temple Mount is the most sacred of all places, the
site, according to Jewish beliefs, of the First and Second Temples
destroyed by the Babylonians and the Romans. Among the Muslims, the
site and its two Muslim shrines, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa,
are among the holiest of all Islamic sites.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak tentatively agreed to the notion that the
Palestinians could be granted religious sovereignty over the mount,
with the Israelis retaining political sovereignty. But after
leaving Camp David, Barak made clear that nothing was agreed to
until every aspect of the peace deal was in place.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the United Nations on Thursday, Barak,
who has come under fire at home for conceding too much at Camp
David, reiterated that Jerusalem and the Temple Mount ``are the
cornerstone of Jewish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Israeli prime minister will ever be able to sign a document
that gives up sovereignty to the Temple Mount to the
Palestinians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak then went on to chide Arafat for his attitude toward the
Temple Mount and toward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the time, the prime minister said, for Arafat ``to
rewrite the history of the three monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very word of Temple Mount tells the real story of Temple
Mount,'' Barak said. When Jesus Christ walked in Jerusalem, Barak
said, he did not see Christian churches or Islamic mosques. ``What
he could see is the Jewish Temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Barak went on to criticize the Palestinian for
inflexibility, saying he was not willing ``to take Clinton's ideas
as the basis of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The fairly harsh words about Arafat appeared to reflect the
Israeli leader's increasing frustration with what he considers the
Palestinian's refusal to seriously negotiate. In private meetings
with American Jews since he has been in the United States, Barak
has said that he cannot give more in negotiations. He has also been
pessimistic about the chances for a peace deal, describing them as
well under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, the administration will keep working at
the issues, senior U.S. officials said. They will try to encourage
Arab leaders to take more initiative in moving Arafat toward a
solution on Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians have been helpful in recent weeks in devising some
ideas, including the notion of ``divine sovereignty'' for the
Temple Mount, meaning that the site belonged to God. But a senior
U.S. official said that the Egyptians and other Arab countries have
only said that they will support Arafat in whatever he chooses to
do. They stopped short of recommending solutions to him, the
official said.

ITALIAN-DUTCH DEAL WILL CREATE INTERNET GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a race to become the America Online of Europe,
Italy's second-largest Internet service provider, Tiscali SpA, said
Thursday that it had agreed to acquire the troubled Dutch Internet
company World Online NV for $5.1 billion in stock. The move
catapults the combined concern into the second-largest Internet
service provider in Europe behind T-Online, a unit of Deutsche
Telekom of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, where the Internet access business
has been mainly dominated by one company, America Online, the
Internet service provider business in Europe is much more
fractured. And for most Internet service providers in Europe,
making money off of providing Internet access has so far proved to
be a difficult task. Most access providers rely on e-commerce and
advertising from their home pages, or portals, to provide the real
revenues, not access charges.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement that Tiscali would acquire World Online
marks the end of protracted negotiations between the two companies
that have lasted for more than two months. World Online had been
seeking a partner since the beginning of the summer as its stock
price has continued to suffer, hovering around 15 euros, or about
one-third of the price of the company's initial public offering in
March. Tiscali's offer of about .44 of its shares for every World
online share, values the acquisition target at about 20 euros, or
about a 27 percent premium over the companys current stock price.
</P>
<P>
   While the combined company will have 3.5 million subscribers, it
remains substantially smaller than T-Online, which has more than 6
million Internet users. Nonetheless, the deal will give the
enlarged Tiscali 1.6 billion euros in cash and a market value of
about 12.5 billion, allowing it to make further acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   For World Online, the deal begins a new chapter in the life of
the Dutch online business that was seemingly scarred back in March
when regulators said they would launch an investigation into the
company's controversial initial public offering. A group of
shareholders plan to sue the company, alleging that World Online's
chairwoman at the time, Nina Brink, acted improperly by not fully
disclosing that she sold her stock before the offering. The value
of the company fell to 3.8 billion euros, down from 12 billion
euros when shares of World Online were first offered to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Brink resigned from World Online on April 14, about a month
after the company went public.
</P>
<P>
   Renato Soru, Tiscali's founder, will be chairman of the combined
company. Jim Kinsella, a former chief executive of MSNBC.com, who
took over World Online when Brink resigned, will be chief executive
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Tiscali was advised by UBS Warburg, NM Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.,
Rothschild Italia SpA and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. Goldman
Sachs International, which helped manage World Online's IPO, and
Merrill Lynch International advised World Online.

SENATE PASSES PIPELINE SAFETY BILL, BUT CRITICS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beating the clock but not every critic, the Senate
Thursday night approved sweeping legislation designed to make
pipelines safer and their corporate parents more accountable to
regulators and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The approval, by unanimous consent, gave Washington state
lawmakers a victory on one of their highest priorities. Even so,
the issue is far from settled. The bill now goes to the House which
has shown less zeal in passing a pipeline safety bill and where
opposition remains strong. That could create a difficult mix in a
Congress that has only 21 working days left.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen complained the bill is too harsh, while
consumer advocates say it doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``we are obviously extremely pleased the Senate has taken
some action,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who is supporting
tougher safety standards than those approved by the Senate. ``They
have moved the ball in the Senate and that's extremely important to
put pressure on the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill had been the subject of furious
behind-the-scenes negotiations for weeks by supporters who were
mindful that if it did not pass this week it would likely get
buried under more pressing legislation. The bill came to the floor
after Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., promised Majority Leader Trent
Lott that it would pass quickly, without debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stemmed from the 1999 gasoline pipeline leak and
explosion in Bellingham, Wash., that killed two 10-year-old boys
and an 18-year man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really pleased. This is a significant step forward,''
said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ``Did we get everything we wanted?
No. You never do in the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill brings much needed reform,'' Gorton said from the
Senate floor. ``It is a marked improvement from the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill would require more frequent and
thorough pipeline inspections, better training for operators and
more timely and detailed information about the location and
condition of pipelines to be given to the public. It also allows
regulators and the courts to impose bigger fines for violations and
calls for more money to be spent developing technology to better
inspect pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   It would give the transportation secretary authority to shut
down a pipeline indefinitely in the event of an ``imminent hazard''
and it lowers the threshold for reporting a pipeline spill from
2,100 gallons to five gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state lawmakers sought those steps in the wake of
last year's accident in Bellingham when a pipeline owned by Olympic
Pipe Line Co. ruptured, dumping 229,000 gallons of gasoline into
Whatcom Creek. A spark touched off a firestorm that killed Wade
King and Stephen Tsiorvas, both 10, and Liam Wood, 18.
</P>
<P>
   The accident stunned the community and prompted Congress to look
seriously at weaknesses in how pipelines are inspected, operated
and regulated. That concern was underscored last month when a
natural gas pipeline in New Mexico exploded, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Murray reminded her colleagues of that ``much darker day'' in
Bellingham in a speech just before the bill passed. ``For too long,
communities across the country in tragedy after tragedy have felt
the impact of our nation's inadequate pipeline safety standards.
Today, the Senate has responded with a strong bill that will help
make pipelines safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the step forward, critics remain. Industry lobbyists
argue that the bill goes too far and the cost of complying with the
new requirements will be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate bill is a tough bill and there's a lot of stuff in
there we're not fond of,'' said Gay Friedman, senior vice president
for legislative affairs for the Interstate Natural Gas Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest objections is a whistle-blower provision and
another that calls for the creation of a citizen advisory committee
similar to the one Washington Gov. Gary Locke is assembling.
</P>
<P>
   Such committees, said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the
Association of Oil Pipelines, a trade group, will require the
industry to spend considerable time educating the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have do a lot more to explain ourselves to a
lot more people'' he said. ``We're not going to get away with
simply putting out a glossy press release.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never been a fan of these citizen advisory
committees,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   One the other hand, some safety advocates said the bill wasn't
tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vitally important we pass a bill with teeth. We would be
doing a grave disservice to the men, women and children who have
lost their lives in pipeline accidents if all that came out of
their deaths was a weak piece of political posturing,'' said Rep.
Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., whose district includes Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Dalen, the mother of Stephen Tsiorvas, said she would
have liked a stronger bill, likening negotiations to a parent who
has to deal with an ``errant'' child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ask the child, what do you want?'' she said in an
interview. ``You put your foot down. We need to put our foot down
because, like an errant child, the oil and natural gas industry is
going to try to pull in as many dollars as they can with as little
legislation as possible tying their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all hoping the House strengthens the bill, pays
attention to what I believe is a rising consciousness among their
constituents. I don't understand what the hangup is. Obviously,
something powerful must be done or more will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank King, whose son, Wade, was killing in the Bellingham
fireball, was more emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I would like better than to have my quiet,
happy, rather apathetic life back,'' he said. ``I don't have that.
Right now, to the Senate, my son is a statistic. I'm not going to
allow Wade King, Stephen Tsiorvas and Liam Wood to be just a
statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely disappointed in the bill.''

LINK BETWEEN TIRES AND CRASHES WENT UNDETECTED IN FEDERAL DATA

 By MATTHEW L. WALD with JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Statistics from a widely used federal database show
that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were almost three times
as likely to be tire-related than fatal crashes involving other
sport utility vehicles. But Ford, Firestone and federal safety
regulators said this week they never detected the pattern in the
data, which might have provided an early warning of problems with
Firestone's tires for sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy surfaced in an analysis by The New York Times of
data from the Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis
Reporting System. It showed that from 1995 through 1998, the most
recent year available, fatal crashes involving Explorers were 2.8
times more likely to list tires as a contributing factor than those
involving other SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony on Wednesday, the two companies and
officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said that they looked at a variety of databases without spotting
the tire flaw now blamed for 88 deaths in rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone documents obtained by congressional investigators,
meanwhile, show that officials of the tire maker were briefed as
early as February about rising warranty costs for the tires that
Firestone recalled last month. Company executives had testified
Wednesday that Firestone's data on warranty claims did not show a
problem with the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive, testified
late Wednesday night at a House subcommittee hearing that even
after replacing Firestone tires in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and
Venezuela, Ford held off taking action in the United States last
year because its review of various databases assured the company _
wrongly, as it turned out _ that there was not a problem here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a data-driven company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., what information the
company had to support its actions overseas, Nasser replied:
``Anecdotal data.'' He added, ``There is no data in those
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it also looked through its data on consumer complaints
to the company itself and its dealers. But the number of complaints
was low, rising to a peak of 10 in 1998. Company officials said
that since Ford routinely directs its customers with tire problems
to the tire manufacturers, the small numbers were not surprising.
Nasser said Ford planned to work more closely with the tire
industry to detect problems earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation database is one of the few
tools by which the government can independently track defects that
cause fatal accidents. With its budget tightened, the highway
safety agency over the years has pulled back from collecting
anecdotal evidence from garages and body shops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet patterns in the government data are not always obvious. The
Fatality Analysis Reporting System records approximately 40,000
deaths a year, and, as various witnesses pointed out in this week's
hearings, the simple fact that people die in accidents where tires
may be a factor is not noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bailey, the administrator of the highway safety agency,
said, for example, that if the database showed a single seat belt
failure, her agency would immediately launch an investigation,
because seat belts are expected never to fail. But, she said,
``tires do fail; if you run your tires for 40,000 miles, there's a
certain expected failure rate.''
</P>
<P>
   And until the recall of 15-inch Firestone ATX, ATX II and
certain Wilderness AT tires was announced early last month, she
noted, the agency had received only about five complaints a year
about the tires out of 50,000 complaints of all kinds about
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the discrepancy between tire-related fatalities
involving Explorers and those involving other sport utility
vehicles ``cracked the code,'' said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of
safety data analysis, after being told of The Times' findings.
</P>
<P>
   But examining the data without a clear idea of what it contains
is much harder than finding clues once a problem is known.
</P>
<P>
   There were just 35 tire-related fatal crashes involving
Explorers over the 1995-98 period, as counted by The Times. Grush
pointed out that compared with the total number of miles driven by
Explorers by the end of 1998, about 120 billion, the number is
deaths is extremely small, he said _ about 0.03 per hundred million
miles of travel.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it a small fraction of the deaths in Explorers due to
rollovers _ about 0.6 per hundred million miles. It is a smaller
fraction yet of all fatalities in Explorers _ about 1 per hundred
million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the limitations of the federal database, Grush and others
noted, is that it records only vehicle type, not tire type. The
data points to a problem with Firestone tires only because the vast
majority of new Explorers were equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Further supporting the conclusion is an analysis by the Times of
the federal data on tire-related deaths in Explorers produced in
1996 and 1997. Explorers built at Ford's Louisville plant were
equipped with Goodyear tires in 1996 and Firestones the next year.
Ford's St. Louis plant did the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality database shows that Ford found that there were nine
fatal accidents involving Explorers from the plants using Firestone
tires and one from the plants using Goodyear tires. An analysis by
Ford confirmed these findings.
</P>
<P>
   The federal data shows no tire-related fatalities involving
Explorers from 1991 to 1993 and a steadily increasing number
thereafter, which may reflect that tread separation problems become
more common as tires age. The Explorer was introduced at the end of
1990, as a 1991 model.
</P>
<P>
   For the years 1995 through 1998, the federal database shows,
there were 17.8 tire-related fatal accidents for every 1,000 such
accidents involving Explorers. For all other sport utility
vehicles, there were 6.4 tire-related fatal accidents per 1,000
accidents; the number for cars was 6.0 tire-related fatal
accidents.

   Safety experts lament that there is only limited data on a body
of crashes probably six to eight times larger than those tracked by
the Department of Transportation _ those that cause injuries but no
deaths. A yet larger category is crashes with property damage but
no injury. Trends could be obvious sooner by using larger
databases, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatals are investigated very thoroughly,'' said Stephanie
Faul, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association
Foundation for Traffic Safety. ``Property damage crashes are hardly
investigated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One source for such data is insurance companies. State Farm, the
nation's largest automobile insurer, contacted the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration several times last year about tire
failures, according to Samuel Boyden, the company's associate
research director, who testified at Wednesday's House hearing. But
the agency did not follow up on the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep.Billy Tauzin, R-La., who presided at the hearing, suggested
that the government agency should make better use of insurance
data. &QL;

   DISPOSABLE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   American Express said that within a month it would begin
offering a free service that will generate random numbers that can
be used instead of account numbers for cardholders making online
purchases. A cardholder would be able to obtain a ``private payment
number'' that could be used at any site that accepts American
Express cards. To save a few clicks, cardholders would be able to
download software from the company's Web site that would
automatically produce a payment number for purchases at selected

   ONLINE HOUSEHOLDS APPROACH 300 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   More than 295 million people in 20 countries around the world
have Internet access from a residential personal computer,
according to findings from a new Nielsen/NetRatings global Internet
trends service. In 14 European markets, an estimated 82 million
people have access to the Internet from a home PC. David Day,
director for analytics at ACNielsen eRatings.com, said the figure
equated to one household in five, and noted that 22 percent of
European households had access via more than one source. In four
leading Asia- Pacific markets, an estimated 37 million people have
access to the Internet from a home personal computer. &QL;

   HARDWARE CHIP MAKER'S PROFIT RISES
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor reported fiscal first-quarter earnings
Thursday that handily exceeded analysts' estimates. For the quarter
ended Aug. 27, National had earnings of $144.2 million, or 74 cents
a diluted share, more than tripling the $47.1 million, or 25 cents
a share, it reported in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 33
percent, to $640.8 million. Excluding one-time items, National had
earnings of $149.4 million, or 76 cents a diluted share. Analysts
had expected the company to earn 65 cents a share on the same
basis. Its shares rose $2.13, to $47.13. National's strong results
partly reflect its exit last year from the personal computer
microprocessor business, but they also reflect the large portion of
revenue that comes from analog semiconductors, which are used in
cellular telephones and other hand-held devices.

   SONY SAYS CHIP WILL ADD BATTERY LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta, the upstart chip maker, will announce its first major
design victory Friday when Sony plans to bring out a new version of
its 2.2-pound Vaio C1VN PictureBook Computer. The machine will use
a 600-megahertz Transmeta microprocessor and will be priced at
$2,299.99. Sony executives said the Transmeta chip would roughly
double the battery life of the system, now ranging up to 5.5 hours.
Earlier this year, Transmeta announced several Intel-compatible
microprocessors designed to consume less power than comparable
Intel chips. Since then, Intel has responded with its own low-power
microprocessors.

   IBM EXPANDING VENTURE WITH RETEK
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Retek, a maker of software for the retail sales
industry, surged Thursday after IBM said it would take an
undisclosed equity stake in the company. Retek shares gained $9.25,
or 29 percent, to $41.38. The alliance, begun in March, originally
called for software, hardware and services to aid e-commerce in the
food and drug segment of the retail industry. Under its new terms,
it will be expanded to other segments and IBM will quintuple, to
300 from 60, the number of professional staff members devoted to
it.

ADVERTISING: GIANTS VIE AS DAIMLERCHRYSLER CONDUCTS ASSIGNMENT
REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle lines are already being drawn in one of
the biggest confrontations in Madison Avenue history.
</P>
<P>
   Two giant agency companies _ Omnicom Group and True North
Communications _ are squaring off in a huge review unexpectedly
called by a major client they share, the DaimlerChrysler Group unit
of DaimlerChrysler AG. The company is undertaking a review for
assignments with spending estimated at $1.3 billion, out of a total
spent last year of $1.5 billion. The work is now divided between
the Southfield, Mich., offices of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom,
and FCB Worldwide, part of True North.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives representing both sides of what is already being
called the shootout in Southfield have taken the unusual step of
issuing statements that aggressively welcomed the review; each
confidently predicted his side would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us will be right,'' said Allen Rosenshine, chairman and
chief executive at BBDO Worldwide in New York. Asked in what his
optimism about BBDO's chances was rooted, he replied, ``In
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   His competitor, David Bell, chairman and chief executive at True
North in Chicago, said: ``This is an opportunity for us to take
them out, and that's exactly how we're approaching it. What we will
be doing is what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The review, which is likely to end with the DaimlerChrysler
Group assignments for creative and media duties consolidated at a
single shop, is indicative of the ferment roiling agencies as
restless clients seek more efficient and effective campaigns.
Indeed, Omnicom and True North figured in other big decisions
yesterday involving another blue-chip advertiser, the Kraft Foods
unit of Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a merger of the magnitude of the one that created
DaimlerChrysler takes place,'' Rosenshine said, referring to the
acquisition by Daimler-Benz of Chrysler Corp., which now operates
under the DaimlerChrysler Group name, ``it is not a shock to us''
that the merged company would intensify efforts ``to provide cost
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Rosenshine and Bell did not prevent a decline in
the prices of shares of Omnicom and True North traded Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange. True North's tumble was steeper, down
14.8 percent, or $6.50, to $37.50 versus 2.1 percent, or $1.75, to
$80, for Omnicom. Analysts who follow agency industry stocks
attributed that disparate performance to the fact that almost all
the True North DaimlerChrysler accounts are part of the review,
compared with fewer of Omnicom's.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts lowered their ratings of True North stock as a
result of the review. They said a larger percentage of total True
North revenue compared with Omnicom comes from the assignments in
review, about 9 percent versus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If True North lost the $140 million in annual revenue from the
automaker, it ``could wipe out most of the company's organic growth
for one year,'' said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in New York who reduced his rating of True
North to neutral from strong buy. (He maintained a strong buy on
Omnicom.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosenshine said ``it's fair to say'' on a total percentage basis
that ``True North has `more to lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would classify the stock market reaction as unusually
rational,'' he added, chuckling. ``Not exuberant, but rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, for his part, said: ``We are very confident. We think we
bring an enormous amount of weight to tilt the scale in our favor
before the shootout.'' A decision is expected in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began late Wednesday afternoon when the
DaimlerChrysler Group announced the review, which involves the
assignments to create national and regional-dealer general market
campaigns for the cars, trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles
sold under the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand names as well as the
DaimlerChrysler Group corporate image account.
</P>
<P>
   The BBDO Southfield office handles the Dodge work, with spending
last year of $651.9 million, according to Competitive Media
Reporting in New York, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. The FCB
Southfield office handles the rest of the assignments, which
include Chrysler, $251.9 million; Jeep, $277.2 million; and
corporate, $67.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the review are the media planning and buying
duties now consolidated at a BBDO sibling, PentaCom in Troy, Mich.
If FCB was to best BBDO, those duties would presumably be shifted
to an FCB operation now dedicated to international media buying for
DaimlerChrysler, called the DaimlerChrysler Media Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Media Alliance could take over PentaCom, just as in 1993
a FCB predecessor, Bozell Worldwide, took over the Jeep creative
assignment from the Southfield office of Campbell Mithun.
</P>
<P>
   Excluded from the review are assignments handled by Omnicom
agencies like the creative duties for Mercedes-Benz, at Merkley
Newman Harty in New York, with spending estimated at $115.1
million, and so-called customer relationship management programs,
at InterOne Marketing in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting spirits at True North as the shootout began was word
that Kraft had shifted the creative duties for Jell-O gelatin,
pudding and snacks to the New York office of FCB from the New York
office of Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising. Spending last year was
estimated at $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   FCB adds Jell-O to Kraft creative assignments that include Cool
Whip, DiGiorno Pizza and Kraft macaroni and cheese dinners. Y&AMP;R
Advertising, which keeps Kraft creative tasks for brands like
Crystal Light soft drink mix and Toblerone chocolate, had created
Jell-O campaigns since 1926. The agency developed Jell-O's
sponsorships of radio and television series like ``The Jack Benny
Program'' and ``The Aldrich Family,'' hired endorsers like Bill
Cosby and created the familiar ``J-E-L-L-O'' jingle and slogans
like ``There's always room for Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no more room for Jell-O at Y&AMP;R Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Kraft confirmed reports in Advertising Age and
Adweek that it would review its media planning and buying
assignments in the United States and Canada, to consolidate those
tasks for brands with spending estimated at $800 million. Those
assignments are now divided among the media agencies allied with
the Kraft creative agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Knuth, a Kraft spokeswoman in Northfield, Ill., identified
the participants as: MindShare, part of the WPP Group; Optimum
Media Direction, part of Omnicom; the Starcom MediaVest Group, part
of the B Com3 Group; and TN Media, part of True North.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its goals of ``operational efficiencies'' and ``a
quicker, more nimble response to marketplace opportunities,'' she
said, Kraft may consolidate the duties at one shop.

BUSH SUGGESTS WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ON DEBATE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid Republican concerns that he needs to end the
debate over debates, Gov. George W. Bush and several of his
advisers sent signals Thursday that they were willing to be
flexible about the original position that they had outlined and
that Vice President Al Gore had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been seeking to cast that rejection as a referendum on
Gore's credibility, asserting that the vice president was breaking
a promise to debate anytime and anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But a few of Bush's advisers conceded Thursday that Bush had not
made significant inroads with that argument, which the campaign
made the centerpiece of a television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor hinted that he was ready to break the
stalemate, a step that many Republican officials have described as
a necessary part of putting his campaign back on a better track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident there will be debates,'' Bush said in Detroit
Thursday morning. ``As to what they look like and where they are,
it will be worked out in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, ``You cannot run for the presidency without
presidential debates.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference to uncertainty over the details and formats of the
debates suggested an inclination to negotiate, as did the later
remarks of one of his campaign aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on the table,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, Bush agreed to just one of three 90-minute
debates that were proposed by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates and guaranteed to be broadcast by all the
major networks. Gore previously agreed to all three.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he also wanted to do two 60-minute debates
sponsored by individual networks, an arrangement that would almost
certainly shrink the television audience. He called for the first
of those debates to take place next Tuesday, in Washington, on a
special weeknight edition of the NBC news program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, several advisers said that the Bush campaign was
considering whether to agree to a second commission debate if Gore
would agree to the 60-minute network debates. The latter would have
the kind of less formal setting in which Bush and his aides feel he
shines, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's advisers and officials with the debate commission
said late Thursday that they had not received any word from the
Bush campaign that it was prepared to negotiate along these lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ``The
governor has made no decisions on what he'll do. He's still going
to hold Al Gore's feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was referring to Bush's tentative plans to travel on
Tuesday to Washington for the debate on ``Meet the Press.'' But
Gore has said he will not be there, and NBC has said it will not
air a show without both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, Gore had said he would debate Bush on
the program, but that was before Bush had rejected two of the three
commission debates. Gore's current position is that other debates
should be added to _ not substituted for _ the commission's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's advisers said that the signs that the Bush
campaign might move from its original position reflected ``the
realization that people didn't buy their debate strategy that Gore
was hiding from debates. It was a ludicrous argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser, however, said that Bush was always prepared to
move from his initial position, which reflected his preferences but
was largely the opening bid in an inevitable poker game.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Critics of global warming treaty see hopeless battle for
ratification
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BILL DAWSON and TODD ACKERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A day after President Clinton's top science adviser
expressed hope that a political consensus might be achievable on
global warming, two prominent critics threw cold water on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Nebraska, and former U.S. diplomat
Richard R. Burt told a Rice University audience Thursday that a
worldwide treaty to reduce pollutants blamed for global warming
still faces an insurmountable battle in the Senate. Hagel had been
one of the treaty's most vocal critics when the world's nations
signed it in Kyoto, Japan nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and vice president have refused to send (the
treaty) to the Senate for ratification because they know it has
little support and would be overwhelmingly rejected,'' Hagel said
via teleconference at Rice's James A. Baker III Institute for
Public Policy. ``There are not now, nor do I anticipate there
being, 67 votes in the U.S. Senate to approve the ratification of
the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt, who was ambassador to Germany in the Reagan
administration, earlier in the day also said the treaty, the Kyoto
Accord, remains too flawed to win ratification. A worldwide
conference to finalize the accord is scheduled for November in the
Netherlands, but even if the world's nations there agree on a plan,
it would still have to be adopted by individual governments.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Lane, director of the Clinton administration's Office of
Science and Technology Policy, said Wednesday at Rice that he has
detected ``real movement'' among previously skeptical congressmen
that global warming poses a ``real threat'' to the future. Still,
Lane said he knew of no plans by the administration to submit the
plan for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The accord would require the United States to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-2012, a reduction
that Hagel said would cause catastrophic consequences to the U.S.
economy. Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush opposes
the treaty for that reason; Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore traveled to Kyoto in 1997 to help negotiate the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If Hagel and Burt remained skeptical about global warming, some
others at the Baker Institute conference did not. During a panel
discussion, a Texas A&AMP;M University researcher said his recent study
of temperature changes during the past 1,000 years has convinced
him that human-caused global warming is already occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Crowley, an oceanography professor who specializes in
research on climate conditions of the past, said he was surprised
by the result of this study, which was published in July in the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Crowley said, his analysis of temperature changes
in the Northern Hemisphere during the last millennium provides ``a
compelling indication'' that natural variation accounts for only a
small part of the warming trend observed in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   This recent warming can only be explained as a result of
humanity's increasing introduction of ``greenhouse gases'' to the
atmosphere, he said. The principal gas is carbon dioxide, which is
emitted during the burning of fossil fuels and also increases as a
result of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   Using evidence from indicators of past climate conditions,
including ice cores and tree rings, Crowley reached two basic
conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   First, the warming of the past century was unprecedented in the
past 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a climate model featuring two natural climate influences
_ fluctuations in volcanic activity and solar radiation _ explains
much of the temperature variation between the years 1000 and 1850,
but only about 25 percent of the temperature increase of the last
100 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the same temperature increase continues with a
``business-as-usual'' introduction of more ``greenhouse gases'' to
the atmosphere, the earth will be as warm by the late 21st century
as it was at any time in the last 400,000 years, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Burt said the Kyoto treaty has numerous problems,
including the absence of mechanisms to ensure compliance. A chief
negotiator in strategic arms reductions talks with the former
Soviet Union, Burt said a similar lack of mechanism would be
regarded as ``fatal'' to an arms-control pact.
</P>
<P>
   International agencies don't have the ability to carry out the
climate accord effectively, he said. Even if they could do so, he
charged, many in the United States would resent giving up national
authority to these world organizations.
</P>
<P>
   According to a conference biography, Burt has been ``involved in
several diverse, international business corporations'' for the past
10 years, including steel manufacturing, newspapers and information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the Rice conference include two utility companies,
Carolina Power and Light Service and Southern Company Services, and
ExxonMobil. Before merging to become the world's largest oil
company, both Exxon and Mobil challenged scientific findings
underlying concerns about global warming and disputed the need for
mandates like those in the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse
emissions.

 &HT;    Death and dying draws media attention
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Adventure lover Roxann Starr of Austin is
planning her next trip. When she gets there, she'll be doing back
flips and cartwheels. She'll dance and sing. Her body, she says,
will soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be totally amazing and incredible,''
Starr said. ``It's going to be a hundred times better than the best
sex I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, 41, laughs with no trace of irony. Her friends guffaw.
She is talking about her death, and she is doing it with the same
irreverent humor that has defined her life. Starr is looking
forward to leaving a body imprisoned by ALS _ amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Since her terminal diagnosis in 1997, she has had the time to
plan a death that matches the way she has lived: joyful, fearless,
surrounded by the people she loves. How we die in America _ a topic
most people avoid _ is starting to get attention. It will be
explored in a public TV series that starts Sunday. The program
already has triggered elaborate plans to hold death and dying
discussions in communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to die with little or no pain because she is
in hospice, a program that treats the terminally ill with narcotics
and provides nurses to keep patients in their homes. Hospice may
not be for everyone, but more people are choosing it, and more
people will hear about it soon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization reports
that hospice programs served at least 700,000 patients last year,
up from 540,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will have ``a good death,'' a term gaining currency as
more people question whether they want to spend their last days in
a hospital, tethered to machines, using technology to the utmost.
</P>
<P>
   When surveyed, most Americans say they don't want a high-tech
death; they want to die at home with loved ones nearby. But the
vast majority die in a hospital, often unconscious and alone, said
Chuck Meyer, chaplain and vice president for operations at St.
David's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and others think the country is ready for a dialogue on
death and dying. Broadcast journalist Bill Moyers is launching the
discussion with a four-part PBS series that starts Sunday, ``On Our
Own Terms: Moyers on Dying.''
</P>
<P>
   In Central Texas, the Capital Area Partnership for End-of-Life
Care is among the hundreds of groups that have formed to continue
the discussion. The local coalition, which includes medical
professionals, state agency personnel and public television
representatives, has published a resource guide on end-of-life care
and and has organized panel discussions, broadcast programs and a
public forum on death and dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really hungry to talk,'' Meyer said. ``Scratch
anyone within five feet of you, and they are dealing with somebody
who has a terminal or irreversible condition.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should have to call on a Dr. Jack Kervorkian to help them
die, said Meyer, author of ``A Good Death: Challenges, Choices and
Care Options.''
</P>
<P>
   But even doctors are uncomfortable talking about death, and many
resist referring patients to a hospice, said Dr. Leigh Fredholm,
medical director of Hospice Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an artificial perception that when you admit your
patient to a hospice that's it. You can't do anything else,''
Fredholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Parkinson, 79, of Georgetown, Texas, said he is at peace
staying at home with his oxygen bottle and wheelchair. Tended by
his wife, Ann, and Hospice Austin nurses, Parkinson is dying of
heart disease but says he is ``very content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The love, care and consideration of these Hospice people is
absolutely incredible,'' he said. ``I dearly love all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   What can he do to pay them back? he asked an agency
representative visiting his home last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like Starr, Parkinson _ a retired textbook publisher and a jazz
trumpet player who won a contest in high school to play with Tommy
Dorsey _ is spiritual and has maintained his sense of humor. He is
not afraid of dying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my grandkids. I know my own kids, and they love me,''
he said. ``What more do I want?''
</P>
<P>
   But like many who face death, he is worried about his family. He
suspects his wife of 55 years, three children and four
grandchildren ``won't much like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No I won't,'' Ann said, her dark blue eyes shining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss her,'' he said, turning toward Ann. ``I'll
think of you all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had a choice, he'd be well and dining at a favorite New
York-style deli that never closes. But he is old now, he said, and
everyone has to die.
</P>
<P>
   Like Starr, he believes in an afterlife and imagines a reunion
with loved ones, including a brother who died years ago. He wants
to hang out with jazz musician Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep having fantasies that I'm going to room with the
pope,'' said Parkinson, who is a Presbyterian. ``Then he could get
rid of all those idiotic people standing around in knight's
uniforms. He's a man. He's a humble human being, and I'd like to
chat with him. He's inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson said he hopes to be around for his 80th birthday in
November ``for bragging purposes,'' but no one knows how much time
he has. Hospice patients are admitted to the program when their
prognosis is six months.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been living at Hospice Austin's Christopher House for
two months _ ever since she needed care 24 hours a day. ALS has
taken over her body. It attacks the motor neurons and leaves people
unable to move, and ultimately, unable to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Starr doesn't leave her bed anymore. She couldn't without being
lifted. With her hair dyed a maroon-red and her limbs limp, Starr
has nicknamed herself ``Raggedy Ann with an attitude.'' She
entertains a parade of friends, and their laughter brightens the
halls of Christopher House.
</P>
<P>
   Her close friend Robbie Billig, a nurse, always comes on
Wednesdays. She banters with Starr non-stop and talks about the
good times they've shared.
</P>
<P>
   Starr recounts hiking and beach trips to Mexico. In college, she
studied geology, but didn't graduate. She worked a variety of jobs,
from waiting tables to cleaning houses to proofreading legislation.
She'd save her money and then travel some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disease certainly changes the way I live my life,'' Starr
said, unable to speak as fast as she would like. ``But I'm not my
disease . . . I decided I needed to keep living as I've been living
_ sucking all the joy and fun out of life as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a hard time surrendering her independence and asking
others for help. But she has accepted that, too, she said, with
help from the Christopher House staff who are ``so open, easy going
and loving.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Billig recounted a trip they took in February to the
Grand Canyon _ one of Starr's favorite places _ with Starr's
wheelchair and bedside commode in tow. The van broke down, though,
and they only made it as far as Santa Fe. They shopped and feasted
for nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last trip,'' Billig said.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr isn't quite done. She's got plans for one more.

 &HT;    Battle rages on between Hingis and Williams
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What if they were friends?
</P>
<P>
   What if this Gucci girl and that girl whose favorite places to
visit are anywhere that accepts credit cards were shopping buddies?
</P>
<P>
   What if the white woman from Switzerland and the black woman
from California discovered a bond transcending race?
</P>
<P>
   What if these two young women, separated by birth 20 years ago
by little more than a hundred days, found a common ground instead
of professional tennis' killing ground?
</P>
<P>
   What if today's women's U.S. Open semifinal match between
top-seeded Martina Hingis and third-seeded Venus Williams at the
National Tennis Center was rooted in admiration instead of
loathing?
</P>
<P>
   What if?
</P>
<P>
   A thousand what-ifs wouldn't matter now, because the animosity
between Hingis and Williams _ also involving Williams' younger
sister, Serena _ has escalated to the point that the heads of state
gathered nearby at the U.N. likely couldn't broker a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The competitve history between Hingis and VWilliams going into
today's match is remarkable for its depth considering the age of
the players. Williams turned 20 three months ago; Hingis will
celebrate her 20th birthday in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But already they have played against each other 15 times with
Hingis holding a 9-6 edge. The first of those meetings was early in
the 1997 Lipton, which Hingis won. The most recent was Williams'
victory in the Wimbledon quarterfinals earlier this summer on the
way to her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has five Grand Slam championships, but none since winning
the Australian Open to start 1999. The emergence of the Williams
sisters as viable contenders for Grand Slam titles (Serena won last
year's U.S. Open) is regarded as more than coincidence in
consideration of Hingis' fade.
</P>
<P>
   Which goes a long way toward explaining what Hingis said to
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport before Davenport's quarterfinal
match Wednesday night against Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started last year (at the U.S. Open),'' Davenport said,
``because I played the first semifinal against Serena and she
played Venus. She's like, 'Well, you better, you know, win.' I
lost. I saw her in the locker room and she was shaking her head at
me right before she played.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis then beat Venus in the other semifinal before losing in
the championship to Serena.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Hingis and Davenport _ with Hingis already through
to today's showdown semifinal with Venus and Davenport preparing
for Wednesday night's quarterfinal with Serena _ talked about
stopping the Williamses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Davenport said, ``she said, 'You're first again.'
I think she feels like she sides with me against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should just tag-team wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the backdrop for the third Hingis vs. Venus meeting at a
U.S. Open in the past four years. Hingis won in straight sets in
the 1997 final and in three sets last year in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more intrigue was added Thursday when Serena, scheduled to
play a women's doubles semifinal with her sister, withdrew with an
inflammation of the small sesmoid bone at the joint of the big toe
on her left foot. It has been a long-term problem, but not one that
appeared to bother her Wednesday night. Nor is it likely to keep
her from representing the U.S. in the upcoming Olympics in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists, of course, suggest the reason for the
withdrawal was to benefit Venus by keeping her from having to play
on a day off from singles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams professes to be unaware of the madness surrounding the
encounter. She chooses only to ``believe in my game'' instead of
creating a ``real problem'' worrying about someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best competitor will win,'' she said. ``If you start
taking it too seriously, that's when it gets to be pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Richard, allowed how he actually thought it ``a good
idea'' for Hingis and Davenport _ sisters in arms, if not blood _
to consort with each other and even strategize against his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is obviously weary of the attention given the Williamses
_ ``Nothing surprises me anymore,'' she said _ and would like
nothing better than to beat Venus, who has won three times in their
past four encounters, to end her rival's current 24-match winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   What if that happens?
</P>
<P>
   What if it doesn't?

 &HT;    'The Throwin' Samoan' continues family tradition
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Marques Tuiasosopo has never set foot in
American Samoa, the small South Pacific island 6,000 miles from
Seattle where his family name is royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to,'' said the senior quarterback for the University of
Washington, which plays Miami on Saturday at Husky Stadium. ``It's
pretty expensive. I'll have to save up some money.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't have to wait long, probably after he signs an NFL
contract.
</P>
<P>
   When he does arrive, he may get a reception fit for a king _ and
not just because of his grandfather, one of 200 Tuiasosopos on the
island but one of six living men to hold the rank of High Talking
Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 family members to play collegiate and professional
sports, Marques might rank as the best. That's because of
versatility that enabled him to pass and run his way to a
school-record 2,723 yards last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marques is an inspiration for young Samoan kids,'' said Jack
Thompson, one of the first quarterbacks to come from the
77-square-mile island known for producing linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``The Throwin' Samoan,'' Thompson, a Washington State
standout in the late '70s, remembers the hits he took from Marques'
father, Manu Tuiasosopo, a UCLA defensive lineman who played for
the Seahawks and 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   When Thompson watches Marques _ who at 6-feet-2 and 220 pounds
is considered small for a Samoan football product _ he knows, ``I
won't have to sue him for copyright infringement. He's going to
have several names because he can run, he can throw, he can
scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   His showcase game came against Stanford last year when he rushed
for 207 yards and passed for 302, becoming the first quarterback in
NCAA history to eclipse 200 yards rushing and 300 yards passing in
a single game.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an injury, Marques will become the Huskies' all-time
total offense leader this season, eclipsing names like Damon Huard
and Mark Brunell and Warren Moon in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Washington is expected to dominate the Pac-10 using an
option-based offense led by Marques, a former baseball prospect
from Woodinville, Wash., who was drafted by the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so multi-dimensional,'' said Washington quarterbacks
coach Steve Axman, who coached Troy Aikman at UCLA. ``Most option
quarterbacks can't throw the ball very well. But he can throw the
ball and run the option.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said one of Marques' strength is his ability to read
the defense during a play and quickly adapt Washington's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Hurricanes fan, I would watch how he is,''
Thompson said. ``As Marques goes, the team will go. He is the heart
and soul of that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Marques credits his prowess to his father, who instilled an
athletic work ethic that mirrors the values of Samoan culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad played the game for 20 years. Football was something I
was raised with. It's the ultimate team sport. You get a chance to
play with the 49ers in the Super Bowl, that's where he learned a
lot of about his principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Manu's principles include the family of five children he raised
with wife Tina, who is white and of Polish and German descent.
That's why Marques said his father, who could not be reached for
this story, will not return to Samoa to abide by Chief Asovalu
Tuiasosopo's wishes to assume the family title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably slim to none,'' Marques said. ``He's pretty set
over here. He was born here and lived his whole life here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marques embraces both sides of his heritage, he is
especially proud of his Samoan roots. ``He always says to me, 'If I
go over there, I'll find 300 Tuiasosopos in our village,' '' Axman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuiasosopos' football legacy dates back to the 1950s with
uncle Johnny Olszewski, a running back who played 10 years in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's part of me,'' Marques said. ``I take a
lot of pride when I go out and play and work hard. It's passed down
from generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The current generation includes younger brother Zach, a Husky
teammate, sister Leslie, who played volleyball at UW, and cousin
Naomi Mulitauaopele, who plays for the WNBA's Utah Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the best athlete in the family, Marques said
without hesitation: ``My little brother Matt. He's as tall as I am
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Tuiasosopo, 14, plays baseball, basketball and football. In
1998, he led the Woodinville baseball team to within one out of
advancing to the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Matt plays shortstop and pitcher, which is why Thompson says the
14-year-old Tuiasosopo might be the next Throwin' Samoan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to umpire one his games behind the plate,'' Thompson
said with a laugh. ``I was telling the catcher, 'Son, you better
catch every ball. I don't want any missed balls.' ''

 &HT;    SEC streak still intact for S.C.
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ South Carolina coach Lou Holtz says he had an
Internet Web site long before he knew how to turn on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Until last weekend, however, putting together three ``W's'' _ as
in www. _ seemed unlikely at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, in his second season with the Gamecocks, is trying to
keep his team's fans realistic. But he might be fighting a losing
battle. Fans in Columbia have renewed optimism after the Gamecocks
ended their 21-game losing streak with a 31-0 opening victory over
New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a question on my Web site this week: `Do you think
we can go to a bowl game this year?' '' Holtz said. ``You make a
first down and the fans automatically think that you're a great
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks, who host No. 9-ranked Georgia Saturday in the SEC
opener for both teams, are by no means great. But this year's
edition is certainly better than last year's 0-11 squad, which
ranked last in the nation in both scoring and total offense.
</P>
<P>
   The offense showed dramatic improve- ment against the lowly
Aggies by gaining 353 yards in offense and scoring four touchdowns.
Last season, the Gamecocks gained 300 yards only once and didn't
score their fourth touchdown until the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a football team that has really started to make
improvements,'' Holtz said. ``We're not a good football team by any
stretch of imagination, but I think we have the focus of just
trying to get better. Nobody mentions our losing streak now. . . .
Fortunately, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, the former Notre Dame coach who was lured out of
retirement in December 1998, said the biggest challenge was
convincing his players they could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offseason, we put the past behind us,'' he said. ``The
past is dead, and what's dead should be buried, so we buried that.
I thought everybody got fired up to play us when we were at Notre
Dame. But they really got fired up to play South Carolina once we
had that losing streak. Nobody wanted to be the team that lost to
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia doesn't want to become the first SEC team to lose to the
Gamecocks in 19 games. South Carolina hasn't beaten a conference
opponent since a 35-3 victory over Vanderbilt on Oct. 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since that losing streak persists, South Carolina's players
aren't celebrating their first victory in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys aren't talking about New Mexico State too much,''
Gamecocks linebacker Andre Offing said. ``That was the past. We've
got more to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Snapping a three-game losing streak to Georgia would earn South
Carolina a lot of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a longer winning streak than half the teams in the
country,'' Holtz said, ``but nobody writes about that.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore may be trying to
distance himself from President Clinton, but he is making no
attempt to escape from the Clinton Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vice president is relying more and more these days
on the expertise, advice and support of a gallery of members and
former members of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was this more evident than in Cleveland on Wednesday,
when Gore delivered a major speech laying out his vision of the
economy for the next decade. At his side was Robert Rubin, who, as
Clinton's former Treasury secretary and one of the people who is
felt to have madea significant contribution toward the current
prosperity, is regarded as the administration's economic superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin provided not only his presence and reputation to vouch for
Gore's ability to keep the economy sound. He helped put in place
the fundamental principles _ chiefly, paying down the debt and
heeding the bond market _ that underpin Gore's own economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was not the only Clinton appointee helping Gore with his
economic blueprint. The list of brainstormers reads like a who's
who of the Clinton administration's economic elite _ Lawrence
Summers, the current Treasury secretary, Erskine Bowles, Clinton's
former chief of staff, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairwoman of
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, and Gene Sperling, the
president's top in-house economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which Clinton appointees are campaigning on behalf
of the vice president is unusual and reflects the confluence of
several factors: Clinton's serious investment in getting Gore
elected; Gore's need to have people with policy expertise and
marquee names vouching for his participation in important decisions
within the Clinton administration; the desire by the Cabinet
members themselves to use to the fullest their waning months in the
limelight and, perhaps for some, a desire to improve their chances
of appointments in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal about Cabinet officers electioneering.
The Hatch Act prevents government employees from spending official
time on political work, but presidential appointees are exempt from
that restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Having Cabinet-level experts at a candidate's disposal is an
enormous advantage of incumbency, and Gore has not been shy about
using it.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is deeply familiar with policy details, his ability
to call forth the armies of the administration to speak on his
behalf has bolstered one of the central tenets of his candidacy _
that he is, as Clinton has often argued, the most qualified person
in history to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Simon, a senior Gore adviser, said the campaign was
thrilled to be able to showcase the Cabinet. ``We've had the most
stable Cabinet of any recent administration, so these are people
who have become authorities,'' he said. ``There's no substitute for
having Bob Rubin talk about economic prosperity or Donna Shalala
talk about health or Andrew Cuomo talk about inner cities. Each of
these people is a shining star.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the strong support of so many Cabinet officers
was a benefit of Gore's having been so involved in the
administration. ``This isn't a situation where you have a vice
president and Cabinet warring among itself, the way Johnson and
Kennedy did, or an office kept in the dark, the way Quayle was,''
he said. ``You have a vice presidential staff that was fully
integrated into all the Cabinet agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a conservative policy analyst at the Hudson
Institute, said that the extent to which current and former members
of the administration were working for Gore appeared
``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a single former official who has come back and
worked so prominently for a vice president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that such action showed both an extraordinary
degree of loyalty within the administration as well as the degree
of determination in helping Clinton establish a political legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Gore's election would provide some
``vindication'' of Clinton's mixed tenure.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tricky area for Gore to navigate. On the one hand, he
says he is not running for a third Clinton term, and he has sought
to close the Clinton chapter of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He often says, as he did here Thursday at a high-tech company,
that he is not running on the ``past performance'' of the economy
but on his own plan for a stronger economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gore has routinely relied on Clinton's political
appointees to advance his cause. Rubin even stumped with him in New
Hampshire last winter. Many have been with the Clinton
administration for years and are seen not so much as auditioning
for a Gore administration but as making themselves more marketable
for the private sector as the end of the Clinton era nears.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire Cabinet has participated in one form or
another in the Gore campaign. Most commonly, they are hosts for
conference calls with reporters. Shalala, the secretary of health
and human services, conducted a conference call on Tuesday to
critique Gov. George W. Bush's plan for prescription drug coverage.
A few days before, Dr. David Kessler, former head of the Food and
Drug Administration and now dean of the Yale School of Medicine,
took part in a conference call to preview a week of Gore speeches
on health-care issues. A few days later, Tyson, who had served on
the 1999 Medicare Commission, conducted a conference call to
discuss Gore's plan to save Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Herman, Clinton's secretary of labor, has been among the
Cabinet officers most visibly involved in Gore's campaign,
particularly in his efforts to reach out to black voters. She and
Rodney Slater, the transportation secretary, who is also black,
were on hand to brief reporters when Gore addressed the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People last month in
Baltimore. Herman also played an advisory role in Gore's
vice-presidential screening committee and is part of the team
working out the debate schedule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most striking examples of Gore's reliance on the
Clinton Cabinet was his selection earlier this summer of William M.
Daley, Clinton's commerce secretary, as his campaign chairman to
replace the ailing Tony Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, the health secretary, is one of the Cabinet members
most actively campaigning for Gore. She said she has been doing so
because of her belief in Gore's proposals and her admiration for
his wife. ``It's both a personal commitment to them and a real
commitment on my part to the programs,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had made it clear that she was not interested in a
job in a Gore administration. Moreover, she said, she just flat-out
loves politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the rough and tumble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she has closely followed the rules about having
the campaign, not the taxpayers, pay for her political trips. But
she noted that Cabinet secretaries are on duty 24 hours a day and
get no vacation, and that part of their jobs are political.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who seemed to be trying openly to parlay his
position into a Gore administration post was Bill Richardson,
Clinton's energy secretary. He was widely considered a possible
vice-presidential running mate for Gore until problems within his
department's purview derailed him.

 &HT;    Georgians hanging tough in doubles, junior events
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Day 11 of 14 at the U.S. Open, and the USTA
National Tennis Center is still teeming with Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   Vinings resident Ellis Ferreira and Rick Leach are in today's
men's doubles final after beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Wayne
Ferreira 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira and Leach, the Australian Open champions, will play
Lleyton Hewitt and Max Mirnyi today at 11 a.m. This is the retiring
Leach's last U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played three years together, and I'd love to win it for
him,'' Ferreira said of Leach. ``We were emotionally overwhelmed in
Australia because of that fact. Not that you need much more
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the junior tournament, Robby Ginepri of Marietta, Ga., and
Ashley Harkleroad of Flintstone, Ga., are through to the singles
quarterfinals as unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
   Ginepri defeated Hiroki Kondo of Japan 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-1
Thursday in the boys draw, impressing Tom Gullikson, USTA director
of coaching for player development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from down 5-2 and two breaks in the first set to
dominating in the third,'' Gullikson said. ``I think he was
physically overpowering that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginepri also reached the doubles semifinals with partner Tres
Davis of Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Harkleroad, who left her northwest Georgia roots last summer to
train at the Saddlebrook Resort in Tampa, beat Annette Kolb of
Germany when Kolb retired trailing 6-2, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should be considered one of the players who can win
it,'' said Harkleroad, 15, who turned pro earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A third Georgia native, Jamea Jackson, had two match points
against 13th-seed Matea Mezak of Croatia on Thursday but began
cramping due to the heat. Jackson lost six straight games and
retired trailing 6-7 (6-3), 7-5, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 Americans in the 64-player girls draw, four were from
Georgia, and Harkleroad is now the only American left. Tanner
Cochran of Dublin beat Erin Burdette of Jackson in the first round,
then lost to Jamea Jackson in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Atlanta U.S. Open,'' said Randy Walker, USTA
communications manager. ``It seems like from the start, Georgia's
top tennis players have been front and center.''

U.N. SPEAKERS URGE INCREASE IN CHARITY TO THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A succession of leaders speaking on the second
day of the United Nations' Millennium Summit on Thursday demanded,
with passion and often eloquence, that the industrialized world
show more tangible charity toward the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billions among the living struggle to survive in conditions of
poverty, deprivation and underdevelopment as offensive to
everything humane as anything we decry about the second
millennium,'' President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor of the world stand at the gates of the comfortable
mansions occupied by each and every king and queen, president,
prime minister and minister privileged to attend this unique
meeting,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, relatively few speakers of the 70 leaders who were
scheduled to speak Thursday offered specific remedies beyond debt
forgiveness, leaving it to some Western countries, like Canada and
Italy, to endorse additional, if less dramatic, measures.
</P>
<P>
   A declaration to be signed on Friday when the summit meeting
ends has set ambitious benchmarks for resolving the global ills of
war, disease, poverty and environmental degradation. One such goal
proposes to reduce by half over the next 15 years the number of
people earning less than a dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela reckoned,
``we should increase that income to levels of fairness and dignity
for 140,000 persons each day of each month and of each year from
the present until Dec. 31, 2015.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, agreed that radical
efforts were required. ``Debt cancellation is important,
indispensable even, but not enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed opening markets to developing countries by
abolishing quotas and tariffs and allocating fresh resources for
education.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the misgivings expressed about the impact of
globalization on poor countries, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of
Canada said: ``We must share the benefits of globalization. We must
give it a human purpose and a human face. The poorest countries
require access for their goods to export markets. Faster, deeper
and broader debt relief should be pursued vigorously.'' And
Chretien added: ``We must ensure that the benefits or the
information revolution are shared by all.''
</P>
<P>
   King Herald V of Norway observed that poverty is inextricably
linked to problems like environmental deterioration. ``For we shall
never be able to cooperate effectively on how to husband the scarce
resources of our planet, how to prevent the degradation of the
environment, as long as so many are trapped in hopeless poverty,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   President J.J. Rawlings of Ghana blamed Western corporations for
``thrusting'' corruption on Africa, which, he contended, ``has
drained some of our countries of resources which should have been
used to improve the quality of life of the poor and
disadvantaged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be less corruption in Africa,'' he said, ``if there
is no place to hide the proceeds of corruption or if the proceeds
of corruption, once uncovered, are returned to their real owners,
the people of Africa,'' he said.

 &UR; NEWMEDIA:  &LR; The Napster debate is about more than just copyright
laws, technology and Metallica. It's about metaphysics. It's about
a ``celestial jukebox.'' And it's about how men think differently
than women. Esoteric as those themes may sound, speakers at two Bay
Area new media conferences this month say taking the Napster
discussion to a higher plane is crucial in helping entertainment
industry executives adapt to changes being wrought by the digital
revolution.  &UR; By Benny Evangelista &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CALPINE:  &LR; Calpine moved swiftly more than two years ago to take
advantage of a window of opportunity when California deregulated
its energy markets. The small San Jose independent power producer
acquired gas-fired power plants as well as many of the geothermal
plants and steam fields in Lake County. The ambitious acquisitions
strategy paid off, helping it become the nation's largest
geothermal producer.  &UR; By Kelly Yamanouchi &QL;  &LR;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    U.N. council pledges better training, faster deployment of
peace-keepers
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Acknowledging that traditional U.N. security
operations are too limited, members of the U.N. Security Council
Thursday pledged better training and faster deployment of
peace-keepers, as well as more stable funding for their work.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued by the council's five permanent members _
China, France, Russia, Great Britain and the United States _ came
shortly after President Clinton urged members at the U.N.
Millennium Summit to pay closer attention to problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president also pleaded with the leaders to broaden their
approach to preventing war throughout the world by attacking the
poverty, disease and environmental hazards that breed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease
and war, we will never be able to create the peace that the
founders of the United Nations dreamed of,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a quarter of all deaths on the planet are now caused
by infectious diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis,
Clinton said the U.N. must invest in the basics of clean water,
safe food, sanitation and health education. If it doesn't, he
warned, the AIDS epidemic that has caused life expectancy in some
African nations to plummet by as much as 30 years will spread to
Asia in the next decade, causing more panic and instability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also predicted that if nations fail to address global
climate changes, environmental problems in the next decade will
become ``as big an obstacle to the development of poor nations as
disease is today.``
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the three-day summit, Clinton and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan have warned that the AIDS crisis and
environmental problems in the world's hot spots would lead to
increased instability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In brief speeches before the Security Council and before a
gathering of African leaders attending the summit, the president
said the United States ``strongly supports'' Annan's goals to
significantly reduce poverty, disease and environmental destruction
in the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has begun to work toward those goals, he said,
citing his administration's efforts to encourage U.S. investment in
Africa, connect African countries to the Internet and write off the
debts of as many as 27 developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Already, debt write-offs in Uganda have allowed that country to
use the savings to double its primary school enrollment, Clinton
said. He added that Senegal has used its savings to hire 2,000 new
teachers and Mozambique has put the savings toward purchasing
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the U.S. Congress to approve $435 million this
year to fully fund the debt-relief program, and asked other world
leaders to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said the United States has launched a $300
million initiative to help African countries provide free meals to
encourage parents to send their children to school. If other
countries would contribute, he said, $4 billion worldwide would
provide nutritious meals in school to every child in every
developing country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pledged continued investment in medical research to
develop a vaccine for AIDS and other diseases, pointing out that
the United States currently invests $2 billion a year in AIDS
research alone. The president has asked Congress to provide a $1
billion tax credit for pharmaceutical companies to speed up
research and development of vaccines against AIDS, malaria and TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed for the long run,'' Clinton told the African
leaders. ``We want to take on the great human challenges; we want
to take on the great political challenges. There are some things
that you will have to do, but I believe America is moving
inexorably to be a much better partner over the long run for
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
that she and Clinton's Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, were
continuing peace meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials.
She said both sides realize they may have only a few weeks to reach
an agreement. She added that there has been ``an intensification of
effort'' with many ideas being discussed, including more detailed
discussions on the fate of Jerusalem, a major sticking point in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a floating operation and we're working hard,'' Albright
said, adding that she and Ross were keeping the president informed.
She said Clinton is ready to step in to help mediate an agreement
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Chairman
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said during a news conference Thursday that he is
committed to leaving ``no stone unturned'' in his search for peace,
but he complained that Arafat remains inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to find a partner'' in Arafat, he said. ``We
didn't find a responsive partner on the other side, but the door is
open and we hope we will find it in the near future.``
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he told Clinton that several far-reaching ideas put
on the table by the president ``are beyond what we believe we can
accept.'' He added, however, that if Arafat would agree to take
Clinton's ideas as a basis for re-entering negotiations, ``we are
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was unsure whether there would be further
meetings while he's in New York, but he said he's confident there
will be ``a serious effort'' to work toward a peace agreement in
the next few weeks.

 &HT;    Foreign athletes melt into U.S. team
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seven years ago, Anna Kozlova was unaware of bagels
and after-school jobs. For all she knew, the lyrics to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' could have been from Eminem's ``The Real
Slim Shady.'' She did not grasp the concept of paying interest on
credit-card charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they just gave you money,'' Kozlova says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has found a new favorite breakfast food and
part-time work. She knows the meaning of annual percentage rates
and billing cycles. And she can recite the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. ``I can, but don't ask me to say it,'' she pleads
to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova is from Russia, for decades the mortal Olympic enemy of
the United States. Today, she is the leading lady on the U.S.
synchronized swimming roster.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your grandfather's, or old Uncle Sam's, Olympic
team. As the walls separating nations come tumbling down, the plane
to Sydney is buzzing with accents from far and wide. The United
States will be represented by about two dozen athletes born beyond
its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Olympic team is a mirror of the country,'' USOC
spokesman Mike Moran says.
</P>
<P>
   The Statue of Liberty might say, ``Give me your tired, your
poor, your huddled masses _ and, while you're at it, throw in a
good distance runner, kayaker and cyclist.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are scattered among several sports and clumped in
one, table tennis. One natural-born citizen with paddle in hand is
joined by three from China, two from Vietnam and one from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC says it does not accelerate the citizenship process,
but athletes can tap congressmen and lawyers on their own to cut
through red tape so they can break the finish-line tape wearing
red, white and blue. Marathon champion Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco
was fast-tracked this year, only to decide before the U.S. Trials
that he was too leg-weary to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the original nation's Olympic committee must sign off
before an athlete is transferred officially. China refused to
release racewalker Yueling Chen, a 1992 Olympian, then relented
last month. Cuba still has not let loose paddler Angel Perez, much
to the frustration of USA Canoe/Kayak.
</P>
<P>
   No immigrant has taken American shores by storm more than
swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg. A world-record holder in two backstroke
events, he stands to become the male counterpart to Marion Jones _
a multiple gold-medalist, a hit on Madison Avenue, an icon to
youth.
</P>
<P>
   HOPING TO ESCAPE PREJUDICE
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism drove the Krayzelburgs from the Ukraine in 1989.
Young Lenny had gotten a taste of it, hearing ``bad words (from
kids), insulting words in Russian that would be, like, 'Jew.'''
</P>
<P>
   They landed in California, for no particular reason. His parents
``were going into pretty much nothingness,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I
mean, they didn't know what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first new home was West Hollywood, where movie makers with
vast imaginations tell stories more credible than Lenny's.
</P>
<P>
   His father had first placed him in a swim program largely to
pass the time until soccer. He swam at a junior college. He missed
out on the Atlanta Games one year after obtaining citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Now Krayzelburg, 24, can parlay almost certain Olympic success
with his cheery disposition and blond, blue-eyed features into
regular gigs on ``Entertainment Tonight.'' Even before the Games,
he has seven endorsement contracts. His handsome mug is on a cereal
box. His degree in finance from Southern Cal is about to come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg resorts to his native language at home. He envisions
marrying a Russian someday. Yet when his ingredients _ the faintest
of accents, westernized lingo, look and interests _ are stirred
together, out pops an American-as-apple-pie.
</P>
<P>
   BECOMING AN AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova, who got a later introduction to capitalist ways,
retains an accent thicker than Krayzelburg's. Her image of America
had been shaped by cinema classics such as _ Freddie Krueger
slasher flicks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the bad parts,'' Kozlova, 27, says. ``Just how people
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Kozlova had been struck by the sight of visiting
Americans in their bright clothes _ and with their brighter moods.
She sojourned to California in 1992 to train, returned home and
came back a year later for good, half the world away from her
parents and two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment has not been all bagels and cream cheese. When
Kozlova's new friends and roommates _ including the male syncro
swimmer, Bill May _ would depart for overseas competition, she was
left behind, awaiting her citizenship. ``That was very, very
hard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Games, she watched from the stands, forbidden
even from associating with the team. ``I wanted to jump in the
pool,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 9, Kozlova became an American. She was so overcome
with emotion that she barely was able to recite the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my father came over, the first words out of his mouth
were, 'I'm glad you stayed here,' `` she says.
</P>
<P>
   While the former kid Soviets probably will add to the U.S. medal
count, their move was mutually beneficial. Krayzelburg journeyed
home once to see his old pool filled with garbage. Kozlova's
ex-teammates scattered to Australia or Greece or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, good riddance, Kozlova says about the Soviet system that
has crumbled along with those walls dividing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are through, you are thrown out,'' she recalls of the
program that tied up an athlete's entire day. ``Sports takes up so
much (time) you cannot prepare for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the land of the free, an array of life's options stand
before them.
</P>
<P>
   His name is on the Lakers' season ticket list. She drives a
Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   You can't get much more thoroughly American than that.

   LOS ANGELES _ A Malibu-based Web site operator must pay
defrauded credit card holders $37.5 million after charging them for
visits to Internet pornography sites even though some victims
didn't own computers, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Audrey B. Collins found that more than
90 percent of the charges the company made were fake, made simply
by taking account numbers off a list supplied by an Agoura Hills
bank. Between 1997 and 1999, it changed names four times to stay
one step ahead of credit card issuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew something was seriously wrong when we got complaints
from people saying I got a bill for Internet pornography and I
don't even own a computer,'' said Federal Trade Commission attorney
Douglas Wolfe. ``What we proved was that they took numbers from
that database and billed them as if they used their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead defendant Kenneth Taves faces additional criminal charges
because he allegedly disobeyed a court demand to reveal the
whereabouts of money and records. During the trial, he was on
parole for an unrelated check kiting conviction. His wife Teresa
Taves and co-defendant Dennis Rappaport can only conduct business
in the future under court-imposed restrictions. Only the Taveses
are liable for paying the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the couple did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, the FTC filed its case against the Taveses and
Rappaport, whose business operated variously under the names J.K.
Publications, Discreet Bill, MJD Service Corp. and Herbal Care Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The operation had the account numbers of 3 million credit card
holders who had purchased goods or services from companies with
accounts at Agoura Hills, Calif., -based Charter Pacific Bank.
Several times, Visa came close to putting the Taves' company on its
active monitoring list for merchants with excessive numbers of
disputed charges. Each time, the operation would apply with Visa
for a new merchant account with a new name, the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that in as many as half the cases, complaining
card holders did not have computers and hadn't given their card
numbers out to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Pacific, which will not face regulatory action, provided
the list of credit card numbers to the Taves' outfit in a practice
known as ``fraud scrubbing'' meant to alert legitimate merchants to
card holders attempting to use such cards fraudulently. As an
example, cards with high percentages of credit refunds known as
``chargebacks'' could appear on such lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the service the bank was providing was meant
to prevent fraud, not cause fraud,'' said bank spokesman Steven
Fink, who said Charter Pacific chose to stop offering the service
after the FTC filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has found some $20 million of the fraudulent companies'
assets but could not say how much of the $37.5 million settlement
would be available to victims. The agency said consumers wishing to
file claims to recoup money lost to the Taveses can call
court-appointed receiver Robb Evans and Associates at (818)
768-8869 or by visiting the FTC Web site at ftc.gov.

APPRENTICE HOPING TO FINISH IN BAZE OF GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyler Baze doesn't let himself worry about the future. At age
17, he'd have a lot of future to worry about if he did.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't wonder if he'll be able to keep riding winners after
his apprenticeship and five-pound weight allowance expire in
December. He shrugs off speculation his 5-foot-5, 110-pound frame
will grow for the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Baze is putting all his thoughts and energy into the next three
months. Is he ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the dark day before Del Mar's finale, will be the last
day off for quite a while for the youngest member of the Baze
family of jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to take advantage of the weight break, to pile up as
many victories as he can, and to earn the Eclipse Award as the nati
outstanding apprentice jockey of 2000, Baze plans to ride every day
this fall. That's !ital!every day.
</P>
<P>
   After clocking in for the 18 consecutive days of the Los Angeles
County Fair meet that opens Thursday in Pomona, he'll ride
Wednesday through Sunday at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meet and
Hollywood Park's fall meet _ and round out each week by riding at
Turf Paradise in Phoenix on Mondays and Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough, sticking it out seven days a week for
the rest of the year, but you've got to do what you've got to do,''
Baze said on the phone from Del Mar. ``I just want to ride as many
horses as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Baze has given his Eclipse Award campaign a boost during the
six-week Del Mar season, riding 22 winners in 37 days (at an
average payoff of $15.60), fifth in the San Diego-area track's
star-studded jock standings.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved up the list since the Hollywood Park meet, where he
was ninth with 31 victories in 65 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Baze's 156 victories this year put him first among
apprentices, with New York-based Norberto Arroyo Jr. second with
139. But Baze's $2.2 million in purses are a distant second to
Arroyo's $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arroyo's 12-month apprenticeship has run out, Baze and
agent Ivan Puhich see a chance to sway Eclipse voters by increasing
their advantage in the wins column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now if I can win 50 to 60 races more than him
(Arroyo), I'll win,'' Puhich said in classic agent-speak, in which
``I'' means ``my jockey.'' The last Southern California-based
apprentice to win the Eclipse was Steve Valdez in 1973, and the
last to remain a fixture on this highly competitive circuit was
Corey Nakatani, who came along in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Baze has impressed Southern Californians more than the
average newcomer. Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, on a racing
radio show last weekend, praised Baze as the headiest apprentice he
has seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Baze is, you might say, bred for it. He grew up on a
Washington-state farm as the son of Earl Baze and the former Cammie
Hunt, both riders. He's the nephew of Gary Baze, currently riding
at Emerald Downs near Seattle. And he's the second cousin of Hall
of Famer Russell Baze, the dominant rider at the San Francisco Bay
Area tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Baze name has opened some doors. But Tyler started at the
bottom like any jockey. He was 15 when he got his first racetrack
job grooming horses for trainer Mike Puhich _ Ivan's nephew _ at
Emerald Downs. Ivan went to see the boy with the riding genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him and saw he was pretty athletic,'' the agent said.
He brought Baze to Santa Anita and got him ready to race.
</P>
<P>
   Puhich estimates Baze galloped 500 horses, breaking 50 from the
starting gate, before his first competitive rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason he's become so good so young is the
preparation we've made,'' Puhich said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Baze five tries before he rode his first winner, a horse
ominously named Fleeting Wonder, on Oct. 31, 1999 at Santa Anita.
His fifth victory, signaling the beginning of his apprenticeship,
came on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Baze spent most of the winter at Turf Paradise and finished
fourth in the standings with 109 winners (20 percent). Oh, and he
finished his senior year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never disappointed me,'' said Puhich, with whom Baze is
living in Monrovia until he turns 18 on Oct. 19. ``He still asks me
for permission to go to the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Baze's success at Del Mar has surprised nobody more than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me. It's like a dream come true, riding with
the best riders in the world,'' he said. ``I didn't expect (to do
this well) in Southern California. I mean, geez Louise, I'm
surprised they even allow me on the grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Baze admits he doesn't know if he'll be able to compete with the
older jockeys here after Dec. 12, when his horses will no longer be
allowed to carry five pounds less.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions about his own weight, Baze responds that he
thinks he is full-grown and will top out at 112 or 113 pounds,
light enough for a jockey on any circuit.
</P>
<P>
   His technique has room to improve. ``I need to get better at
staying still on a horse,'' he said. He is winless in 24 starts on
the turf course at Del Mar. But apprentices rarely are given strong
horses to ride in the trickier grass races.
</P>
<P>
   Puhich, 74, said Baze will be ``my last jock . . . I'm going to
work about three more years, then turn him over to (fellow agent)
Tony Matos, and Tony will get him to the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The next three months
figure to be enough of a challenge for now. &QL; 
 &QL;

Kahal are the other Californians. . . . Del Mar stewards on
Thursday handed trainer Craig Dollase a 15-day suspension starting
Dec. 13 and $2,500 fine because Abby Girl tested positive for an
illegal level of albuterol following a May 20 victory at Hollywood
Park. Dollase indicated he'll consider appealing. He said the drug
was administered to treat an allergy. . . . Jerry Bailey and Bill
Mott were the leading rider and trainer at the Saratoga meet that

aboard Perfect Sting in the Diana Handicap. The New York horses
return to Belmont Park for a 33-day season opening today. . . .
City Zip, who deadheated with Yonaguska in Saturday's Hopeful
Stakes, became the fourth horse to sweep Saratoga's three big
2-year-old stakes. Dehere, in 1993, had been the most recent to do
it. . . . Weekend stakes wins by El Corredor and Saudi Poetry put
Bob Baffert back atop the national trainer standings with $7.4
million in earnings, about $100,000 more than Bobby Frankel. . . .
Frankel's Chester House, who scored his biggest victory last month
in the Arlington Million, has been retired because of a shoulder
injury. . . . Silic, Julio Canani's 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile winner,
has been retired after a bone chip was found in a foreleg. . . .
Trainer Ron McAnally ended his extraordinary Del Mar losing streak
at 50 races when Jimmy Z won Sunday. . . . LemonDrop Kid remained
No. 1, with 16 of the 19 first-place votes, in the NTRA media poll.

COLORADO TEAM LOOKS FAMILIAR TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After months of recruiting, linebacker Zeke Moreno
finally made his college decision, so one of the first things he
did was call his friend, fellow San Diego prep star Lonnie Ford. It
makes perfect sense today, since Moreno and Ford ended up at USC
and are crucial players on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't talking about USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Lonnie I was going to commit to Colorado,'' Moreno
said. ``because we just wanted to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford knew the pair would end up at either USC or Colorado but
urged Moreno to wait until his campus visit with the Trojans. That
trip convinced both to commit to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have easily been in this same spot this week where we
would be playing against USC,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unusual position. USC plays Colorado on Saturday for
the first time in 36 years, but the two schools have spent most of
the mid-`90s battling for the top players in Southern California,
and in some cases, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   They are probably more familiar with each other than some of
their own conference rivals.
</P>
<P>
   There's a long list of players whose final two school choices
were Colorado and USC, and each school has its share of victories.
While the Trojans got Moreno and Ford, the Buffaloes grabbed
linebacker Jashon Sykes and tailback Marcus Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven players on the Colorado roster are from California,
and this week's game will be a homecoming with many players
scrambling for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this game so different is a lot of guys from
Colorado are finally getting a chance to come home to their family
and friends, and they want to put on a show,'' USC cornerback Kris
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   The connections even extend off the field. Colorado chancellor
Richard Byyny earned his bachelor's and doctorate degrees from USC.
</P>
<P>
   Even the coaches have mixed emotions. USC running backs coach
Kennedy Pola was an assistant at Colorado for two seasons
(1997-98). Linebackers coach A.J. Christoff was a Buffalo from
1995-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited a lot of those players and I want them to do
well,'' Christoff said. ``And I want us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Christoff remembers recruiting Ford, along with current Trojans
Markus Steele, Bernard Riley and Omar Nazel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruited Southern California like it was in-state,''
Christoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason was that former Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel
had close ties to the area, having played and coached at UCLA.
Former USC coach John Robinson used to say that Colorado was a
bigger rival for players than UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neuheisel was here every chance he had,'' Pola said. ``We put
a lot of coaches down here. Those guys that USC didn't want, we
stayed on top of, and those that didn't want to stay in the area,
we welcomed with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pola believes that era is fading and attributes it to some
of the changes on USC's current coaching staff, which includes
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt I could come in here and battle. At Colorado and
San Diego State, I always thought we had a shot,'' Pola said.
``Now, we have a young and enthusiastic staff of recruiters at USC.
I believe this staff is a recruiting staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest battle last season occurred over a Colorado
native. Houston, who gained 98 yards last week in his college debut
against Colorado State, was considered one of the top tailbacks in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, USC was trying to snatch a player from the
Buffaloes' backyard, although Houston eventually decided to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was between us and Colorado,'' said USC wide
receiver Marcell Allmond, who hosted Houston on his recruiting
trip. ``I thought it was a 50-50 chance, but I guess he wanted to
be with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player who kept both schools on edge was Sykes. USC
feverishly attempted to sign him after Paul Hackett was hired but
couldn't convince him to stay in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was torn between the two places,'' said Richard, a high
school teammate at Serra High in Gardena. ``But he was wary that we
had depth. I told him that you have to come here and compete, but I
guess he didn't take my word.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with Sykes' decision. He is considered one of
the premier linebackers in the country and a strong candidate for
the Butkus Award.
</P>
<P>
   But his situation might be one of the last major competitions
between USC and Colorado since Gary Barnett replaced Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis now is the state of Colorado,'' Christoff said.
``Gary Barnett was a high school coach in Colorado and said he
wanted all the Colorado kids he could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pola: ``I don't think that staff has that much of a
relationship in Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't affect Saturday's contest, when players from both
sides imagine themselves wearing the uniform of the team across the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to play the school that recruited you,'' Moreno
said. ``I think it'll be good seeing some of the coaches that
recruited me. They tried to get me to change my mind when I
committed to USC, but I think I made the right decision.''

ENERGY FIRM GENERATES CONTROVERSY ON ITS WAY TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY YAMANOUCHI  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Calpine moved swiftly more than two years ago
to take advantage of a window of opportunity when California
deregulated its energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   The small San Jose, Calif., independent power producer acquired
gas-fired power plants as well as many of the geothermal plants and
steam fields in Lake County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious acquisitions strategy paid off, helping it become
the nation's largest geothermal producer. Today, the company shows
no signs of slowing down in its relentless drive to become the
country's largest independent energy producer.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its second quarter this year, Calpine's assets had
grown to $5.6 billion, up from $2.5 billion a year ago. At the same
time, it has seen its net income steadily increase to $95.1 million
in 1999 from $7.4 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The state's energy shortage ``created real opportunities for
us,'' said Peter Cartwright, Calpine's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the soaring profits of Calpine and other independent power
producers have sparked investigations by the state Public Utilities
Commission, state attorney general's office and federal agents of
possible price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright denied that prices have been manipulated. He said his
company is attempting to lower prices by building new power plants,
not to profit from price spikes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, 70, started the company in 1984 after spending 19
years helping General Electric build nuclear power plants and five
years at an engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Calpine started out providing management
services for independent power producers. After a few years, the
company got into the the power producing business itself. In 1989,
Calpine bought its first megawatt, enough power to serve 1,000
households, from an existing power plant at the Geysers, a
geothermal power facility in Lake County.
</P>
<P>
   It has been during the past few years, though, that the company
has grown the most. It has 45 existing and proposed plants in 27
states in the U.S. and Alberta, Canada. In California, it has
plants in San Jose, Gilroy, Yuba City, King City, Pittsburg and
Watsonville, as well as Sonoma and Lake counties.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine's growth accelerated in large part because the state
deregulated the energy market in 1998, forcing utilities to sell
off most of their generating capacity based on fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deregulated power market has really opened up and
expanded,'' Cartwright said. ``We've been building up for this for
a long time, building up the capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the electricity industry shifted as the growing
demand for juice required companies with the wherewithal to build
larger, more-efficient power plants. Each megawatt placed online
can require an investment of as much as $500,000, according to Ron
Walter, Calpine's senior vice president of business development and
head of the firm's mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of decades ago, power companies were building
50-megawatt plants. Today, power producing giants are building
1,000-megawatt behemoths that generate enough power for 1 million
homes.
</P>
<P>
   During Calpine's early growth period, Walter sought small
generators that lack the capital to continue building plants.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Calpine's aggressive plant acquisition strategy helped
the company grow from 141 megawatts in 1994 to 3,355 megawatts in
1999 _ enough to light 3.3 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with larger power companies like Enron, which operates
16,000 megawatts worldwide, Cartwright's company is a small-fry.
</P>
<P>
   But Cartwright said Calpine has big plans to get up to 30,000
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   In its Sept. 4 issue, Fortune magazine ranked Calpine 25th among
its 100 fastest-growing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine ranked 34th in the country in megawatt sales during the
third quarter of 1999, according to the Power Marketing
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Energy analysts, though, say Calpine is on track to become the
largest independent power plant company in the country. According
to industry sources, the company has the most generating capacity
under construction and in development in North America.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its acquisition and development program, Calpine has
raised $5.6 billion in financing since November 1999, according to
Neil Stein, an independent-power analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this industry, they have unprecedented access to capital,''
Stein said. ``Their credit ratings have steadily improved over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with fewer and fewer plants left to acquire, Calpine
has had to shift its strategy, focusing instead on building plants
from the ground up. The idea is to employ the latest technology to
produce efficient generating plants that will phase out older
plants.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that distinguishes Calpine from many other power
plant companies is its focus on the domestic market. When the
company went public in 1996, the conventional wisdom was to invest
in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, while the United States
was seen as a dead market, noted Stein.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've discovered is that this is the one market you
really want to be invested in,'' he said. ``All the price spikes
that we've seen in California and the threat of blackouts are
really a testament to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of rolling brownouts this summer in California in
particular has underscored the need for the state to shore up its
power-generating capacity. The need was so acute that California
had to go out of state to fill 20 percent of its energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine has three plants already under construction in the state
_ two in Pittsburg are scheduled to come online, one in July 2001
and the other in June 2002, according to the California Energy
Commission. Another in Yuba City is scheduled to begin operations
in September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these will add 1,880 megawatts to meet the
California's thirst for power, which currently runs as high as
45,000 megawatts during peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   But some energy companies are unhappy about the wholesale prices
they are getting for the power they provide, and have threatened to
stop building any power plants in California.
</P>
<P>
   The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of
the state's electricity grid, lowered the wholesale price cap twice
to its present $250, from $750 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright dismissed the threats of leaving as posturing and has
pledged to continue to build plants here. ``Price caps don't hurt
us. We know that California needs the power,`' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Highlander, a Calpine spokesman, said the company's plans
to build plants in California have not changed since the ISO
lowered price caps, nor since state lawmakers placed a $65 cap on
San Diego consumer electricity bills last week.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who has a ``strong buy rating'' for Calpine, projects
that during the next five years, the company's market share in the
fragmented industry will grow from 1.5 percent to 5 percent and
earnings will grow 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's rapid growth could also be a liability. Jeff
Wolinsky, an analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that the 40
percent of the company's current cash flow this year insulated from
market price volatility could drop to only 20 percent by 2004, due
to Calpine's rapid acquisition and development strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolinsky added that the company could be at a disadvantage due
to its small market share in each region it serves. In California,
for example, Calpine operates 1,300 megawatts of 55,000 megawatts
of in-state generation, according to the company and the California
Energy Commission. By contrast, PG&AMP;E operates 8,500 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said
Calpine doesn't have the buying power of large energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   Florio also said Calpine plans to build some plants in urban
areas where power is most needed but sometimes more difficult to
get approved. Such is the case in south San Jose, where
neighborhood groups, politicians and the mayor have rallied against
Calpine's proposal to build a 600-megawatt plant on a 14-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the proposed Metcalf plant will be an eyesore and
increase pollution. They also say it is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright said that the plant would not create more pollution,
noting the facility is nowhere near as close to residential areas
as a similar plant Calpine recently built in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose resident Elizabeth Cord, who is heading up efforts
by the Santa Teresa Consumer Action Group against Metcalf, said the
plant would be the worst-polluting business in the city. Cisco,
which is also proposing to set up operations in South San Jose, has
opposed the plant, saying it is not necessary and would interfere
with its own expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Cord said that ``there's absolutely no community outreach
anywhere'' by Calpine and the California Energy Commission's review
process.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Haber, associate director of the air division at the
federal Environment Protection Agency, said the Metcalf plant does
meet regulatory standards and is a ``pretty good plant'' compared
to other possibilities.

DAWN OF A NEW AGE OF NEW MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENNY EVANGELISTA  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Napster debate is about more than just
copyright laws, technology and Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   It's about metaphysics. It's about a ``celestial jukebox.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's about how men think differently than women.
</P>
<P>
   Esoteric as those themes may sound, speakers at two Bay Area new
media conferences this month say taking the Napster discussion to a
higher plane is crucial in helping entertainment industry
executives adapt to changes being wrought by the digital
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Napster thing is on a lot of people's minds, but we don't
want them to be embroiled in a debate over whether Napster is right
or wrong,'' said Andrew Keen, executive producer of MB5 2000, a
three-day new media conference that starts tonight in Emeryville,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking people to think a little bit ahead, to get beyond
Napster and Scour and imagine the future, what the media business
will be like five years down the line,'' said Keen.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, no stranger to metaphysical thinking,
will kick off the conference at the Ex'pression Center for New
Media in Emeryville with a keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MB508 (61156 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The conference is expected to draw more than 500 people, an
exclusive crowd of music and film company executives willing to
fork over the $1,999 registration price to expand their minds and
learn about new media technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant tonight is Jim Griffin, a music industry
visionary who will deliver the keynote speech at the three-day CMJ
ChangeMusic San Francisco Festival starting next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is undergoing a transition from a product to a
service,'' said Griffin, chief executive of Cherry Lane Digital
Inc., a technology consulting firm in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The CMJ ChangeMusic conference, at the Hotel Nikko, will feature
panels on topics like Internet radio and how artists can use the
Web. A similar event earlier this year in Seattle drew about 1,500
music industry executives, artists and fans.
</P>
<P>
   And the following week, at Gavin.com's ``Music on the Net''
conference scheduled for Sept. 20 to 22 in San Francisco, the top
technology gurus at BMG, EMI and Universial Music Group will talk
about how they are trying to ``out-Napster'' Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of online file swapping programs like Napster and
Scour have caused established record and film companies to go to
court hoping to protect their valuable copyrights to music and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a federal judge ruled that online music portal
MP3.com willfully violated copyright laws and ordered the company
to pay up to $250 million in damages to Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers' widespread embrace of digital music should also
be a signal that those same entertainment industry leaders have to
start thinking outside of the box, literally the plastic boxes in
which CDs are packaged, said Chris Gladwin, chief executive officer
of a Chicago music subscription service startup called Full Audio
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Until about six months ago, record industry executives remained
skeptical that there was a mass market for music downloaded in only
digital form, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came Napster'' and its more than 20 million users,
Gladwin said. ``It confirmed undeniably that large quantities of
consumers will consume digital music.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike when the record companies convinced consumers that
CDs were better than vinyl records, this time the consumers are
driving the change, Keen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This revolution of digital sound has not been created from
above, it's been created from below,'' he said. ``It's all about
empowerment. There's a fundamental new industry developing around
the power of the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Once moved beyond the physical, Griffin said music can evolve
into what he likes to promote as the ``celestial jukebox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The celestial jukebox ... is the notion that we will
ultimately have access to what we want, wherever we want it and
whenever we want it,'' said Griffin, a former Geffen Records
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition will be a lot like the one that happened in the
banking world,'' he said. ``We would have never gone to Europe
without travelers checks 20 years ago. Today, we use credit cards
and ATM cards, relying on the `just-in-time' arrival of customized
amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   And Griffin believes music executives need to start thinking
less like men and more like women.
</P>
<P>
   ``As men, we tend to believe more in selling someone something
for $15 and transferring it to their possession without ever
learning their names,'' said Griffin, who believes that as the
market shifts from selling plastic products to offering digital
music services, the relationship with the customer will play a
bigger role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women understand the value of starting a relationship that
never ends. There's too many men in our business.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore's momentum: What a difference some time, a convention and a
popular veep make
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON. Pa. _ When Al Gore last visited northeast Pennsylvania
in June his campaign appeared on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the polls, the Democratic candidate generated even more
negative headlines here when he was forced to scramble for a new
site for a health care event after the local Bishop, angry over the
vice president's support of abortion rights, nixed his scheduled
visit to a Catholic hospital.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few months, a successful convention and a
well received vice-presidential choice make. Gore returned to this
hilly industrial pocket of an important swing state Thursday having
turned around, at least for now, what had been a struggling
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A telling sign of the changing tide occurred when Gore stopped
by Shooky's Deli Restaurant shortly before lunchtime. He was
greeted by Scranton Mayor Jim Connors who announced he was
switching from Republican to Democrat. The mayor cited Gore as his
reason for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll win northeast Pennsylvania and all of
Pennsylvania,'' said Connors, a flamboyant character who has feuded
with the state's Republican governor, Tom Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Other indicators point to a Gore rebound. A fresh batch of
post-Labor Day polls show that Gore, bolstered by strong support
from women, has retained his post-convention bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He also solidified labor support Thursday when the last major
union hold-out, the Teamsters, voted to endorse him. The Teamsters'
backing should give Gore's campaign a lift in Midwest battleground
states, where unions are strong.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lead is narrow and he has lost momentum before,
particularly last spring when he failed to capitalize on his
primary sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, buoyed by the change in fortune, the often-formal
candidate appears to be enjoying himself. He is looser on the
campaign trail, joshing with voters in diners, sports bars and
sports stadiums. On Wednesday he even stepped in as a temporary
pitcher for the Detroit Tigers during the team's batting practice
at its new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After months of watching Bush set the agenda, Gore recently has
kept his Republican opponent on the defensive on a range of issues
from health care to Social Security to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing workers at a Gentex plant in nearby Carbondale, Gore
pressed Bush to explain how he would pay the trillion-dollar cost
to phase in his Social Security plan, which would allow workers to
invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an important specific, that trillion dollar
hole. Don't you think you want to know the answer before the
election?'' Gore asked the workers, who make lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Gore unveiled his economic blueprint, his campaign
took out an ad in the New York Times that contrasts the candidates'
plans. Entitled ``Does it matter if the numbers add up?'' the ad
claims that Bush's tax cut proposals and spending plans ``would
bust the budget surplus and plunge the nation back into deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has countered that the surplus will be
sufficient to pay for the candidate's $1.3 trillion tax cut and
spending programs. Bush campaign officials accuse Gore of
underestimating the cost of his programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was trailing in Pennsylvania for much of the spring
and summer, Gore now enjoys increasing momentum in the state, said
Terry Madonna, a pollster at Millersville University.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said that Gore's populist message is appealing to the
blue collar, socially conservative Democrats who populate this part
of the state and who are essential to any presidential candidate
who wants to carry Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bringing them home,'' said Madonna of a group of voters
who have swung back and forth between the parties in the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was targeting these workers at Gentex when he told them
that he advocates a prescription drug benefit for the elderly that
benefits ``not just the poor but the middle class.''

HEARINGS HIGHLIGHT HOME LOAN ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM ZUCKERMAN  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; For some consumers, a home equity loan is a
great source of cash to fix up the house or put kids through
college.
</P>
<P>
   But for others _ especially those with small incomes and little
financial savvy _ borrowing against the home can be a nightmare
ride on a merry-go-round they can't get off.
</P>
<P>
   Omaga McGlothin, a 51-year-old east Oakland, Calif., resident,
found that out the hard way. After she lost her nurse's assistant
job six years ago, she refinanced her mortgage, collecting about
$10,000 in cash to pay for living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she owed about $11,000 on the three-bedroom stucco
house she bought in 1969. Today, after several more refinancings,
her debt has ballooned to $113,000. And her monthly mortgage
payment is up to $920 per month, more than three times the $250 she
paid before she refinanced.
</P>
<P>
   With less than $2,000 coming in each month from the foster care
services she provides, McGlothin hasn't able to keep up. She is
trying to negotiate a new payment schedule with the current lender,
Pennsylvania's Advanta Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a struggle,'' said McGlothin. ``But I will find a way to
keep my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases like McGlothin's were the subject of Federal Reserve
hearings yesterday in San Francisco. Officials of the central bank
are considering how to enforce a 1994 law that set rules governing
high-fee, high-rate loans to low-income homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups at the hearing said that high-pressure marketing
of rip-off home loans _ so-called predatory lending _ has put
thousands of poor people on the edge of financial ruin. Such
lenders prey on the most vulnerable, they said, seeking out
customers with tarnished credit and job histories, and few other
places to turn for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous problem of people losing their houses,''
said Consumers Union attorney Norma Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, lenders stress that not all loans to borrowers
with low incomes or less-than-prime credit records are predatory.
And, indeed, government officials and consumer groups are eager to
boost the flow of credit to low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because poor borrowers often are easy marks, the business
is rife with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders, for example, charge low interest rates for short
periods before switching to sky-high permanent rates. Others charge
huge up-front fees. Still others set payment schedules in which
principal balances don't get paid down, but rise instead, putting
the borrower deeper in debt.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is what has happened to McGlothin. ``When I make
a payment, it doesn't take anything off the principal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McGlothin has borrowed from several lenders, and it's not clear
which ones were responsible for the worst abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Advanta, her current lender, said it couldn't comment on her
case, but that it treats customers fairly. ``There may be some
unfortunate situations out there created by less-than-credible
lenders,'' spokeswoman Catherine Reid said. ``Advanta is not one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups at yesterday's Fed hearing said regulators
aren't doing enough to rein in rip-off lenders. But, they noted,
borrowers must take responsibility, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think nothing of shopping in six stores for a
toaster,'' said Consumer Union's Garcia. ``They should so the same
thing for a loan.''

YAHOO'S STOCK PRICE FALLS FOR NO REASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to Internet stocks, no news is bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Tim Koogle, chief executive officer of Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle was the luncheon attraction at the Robertson Stephens
Internet conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After he delivered a news-free speech that seemed to confirm
what analysts and the media have been saying for months, Yahoo
stock plummeted 10 percent in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about a slowdown in Internet
advertising, Koogle admitted that the online market has been in a
consolidation phase for nine or 10 months. ``It takes a little bit
of the upside away in the near term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the consolidation would last, he said it would be
``most visible for a couple quarters,'' but that long-term, Yahoo
would benefit as the number of competitors decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle finished his speech around the same time the markets
closed. Within the next hour or so, Yahoo's stock plummeted from
$112 to a low of $103.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock was tanking, I asked several money managers who
heard the speech whether Koogle had sprung any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   No one could come up with a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation came from Dave Karraker, a spokesman for
BlueLight.com, the Kmart-affiliated Web operation that has several
partnerships with Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koogle didn't appear to say anything new, and that was the
problem. This was his first real speaking engagement since the
whole online advertising thing blew up on Yahoo. I guess investors
expected him to say more.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comments didn't seem to do anything to calm anyone's
nerves. With how volatile the Internet sector is right now, you
almost have to say something really decisive, even controversial,
to get people back into the frame of mind that your company is a
fighter that will make things work no matter what. Just laying low
will get you battered.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo blamed the stock drop on the media, saying that news
services misinterpreted Koogle's comments. At least one news
service, Dow Jones, did ``clarify'' a headline, saying that Koogle
``did not explicitly state that the company expects a near-term
decrease in advertising spending.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo spokeswoman said Koogle's comments referred to
consolidation in the online market in general, not to consolidation
in online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like hair splitting to me, but it was enough to turn
Yahoo's stock around. It recovered most of its after-hours loss
Wednesday, but reversed course again yesterday, closing at $106.94,
down $5.13.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Blue Light Special
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned BlueLight.com made a presentation at the
conference just before Koogle's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Koogle, BlueLight CEO Mark Goldstein did break some news.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest to San Franciscans is the new store BlueLight
is creating on the ground floor of its new headquarters building on
Jefferson Street in Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in November or December, the 8,500-square-foot
store will feature an Internet kiosk like those being installed in
Kmart stores, a Jamba Juice outlet and a Kodak one-hour photo
processing center.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it may add Kmart-branded products like the new
BlueLight PC.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart initially wanted to sell the computer for $399. But Intel,
``in classic Intel'' fashion, wouldn't provide the chip that
Kmart's manufacturer, LG Electronics, wanted to use, Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Kmart had to substitute a more-expensive Intel processor,
which brought the retail price to $449, including free Internet
service, which BlueLight provides to anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   BlueLight will call attention to its new store with a huge
flashy sign modeled after the classic blinking blue light that used
to attract Kmart shoppers to temporary specials like four sub
sandwiches for a dollar. Kmart is bringing back the blue light in
its stores and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the sign hasn't received final approval from the
city, but it probably will because the only restriction on signs in
Fisherman's Wharf is a 25-foot height limit.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Goldstein, it's clear that Kmart is not going
``upscale'' in its stores or Web site.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, BlueLight will expand its Web site to include a
photo-processing deal with Kodak, a gift registry, sweepstakes
offers and a free gossip newsletter from National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart is the No.1 outlet for National Enquirer, which Goldstein
called ``the Kmart shopper's Reuters.''
</P>
<P>
   People who sign up for the newsletter will get an HTML page
e-mailed to them. The page will contain National Enquirer content
in the middle and Kmart ads and offers around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter is a ``prospecting tool,'' Goldstein said. ``We
have 6 or 7 million e-mail addresses now.'' By the end of 2001, the
company hopes to have 20 million e-mail addresses, at least $100
million in sales and be turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to do an initial public offering next year. In the
meantime, it can live off $80 million in second-round financing it
recently secured from Kmart and Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Drawing a Crowd
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's not public yet, BlueLight is one of the few
pure B2C (business-to-consumer) Internet companies that drew an
overflow crowd at the conference, which concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that are struggling are the B2C providers, the
e-tailers, that are really trying to deal with gaining brand
identity in a market that's crowded,'' said John Rohal, director of
research for Robertson Stephens. ``People have shifted from the
idea that new brands are going to be created on the Web, to the
idea that established brands (like Kmart) are going to extend to
the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohall said the biggest audiences were for Internet
infrastructure companies, mainly in network equipment, fiber optics
and communications chips.
</P>
<P>
   Presentations by B2B (business-to-business) companies like Ariba
and Commerce One were also ``really packed in really big rooms'' at
the Ritz-Carlton hotel, Rohall said.
</P>
<P>
   Rohall said that Phone.com, which makes software for getting
wireless applications onto cellular phones, and Lifeminders.com,
which will be delivering breaking Olympics news to mobile devices,
were also big attractions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Full Disclosure
</P>
<P>
   The Robertson Stephens conference is the first big investment
confab since the Securities and Exchange Commission passed the Fair
Disclosure Regulation. Reg FD is supposed to ensure that big
investors like those who attend these conferences don't get
material information before the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the investment banks that host these get-togethers
only invite their big clients. Some allow the media, but exclude
reporters from ``breakout sessions,'' where analysts get to ask
CEOs questions. The answers often move a stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Reg FD hasn't taken effect yet, and Robertson Stephens excluded
the press from breakout sessions this week. Rohall said his firm
hasn't decided what it will do in the future. ``We're still trying
to understand Reg FD. Our legal guys are looking hard at it.''

<P>
   A panel of expert scientists reported Thursday that after
studying what were regarded as the leading suspected causes, it
could not say what had brought on the array of symptoms called Gulf
War syndrome in thousands of veterans of the war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which had pored over studies of poison gas, uranium,
drugs and vaccines, concluded that there was not enough reliable
data to say whether exposure to any of those agents had caused the
illnesses. The lack of data extended not only to the effects of the
chemicals in question but also to the level of exposure of Gulf War
veterans to the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, of 18 members, was brought together by the
Institute of Medicine, a body of the National Academy of Sciences.
Its conclusions were announced Thursday at a Washington news
conference, where Dr. Kenneth I. Shine, the institute's president,
summed up the frustration of members of the committee and others
seeking more definitive findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to come up with remarkable new conclusions,''
Shine said, ``but after careful analysis, if the data isn't there,
we can't draw any conclusions from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended both more scientific research and that
the military try to better monitor what happens to soldiers and
their environment in any future war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weidman and William Frasure, officials of Vietnam
Veterans of America, who have tracked the debate over Gulf War
syndrome for several years, said that given the scant data, they
sympathized with the committee. What is needed, they said, is a
thorough study of not only the existing scientific literature but
also classified records on troop deployments and veterans' medical
records, carried out not by military officials but by independent
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of Gulf War syndrome vary, but veterans have
complained chiefly of fatigue, skin rash, headache, memory loss and
muscle and joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's search for a cause followed studies by both the
Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Both
those earlier studies found that there was a group of Gulf War
veterans suffering from a variety of symptoms, but could find no
cause.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress mandated further study, the Institute of Medicine
was asked by the VA to convene an expert impartial panel to look at
a list of 33 agents and try to determine whether any might be the
cause. The committee began work early last year on what were
considered the four most likely suspects among those 33 and, after
a review of thousands of published, peer-reviewed scientific
studies, addressed the four on Thursday at the news conference and
in a written report. (Under the congressional mandate, the
committee must now spend years looking at the 29 others.)
</P>
<P>
   The committee left open the question of whether two of those
four agents _ the nerve gas sarin and vaccinations against germ
warfare _ might be the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is inadequate/insufficient evidence,'' the panel wrote,
``to determine whether an association does or does not exist
between exposure to sarin at low doses'' and any subsequent
``long-term adverse health effects.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to vaccinations against anthrax and botulinum, the
committee's wording was identical.
</P>
<P>
   The committee felt there was at least some evidence that the two
other agents _ depleted uranium and the chemical pyridostigmine
bromide _ were unlikely to be the cause, although again there was
not enough evidence to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Dr. Harold S. Sox Jr., said he felt
that its review did not ``move the needle'' toward any new
conclusions on sarin or the vaccines. As for the depleted uranium
and pyridostigmine bromide, he said, ``we did move the needle'' in
that it now seems less likely that either was a cause of the
syndrome. But he emphasized that the study had been unable to rule
them out.
</P>
<P>
   These four agents were studied first for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sarin was suspected because it is a potent nerve toxin used in
chemical weapons, some of which were destroyed during the Gulf War,
thus exposing soldiers to small doses.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines became suspect because soldiers received two of them _
one against anthrax and one against botulinum toxin _ before
serving in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Pyridostigmine bromide is a drug used as a treatment for
myasthenia gravis, but it can also blunt the effects of nerve gas,
so some soldiers were given preventive doses of it.
</P>
<P>
   So-called depleted uranium, a low-radiation form of uranium,
came under suspicion because it is used as a layer in the armor of
tanks to increase protection, and is also used in some ammunition
rounds. Soldiers were exposed to it during the cleanup of damaged
tanks and in munitions from ``friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Overriding all their tentative conclusions was the constant
refrain expressed at the news conference by the committee's members
that there was very little evidence of the kind needed to make
conclusions on two points: whether low doses of any of the agents
might cause long-term illness, and just how much exposure to the
agents any veteran got.

WOODS FINDS THE GOING TOUGH IN CANADA, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario _ For some reason, when Tiger Woods has
traveled north to Canada, his performance has headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Woods missed the cut at the Bell Canadian Open,
the only time in 86 career starts on the PGA Tour as a professional
that Woods has missed a cut. Thursday, Woods returned to the
Canadian Open for the first time since 1997, trying to accomplish a
rare triple crown. Lee Trevino is the only player to win the U.S.
Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same year
(1971), and after waltzing to victories at both the U.S. and
British Opens, Woods arrived in the suburbs of Toronto this week
hoping to add even more luster to his history-making season.
</P>
<P>
   But after Thursday's opening round at Glen Abbey Golf Club,
winning the Canadian Open will be no easy task for the world's No.
1 player. Spraying shots all over the back nine, and making a
costly double-bogey at No. 11, Woods finished at even par 72, tied
for 45th place, seven strokes off the lead, and well off his game.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sutherland, who has never won on tour, was the surprise
first-round leader, shooting a 65. Cameron Beckman (66) was alone
in second place, while Sergio Garcia, J.L. Lewis, Jesper Parnevik
and Brian Watts were tied for third place at 67.
</P>
<P>
   Does Woods still have plenty of time to come back? Of course he
does. Would he have to play much better to win? Of course he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of ugly,'' Woods said, describing his play over
the final 10 holes. ``I hit it left, I hit it right, I hit it
short, I hit it long, I hit a lot of bunkers. Golf is a fickle
game. It was just one of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods coughed occasionally as he spoke, still feeling lingering
symptoms from a flu he caught last month. Many were surprised that
Woods played this week, instead of taking more time off. After this
week, Woods will not play again until the Presidents Cup in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken antibiotics, but I haven't had enough time to get
it totally out of my system,'' Woods said of the flu. ``If I don't
play this week, I'd take seven weeks off in a row. That's way too
long. Five weeks in a row is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods started well, reaching three under par through eight
holes, but then things fell apart. He made a three-putt bogey at
No. 9, missing badly from just 3 feet away on his putt for par.
Then at the par-4 No. 11, Woods pulled his tee shot left into deep
rough, leaving himself with a difficult approach shot, over a tree
and over water, just to reach the green. Woods could not pull it
off. The ball sailed high over the tree, but it dropped well short
of the green and into the water. After a drop and a penalty stroke,
Woods hit his fourth shot onto the green, but it landed 15 feet
past the cup. Woods missed his putt attempt for bogey, and the
double-bogey dropped him to even par. Woods made another bogey at
No. 14, but he birdied the final hole, and barely extended his
streak of consecutive rounds of par or better to 32.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even struggling, Woods remained the focal point of the
tournament, and the Toronto area has gone wild for him. When Woods
confirmed last week that he would play, the remaining tickets sold
out within hours. And Thursday, many in his huge gallery yelled,
``Thanks for coming, Tiger,'' as he walked by, treatment that Woods
clearly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people scream a lot of other things before,
especially after they've had their favorite beverage,'' said Woods
smiling. ``This was nice. That's one reason why I've always enjoyed
playing in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are friendly,'' he said. ``I'm still not out of the
tournament. I have an early tee time, hopefully the wind won't
blow, and I can get back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods will have to catch Sutherland, who birdied six of his
first nine holes during a splendid round. Meanwhile, Garcia
continued to play well, bolstered by his recent performance at the
Battle of Bighorn, the made-for-television match against Woods, won
by Garcia, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to beat Tiger was probably the best thing that
could happen to me,'' Garcia said. ``It gave me a lot of
confidence, of course. Hopefully, I'll be able to continue playing
well this week.''

ANALYSIS: AS BUSH HITS BUMPS, A RIFT OVER STEERING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political troubles facing Gov. George W. Bush
have exposed a serious rift between the Bush organization and the
Republican National Committee over how best to conduct the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-ranking officials at party headquarters here say
they were furious that the campaign had shut them out and rejected
their advice on things like television commercials and how Bush
negotiates a schedule of debates with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking party official official complained that the
view from Austin, Texas, where Bush has his headquarters, has been
that the party has nothing to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``They acted like they were the smartest people in the world _
and that no one here in Washington had anything to contribute,'' he
said. ``Their view was: `We really understand the American people.
You people in Washington don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said that there had been some friction
for months between officials in Austin and at the party but that it
escalated two weeks ago when Bush himself ordered the party to
shelve a 30-second commercial questioning Gore's ethics by using
misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican officials said the party had been unfairly
blamed for championing the commercial, even though several Bush
aides had pushed for it, as well. Some Bush aides, in turn,
complained that the party did not have a better chain-of-command
for reviewing and distributing advertisements _ and that it had
already delivered the commercial to some television stations when
the decision was made to pull it.
</P>
<P>
   After the controversy surrounding the pulled commercial, Bush
campaign officials removed David Israelite, the party's political
director, as coordinator of its advertising campaign. The campaign
replaced him with Maria Cino, who was the Bush organization's
political director during the primaries and who moved to the party
in the spring as a deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush lieutenant said Israelite had been ``the center of the
universe as far as the spots go,'' but that campaign officials
prefer ``a broader group of people considering the options.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints among party officials is that for
months they were rebuffed in their efforts to keep Gore on the
defensive by starting an early advertising campaign, as the
Democrats did against Bush. Throughout the summer, Democrats spent
$35 million on commercials promoting Gore or pounding Bush, while
Republicans spent roughly $25 million. Some party officials said
they had pressed for the campaign to approve a much more aggressive
television blitz against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush officials said there was no need for Bush to begin
attacking when he was enjoying a solid lead in the polls and when
he was vowing to keep the tone of the campaign positive.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials also complained that members of the campaign
high-command in Texas instructed them earlier in the year to stop
staging events and putting out news releases intended to knock Gore
off stride. Such efforts, these officials said, could have
prevented the vice president from gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin wants to control everything,'' said one strategist who
works closely with officials at the campaign and at the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   One party official said he had suggested that the party put on
an anti-Gore event to help Bush regain momentum and capture
attention in the press immediately after the Democratic convention.
But, he said, the idea was dismissed by Bush aides in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   As is common for a presidential campaign, the Bush organization
effectively seized control of the party after the primary season
ended and installed some of its loyalists _ including Cino and Fred
Meyer, the chief coordinator between the party and the Bush
campaign _ at party headquarters. It left the chairman, Jim
Nicholson, in place.
</P>
<P>
   Several people described Nicholson as a loyal partisan, and one
of the few top party officials who has not complained about the
Bush campaign. ``I'm not aware that there's very much concern,''
Nicholson said in an interview. ``In any campaign there are always
certain personality conflicts. But there's even very little of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many party stalwarts who work closely with Nicholson went as
far as to say that members of the tight-knit Bush high command in
Austin were overly confident, even arrogant. A mocking phrase
making the rounds among party officials here is ``Austin Knows
Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Several well-placed Republicans said the confusion over the
advertising campaign _ and who is running things _ has frustrated
many top officials, including the party's chief of staff, Tom Cole,
and Alex Castellanos, the media consultant who is producing the
Republican commercials. Neither agreed to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for such tensions to arise at a time when a
candidate is watching his poll numbers sag, as Bush is. But many
officials on both sides said the strains are deeper han usual,
prompting one party official to say that Bush aides would likely
investigate sources for this article. ``There will be witch
hunts,'' he said. ``There will be victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions stand in marked contrast to the relationship
between the Gore campaign and the the Democratic National
Committee, which have worked closely together to mount a drive to
discredit Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC has been a lot more coordinated with the campaign,''
added one strategist with close ties to the Republican Party, ``and
has been complimenting the campaign on a message standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   It should not be a surprise, perhaps, that Bush camp has not
devoted more attention to party officials here. Bush has cast
himself as an outsider and built his campaign in part on his
disdain for Wasington and politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Some people involved in the Bush operation and at the party
cautioned that it was simplistic to characterize the rift as one
between Austin and Washington. They noted, for instance, that there
have been debates among officials in both places about how and when
the party should begin broadcasting commercials attacking Gore _
and that those debates are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of frayed egos, bad relationships and
strong-willed beliefs on difference sides,'' said one Republican
consultant who is close to officials in both camps. ``It's not the
kind of climate you want at this point in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, brushed of suggestions
of disputes, saying, ``We're all working together to win in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said
some of the finger-pointing may be from Washington insiders who
feel left out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a low of squawking, a lot of complaining _ there are
some babies involved in this stuff,'' he said. ```All of the people
who live inside Washington are resentful that they're not running
the campaign.''  &QL;

LEADERS OF ARYAN NATIONS FOUND NEGLIGENT IN ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights
organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest
white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a
state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan
Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two
years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's
compound near here.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of
the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were
ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the
nine-woman, three-man jury.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai
County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a
mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their
lawyers. The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,
even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has
successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's
finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one
that could force the group out of its 19-acre property. ``I'd like
to say publicly for Butler to get the message that we consider the
every single asset of that compound to be the property of the
plaintiffs in this case,'' Dees said after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of
message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly
sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called
North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself
to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of
Independence who were harassed for their views. ``This is
nothing,'' he said, after the verdict. ``We have planted seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money. We will
spread the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now
21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the
Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12
million in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan
Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of
racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will
be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees
said in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day
trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,
he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of
drunken young men.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of
violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the
jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly
politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts
and all manner of people that drift in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near
the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden
Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a
wedding. They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had
accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun. He had been in the Job
Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim
and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. He quickly retrieved
the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the
police after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police
that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant
Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the
car. They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the
car into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,
struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and
screamed at her. She and her son testified that they thought they
were going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that
one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian. She testified
that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor
white farm girl.'' A guard then said that because they were white,
the men would let them go.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified
that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the
other men had fired at the Keenans. Under questioning, Yeager read
portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance
to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to
ever walk the face of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and
are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a
fugitive. The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial
and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point
repeated by Steele.

<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   GORE RIDES HIGH
</P>
<P>
   In the first spate of post-Labor Day national polls,
traditionally considered among the most important of the campaign
season, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are
locked in a tight race, with Gore holding onto the momentum he
gained after his convention, having made great strides among women,
Democrats and independents. Gore also appears to have made
considerable headway in turning around negative views of his
personality and demeanor. He continues to hold an advantage over
Bush on the issues. A poll of 810 likely voters by ABC News and the
Washington Post shows Gore and Bush tied, at 47 percent each. A
Gallup Organization poll of 750 likely voters for CNN and USA Today
has Gore leading Bush by a margin of 47 to 40. And a Zogby poll of
1,001 likely voters shows a six-point lead for Gore. All three
polls have margins of sampling error of plus or minus four
percentage points and were taken Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUNNING MATES: LIEBERMAN IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut ventured deep into Bush
country Thursday, showing up in Houston, and he plans to return
Monday, signaling the Democrats' new-found confidence and boldness
to campaign in a state they have almost no hope of carrying.
Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, plans to hold
a campaign forum in Houston on Friday on children's health care, an
event that will no doubt include a few digs at George W. Bush's
record on the subject as governor of Texas. On Monday, Lieberman
will be the draw at a Democratic National Committee fund-raising
luncheon at the home of Thomas Meredith, the former chief financial
officer of Dell Computer and now the managing director of Dell's
venture capital unit. The DNC expects to raise $500,000 at the
lunch. Vice President Al Gore's campaign aides concede that he has
no chance of winning Texas, but they note that an opponent's home
state can be a useful forum for attacks, as Michael Dukakis learned
in 1988, when Bush's father showed up in Massachusetts to lament
water pollution in Boston harbor.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY DUCKS A BULLET
</P>
<P>
   The suspense was palpable. When Dick Cheney took a tour Thursday
through a Londonderry, N.H., optics firm to emphasize his ticket's
commitment to building a higher tech military, all eyes fell on an
outsized gray helmet festooned with the latest in panoramic night
vision goggles that was sitting on a table in the middle of the
factory floor. Visions of one of the most-ridiculed images of the
1988 campaign, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts donning an
unbecoming helmet during an ill-fated photo opportunity aboard a
63-ton tank, danced through cameramen's heads. As Cheney handled
the helmet at Insight Technology Inc., an eager photographer called
out, ``Do you think it's the right size?'' Alas, the minefield was
avoided. ``Come on, guys, you don't think I'm going to try it on,
do you?'' Cheney replied, before walking over to a table of laser
devices.
</P>
<P>
   THE STATES: FISTICUFFS IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican Florida legislators from feuding families traded
punches early Wednesday morning after one legislator's father
reportedly insulted the other legislator's father on live radio.
According to The Miami Herald, State Rep. Renier Diaz de la
Portilla and Rep. Carlos Lacasa of duked it out in the parking lot
of Radio Mambi, a popular talk radio station, after Lacasa's father
insulted Diaz de la Portilla's father during a talk show on
election night. After the comments, Diaz de la Portilla went to the
station and demanded to be let in to defend his family's honor,
frightening Martha Flores, the radio host, who exclaimed into the
microphone, ``Hail Mary Mother of God, the Diaz de la Portilla's
are out there.'' Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Renier's brother, had
just been badly beaten in his race for mayor of Miami-Dade County,
and had complained that the radio was unfair to him in favor of his
rival, incumbent Alex Penelas. Renier Diaz de la Potrilla and
Carlos Lacasa met in the parking lot and fought, although each man
says that the other started it. Flores begged her listeners to call
the police, and so many listeners responded that the flood of calls
caused the 911 system to crash.
</P>
<P>
   HAYDEN SEEKS CITY COUNCIL SEAT
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hayden has spent close to 40 years rocking the political
boat, first as a college student and later as a California
assemblyman and senator. The state's term limits law is forcing him
out of the Senate this year, but he is not giving up on public
life. He announced Thursday that he would run for Los Angeles City
Council next year, for a seat covering the Westside and parts of
the San Fernando Valley that is being vacated by Mike Feuer.
Hayden, a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Mayor Richard
Riordan in 1997, joins a crowded field in the nonpartisan race. He
has been a sharp critic of police corruption and school
construction problems, has promoted gang truces and has complained
that Angelenos feel unconnected to their government.
</P>
<P>
   THE CONVENTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA'S RED SCARE More than a month after the Republican
convention ended, Philadelphia residents learned Thursday of the
police department's rationale for a raid that resulted in 75
arrests at a warehouse where demonstrations were being planned. In
a newly unsealed warrant, the police said some of the protesters
had ``communist and leftist'' sponsors and others were sympathetic
to ``the former Soviet-allied World Federation of Trade Unions.''
Stefan Presser, legal director of the state American Civil
Liberties Union, called the warrant an outrage today. ``That
document could have been written by Hoover's FBI in the '40s and
'50s,'' he said, complaining that it failed to justify the raid and
served as a pretext for one of the largest instances of preventive
detention in modern American history. Some of those arrested were
kept in jail for more than two weeks after the convention and more
than 300 cases are pending against demonstrators. The warrant also
disclosed that the city police, who had been under court order not
to infiltrate protest groups, used state troopers as infiltrators.
Presser complained that the use of the troopers was ``an end run''
around basic civil liberties. The police declined to comment.

IN REVAMPING, CMGI TRIES TO LIFT SAGGING SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI, one of the earliest and savviest investors in the
Internet, announced a sweeping restructuring Thursday meant to
reassure disenchanted investors that it was moving toward becoming
profitable and is picking the winners among the plethora of
companies it owns.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Andover, Mass., has backed companies
including GeoCities, Lycos and Alta Vista. At the beginning of the
year, it had a market value of nearly $50 billion. But since then
its shares have plunged by 69 percent, more even than many other
big Internet companies. Its shares closed Thursday at $43.19, up
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the company said it would reduce its 17 majority-owned
businesses to between 5 and 10, organized around 5 business lines.
It will merge three venture capital funds into a single fund. It
will also abandon plans for a fund meant to invest in Internet
companies overseas with Hicks, Muse Tate &AMP; Furst, the buyout firm,
and Pacific Century CyberWorks, an Internet company, because of
differences among the partners over the structure of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving our path to profitability is the single driving
force here,'' said David Wetherell, CMGI's chairman, in a
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI identified five broad business categories in which it would
concentrate: search and portals; infrastructure and enabling
technologies; professional services; interactive marketing; and
electronic business. It hopes to wind up the revamping with one or
two companies in each of these areas that it will ultimately take
public. A few of its companies, like Engage, a database advertising
company, already have public shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   As for the weaker companies in each area, it will decide whether
to merge them into the stronger ones, sell them, or close them. It
also hopes to acquire new companies, especially profitable ones, to
shore up its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell refused to name the businesses he considered weak or
to say how many people would be laid off, but he said the company
had routinely pared positions even as it had grown rapidly. CMGI
acquired 33 companies in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, CMGI did not create a business line for Internet
content or community, two areas in which it had many early
investments. Indeed some companies like Icast, an music and
entertainment service, fit awkwardly into the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it hoped that the new organization would
reassure investors who, looking past the dazzle of CMGI's
investment success, found the company a jumble of largely unrelated
businesses. Starting with CMGI's fiscal fourth quarter earnings to
be released on Sept. 21, the company will report revenue and
operating earnings separately for each of these segments.
</P>
<P>
   Paul L. Merenbloom, an analyst for Prudential Securities, said
CMGI's move reflected strength rather than the desperation seen at
so many Internet companies these days. With CMGI burning through
$50 million in cash each month and investing another $25 million
through its venture arm, the company's $1.7 billion in cash will
last nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an eternity on the Internet,'' Merenbloom said.

GROCER MAKES ONLINE SHOPPING ARRANGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ralphs Grocery Co. and Priceline.com have combined
to offer grocery savings of as much as 50 percent in the first
online shopping opportunity of its kind in California, the
companies announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline.com WebHouse Club allows consumers to shop for
grocery bargains online at Priceline.com, lock in their savings by
paying with a credit card when they order and pick up the groceries
at Ralphs anytime within three months. If there's a sale that makes
the in-store price lower, the customer gets the lowest price and
the difference is credited to the WebHouse Club account.
</P>
<P>
   For Ralphs it's a cost-free method of attracting new customers
in a very competitive environment that hasn't been kind to all
grocers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs us nothing and we believe it will attract customers
who don't usually shop at Ralphs,'' Ralphs spokesman Terry O'Neil
said Thursday at an in-store demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The Web program works like grocery coupons - manufacturers pay
the store full price for the items discounted on the Web site.
Manufacturers benefit from the opportunity to increase their sales
without lowering their overall retail price - to get products to
people who are brand flexible, and possibly to increase their
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Customers - especially those who are not stuck on one particular
brand of chocolate chip cookie, for instance - can save as much as
50 percent on a variety of grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming the price of your own groceries delivers real savings
and that's something everybody's looking for,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 cards have been passed out in the past couple of
days at the Ralphs in Studio City. O'Neil expects similar response
in all of Ralphs' California stores, including its Food 4 Less
division. Cards can also be requested online and mailed to the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new wave of grocery shopping,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   A sample grocery basket that included bread, diapers, paper
towels, chicken breasts, coffee, yogurt, steak and potato chips
cost $33.47 when purchased online Wednesday evening. When the order
was picked up at the store Thursday, the retail price for those
items was $52.94 - a savings of $19.47.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.5 million people already use the Priceline.com Club for
Groceries in major cities on the East Coast, the Midwest and Texas.
The partnership with Ralphs is its first venture in California.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline expects 4 percent to 5 percent of Los Angeles
households to be using its service by early 2001, said Robert
Padgett, director of corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com was launched in spring 1998. The WebHouse Club was
launched almost a year ago and is a privately held licensee, but
Priceline holds warrants to buy it if certain financial targets are
reached, Padgett said.
</P>
<P>
   The WebHouse Club for Groceries is a different business model
than that of online grocers who deliver products to the customer's
home or office. Delivery models trade on customer convenience more
than price. The WebHouse Club offers cost savings, but you have to
go to the store to get them. It is unclear which companies and
business models will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Although online grocery shopping is expected to grow from a $1.1
billion business this year to nearly $17 billion in 2004, the
industry segment is starting to see some players backing off in
some markets or being bought out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peapod - a Skokie, Ill.-based online grocer that
expanded so rapidly it nearly went bankrupt and has lost millions
each year since it went public in 1997 - announced Thursday that it
is backing out of four major markets in Ohio and Texas and buying
Streamline.com's Washington, D.C., and Baltimore operations for $12
million. Peapod acquires a foothold in the Washington area and
greater concentration in its Chicago home base, and New York-based
Streamline gets cash it needs to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   And Webvan Group of Foster City, Calif., recently announced it
would acquire its main competitor, HomeGrocer.com of Kirkland,
Wash., in a deal valued at $1.2 billion. The deal is expected to
increase Webvan's revenues by 50 percent, while requiring 50
percent less cash.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date grocery store sales overall have risen a
respectable 6 percent over last year, according to the National
Retail Federation, but not all grocers are profiting as much as
they would like.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional grocery markets operate on slim profit margins and
make their money on volume. If they misstep, they suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's stock and the entire food retailer sector in the
West and Midwest was downgraded late last month after the company
announced its profits would come in below analysts' estimates.
Albertson's cited a decline in same-store sales and
higher-than-expected merger costs. Albertson's acquired Salt Lake
City-based American Stores Co. last year, bringing its holdings to
more than 2,500 supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Montvale, N.J.-based A&AMP;P saw its credit and debt ratings sink
Thursday after it said it expects to lose money in its fiscal
quarter, which ends Saturday.

POWER RELIABILITY SERVICES SURGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two local stocks revved like overtaxed air
conditioners in the long, hot summer nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, part of the red-hot industry providing reliable
power services to communications companies, have seen their shares
skyrocket since June. That's when Chatsworth's Capstone Turbine
held an initial public offering and Camarillo's Power-One split
shares 3-for-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cutting-edge companies in a universe that is just
starting to develop,'' said Masroor Siddiqui, an analyst who covers
both for Goldman Sachs and Co.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, Capstone's stock had risen from its June IPO
price of $16 to $83.375. Power-One's stock closed at $71.50 after
its June 5 split. Now it is at $172. The company will complete
another 2-for-1 split next week.
</P>
<P>
   The service the two provide is steady power supply almost
impervious to surges or blackouts. The industry calls it ``high
nines'' power in reference to the 99.9999 percent reliability
devices can achieve. In comparison, utility power grids provide
99.9 percent reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Capstone's turbines, installed in city buses, at landfills or at
businesses as small as convenience stores, can give customers an
independent electricity supply. Power-One's products come in
further down the supply line. The company makes power systems for
Internet service providers and telecommunications companies, making
devices like DC/DC converters that send the right voltage to
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Capstone especially benefited from the hot summer, which showed
the shortcomings of the power grid and deregulation. Southern
California spent much of August in energy conservation mode as the
system reached its breaking point and consumers lamented the new
era of electricity deregulation they once demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The summer ``shed more light on distributed generation,'' said
Capstone spokesman Keith Field. ``There are growing needs not only
for more power but for power reliability and power quality.''
</P>
<P>
   But more important to the future of both companies is the huge
need of the telecommunications industry for the services of both,
brownouts or not, Siddiqui said. Brokerage Needham and Co. noted
that power fluctuations cause more than 17,000 computer disruptions
per second around the world. In households, that could be no more
than being bumped offline. In industry, such disruptions could
bring computer controlled operations to a halt with disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has less to do with deregulation than with the digital
economy because that's an industry that needs high-quality power,''
Siddiqui said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like the fundamentals of both companies. Power-One is
responsible for $10 billion of an $18 billion market for power
supply products.
</P>
<P>
   J. Keith Dunne, an analyst with Robertson Stephens, dates the
surge of the power industry less to the beginning of summer than to
a July conference when analysts christened power as The Next
Investor Sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then you've seen all these companies perform remarkably
well,'' he said.

MRS. CLINTON PROPOSES GRANTS FOR SCHOOL PRINCIPALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turning the nationwide shortage of school principals
into a campaign issue, Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed a plan
Thursday to help schools recruit and train 10,000 principals over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a speech at Queens College in her campaign for the
Senate, Clinton said the federal government should award a total of
$60 million a year to school districts that sorely need principals
and assistant principals. Schools could use the money, which would
come in the form of matching grants, to hire outstanding teachers
or people from other professions as principals.
</P>
<P>
   School districts could also use the grants to provide stipends
to ``master principals,'' who would train and provide support to
new principals, ideally with the help of nonprofit groups and
universities, Clinton said. Her proposal comes as an increasing
number of schools in New York City and across the nation are
struggling to replace principals who have retired or quit in the
face of mounting job pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``No school can reach its potential without a firm leader,''
Clinton said, addressing several hundred students and community
members. ``If we don't put an emphasis at the national level on
recruiting and training and placing more principals we are going to
fall further and further behind in the leadership gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that school districts should be required to
provide parents with statistics about violent incidents and
discipline problems in their children's schools. The information,
which would be posted on the Internet as part of a school's annual
report card, would include the number of students who were caught
with weapons and the number of violent incidents against teachers.
</P>
<P>
   She also introduced a plan to break some of the nation's largest
high schools into smaller schools, an idea that has already taken
off in many urban school districts, especially in New York City.
The proposal, which would cost $100 million a year in federal
funds, would focus primarily on high schools with several thousand
students.
</P>
<P>
   The new, smaller schools would remain in the same building and
use the same teachers, but most would need to hire new
administrators and support staff. School districts would receive
matching grants to cover hiring costs, Clinton's aides said.
Proponents of small high schools say they have fewer discipline
problems and higher graduation rates than large schools, which they
say breed violence and academic failure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York City, hundreds of small public schools have been
created over the last decade, many in buildings that once housed
enormous high schools. The schools often have a theme, like science
or the arts. Some are at the top of city achievement lists,
although others _ typically those that have been set up to serve
children who failed in traditional settings _ rank at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said money for the principal recruitment program
and the small schools program would come out of the federal budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do for children today what my parents and their
generation did for me and my classmates,'' she said. ``That means
we take this surplus, this moment of great prosperity, and we do
the responsible things with it. We don't give trillion-dollar tax
cuts, most of which go to people who are already doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reiterated many of her other education proposals,
some of which address the nationwide teacher shortage with promises
of scholarships and signing bonuses to people who agree to teach in
hard-to-staff schools. Her campaign also released a television
commercial Thursday that highlights her education proposals and
paints her as a longtime crusader for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island,
released a statement saying that Clinton's efforts to improve
education in Arkansas when her husband was that state's governor
were ``a dismal failure whereby taxpayers spent more money and got
worse results.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton ended her speech at Queens College, two audience
members stood and shouted, ``Hillary hates Israel!'' and ``Jew
hater!'' But they were practically drowned out by applause for
Clinton, and they quietly left the room. In a question-and-answer
session that followed, Clinton, who has had difficulty swaying
Jewish voters, outlined her views on the Middle East and said that
``a Palestinian state would make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that she was ``absolutely opposed to any
unilateral declaration of statehood'' by the Palestinians.

AIRLINER IS FORCED TO EVADE STEALTH JET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A United Airlines passenger plane leaving Los
Angeles for Boston on Thursday was forced to take evasive action
when it came too close to an Air Force stealth fighter shortly
after takeoff, airline and federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at 8:43 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time as the
passenger plane, United Airlines Flight 174, was climbing to 15,000
feet from Los Angeles International Airport. The anti-collision
device in the plane's cockpit detected an approaching aircraft and
issued an alert, said Chris Brathwaite, an airline spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The United pilot, who saw the F117 stealth fighter jet,
responded by dropping to 10,800 feet, Brathwaite said. There were
166 passengers and seven crew members aboard the Boeing 757, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force jet passed overhead, and our flight continued to
Boston without incident,'' Brathwaite said.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot B. Brenner, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the aircraft came within 500 feet vertically
of each other but were about two-thirds of a mile apart
horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collision avoidance system worked as designed and the two
aircraft were never in serious conflict,'' Brenner said. The FAA is
investigating the incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Johnny Whitaker, the deputy director of Air Force public
affairs, said the incident involved an F-117 stealth fighter
operating from the flight test center at Edwards Air Force Base,
which is about 100 miles from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Edwards said the Air Force was still gathering
information about the incident and had no additional information
immediately available. The F-117 is considered the most
sophisticated jet in the U.S. arsenal. It can evade most radar, but
is generally visible to anti-collision devices.

NYC POLICE UNION BACKS LAZIO OVER MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 27,000-member New York City Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association endorsed Rep. Rick Lazio for the Senate on
Thursday. Patrick Lynch, the president of the association, said
that Lazio ``does not jump on the bandwagon of criticism
unreasonably at a time when it's difficult to be a New York City
police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch was referring to a statement made in January by Lazio's
opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who referred to the ``murder of
Amadou Diallo'' shortly before the trial of the four police
officers who shot Diallo. The four officers were subsequently
acquitted. Although Clinton has said she misspoke and has
apologized for the remark, Lynch has not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went so far, although apologizing, to call us murderers,''
Lynch said during a news conference with Lazio on the steps of City
Hall, the site of near-constant political endorsements for local
candidates these days. A New York City police officer, Lynch added,
``takes offense to that.'' Lynch added that Clinton's statement was
``one of many'' she has made against the police.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch praised Lazio for supporting higher pay for New York City
police officers and for opposing federal oversight of the
department. The possibility of such oversight is now being
negotiated between City Hall and the U.S. attorney's office in the
Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although the endorsement by the city's police officers was not
unexpected, it was a boost for Lazio, whose relatively lax campaign
pace has worried state Republicans in recent weeks. ``This
endorsement means a great deal to me,'' Lazio said at the news
conference, adding that ``as a former prosecutor and as the
son-in-law of a former New York City detective, I know very well
how difficult this job is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign pointed out that Lazio voted in 1995 with
other Republicans against a Clinton administration program that
eventually put 100,000 more police officers on the nation's
streets, including more than 11,000 in New York state. Lazio
countered that his vote was based on his desire to see local
control of decisions about policing. ``The question is whether
Washington is going to dictate how that money's going to be spent
or whether we're going to spend it on our own priorities,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 New York Senate race, the PBA supported the
Republican incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato over then-Rep. Charles
Schumer, who won.

SCHOENEWEIS WAS DUE TO CATCH A BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Scott Schoeneweis has stood at his locker in
clubhouses throughout the American League this season, shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   In countless games this season, Schoeneweis pitched well enough
to win for the Anaheim Angels, only to have some freak play or bad
bounce end up costing him and the team. He also endured a six-week
stay on the disabled list with a pulled muscle in his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday against the Tigers, he got the breaks, made the plays
and won the game with eight scoreless innings in a 1-0 victory. It
was only his seventh win of the season despite his ability to pitch
deep into games.
</P>
<P>
   In his 23 starts, he has pitched into the sixth inning 21 times
and into the seventh inning 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Schoeneweis has maintained a good frame of mind
and not let it affect his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same game plan every game,'' said Schoeneweis, who
is 7-7 with a 4.89 ERA. ``I make little adjustments to get better,
but basically I'm trying to do the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think about those things (bad breaks), or say, 'Why
me? I should have more wins.' I just have to go out and keep doing
my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott has probably been the toughest-luck pitcher on the
staff,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``But he's pitched deep into
games and has a great attitude about it. In a 1-0 game like
(Wednesday) night, he's pitching on a tightrope. There is no margin
for error.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Staff absences: Three starting pitchers who were key to the
team's success earlier in the season _ Jarrod Washburn, Brian
Cooper and Seth Etherton _ are probably through for the season.
Washburn, who is recovering from a stress fracture in his left
shoulder, is the only one who has even a slight chance to return
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The club transferred Etherton (shoulder tendinitis) from the
15-day DL to the 60-day DL, meaning he wouldn't be eligible to
pitch again until the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes a little pressure off Seth in his mind to come back
before the season's over,'' Scioscia said. ``It's the same with
Jarrod. The chances of him pitching again this year are remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Etherton and Washburn are a combined 12-3 this season.
Meanwhile, Cooper (4-8, 5.90 ERA) is healthy but needs time to
`regroup,' according to Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we can get him back to being the
effective pitcher we know he can be,'' Scioscia said. ``Coop's been
trying for the past two months and he's just beating his head
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Records: All the big swings and big home runs the Angels are
producing are making it a record-breaking season in many
categories. Including strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn struck out once Thursday, his 154th of the season,
which leads the American League. And unless he suddenly turns into
Joe DiMaggio, he'll break the club record of 156, set in 1982 by
Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the DH for the second night in a row Thursday, giving
Scott Spiezio another start in the field.

BORING OUTPUT DATA POINT TO EXCITING PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the best economic news of this year is unfortunately the
sort many Americans probably find the most boring.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wednesday's update of second-quarter productivity data
no doubt made many eyes glaze over, it not only was exciting stuff
but also a reassuring harbinger of continuing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that productivity's April-June spurt was even
better than preliminary estimates indicated means Federal Reserve
policy-makers will be increasingly likely to put interest rate
hikes on the back burner for the time being. The higher the rate of
productivity growth, the greater the potential for noninflationary
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity-inflation link is mostly related to labor
costs. Rises in productivity, which measures worker output, mean
employers can increase wages without a pressing need to try to pass
on increased labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.
It also means companies are more likely to be able to maintain
profit margins without the need to hike prices.
</P>
<P>
   The question most on the minds of economists during this
productivity surge has been whether it's a cyclical or long-term
run. The pertinent numbers seem to foretell more of the same for a
long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter productivity was up at an annual rate of 5.7
percent instead of the 5.3 percent estimated earlier. This put the
April-June growth pace at triple the first quarter's rate. Year
over year, productivity soared 5.2 percent, which was the best
showing since 1983's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This is phenomenal when considered in the context of an economic
expansion nearing its 10th birthday. Productivity is supposed to
slow as expansions mature. Moreover, viewed over a generation's
worth of productivity performance, it's exceedingly impressive.
Over the last four years, productivity has increased an average of
2.5 percent a year, compared with a 1.6 percent annual growth rate
over the previous 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind this productivity resurgence? Nothing less than
the technology boom and continuing corporate enthusiasm for capital
investment in high-tech equipment. While overall capital spending
soared at a 20 percent-plus rate in the second quarter, tech
spending was up at a 30 percent-plus pace. Meanwhile, new orders
for tech equipment in June were up more than 40 percent from a year
ago, according to a recent Merrill Lynch report.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis by Merrill Lynch's research team also shows that
productivity gains lag tech spending by about 2 1/2 years and that
tech spending has risen at a 25 percent annual rate over the last
two years. This means recent tech outlays promise to sustain the
current level of productivity gains through 2002, at the very
least.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, labor costs, which might be considered the
flip side of the productivity picture, are showing give. They
declined at a 0.4 percent annual rate, which was the third such
drop over the last year. This doesn't necessarily mean workers are
making less, as some may infer, but only that worker output is
climbing faster than compensation. This is a win-win situation for
employees and employers, because rising worker value enhances both
company performance and job security. &QL;

CLERK'S ALLEGED SCHEME TO STEAL CASH OVERLOOKS SIGNIFICANT DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A night clerk's plan to steal cash from a
Shawnee, Kan., convenience store was elegantly simple, as far as
these things go:
</P>
<P>
   Police say he blocked the store's two security cameras by
putting tape over their lenses, stashed the money in a trash bin
and then called officers to report an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He made his biggest mistake when he selected the tape to mask
the cameras, police said. It was transparent tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things where (the videotape) looks a little
fuzzy, but I don't see any robbery in there,'' said Shawnee Police
Lt. Mitch Brim.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old clerk at the Texaco Starmart, 5501 Hedge Lane
Terrace, first told police early Thursday that a man had called the
store and ordered him to tape over the camera lenses. Then the man
walked in, pointed a pistol at the clerk and demanded money, the
clerk told police.
</P>

CHIEFS TO SIMULCAST OCT. 2 GAME AT KAUFFMAN STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM TEICHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lamar Hunt has always had big dreams, and the
founder of the Chiefs and the American Football League has hatched
another one.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt announced Thursday the Chiefs would try to break the NFL
regular-season record for paid attendance in their Oct. 2 game at
Arrowhead Stadium by selling about 12,300 tickets to watch a
simulcast on the video board at neighboring Kauffman Stadium.
Tickets for the Monday night game, in which the Chiefs play the
Seattle Seahawks, will cost $10.
</P>
<P>
   All Arrowhead Stadium tickets for the game, about 78,600 of
them, are sold. If the Chiefs can sell the full allotment at
Kauffman, the combined on-site total would surpass the NFL's
regular-season paid attendance of 90,833, set in 1958 when the
Chicago Bears played the Rams at Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   League records show an attendance of 102,368 for a
regular-season game between the San Francisco 49ers and Rams in Los
Angeles in 1957. But that total, according to the Chiefs, is a body
count, not paid attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has told us that any record we set will have to
have an asterisk by it. That's OK. I remember a baseball player
named Roger Maris, and he had a record with an asterisk by it,''
Hunt said of the former single-season home run champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get the record, that would be a great achievement.
If not, it's not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Shaw, the Chiefs' manager of public information and media
services, said the fans at Kauffman would be seated in the lower
level between the first- and third-base sides of the infield. That
area holds about 12,300.
</P>
<P>
   A parking lot is under construction at the Truman Sports
Complex, and the Chiefs think it will be ready by Oct. 2 to handle
the extra vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the Chiefs asked the NFL three years ago for
permission to simulcast at Kauffman. The league refused, saying it
would take away too many local TV viewers and reduce the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the league asked teams for help in promoting Monday
night telecasts. The Chiefs again offered their simulcast idea, and
this time the NFL agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions will be available at Kauffman Stadium. Hunt said the
Royals would receive all concession revenue from the extra fans.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are available in the usual ways _ at Ticketmaster
outlets, by phone at (816) 931-3330, or over the Internet at
www.ticketmaster.com. They also can be purchased at the Arrowhead
box office. Parking will cost $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believe new ideas are worth trying,'' Hunt said.``I'm
a little bit fearful that when this is done, it'll be known as
`Hunt's Folly.' &UR; '' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than four years ago, a little-known personal-injury lawyer
named Edward D. Fagan stood next to an Auschwitz survivor at a news
conference in New York and announced an audacious lawsuit, accusing
Swiss banks of stealing money 50 years ago from those who died in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fagan has a new and glamorous career and is likely soon
to earn millions of dollars in legal fees. He has since filed
lawsuits against banks, insurers and other companies in Austria,
Germany and elsewhere, charging that they too profited from Nazi
ties or exploited victims. Settlements of actions against Swiss
banks and German industry worth over $6.2 billion were recently
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawyers got involved in the Holocaust claims. But the
47-year-old Fagan cast himself apart as a media-savvy street
fighter who became the public point man in the cases. This July, he
hopscotched in a few days from Berlin to Vienna to Warsaw on behalf
of tens of thousands of people that he and lawyers associated with
him represent.
</P>
<P>
   They have also opened a second front, charging Japanese
companies in lawsuits with using thousands of Asians and others as
forced labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a posse,'' the tall, curly-haired and engaging
lawyer said. ``There are all these bad guys all over the world and
we have to track them down one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   His mission, he said, is to reach back into history and force a
reckoning with those who profited from evil. But an investigation
by The New York Times and the ABC News program ``20/20'' has found
that Fagan is facing his own reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   As he recast himself as a ``human rights'' lawyer, Fagan left
neglected personal-injury clients in his wake, abandoning their
claims or not returning their phone calls for years, according to
court papers and interviews. One former client recently won a
malpractice judgment against Fagan and ethics officials in New
Jersey filed a misconduct complaint against him last month on
behalf of another client.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, so at ease with using the emotional force of the
Holocaust as a weapon, also ignored for months scores of plaintive
calls and letters from aging Nazi-era survivors anxious about
whether their claims had been received, according to a paralegal
who worked last year for him and his partner at the time. Fagan
conceded he may have failed some clients by taking on too much
work. But he insisted that he did his best to represent his
personal-injury clients and that he labored ceaselessly in the
Holocaust cases without financial guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable to be a lawyer and to be able to use your
profession to do good,'' he said. ``To change history. To stand up
for people's human rights is incredible, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's conduct does not appear to have jeopardized the
financial claims of his Holocaust clients, but several survivors he
represented say that his failure to return calls for months, even
years, took an emotional toll.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Fagan played a leading role in
promoting the Holocaust claims, cases whose moral charge made them
a public cause. He specialized in shaming companies and
governments, orchestrating demonstrations and prayer vigils. Some
Holocaust survivors and advocates view him as their champion.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made it his business, while other lawyers were
painstakingly developing legal claims, to be first at the
courthouse, gaining leverage with a hasty filing. A news conference
with an aged survivor would soon follow, drawing in a flood of
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers in the Holocaust cases say Fagan's ambitions
vastly outstripped his resources to deal with the vast numbers of
clients he took on and added that he was often absent for the
grinding legal work. Burt Neuborne, who had worked with Fagan
before breaking with him, said Fagan's filing in the Swiss banks
case was so inadequate that a judge asked him to rewrite it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an ordinary man who got swept up in issues that were
bigger than he was,'' said Neuborne, a law professor at New York
University. ``He didn't understand and eventually didn't really
know how to behave and just got swept away in the current of his
own ego and his own ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlingen, Texas, Fagan grew up in nearby San Antonio
with two brothers and a sister. He once wanted to be a rabbi, and
studied in Israel. After his religious ardor waned, Fagan returned
to the United States and enrolled in Cardozo Law School in New
York, a part of Yeshiva University, graduating in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As Fagan began his claim against the Swiss banks in late 1996,
the claims of some of his personal-injury clients were apparently
abandoned or forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   One was Hector Ortiz. In 1992, Ortiz, a truck driver, smashed
into the back of a slow-moving crane, shattering bones and
sustaining head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fagan filed a $35 million lawsuit on his behalf in
federal court in Brooklyn and brought a similar action in state
Supreme Court there. He aggressively pursued the federal claim
until late 1996, court papers and interviews indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson Jr.
dismissed Ortiz's federal lawsuit, noting, among other things, that
Fagan had ``failed to prosecute'' it for three years and had
ignored court orders. Ortiz's claim in Brooklyn state court has
lain dormant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former client, Offer Salmoni, won a $167,000
malpractice judgment against Fagan, which the lawyer did not
contest. Fagan had filed a lawsuit on Salmoni's behalf in 1993 to
contest an eviction. Salmoni charged in a 1998 lawsuit that Fagan
had allowed that claim to be thrown out by repeatedly failing to
make court appearances and had let the statute of limitations
expire without refiling. Fagan, who is licensed to practice in New
York and New Jersey, said he planned to settle with Salmoni.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New Jersey ethics officials, after a preliminary
inquiry, filed a misconduct complaint before a grievance committee
against Fagan on behalf of another former client, Diane Gibbons.
Gibbons had complained to the ethics board that Fagan's failure to
file required papers in her personal-injury action led to its
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a legal-ethics expert at New York University
who is not involved in the Holocaust litigation, said that lawyers
face sanctions if they ignore existing claims when the prospects of
bigger awards beckon. ``Your loyalty to your original client is
undiluted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal-injury clients, whose names were provided to The
Times by Fagan, said he fought difficult cases on their behalf,
adding that they would use him again. But Fagan acknowledged that
he failed to withdraw _ as lawyers are required to _ from suits he
did not pursue.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999, with the Holocaust cases on the way to settlement,
Fagan had established his place on the world stage. When Jane
Warshaw, a paralegal, came to work for him that fall, she was
thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were doing God's work,'' said the paralegal,
57.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Fagan's partner at the time, Carey R. D'Avino,
asked her to check the office's telephone answering system. On it,
she found more than 100 unanswered messages from Holocaust
survivors as well as personal-injury clients, including Ortiz. It
sounded like many had been desperately calling for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Stacks of unopened letters from Holocaust survivors or their
heirs were scattered around and stuffed in a drawer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by what she viewed as client neglect, Warshaw in
January sent a recording of those calls and correspondence to U.S.
District Court Judge Edward R. Korman of Brooklyn, who is
overseeing the Swiss banks case. She also provided that material to
The Times and ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from the documents and recordings is
chaotic. New York disciplinary officials were investigating
complaints by three of Fagan's clients. Calls from Holocaust
claimants were bounced from one answering machine to another.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Bella Ross, said that her parents, concentration
camp survivors, were ecstatic when Fagan first took their case in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, you know, they had this savior,'' said Ross in a
recent interview. ``I mean, this is the man. You saw him on TV. You
heard about him on the radio. You see him in print. He is
everywhere. It was like finally they were blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, however, the family was so concerned about Fagan's
lack of response to dozens of messages and faxes that she filed a
complaint against him with New York disciplinary officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, Mr. Fagan has done nothing to update my parents on
the status of their case and is literally unreachable,'' Ross wrote
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Lieberman, a lawyer who represented Fagan in the matter,
told investigators in a March letter responding to Ross' complaint
that Fagan could not possibly deal with each of his tens of
thousands of clients.
</P>
<P>
   Other Holocaust lawyers, though, were devoting more extensive
resources to client communication. While some used paralegals to
handle calls, Neubourne, the New York University professor, said he
set aside four hours a week to deal directly with survivors,
including many of Fagan's clients who called him out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who lived with these memories for so long,''
Neubourne said. ``The memories were then opened up, somebody told
them something was going to happen. And then they just got cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan called Warshaw a ``disgruntled former employee,'' though
he conceded that some of her concerns were legitimate. He said he
spent much of his time in recent years traveling and that only a
few clients had complained.
</P>
<P>
   Korman referred Warshaw's complaint to court officials and
D'Avino said that a court investigator contacted him. Fagan said an
assistant was hired in June to answer calls and he believed the
matter was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Fagan arrived in Berlin as part of a victory lap in two
of the most significant cases. To settle slave-labor claims against
German industry, the government and companies there had approved a
$5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era survivors. Not long after,
Korman in Brooklyn approved the $1.25 billion settlement of the
Swiss banks case.
</P>
<P>
   During the signing of the settlement, though, Fagan dickered by
cell phone with Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury
secretary, about lawyers' fees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German plan, two arbitrators are to decide how to
award legal fees. Fagan argued with Eizenstat, who led negotiations
in the case for the U.S. government, that he understood that the
arbitrators had up to $75 million to award, not the $62.5 million
to which some other plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the call, Fagan telephoned a partner and said, ``I got the
legal fees up.'' But his excitement was premature; documents show
that the lower figure became the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that Fagan, after failing to get higher fees,
then asked for a letter testifying about his efforts in the German
case because he feared that lawyers critical of his conduct would
seek to reduce his payout. Eizenstat said he agreed to write such a
letter because he felt Fagan had played a constructive role.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's fears are well-founded. He is seeking $4 million in the
Swiss banks case, twice as much as any other lawyer. In that case,
as in other class actions, a judge or court-appointed expert will
determine fees. Lawyers like Fagan argue in such proceedings that
they deserve the fees they seek because they took great financial
risks and played a central role in a case's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuborne and others said in interviews they would argue
before Korman for a far lower sum for Fagan in the Swiss banks
case, contending that his contribution was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only gift was for publicity,'' said Martin Mendelsohn, a
lawyer in Washington who worked on the Holocaust claims. ``But this
was a lawsuit. It was not theater.''

DODGERS SIGN DEAL WITH VERO BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers have signed a deal with Vero Beach,
Fla., and Indian River County (Fla.) to keep their spring-training
home at Dodgertown for the next 20 years, a team official said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was expected, is contingent on the local
municipalities securing state funding. That's not expected to be a
problem. Vero Beach and Indian River County must file their
application for funding, which could reach $7.5 million, by Oct. 1.
An answer is expected by the New Year. The total financial package
put together by the local government is $20.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, which stems from the ``memorandum of
understanding'' all sides voted on during the summer, the Dodgers
will sell the complex to the local municipalities and lease it back
for $1 a year, a source said. Part of the complex was be renovated
for baseball and baseball operations, and a local developer will
build a ``town-plex'' on the remaining acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have trained at Dodgertown since 1948, but in the
past two years they have been courted by an Indian tribe in Arizona
and by officials looking to bring exhibition baseball to Las Vegas.

   Less than four years ago, a little-known personal-injury lawyer
named Edward D. Fagan stood next to an Auschwitz survivor at a news

whether their claims had been received, according to a paralegal
who worked last year for him and his partner at the time. That
paralegal, Jane Warshaw, was so distressed by what she saw that she
wrote in January to the federal judge overseeing the Swiss banks
case to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to witness what I have seen at this office,''
Warshaw wrote. `What is happening to these poor, old, injured and
neglected people is heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fagan conceded he may have failed some clients by
taking on too much work. But he insisted that he did his best to
represent his personal-injury clients and that he labored
ceaselessly in the Holocaust cases without financial guarantees,
winning results few would have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable to be a lawyer and to be able to use your
profession to do good,'' he said. ``To change history. To stand up
for people's human rights is incredible, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's conduct does not appear to have jeopardized the
financial claims of his Holocaust clients. In any settlement, they
would be eligible to get the same compensation as clients of more
attentive lawyers. But several survivors he represented say that
his failure to return calls for months, even years, took a
wrenching emotional toll. Legal-ethics experts say lawyers are
obligated to answer client queries within a reasonable period, even
in a huge class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan is a frenetic man who appears inseparable from his cell
phone. He had hoped to be a rabbi, failed at business and ran a
struggling legal practice before he stumbled into the Holocaust
litigation and a potential gold mine in legal fees. In the Swiss
banks suit alone, he is seeking $4 million, the most sought by any
lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Fagan played a leading role in
promoting the Holocaust claims, cases whose moral charge made them
a public cause. He specialized in shaming companies and
governments, orchestrating demonstrations and prayer vigils. Some
Holocaust survivors and advocates view him as their champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a master in public relations,'' said Hannah Lessing, an
official of a state-financed group in Austria for Holocaust
victims. ``Behind all the facade of yelling and screaming, there is
a man who cares for survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also made it his business, while other lawyers were
painstakingly developing legal claims, to be first at the
courthouse, gaining leverage with a hasty filing. A news conference
with an aged survivor would soon follow, drawing in a flood of
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan represents far more Holocaust claimants than most other
lawyers, giving him a powerful role in negotiations. The actual
number of clients is apparently a matter of some confusion. In one
interview, Fagan put the figure at 82,000, but his own lawyer cited
a different one _ 52,000 _ in a March response to a client
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers in the Holocaust cases say Fagan's ambitions
vastly outstripped his resources to deal with the vast numbers of
clients he took on and added that he was often absent for the
grinding legal work. Burt Neuborne, who had worked with Fagan

<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Here Are Defendants'
</P>
<P>
   Fagan has said that two pieces of information led him to the
Swiss banks case. The first was a 1996 article in The New York
Times that discussed Nazi gold and Swiss banks. The other came from
a longtime client, Gizella Weisshaus, an Auschwitz survivor who
told him about her family's Swiss account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the article,'' he recalled, ``and I thought, `Oh my
goodness, I'm a lawyer, here are defendants. I don't know who the
plaintiffs are, I don't know who the plaintiffs are going to be,
but someone is going to pay.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss banks case would also apparently be the way to satisfy
his gnawing hunger for acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlingen, Texas, Fagan grew up in nearby San Antonio
with two brothers and a sister, all from his mother's first
marriage. Fagan's father abandoned the family, according to Wayne
Fagan, the lawyer's oldest brother. His other brother, Avraham,
embraced Orthodox Judaism and Fagan followed him to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a rabbi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His religious ardor waned, and Fagan returned to the United
States and enrolled in Cardozo Law School in New York, a part of
Yeshiva University, graduating in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years with a large law firm that represented
corporate defendants. But in the late 1980s, Fagan, searching for
something with more panache, tried to start an exploration club for
the wealthy. Travelers would sail by yacht to exotic locales,
accompanied by ocean scientists and environmentalists. In 1991 he
set up the Odyssoe Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the business, to
support environmental research. But the whole venture fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, soon after returning to law, he rented the entire 21st
floor of the former Standard Oil building in New York City,
complete with the original, opulent board room. He tried to support
his tiny firm, Fagan &AMP; Associates, by subletting space to other
lawyers and advertising for personal-injury clients in the yellow
pages.
</P>
<P>
   He was eager, however, for the spotlight, trying to interest a
tabloid in one case. In 1994, he asserted in a fax to the Star
magazine that the actor Sylvester Stallone had tried to defraud a
client of his who owned three paintings by Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been been an article of this nature with a
celebrity (of this stature) involving fraud and his artwork,''
Fagan wrote, according to papers in a libel lawsuit that Stallone
filed against him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine never published the article and Stallone withdrew
his libel action.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Fagan got on television representing a
6-year-old Queens girl who had been stabbed with a hypodermic
needle by a homeless man on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   But at same time, his finances and his business ties were
unraveling, public records show. He began to owe large amounts of
federal income taxes, a debt he said he has recently mostly paid
off. In 1996, the yellow pages unit of the former Nynex Corp. filed
a $228,000 lawsuit against the Odyssoe Foundation in a New Jersey
state court for unpaid services like advertising for his legal
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he had ordered the ads through the nonprofit, rather
than his law firm, because it was also the billing address of some
telephone lines at his firm. He said he believed the matter had
been resolved, but a spokeswoman for Verizon, the successor company
to Nynex, said the bill was still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an eviction proceeding for unpaid rent, he was forced
in 1997 to leave his lavish offices and rent space from a law firm
in the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony of his professional life spilled over into his
closest relations. In the mid 1990s, Fagan severed ties with his
three siblings, said his brother Wayne, a lawyer in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Fagan, whose clientele has included Arab royalty, said:
``Eddie was a warm, jovial person who was like a pied piper. But
something happened and Eddie just changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cases Left Behind
</P>
<P>
   With Fagan's claim against the Swiss banks on behalf of
Weisshaus and others in late 1996, he embraced a new mission. But
the claims of some of his personal-injury clients were apparently
abandoned or forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   One was Hector Ortiz. In 1992, Ortiz, a 49-year-old truck
driver, smashed into the back of a slow-moving crane, shattering
bones and sustaining head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fagan filed a $35 million lawsuit on his behalf in
federal court in Brooklyn and brought a similar action in state
Supreme Court there. He aggressively pursued the federal claim
until late 1996, court papers and interviews indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson Jr.
dismissed Ortiz's federal lawsuit, noting, among other things, that
Fagan had ``failed to prosecute'' it for three years and had
ignored court orders. Ortiz's claim in Brooklyn state court has
lain dormant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said that Ortiz came to his office about a year ago and
that he had told him then that his federal claim was dead but had
yet to inform him that his state case also appeared at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who has not worked since the accident, disputed that
account, saying in a phone interview that he had not seen or spoken
with Fagan for more than two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting in vain,'' he said. ``I didn't know something
like this could happen. Right now I'm confused. I don't know what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another client, Tomas Giron, was struck and severely injured in
1992 by a car that its owner had reported stolen. Fagan said he had
made a claim on Giron's behalf to a New York state fund that
compensates victims of uninsured motorists but that it had been
denied.

SENATE VOTES TO PREVENT RAISING LEVEL OF MISSOURI RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a vote cast under threat of a presidential veto,
the U.S. Senate on Thursday decided that the level of the Missouri
River should not be raised in the spring to improve wildlife
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 52-45 to prevent the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers from releasing extra water from the Gavins Point Dam near
Yankton, S.D., at least once every three springs.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the river would enhance the breeding of two rare species
of birds, the piping plover and interior least tern, as well as one
rare fish, the bottom-dwelling pallid sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Kit Bond and John Ashcroft, Missouri Republicans, argued
against the river plan, contained in a $22.5 billion bill financing
energy and water projects. They said it could cause flooding of
downstream farms and towns without guaranteeing the protection of
the birds and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they said, the spring releases would cut the amount of
water available to release in the summer, inhibiting barge traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, Missouri won big today,'' said Bond, who
wrote the provision against the river plan. ``We were able to
protect Missourians from a federally backed flooding scheme that
would have endangered countless Missourians along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would veto the $22.5 billion
appropriations bill unless it protects the birds and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat running to unseat
Ashcroft, sided with the two Republicans and wrote to Clinton last
month.
</P>
<P>
   A veto could be unpopular with Missouri farmers and the state
overall, and Missouri is considered a swing state in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who wanted to raise
the river level, said he was heartened the Bond provision didn't
win enough support to overturn a veto, which takes a two-thirds
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote today gives us more than enough Senate support to
make long-overdue changes that will lead to better management and
improved recreational opportunities along the river,'' said
Daschle, the Senate minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   He said outdated river management policies favor the $7 million
barge industry downstream but threaten a $90 million recreation
industry upstream, as well as the wildlife species.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle agrees with the Missourians that releasing extra water
in the spring would mean releasing less in the summer. But, he
argues, that would leave more water during the summer in four South
Dakota reservoirs upstream from Gavins Point for boating, fishing
and other recreation.
</P>
<P>
   While Daschle stressed the recreational benefits, the official
reason for pushing the change was a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
discovery that the Endangered Species Act would be violated if the
birds and fish weren't protected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited that act and the need for a more balanced use of
the river for commerce and recreation in threatening the veto.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate vote a Clinton spokesman, Jason Schechter,
said: ``We have no intention of letting this language become law.
If it takes a veto, that's what we will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has backed a similar Bond provision for four years.
This year, however, the wildlife service determined that higher
levels would cleanse sandbars of vegetation that can serve as
hiding places for predators of the plover and tern. More water
would help sturgeon breed.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Smith, director of the Missouri River field office of
American Rivers, a conservation group, agreed: ``Without changes in
the flow of the Missouri River, these three species will disappear.
That is crystal clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Natural Resources disagrees that
raising the river would help, saying it may even inundate nesting
sites while also increasing the risk of floods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern over endangered species, much of the Senate
debate concerned flooding and barge traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said a veto would send a clear message to Missouri:
``The Clinton-Gore administration is willing to flood downstream
communities as part of an unscientific, risky scheme that will hurt
not help the endangered species it was designed to protect. If
that's the message, I wouldn't want to be the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said voters in key election states would take note of a
veto and the risk of higher water levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does that, it's a disaster for all those states and I'm
sure going to talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schechter, the White House spokesman, said presidential politics
will not play a part. ``We will address this on its merits,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   An Ashcroft aide chided Carnahan for not swaying Democrats to
vote against Daschle. The only Democrat to do so was Sen. Blanche
Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spokesman Tony Wyche said it was illogical to think the
governor would hold sway with senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should take note of the willingness of the Ashcroft
campaign to partisanize and politicize everything for their own
gain, even when they agree with us on a subject,'' Wyche said.
``It's absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle disagreed with Bond about the risk of flooding, saying
no extra water would be released if water levels are already high.
``Let no one be misled,'' he said. ``This has nothing do to with
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the barge industry accounts for only three
tenths of 1 percent of the transportation of farm products.
</P>
<P>
   Bond argued that hampering barge traffic would shift business to
higher-priced rail and highway shippers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flood risk, Bond said water takes 11 days to get from
Gavins Point to St. Louis and that no one could predict how much
rain might fall over that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that people, property and fish can all be protected
at the same time without increased risk of flooding,'' he said. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rubinton, the fund's president, though, said in an
interview that its records showed that such a claim had not been
pursued and that the statute of limitations on making such a claim
had long expired.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former client, Offer Salmoni, won a $167,000
malpractice judgment against Fagan, which the lawyer did not
contest. Fagan had filed a lawsuit on Salmoni's behalf in 1993 to
contest an eviction. Salmoni charged in a 1998 lawsuit that Fagan
had allowed that claim to be thrown out by repeatedly failing to
make court appearances and had let the statute of limitations
expire without refiling. Fagan, who is licensed to practice in New
York and New Jersey, said he planned to settle with Salmoni.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New Jersey ethics officials, after a preliminary
inquiry, filed a misconduct complaint before a grievance committee
against Fagan on behalf of another former client, Diane Gibbons.
Gibbons had complained to the ethics board that Fagan's failure to
file required papers in her personal-injury action led to its
dismissal. Fagan said he could not comment on the matter because it
was pending.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a legal-ethics expert at New York University
who is not involved in the Holocaust litigation, said that lawyers
face sanctions if they ignore existing claims when the prospects of
bigger awards beckon. ``Your loyalty to your original client is
undiluted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal-injury clients, whose names were provided to The
Times by Fagan, said that the lawyer fought difficult cases on
their behalf, adding that they would not hesitate to use him again.
But Fagan acknowledged that he failed to withdraw _ as lawyers are
required to _ from suits that he did not pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in over my head a lot of the time,'' he said. ``But now
I'm digging out, for me and for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unanswered Calls, New Inquiries
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999, with the Holocaust cases on the way to settlement,
Fagan had established his place on the world stage. When Jane
Warshaw, a paralegal, was sent by a temporary-help agency to work
that fall for him and his then-partner at the World Trade Center,
she was deeply thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were doing God's work,'' said the paralegal,
who at 57 is spunky with reddish hair.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Fagan's partner at the time, Carey R. D'Avino,
asked her to check the office's telephone answering system. On it,
she found more than 100 unanswered messages from Holocaust
survivors as well as personal-injury clients, including Ortiz. It
sounded like many had been desperately calling for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Stacks of unopened letters from Holocaust survivors or their
heirs were scattered around and stuffed in a drawer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have gotten their hopes up and then, there again,
they were told that they just didn't matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said she suggested to D'Avino that she prepare a
newsletter to keep clients updated, an accepted practice in
class-action suits. The lawyer said he told her that their clients
were already getting periodic newsletters. He described her as
``well-meaning'' but ``out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, troubled by what she viewed as a pattern of client
neglect, the paralegal sent a tape recording of those calls and
office correspondence to U.S. District Court Judge Edward R. Korman
of Brooklyn, who is overseeing the Swiss banks case. She also
provided that material to The Times and ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from the documents and recordings is
chaotic. New York disciplinary officials were investigating
complaints by three of Fagan's clients. Calls from Holocaust
claimants were bounced from one answering machine to another.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Bella Ross, said that her parents, concentration
camp survivors, were ecstatic when Fagan first took their case in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, you know, they had this savior,'' said Ross in a
recent interview. ``I mean, this is the man. You saw him on TV. You
heard about him on the radio. You see him in print. He is
everywhere. It was like finally they were blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, however, the family was so concerned about Fagan's
lack of response to dozens of messages and faxes that she filed a
complaint against him with New York disciplinary officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, Mr. Fagan has done nothing to update my parents on
the status of their case and is literally unreachable,'' Ross wrote
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Lieberman, a lawyer who represented Fagan in the matter,
told investigators in a March letter responding to Ross' complaint
that Fagan could not possibly deal with each of his tens of
thousands of clients. Both D'Avino and Fagan said in interviews
that they had fulfilled their ethical obligations to their clients;
to date, there have been no findings against them.
</P>
<P>
   Other Holocaust lawyers, though, were devoting more extensive
resources to client communication. While some used paralegals to
handle calls, Neubourne, the New York University professor, said he
set aside four hours a week to deal directly with survivors,
including many of Fagan's clients who called him out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who lived with these memories for so long,''
Neubourne said. ``The memories were then opened up, somebody told
them something was going to happen. And then they just got cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clients said Fagan returned phone calls promptly and others
involved in Holocaust-related issues said they also had had far
happier experiences with Fagan. They described him as a passionate
advocate who took up a fight that traditional Jewish groups had
allowed to languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was the only true source of light,'' said Dr. Thomas Weiss,
an ophthamologist in Miami Beach who has been active in Nazi-era
claims against insurers. ``He saw himself as picked by Providence
to lead this charge.''

</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fagan described Warshaw as a ``disgruntled former
employee,'' though he conceded that some of her concerns were
legitimate. He said he spent much of his time in recent years
traveling and that only a few clients had complained. ``You know
the truth of the matter is that some people are going to be
unhappy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korman referred Warshaw's complaint to court officials and
D'Avino said that a court investigator contacted him. Fagan said an
assistant was hired in June to answer calls and he believed the
matter was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Korman said that court officials did not
confirm or deny the existence of an inquiry until a judge issued a
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling at the Top
</P>
<P>
   In July, Fagan arrived in Berlin as part of a victory lap in two
of the most significant cases. To settle slave-labor claims against
German industry, the government and companies there had approved a
$5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era survivors. Not long after,
Korman in Brooklyn approved the $1.25 billion settlement of the
Swiss banks case.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan savored the moment as he joined government officials,
industry leaders and the heads of Jewish groups at the signing
ceremony for the German agreement. ``I know for a fact that the
majority of these cases wouldn't have happened without me,'' he
said. ``That's not bravado, it's just a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   During the historic signing, though, Fagan dickered by cell
phone with Stuart E. Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary,
about lawyers' fees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German plan, two arbitrators are to decide how to
award legal fees. Fagan argued with Eizenstat, who led negotiations
in the case for the U.S. government, that he understood that the
arbitrators had up to $75 million to award, not the $62.5 million
to which some other plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the call, Fagan telephoned a partner and said, ``I got the
legal fees up.'' But his excitement was premature; documents show
that the lower figure became the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that Fagan, after failing to get higher fees,
then asked for a letter testifying about his efforts in the German
case because he feared that lawyers critical of his conduct would
seek to reduce his payout. Eizenstat said he agreed to write such a
letter because he felt Fagan had played a constructive role.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's fears are well-founded. He is seeking $4 million in the
Swiss banks case, twice as much as any other lawyer. In that case,
as in other class actions, a judge or court-appointed expert will
determine fees. Lawyers like Fagan argue in such proceedings that
they deserve the fees they seek because they took great financial
risks and played a central role in a case's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuborne and others said in recent interviews they would
argue before Judge Korman for a far lower sum for Fagan in the
Swiss banks case, contending that his contribution was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only gift was for publicity,'' said Martin Mendelsohn, a
lawyer in Washington who worked on the Holocaust claims. ``But this
was a lawsuit. It was not theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   New Clients to Pursue
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Berlin on the day of the signing
ceremony, Fagan tried to tantalize reporters: ``Nobody wants to
know where we're going next?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, Fagan and lawyers associated with him had set
their sights on a new target, Japan. They fanned out to
destinations like Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand
and the Philippines in a bid to sign up thousands of people who
claimed they were used as forced laborers, including former
American and Allied prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Hair, director of a group in Miami that represents American
civilians interned by the Japanese, said that Fagan called him in
December and characterized himself as the ``hero of the Holocaust''
cases before he began his sales pitch. Hair, who already had a
lawyer, declined.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Fagan flew to Tokyo to make client contacts at a
conference held by groups representing victims of Japanese wartime
aggression, said several people who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Public demonstrations, Fagan's stock in trade, soon followed.
This summer, hundreds of old men and women passed into a downtown
park in Seoul, South Korea, under a banner that, roughly
translated, read, ``For the first time in 55 years we have brought
action by human rights lawyers from the United States against the
Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rally's end, a Korean folk band playing drums and cymbals
led the crowd down a Seoul street as a man chanted through a
loudspeaker ``The Japanese government should repent and compensate
for their atrocities of World War II. Repent. Repent. Repent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he plans to move forward, addressing more World War
II wrongs and other human rights causes. But some, like Warshaw,
can only see the trail of broken promises and failed hopes he has
already left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can ignore someone, especially when you've
said, `I'm here to help you, I'm going to help you''' she said.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday dismissed
criticism from some Republicans over the direction of his campaign.
But he also called himself the underdog in the race and said he
would restyle his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides said he would start appearing at town hall
meetings again as early as next week. Such sessions disappeared in
March after Sen. John McCain dropped from the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said the Texas
governor was also likely to start visiting coffee shops and
cafeterias and might begin to visit families to discuss how his tax
cut plan would affect them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he wanted to hold such events, Bush said, ``Well, it's
a better picture.'' He said that if his unscripted encounters were
mostly with reporters on his campaign plane, ``people don't get a
sense of my ability to relate to people. They don't get a sense
that my plan has got real purposes for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes repeatedly used a similar phrase, ``real plans for real
people,'' making it clear that this was the Bush campaign's new
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments at an impromptu news conference on an
airport tarmac in Detroit after prominent Republicans across the
country expressed concern over the state of his campaign and after
a series of national and state polls showed that Vice President Al
Gore was solidifying the gains he had made after the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Thursday by ABC News and The Washington Post
found the race tied, with Bush and Gore each attracting 47 per-
cent. A Gallup Organization poll for CNN and USA Today found Mr.
Gore leading Bush, 47 percent to 44 percent, a result that is also
essen- tially a tie, since it is within the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   And while he said he would change some events, Bush also waved
off some of the second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Washington,'' he said. ``That's people getting ready to
jump out of the foxhole before the first shell is fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the military analogy on a day when he campaigned with
two of the most prominent figures of his father's administration,
Colin L. Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
J. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded U.S. troops during the Persian
Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Both voiced support for Bush's contention that President Clinton
had allowed the military to deteriorate, leaving it unprepared for
post-Cold War conflicts. And Powell called Bush ``a man with a
mission, a man with vision, a man who is committed to making sure
the armed forces of the United States will always be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans who had voiced concerns about the shape
of the Bush campaign seemed particularly concerned about Bush's
refusal to agree to debates sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates. They said his stance had made him seem timid
and had taken him into an unproductive fight over political process
rather than issues.
</P>
<P>
   While he continued to criticize Gore for rejecting his offer for
a different set of debates _ two of them shorter and before smaller
audiences than the commission debates _ Bush for the first time
gave some suggestion that there was give to his position. ``There
will be debates,'' he said. ``I am confident there will be debates.
As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out
in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush even joked that he ``may go more alpha male coming down the
stretch.'' That was a dig at Gore, who had a feminist author on his
payroll last year, advising him how to dress and act like an alpha
male. ``I'm under no illusions and neither should our supporters be
_ it's going to be a tough contest,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was the underdog, Bush jumped at the label.
``Yeah,'' he said. ``I'm the underdog. But I was the underdog when
I first started.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new campaign style is reminiscent of the retooling of his
primary campaign in South Carolina in February after his drubbing
by McCain in the New Hampshire primary. Bush began holding town
meetings, which had been his opponent's trademark. And he tried to
appropriate McCain's reform mantle, calling himself a ``reformer
with results.''
</P>
<P>
   The events Bush and his aides were describing Thursday,
similarly echoed of the style of Gore, who has been holding town
hall meetings, visiting teachers in their homes and stopping into
coffee shops to talk to workers. Gore often talks of fighting for
``working people.'' Bush is now speaking of working for ``real
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the governor and his aides had thought they were not
being ``creative'' enough. She said the campaign had fallen into
auto-pilot, simply using the rally formats that had worked for well
for the governor on his ride into the Republican National
Convention. She said Bush wanted to put a human face on his policy
proposals by meeting with people and showing how they would benefit
under his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign derided Bush's portrayal of himself as an
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who raised $100 million in this campaign, a
record, from the special interests _ the HMOs, the prescription
drug companies and the big oil industry,'' said Chris Lehane,
Gore's spokesman. ``It's Al Gore who has an agenda that represents
the underdog and George W. Bush who has an agenda that represents
the special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new style was not visible Thursday, however, as he turned
to military themes and showcased at his side Powell and
Schwarzkopf. At Wright University in Dayton, under a banner
proclaiming ``Respecting America's Military,'' Bush introduced the
former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Desert Storm
commander, and each one gave him a strong endorsement as the best
man to be commander in chief.

 AS MOVIE EXHIBITORS CROWD BANKRUPTCY COURT, amc STICKS TO ITS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Dark days have descended on the overbuilt
movie exhibition industry. Two of the largest chains already are in
the fog of bankruptcy, and more are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But despite industry rumors, Kansas City-based AMC Entertainment
Inc. is adamant that it's not in the bankruptcy waiting line. It
insists it's nowhere close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in compliance with all of our (bank agreements), and we
expect to stay that way,'' said AMC spokesman Richard King,
referring to the terms it must meet in managing its heavy debt.
``We're not thinking about bankruptcy _ it's not even on our radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wall Street, thus far, is maintaining faith in AMC's words
and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts who follow the company contend, as they have for
some time, that AMC is best positioned to return to profitability
once the overbuilt industry goes through the valley of
restructuring. That faith endures, in spite of AMC's loss of 90
percent of its market capitalization value since July 1999, a
figure similar to what other exhibitors have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Already going through bankruptcy are United Artists Theatre Co.,
which filed for Chapter 11 protection Wednesday, and Carmike
Cinemas Inc., which filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in line are Regal Cinemas Inc., which has said that
it's going to violate covenants of its bank agreements and that
Chapter 11 is an option, and Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which
also has warned that it's going to break its bank agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, management at Cinemark USA Inc. is being
tight-lipped, although Kevin Kuzio, a fixed-income analyst at KDP
Investments, thinks Cinemark will probably violate terms of its
lending agreements as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the industry is on track'' for bankruptcy reorganization,
said Kuzio, who closely follows the exhibition industry. ``The
question is: Can half the industry restructure and the other half
not and effectively be positioned to compete with those who have?''
</P>
<P>
   Benefits of bankruptcy
</P>
<P>
   At one time, companies going the Chapter 11 bankruptcy route
were forever emblazoned with a scarlet B on their reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more industries have gone through shakeouts
similar to the retail bloodbath of the 1980s, the stigma has
lessened.
</P>
<P>
   Though still not a desired route, bankruptcy reorganization does
have tremendous benefits. The two major opportunities presented by
Chapter 11, which protects a company from its creditors while it
reorganizes, are a one-time chance to walk away from leases on
money-losing locations and the chance to shed millions of dollars
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, United Artists is getting rid of $460 million in
debt and walking away from 70 poor theater locations.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, one of the biggest losers in a Chapter 11 are the
shareholders, who are very last in line as the company gets sliced
and diced. For instance, in Payless Cashways' Chapter 11
reorganization in 1997, shareholders got one share of new stock for
each 100 shares of old stock, stock that today is worth about $1.50
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another group that's vulnerable are bondholders. In United
Artists' reorganization, the holders of $275 million in bonds are
getting only 7 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   But once a company makes it through Chapter 11, it has a much
better chance of returning to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry dynamics will be that the half that emerge from
Chapter 11 will be a lot healthier than they are today,'' Kuzio
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the plan
</P>
<P>
   So why does Wall Street maintain some faith in AMC? There are a
couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company has the newest circuit of theaters and the
highest screen count per location. That means more of its screens
are in megaplexes than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as of June, AMC had 13.9 screens per location, the
highest of the six largest theater chains. Next closest was
Cinemark, probably AMC's most formidable and direct competitor,
with 11.6.
</P>
<P>
   The four others were Regal with 10.5, Loews with 7.6, United
Artists with 7.2 and Carmike with 6.3.
</P>
<P>
   That puts AMC in a better position relative to its competition.
And that was always AMC's plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's annual meeting in December 1997, company
founder Stan Durwood told shareholders that in three years the
company planned on having about 3,000 screens spread over 150 to
175 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost three years later, AMC has 2,726 screens spread over
195 locations.
</P>
<P>
   What many underestimated was the building fury that was
unleashed when Durwood built a better mousetrap _ the Grand 24 in
Dallas, the first megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five years later, the industry has almost 36 percent more
screens than it can support. And with the newer megaplex screens
averaging $270,000 each to build, every big exhibitor has bled
plenty of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor that cheers Wall Street is that AMC has
accelerated the closing of money-losing screens and cut its
selling, general and administrative costs by almost $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time like this, when exhibitors have weak product, that's
going to be very beneficial,'' Kuzio said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurray for Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   So what does Hollywood think about this whole mess on the
exhibition side?
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be pretty ho-hum. No one is stepping up and saying
anything about helping the exhibition brethren.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hollywood's take from the box office, which
historically hovers right at 50-50, last year jumped to 53.3
percent of total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one studio was pressuring exhibitors to include
transaction fees from the sale of tickets by telephone and Internet
in the total revenue pot.
</P>
<P>
   And while 20 or 30 years ago almost 90 percent of Hollywood's
take on a movie came from exhibition in North America, that has
plummeted to around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Hollywood has dropped the ball on
producing hits; box office attendance is down 6 percent from last
year. And now, the Olympics are looming over the industry, a
once-every-four-years occurrence that further depresses theater
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the odds
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Kuzio said AMC had a 25 percent likelihood of
defaulting on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kuzio said the likelihood was higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little closer, because the industry in general is
bearing down on them,'' Kuzio said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuzio said a Chapter 11 was an efficient way to strengthen a
company. But he didn't think AMC would voluntarily file for
bankruptcy unless it had no recourse.
</P>
<P>
   The two events that could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy
filing would be a liquidity issue or bank covenant violations.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the concentration of ownership with AMC would make it
less likely to seek Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   That concentration is in the Stanley H. Durwood Foundation, a
charitable trust that got all of the company's class B shares after
Durwood died in July 1999. Those shares control 67.5 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Durwood's death, foundation trustee Raymond F.
Beagle Jr. said Durwood's estate and succession plan had two
purposes _ to create stability for the company and its employees,
and to create stability for the holders of the 19.4 million shares
of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Durwood, one of Stan Durwood's sons, said he and his
siblings all owned AMC stock in varying amounts.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his siblings still had total confidence in AMC's
chairman, Peter Brown, handpicked by his father to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have faith in Peter and the whole team, and I think AMC
saw this coming and made a lot of appropriate steps,'' Durwood
said. ``But, you know, who would have thought a year ago that it
would come to this?'' &QL;

 DAYTON, Ohio: in chief.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush also hinted at stops across the day that he would name
Powell to his administration. ``The general talked about being
retired from public service,'' he said here, then glanced at Powell
and added puckishly, ``If all goes well. ...'' The crowd erupted in
cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged that he would push for modernization of the
military to meet the new threats in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the nation had the chance to ``redefine how war
is fought and won in the future, and therefore we have the
opportunity to redefine how the peace is kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if elected he would assemble a task force of
military leaders to come up with a ``strategic plan'' for what the
military of the future should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's not going to look like the great American moment
of Desert Storm and Desert Shield,'' Bush said. ``A military of the
future is not going to be that heavy, and it's not going to be that
hard to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events were designed to put the gulf war leaders at
center stage in order to endorse the son of the man they served
under. Schwarzkopf called himself proud to ``stand up and endorse''
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Powell lambasted the Clinton administration for hurting military
readiness, a theme that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
have been hitting hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and frankly deeply disappointed the other day
when the president's spokesman attacked Dick Cheney because he
dared to tell the truth about the state of readiness, and said he
was attacking the military,'' Powell said. ``Dick Cheney has never
attacked the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney pressed the same theme in appearances at military
contractors in New England. He recalled a telephone call he had
made to former President Ronald Reagan after the gulf war, saying
he had thanked Reagan the money his administration had spent on the
military. ``I ask myself,'' he said, ``is anybody going to call
Bill Clinton or Al Gore in the future to thank them for what they
did to the U.S. military? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, challenged several
of the assertions Bush made in his speeches Thursday. Bacon said
that the administration, along with Congress, had increased defense
spending by $150 billion over the next several years. That included
an increase in spending on weapons and other equipment _ an area
where Bush was sharply critical _ from $43 billion in 1998 to $60
billion today, as well as three straight years of pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also noted that the number of troops qualifying for food
stamps _ which Bush has often cited as evidence that the Clinton
administration had neglected men and women in uniform _ had
declined significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that 19,400 service members, 0.9 percent of the
total, collected food stamps in 1991, when Bush's father was
president and Cheney Cheney was secretary of defense. Today, Bacon
said, 5,100 are on food stamps, or 0.4 percent of a smaller force.

 CONNECTICUT SUES 4 BIG HMOs OVER DENIAL OF CLAIMS  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Connecticut's attorney general filed a federal
lawsuit Thursday against four of the state's largest HMOs, charging
them with improperly denying medical claims, obstructing access to
prescription drugs, delaying payments to doctors and misinforming
patients about their rights to appeal decisions about their health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Hartford,
seeks to represent thousands of clients who, according to Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal, have suffered physically and
financially from the organizations' practice of putting profits
ahead of patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have engaged in a pattern of conduct that has denied
essential medical treatment to patients,'' Blumenthal said at a
news conference in his office Thursday morning. ``They have forced
people to accept less-effective care simply so the company can
increase its profits.''
</P>
<P>
   All four companies named in the suit issued statements Thursday
stressing their commitment to high-quality patient care. Two
offered to meet with Blumenthal to discuss the charges. Oxford
Health Plans, based in Norwalk, went further, contesting many of
the lawsuit's allegations and chiding the attorney general for not
having met with company officials to discuss the allegations
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The three other HMOs and their Connecticut subsidiaries named in
the suit are Cigna Health Plans, based in Bloomfield, and its
subsidiary, CIGNA HealthCare of Connecticut; Foundation Health
Systems of Los Angeles, and its subsidiary, Physicians Health
Services of Connecticut; and Anthem Health Plans, in Indianapolis,
and its subsidiary, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the four national HMOs provide medical services to
more than 800,000 Connecticut residents, as well as hundreds of
thousands of others in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court judge must determine whether the lawsuit
meets the legal requirements for the class-action status Blumenthal
is seeking. If it does, Connecticut would become the first state to
file such a suit against HMOs and the first to do so on behalf of
consumers, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Texas filed a suit against Aetna U.S. Healthcare
accusing it of providing improper financial incentives to doctors
to limit patient care. The two sides settled the suit earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks no money award; instead,
Blumenthal said he intended to provoke the four HMOs into
reconsidering what he called ``misguided management'' that put
patients in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the suit contends that the HMOs illegally deny
hospitalization costs beyond a set number of days, regardless of a
patient's medical needs. It also charges the companies with so
strictly limiting the list of prescription drugs they will
subsidize that they effectively deny patients necessary medicines,
without denial notices or notifying clients of their rights to
appeal. The HMOs also intentionally ignore inquiries from their
clients, the lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for fundamental, far-reaching changes to the way
they do business,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Internal documents outlining the policies of HMOs, he added,
will provide powerful evidence that they have consistently violated
federal guidelines that require them to administer health plans
solely in the interest of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The suit does not charge Physicians Health Services with denying
prescription drugs to clients, a charge Blumenthal brought against
the company in a previous lawsuit. Dismissed by a federal court
judge, that suit is now being considered by a federal appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message, a spokeswoman for Oxford Health Plans said
that Thursday's broad allegations were misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxford pays clean claims on average within seven days
(significantly faster than industry norms), Oxford answers member
inquiries in a timely manner, Oxford has all but eliminated
retrospective denials through a concurrent review program we
introduced over a year ago and Oxford offers drug benefits approved
by the Connecticut Department of Insurance which are clearly
described to members in their policy certificates,'' said the
spokeswoman, Maria Gordon Shydlo.
</P>
<P>
   David Olson, a spokesman for Foundation Health Systems, called
today's suit ``old news'' because it repeated allegations in
lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs against his HMO and many
others. ``The only thing that's new is that the attorney general
has decided to join the fray,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes as the shortcomings of managed care,
specifically the affordability of prescription drugs, have become a
central issue in the presidential campaigns of Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Three weeks ago, Gore attacked HMOs
as callous profiteers during his speech to the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a prominent Democrat, said the timing of his suit
had nothing to do with presidential politics. ``The abuses of HMOs
have been a fact of life for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted that other states would join Connecticut's
lawsuit against the four companies, perhaps in the next several
weeks. Later this month, Blumenthal plans to present the details of
the suit to a gathering of attorneys general from several other
Northeastern states, including New York and New Jersey.

TAKING A NEW COURSE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former UCLA safety Lovell Houston, after
undergoing surgery last week to strengthen his right-shoulder
socket, has enrolled at Colorado and began taking classes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, a former Parade All-American at Denver Jefferson High,
battled a series of injury problems in his two years at UCLA that
rarely allowed him to fulfill his promise as one of the
cornerstones of the Bruins nationally top-ranked recruiting class
of 1998. Among the other highly touted members of that class were
DeShaun Foster, Robert Thomas, Mike Saffer and Ken Kocher _ all of
whom have started for at least two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Houston redshirted his first season after a quadriceps injury in
training camp slowed his progress. The shoulder surgery was the
third he's had since coming to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chance to play and be Lovell Houston,'' said
Houston, who started three games last year at strong safety and
returned a kickoff for 95 yards against Stanford the first time he
touched the ball as a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a good year last year, but I didn't meet my
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston said his decision to return closer to home had nothing
to do with UCLA and everything to do with his surgery. He had
arthroscopic surgery on the shoulder in the offseason, but it never
healed sufficiently for him to do the necessary work in the weight
room this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed UCLA very much and I appreciated all of my teammates
and coaches,'' said Houston, whom the UCLA coaches were hoping to
start at free safety. ``After the last surgery, I lost 20 pounds.
It was hard to go eat as much as I wanted to. This is where my
support system is (in Denver).
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, DeShaun, Julius (Williams) and Bryan Fletcher lived
together and it would be difficult for them to cook for me and
wrong for me to expect that. It's difficult when I have to put on
clothes and socks, and I write right-handed so it's hard to take
notes. There are a lot of things I needed to have a lot of help
with and between my parents, both my brothers and little sister,
I've got a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston says he might require surgery on his left shoulder _ it
was examined while he was under anesthesia _ but that he hopes to
be healthy for spring practice. Then he'll join his brother,
Marcus, a freshman running back who will start for Colorado against
USC on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Houston will have a reunion with some of his
former teammates on Sept. 21, 2002, when Colorado plays UCLA at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but good things to say about my coaches and
teammates at UCLA,'' Houston said. ``Sometimes fate just bends a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Raisin' hell: Oregon has gone to Fresno before and Cal is
visiting this season. Next year is Texas Tech. And then Oregon
State. In five years, Wisconsin will be there.
</P>
<P>
   But schools like Ohio State, whom Fresno State played last week,
Colorado, Auburn and UCLA won't go there. The Bruins have played
Fresno State three times in the past six years _ all in the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play UCLA in Fresno, but they won't play it,''
said Fresno State coach Pat Hill, who played center for UCLA coach
Bob Toledo when he was the head coach at UC Riverside. ``I can't
get Arizona or Arizona State to play (anywhere). I'm glad Bob
Toledo and UCLA will give us the opportunity to play them, but I
just wish they'd play us here. They go to San Diego State (in
2002), but they won't drive up here.''

U.S. REPORT WILL CRITICIZE IOC ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ With the Summer Games set to open a week
from Friday, a report financed by the White House office of
national drug policy has issued a stinging rebuke to the
International Olympic Committee as ineffectively combating the
pervasive use of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 107-page report, obtained by The New York Times and
scheduled for public release Friday, says the IOC failed to
establish a sufficiently independent body to administer an
anti-doping campaign and cites allegations that the IOC interfered
with research on drug testing. The report also says some coaches
and athletes estimate as many as 80 or 90 percent of participants
in some Olympic sports use performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no one in the Olympic movement seriously advocates
doping by athletes, the financial stakes for Olympic athletes,
corporate sponsors, the TV broadcast and cable industries and
sports governing bodies, coupled with the pharmacopeia of
performance-enhancing substances, the athletes' drive to win and
the absence of an effective policing mechanism create an
environment that encourages doing anything _ including doping _ to
win,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the culmination of a $1 million, two-year study
conducted by the National Commission on Sports and Substance Abuse,
at Columbia University. The study was meant to be the most
comprehensive review to date of doping in Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as the IOC has made one notable advance in the
fight against drug use. Last week it approved a blood test in
Sydney for EPO, a drug that increases oxygen-carrying capacity and
is believed to be widely used in endurance sports. This week 27
athletes were removed from the Chinese Olympic team, a number of
whom had failed blood tests at home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this advance, however, there will be no tests in Sydney
for such drugs as human growth hormone, insulin growth factor and
products that essentially serve as artificial blood.
</P>
<P>
   The intent to cheat apparently remains widespread, as evidenced
here by a customs seizure of human growth hormone from a Uzbekistan
coach on Thursday, and the banning of a Czech weight lifter and a
Canadian equestrian athlete for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Games begin in Sydney, millions of children will
watch every event,'' Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House
drug policy office, says in a statement accompanying the report.
``They'll copy the moves of the basketball players and the strokes
of the swimmers. Unless we continue to rid the Games of doping and
drugs, these children will also take the same drugs as they see
their stars cheating with.''
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that despite the IOC's creation of the World
Anti-Doping Agency last year, the agency has the authority only to
make recommendations to the Olympic committee. Its independence has
been questioned, in part because the agency is being headed by Dick
Pound, an IOC delegate from Montreal. Pound has said he will step
down next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no independent and accountable international
organization with authority to create and administer an effective
anti-doping program for Olympic sports,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A troubling conflict of interest exists among the governing
bodies that regulate various Olympic sports, the report said. The
need to promote sport and attract corporate sponsorship often
clashes with the determination to catch cheaters, because cheating
brings negative publicity and can diminish corporate enthusiasm,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Persistent patterns of irregularities in enforcement raises
serious doubts about the commitment of the sports' governing bodies
to protect the interest of honest athletes, the virtues of sport
and the health and safety of the competitors,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists interviewed by the Commission on Sports and Substance
Abuse reported that their attempts to develop tests for banned
substances ``were stymied by late decisions and a seeming lack of
will at the highest levels of the IOC,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC denied Friday that it was interfering with research on
drug tests. The Olympic committee pointed out that it had committed
$25 million in the next two years to fight doping, that its
anti-doping agency was conducting 2,400 out-of-competition tests
this year, and that the suspensions of about 30 athletes around the
world in recent weeks were a sign that a deterrent to cheating had
been created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we've won the war on drugs, but we're close to
winning the war on EPO, and we've put a fear in people who are
cheating,'' said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, an IOC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the huge financial gains available in this age of
professional Olympic athletes, the report also accuses parents,
coaches and trainers of actively encouraging doping, or turning
their heads to it, and it calls for corporate sponsors to demand
that athletes be free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for an independent anti-doping agency that does
not answer to the IOC, an international research effort of $50
million to $100 million over a five-year period, more comprehensive
out-of-competition testing, more accurate labeling of dietary
supplements, so-called athlete passports that would give a public
history of an athlete's doping tests and the adoption of
standardized lists and penalties for banned substances.

NO GIULIANI, MUCH CLINTON, AT BELATED PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organizers of this year's Labor Day parade, to be
held Saturday, are planning to turn the march into a major platform
for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight the first lady, whom they have endorsed, the
parade's organizers have taken the unusual step of not inviting
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was briefly Clinton's opponent. Nor
have they invited the Republican who is running, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The parade up Fifth Avenue, which will begin at 11 a.m. at 44th
Street and end at 72nd Street, is expected to give Clinton a giant
audience _ labor leaders predict at least 250,000 marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the parade has been scheduled for the Saturday
after Labor Day, because many union members did not want their
three-day holiday weekends cut short for the march. Union leaders
also wanted to hold it on a day when more people would be in
Manhattan to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The march comes during a difficult year for the city's unions.
Workers at the Museum of Modern Art remain on strike after four
months, more than 200 workers at Domino Sugar in Brooklyn have been
on strike for more than a year and a campaign to unionize
restaurant workers at the Metropolitan Opera remains stalled after
a year. In addition, the city's 300,000 municipal workers do not
appear close to getting a contract with the city _ another major
subject of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central
Labor Council, the parade's sponsor and an affiliate of the
AFL-CIO, said Clinton would give separate speeches to some unions
that plan to turn out thousands of members: the teachers,
electrical workers, building trades' unions and District Council
37. ``We want to showcase her meeting with working people,''
McLaughlin said. He said the labor council also wanted the parade
to showcase two endorsed incumbents in Congress who face tough
challenges in Tuesday's Democratic primary: Major Owens and
Edolphus Towns.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio was not invited, labor leaders said that two
unions that have endorsed him, the police and the corrections
officers, might carry pro-Lazio signs. Michael Marr, a spokesman
for Lazio, said the Republican would be campaigning in Queens and
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mayor, if he shows up uninvited, McLaughlin said, he
will be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the mayor said he would not attend.
Giuliani was invited to march each year for the last five years and
accepted every year except for 1999, when he had a scheduling
conflict, the spokeswoman said.

JUDGE RULES CALIFORNIA DOCTORS AND PATIENTS MAY DISCUSS MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Hawaii, Maine, Nev., Ore., Wash.)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Thursday
that federal officials may not interfere with the freedom of
California doctors and patients to discuss the potential medical
benefits of marijuana, or of doctors to recommend its therapeutic
use, under the terms of a state ballot initiative approved by
voters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup came in a
class-action lawsuit filed against top Clinton administration
officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, in 1997, seeking
to block them from prosecuting or removing the prescription
licenses of any doctors who endorsed marijuana's potential benefits
in treating patients with illnesses like AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevant federal statute does not authorize the government
to revoke a physician's license to dispense controlled substances
merely because a physician ``recommends'' marijuana as a therapy to
a patient,'' Alsup wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any contrary holding would raise severe First Amendment
doubts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measure have been passed in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii,
Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The California ballot measure, like the one in Arizona, did not
remove the longstanding federal prohibition against doctors
prescribing drugs like marijuana and heroin, in which the
government recognizes no medical value. It simply gave patients
found with small amounts of marijuana a defense if they could show
that a doctor had recommended it orally or in writing. But almost
since the law's passage, doctors have been fearful of the threat of
federal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finally signals that doctors and patients can once again
openly discuss marijuana as medicine without fear of draconian
federal punishment,'' said Graham Boyd, a lawyer with the American
Civil Liberties Union who filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weiner, a spokesman for Barry McCaffrey, the White House
drug czar who was also a named defendant in the case, said his
office had just learned of the decision and that together with the
Justice Department, the main agency handling the case, ``We will
study and analyze the decision closely, and that's all I can tell
you right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The government can appeal the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

AS GASOLINE PRICES RISE, WORRIES MOUNT ABOUT HIGHER HEATING FUEL
COST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gasoline prices have surged again this week
amid increasingly gloomy predictions that the cost of fuels used to
heat homes and businesses will remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for unleaded gasoline in the Kansas City area have gone
up as much as 15 cents per gallon, to $1.55, at most service
stations _ a reaction in part to oil prices that are posting
10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the costs of heating oil, propane and natural
gas are climbing. Analysts worry that the price of these fuels
could rise even further unless there is a warm winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the risk of (price) spikes has gotten bigger,'' said
David Costello, an analyst for the federal Energy Information
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The price of natural gas, for example, has remained unusually
high throughout the summer. Already those prices have moved higher.
On Aug. 1, the wholesale cost of 1,000 cubic feet was about $3.80,
nearly double the price at the same time last year. On Thursday,
the average wholesale price for 1,000 cubic feet of gas in the
Midwest was $4.90.
</P>
<P>
   At those prices, an average household would see its heating
bills increase $300. The average household uses 120,000 cubic feet
of gas in a year, most of that in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Traders in the futures and wholesale markets have been worried
about supplies of natural gas. Prices have been volatile, partly on
reports of increased use of natural gas by electric utilities. Now
concerns about a cold winter are fueling some of the surge.
</P>
<P>
   As for gasoline, Costello said there had been some tight
supplies in some parts of the country, including the Midwest. But
much of the upward price push has come from rising crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A barrel of West Texas crude oil _ a frequently used reference
price _ cost $28 on Aug. 1. Thursday's price was $35 a barrel. A
barrel makes 42 gallons of gasoline and other products.
</P>
<P>
   But Costello said he held out hope of some relief for motorists.
Now that summer driving is over, demand should slacken, although
more oil will be needed to rebuild stockpiles of heating oil. &QL;

JEWISH GROUP EXTENDS HAND TO CHRISTIANS ON HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS name of newspaper in 9th graf)  
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A large group of influential Jewish scholars and rabbis have
signed a theological statement to be released this weekend calling
on Jews to relinquish their fear and mistrust of Christianity and
to acknowledge church efforts in the decades since the Holocaust to
amend Christian teaching about Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, called ``Dabru Emet'' _ which means ``speak
truth'' in Hebrew _ was signed by nearly 170 Jewish thinkers and
leaders from all four branches of Judaism _ Orthodox, Conservative,
Reform and Reconstructionist, including heads of theological
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In what is probably the most controversial point, the document
says that ``Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   It says, ``Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism
and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have
taken hold,'' but that ``Nazism itself was not an inevitable
outcome of Christianity.'' It asserts that if the Nazis had
succeeded in exterminating all the Jews, Christians would have been
the next targets.
</P>
<P>
   The document also claims major commonalities between the faiths,
saying that Jews and Christians worship the same God; seek
authority from the same book, the Bible; and accept the moral
principles of the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   A result of a scholarly dialogue that began five years ago, the
statement was the idea of Dr. Michael Signer of the University of
Notre Dame, who wrote it with Dr. Tikva Fryer-Kensky of the
University of Chicago divinity school, Dr. Peter Ochs of the
University of Virginia and Dr. David Novak of the University of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we needed a statement,'' Novak said, ``is that
major Christian groups and thinkers have in the past 30 or 40 years
come up with a major rethinking about Jews and Judaism and have
issued statements about how they can respect the legitimacy of
Judaism. It seems to us to behoove Jewish thinkers to respond
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Novak noted that as Jewish academics at non-Jewish institutions,
the four co-authors could write without seeking approval from any
denomination or religious body. Christian theologians have
expressed interest in such a statement for years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The document will be printed in paid advertisements this Sunday
in The New York Times and The Sun &UR;  &LR; of Baltimore. It is being
released by the Institute for Christian &AMP; Jewish Studies, an
independent interfaith organization in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In history and in contemporary times there are reasons for
Jews to be very wary of Christians,'' said Rabbi David Sandmel of
the institute. ``But the Christian world today is very different
than it was 50 or 100 or 500 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people refused to sign, many because they disagreed
with the section on the Holocaust, Sandmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi James Rudin, senior interreligious advisor at the American
Jewish Committee, said he objected because ``Christianity and
Christian teachings over the centuries created the seedbed for
Nazism to grow in. This document lets Christian teaching off too
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amy-Jill Levine, Carpenter professor of New Testament
studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School, said she was
concerned about the assertion that Jews and Christians learned from
the same Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share many of the same stories, but the interpretive
traditions are substantially different, and even the canonical
order of the books creates different texts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Levine added her signature. ``Overall, this struck
me as a hopeful and needed document at this time,'' she said,
adding that she tries to counter anti-Jewish thinking among her
Christian divinity students so that they will not spread it from
the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews do not really understand Christianity either,'' Levine
said, ``and there is no way to break down bigotry or prejudice
unless there is education, on both sides.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a cold night last December, a white limousine
stopped near Il Boschetto restaurant in Yonkers. Two large men
stepped out and hurried through the restaurant's tinted front door.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were suspected of being mob racketeers. One, Joseph
Datello, was an inducted member of the Lucchese crime family. The
other, Sean J. Richard, was the son-in-law of John Riggi, the
imprisoned boss of the New Jersey-based DeCavalcantes. Richard had
recently been in a car accident. He wore a bandage on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   In the restaurant, they met Steven L. Crea, the Luccheses'
acting boss, who greeted them from the first stool at the bar. For
about an hour, the three men talked about bribery and extortion,
the authorities say. Richard remembers that Crea was angry. He
speculated darkly about a man he thought might be a snitch.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, Richard dropped Datello off at his home
on Staten Island, as he had after many meetings before. Then he
broke from the routine.
</P>
<P>
   He directed his driver to a motel parking lot and switched cars,
taking a seat in a sedan with another group of men. Reaching into
his sweatsuit, he unrolled the bandage and removed a hidden
recording device.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Richard had just betrayed his Mafia boss. Crea had guessed
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was a fellow boss' son-in-law, worried that his
future held either jail time or a violent death, who had turned
against him. In the parlance of mobsters, Richard had become a rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the kind of circumstances you want to gain fame
and notoriety for,'' Richard said in a recent interview. ``But I
didn't have many options, and that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who while in hiding agreed to several interviews, is
the mob's latest embarrassing, tell-all turncoat. He is an eager
raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, unsealed racketeering indictments against Crea and 37
other defendants, accusing them of participating in a criminal
enterprise that drove up the prices of construction projects
throughout the city. The indictment identifies Crea as the acting
boss and Datello as a soldier in the Lucchese crime family.
</P>
<P>
   As the prosecutions go forward, they will rely on years of
investigation and wiretaps by the New York Police Department. And
they will rely on Richard, who agreed to plead guilty to attempted
enterprise corruption in exchange for a new identity and a sentence
of five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   In return, he plans to testify with zeal about how the
Luccheses, through persistence and payoffs, maintained a grip on
construction projects at a time when the Mafia was supposedly in
decline. Dozens of contractors, union officials and mobsters are
said to be vulnerable to his testimony, which will recount, in
detail, bribes doled out in bars and restaurants, coercion at
construction sites and the Mafia's aggressive, if somewhat
bumbling, management of a sprawling criminal scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a godsend,'' said a lawyer who is familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable reversal. As Riggi's son-in-law and the
father of two of the boss' granddaughters, Richard, 35, is
literally married to the mob. And he is displaying an almost
gloating disrespect. In interviews, he went beyond discussing
details of labor corruption. He spoke with disdain for the mobsters
he once served.
</P>
<P>
   He described Emmanuel Riggi, one of his brothers-in-law and a
man prosecutors describe as a member of the DeCavalcante crime
family, as ``so fat he breaks chairs at every family function.'' He
said John Riggi, the feared crime boss, ``ought to thank me for
feeding his useless kids.'' He said Datello, his 6-foot-5 former
partner, was ``a big idiot, like Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say, `Hey, Joey, I've got to take you in to get the
bolts for your neck,''' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is a gritty man and can emanate the blunt, coarse
demeanor of a thug. He is utterly unlettered. He says ``mob
fractions'' when he means ``mob factions.'' But he is also capable
of warmth and charm, and the people who know him say he is very
smart, a man who passed easily through many different roles until
arriving at his latest: witness for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a chameleon,'' said Tommy, a friend of nearly 20 years
who spoke only on the condition that his last name not be
published. ``He became a gangster better than one of them, and he
thought circles around them while he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 30 years of his life, Richard was a virtual
nobody, a laborer from the Bronx who trained as a union apprentice
and, by his mid-20s, started a small subcontracting company in New
Jersey. His insider's tour of the mob did not begin until 1995,
when he began dating Sara M. Riggi, the daughter of the
DeCavalcantes' boss.
</P>
<P>
   The DeCavalcantes are the smallest of the region's Mafia
families, and considered by law enforcement to be the weakest,
often relying on cooperation with the five families in New York.
But they have long specialized in labor rackets: extorting
contractors in exchange for labor peace, or replacing unionized
employees with nonunion workers and then spiriting away savings on
wages or fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard became fascinated with Riggi, whom he said he first
visited in the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Md.,
in 1996, when the boss was serving a sentence for extortion. Riggi,
75, appeared in prison khakis, yet somehow managed, Richard said,
``to have an almost presidential bearing.'' He sat briefly with
Richard and Riggi before sending his daughter to a vending machine,
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she left, he looked at me and said: ``Who you with?
Who you indentured to?'' Richard said. ``I said: ``Nobody. I don't
answer to nobody.' And after we talked for a while, we hit it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Riggi married on Sept. 13, 1996. ``Friday the
13th,'' Richard now says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Riggi's three sons, who law enforcement officials say
were unable to run the rackets (Richard calls them ``goofballs,
three guys you wouldn't take miniature golfing''), his son-in-law
seemed smart and aggressive. Soon, Richard's legitimate business
was a sideline; labor rackets were his game.
</P>
<P>
   He and law enforcement officials said that in 1996 he began
circulating his father-in-law's instructions to corrupt New Jersey
locals and pursuing larger plans. ``Sean was a significant
player,'' said Robert T. Buccino, who retired last month as deputy
chief of New Jersey's Organized Crime Bureau. ``He was more trusted
than the sons were.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Richard established a link with the Luccheses, working
for Datello, who prosecutors say also specialized in labor rackets.
In one of his first schemes, Richard and prosecutors assert, he and
an associate bribed Michael Forde, the president of Local 608 of
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, to help limit the
number of unionized carpenters at a Park Central Hotel renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first payment _ $10,000 in cash _ was made over
afternoon beers at a Hooters on West 56th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the ten thousand, and he says, `You know, I really
shouldn't be drinking beers while I'm working; the union is
cracking down on that,''' Richard said. ``It was the funniest
thing. I said: `You're worried about the beers? What do you think
your guys would think about that ten thousand you just took?'''
</P>
<P>
   Forde was indicted this week; through his lawyer, he said the
meeting with Richard never took place.
</P>
<P>
   As he worked for Datello, Richard lived a high roller's life,
canvassing Manhattan and spending freely from wads of $100 bills.
He bought pedigreed Rottweilers. He leased a new luxury car every
few months. He bought a $320,000 home on two acres in Holmdel,
N.J., putting $145,000 down. The house had a sauna, a Jacuzzi, an
in-ground pool and separate yards: one for his two infant
daughters, the other for his menacing black dogs.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, he had become a fixture at the Oak Room at the Plaza
Hotel, where the manager, Patrick Littlejohn, remembers he sat in a
corner booth and ordered heaping plates of chilled seafood and
seared prime rib, washing both down with 1982 Lafite-Rothschild.
Sometimes he stood by the piano, singing Frank Sinatra or Perry
Como. ``All the classics,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   He also passed long hours at the Paradise Club, an adult
nightclub near the Empire State Building, where he tipped the
raven-haired striptease dancer he fell in love with as much as
$1,000 a night, he and the dancer both say. ``If I dropped dead
tomorrow, I lived, baby, I lived,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   He and the authorities also say he attended the meetings of a
secret three-member construction panel that the Luccheses used to
plan rackets, mediate disputes and divide spoils. By his telling,
these meetings illustrated the paradox that the latter-day Mafia
has become.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the mob was resourceful enough to cheat the
construction industry of millions of dollars. On the other, many
members and associates were almost pathetic: grown men who groveled
to get jobs as flagmen at road crews, or who talked relentlessly on
cellular phones about secret meetings, all while the detectives
were listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be a secret society, but we'd get 20, 25,
30 guys turning up, all asking for something,'' Richard said. ``It
was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one panel meeting last year at Little Charlie's Clam
Bar on Kenmare Street in Manhattan, for which, he and investigators
say, two dozen mobsters and associates arrived in flashy cars,
lining the block with Cadillacs and Lincolns. Later, he learned
that police had watched the entire show. ``It was kind of
comical,'' Richard said. ``The detectives were right across the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard's life began to unravel last June, when police raided
several dozen homes and offices in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, searching for records documenting the suspected
rackets. One of the targets was the Linden, N.J., office of S &AMP; S
Contracting, the business he had formed with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The raids filled him with dread. ``It was the beginning of the
end,'' he said. ``For them to get 40 warrants in three states? Come
on. That's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five months, he fell into a funk. He began to use
cocaine, marijuana and heroin, he said, and drank more heavily than
usual. He spent even more money, dipping into the weekly cash
tribute he said he was supposed to pay Datello as a member of his
crew.
</P>
<P>
   He also began to think about becoming the state's witness, in
part because friction within the Luccheses rose after the raids,
and he worried that Datello had been given orders to kill him. The
fear, he said, intensified late last fall when he was told to wait
outside the Tick Tock Diner in Clifton, N.J., to meet Dominic
Truscello, a Lucchese capo. Datello told him he would be picked up
in a van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What do you guys need a van for?''' Richard recalled.
``A van is never a good sign in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so spooked that he armed himself, he said, carrying a
pistol in his belt. The van ride passed without violence, but
during the meeting that followed, he said, Truscello stared icily
at him and said, ``What are your sins?'' Richard interpreted the
question as a sign that he was marked for execution. He defected
soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the case is public, some of Richard's former Mafia
associates seem astounded at the breadth and tone of his
confessions. A few, through lawyers or associates, declined to
comment, including John Riggi, his sons and Datello, who has eluded
arrest so far.
</P>
<P>
   Others, through associates or lawyers, said Richard is little
more than a wild exaggerator and a serial manipulator who drew
attention to the Luccheses through a foolishly flamboyant style.
``This guy was a wannabe, and he conducted business that was not
authorized by organized crime,'' said a person who is familiar with
the Lucchese family.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and associates of the Luccheses say that Richard is a
traitor on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is now in hiding with his girlfriend, the stripper, who
performed under the name Lola. His wife, Sara Riggi, has not seen
him in months. She has been left in disarray, alone with their
daughters and facing foreclosure proceedings against their home.
She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July and for
divorce in August. ``It's very upsetting,'' she said in a brief
interview, which she ended in tears.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richard has the appearance of a man who has long
been resting. He has lost weight and added tattoos. He has a rich
tan. Now and then he talks about book or movie deals. He takes
precautions, of course, but they are almost comically half-hearted,
like his tendency when venturing away from police to wear a hat and
sunglasses, or his request to a reporter not to describe his
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The Luccheses' latest racketeering case, and his probation will
be over one day, he says. Then he will have a new life. ``The last
thing anybody wants to be is a rat,'' he said. ``But you know
something? I'll be a rat and I won't be in prison. I'll be a rat
and I'll be alive.''
