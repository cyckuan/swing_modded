<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls on Cease-fire in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali appealed to the Tajik parties to cease
hostilities immediately and to comply strictly with their
obligations under the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali noted that
the situation in Tajikistan has been very tense -- the most
serious in four years.
</P>
<P>
In the Tavildara sector, the government reinforced its troops
during March and April while the fighting was largely static
there. "Fighting escalated at the beginning of May 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned at the serious deterioration of the
situation in Tajikistan, which is at its worst and most volatile
since the end of the civil war of 1992," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Large-scale fighting in the Tavildara region has resulted in
many human losses, the interruption of communication between the
capital and a large part of the country and a dramatic aggravation
of the humanitarian situation of the civilian population," he
reported.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the conflict in Tajikistan could not be
settled by military means.
</P>
<P>
In the present circumstances, the first priority is the
restoration of an effective cease-fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the Security Council extend the mandate
of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT)
for a further period of six months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Visits Burned Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday visited the ruins of one of 33 black churches burned in
arson fires over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, on a visit to Greeleyville, South Carolina, called for
racial reconciliation across America. He said the church fires
proved that while much progress has been made in building a bridge
between black and white America "our job is not done."
</P>
<P>
"Show the forces of hatred they cannot win," Clinton was quoted
as saying by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds to
speak out against racism and report anything they know about the
unsolved church fires.
</P>
<P>
He promised additional federal law enforcement tools to
investigate the unsolved fires and to prevent additional ones.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was speaking outside the new Mt. Zion AME Church, which
will be dedicated officially Saturday. The old church burned
nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged by the rebuilding they're doing," Clinton said
en route to South Carolina Tuesday night. "And I want to reaffirm
to everybody in this country that we're going to keep working
until we get to the bottom of all these cases."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has spoken on several occasions of the consequences of
the church burnings since a Monday appearance in San Diego. There,
he urged the nation to "come together as one America to rebuild
our churches" and "show the forces of hatred they cannot win."
</P>
<P>
He has stressed that Americans must believe that opportunity
should exist for everyone regardless of race, class or income.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow this country to become a more divided
country," Clinton said Tuesday in Glendale, California. "If we can
respect each other and share the basic values of America, we're
going to be fine."

<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
Tuesday ended five months without a chief executive by appointing
Gavin Casey, chief administrative officer for international
equities at brokers Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
Casey, 49, will replace Michael Lawrence, who was dismissed in
January after clashing with many of the exchange's largest
members.
</P>
<P>
John Kemp-Welch, the stock exchange chairman, said Casey's
appointment had been vetted and checked with all the relevant City
watchdogs, including the Bank of England, the Securities and
Investments Board, the Securities and Futures Authority, the
Department of Trade and Industry and the exchange's own
investigative department.
</P>
<P>
John Kemp-Welch added that the board had been unanimous in its
decision to appoint Casey, who was selected from a short list of
three.
</P>
<P>
Casey, who will take up his new position in August, said that
coming from a member firm, he understood what the exchange was
trying to do, agree with it and looked forward to the challenge of
trying to implement it.
</P>
<P>
Michael Marks, Casey's boss at Merrill Lynch, said he would
make "an excellent choice", and "the advantage he brings is that
he understands the securities business".
</P>
<P>
"I think he will do an outstanding job. He certainly did an
outstanding one for us," Marks said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Vows Not to Let Violence Disrupt Russian Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today condemned Tuesday night's blast on the Moscow subway and
vowed that violence will not stop Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described as a "savage, barbaric act" the blast at a
station in southern Moscow, in which two men and two women were
killed.
</P>
<P>
"The best response to the machinations of extremists will be a
vote on June 16, a vote for civil peace, for stability, for the
future of Russia," he said in a message to the people of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, leads most opinion polls for Sunday's election but
faces a strong challenge from 51-year-old Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb, which went off
under a seat after the train had left Tulskaya station around 9
p.m. local time. The blast left 11 people injured, most of them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said he could not rule out the
possibility that Chechen separatists had planted the bomb, but
offered no evidence. The Chechen diaspora in Moscow called the
attack "barbaric" and sent its condolences.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said it is the first terrorist attack against the
general public in Moscow's subway since the system opened in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, a Yeltsin ally, said the bomb was intended as a blow
to his own bid for re-election in Sunday's mayoral poll. His
running mate, Valery Shantsev, was hurt in a bomb attack last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's blast cast a shadow over today's Independence Day
holiday, and coincides with the fifth anniversary of Yeltsin's
coming to power in 1991.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign undersecretaries of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states will meet in
Riyadh, capital of Sardi Arabia, Saturday to discuss, among other
things, matters of regional security, A GCC official said today.
</P>
<P>
GCC Assistant Secretary General for political affairs Abdelaziz
Abu Ali said in a statement that the Gulf officials, in a
two-day meeting in Riyadh, will discuss Gulf security issues,
particularly relations with Iran in light of the latest events in
Bahrain, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain said last week that it had foiled a coup attempt
masterminded by a pro-Iranian group to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied Bahrain's allegations that it was involved in
the coup attempt, saying that they were "totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers in their last week meeting urged
Iran not to interfere in the internal affairs of Bahrain and
respect the sovereignty of the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar, said what Bahrain described as
Iran's interference in its internal affairs has posed a new
threat to the security and stability of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Arab Gulf chiefs of staff were
set to meet in Bahraini capital today, according to reports
available here.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A government plan to build
anti-aircraft and anti-submarine cruisers to replace a fleet of
destroyers built more than 30 years ago was endorsed by the
defense committee of Germany's Federal Assembly today.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to build three F124 cruisers, at an
estimated cost of one billion German marks (650 million
U.S. dollars) each, before deciding whether the fourth should be
built. The first cruiser is to be delivered in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Though supported by the government and the main opposition
Social Democratic Party, the committee's decision was sharply
criticized by the Green Party and the Democratic Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, 143 meters long and 17 meters high, will be able
to travel at 28 nautical miles (32 kilometers) per hour.
</P>
<P>
Designed as an anti-aircraft and anti-submarine vessel, the
cruiser can take 195 men and stay on sea for 21 days without
re-fueling.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich and Poor Widened in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The rich have been getting richer
and the poor poorer since President Clinton took office, the
Investor's Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Census Bureau released data showing that
the wealthiest Americans saw their average income climb 21 percent
between 1992 and 1994, while the bottom fifth's incomes stayed
flat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration seems to have made little progress on
this issue, the paper said. The middle class continued to get
squeezed as median incomes stagnated. Poverty rates continued at
high levels.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, a study by Rand researcher Lynn Karoly
found that the income gap continued to widen in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Also in March, Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence Lindsey
noted that the income gap was widening again under Clinton, after
holding steady during the Bush years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The trend seems to have resumed in 1993 and again in 1994,
with the share of income going to the top 5 percent rising from
18.6 percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993 and 21.1 percent in
1994," he said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Clinton has not done much on poverty, either.
The poverty rate in 1994 -- the last year for which data are
available -- stood at 14.5 percent of the population. It was
higher than in all but three years of the Reagan and Bush
administrations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton adjusted taxes for the three major classes,
little effect was seen in narrowing the gap between the rich and
poor, according to the report.

OTTAWA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo today denounced U.S. sanctions on Cuba and a U.S. bill
punishing Cuba's foreign investors and trade partners as a
violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Canadian parliament, Zedillo said the
Helms-Burton Bill, signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in March,
is an attempt to control the investment policies of other nations
and thus a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
The principles of international law must be defended and abided
by, he told Canadian lawmakers.
</P>

Zedillo said Mexico, like Canada, believes that any action
hampering international investment and trade is unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Prime Minister Leaves for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri and his wife Nazek left here this afternoon for Beijing
for a four-day official visit to China at the invitation of
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to China by a Lebanese leader since
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries in 1971.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Lebanese prime minister will hold a
series of meetings with Chinese leaders, and sign several
agreements of economic, trade and technical cooperations with the
Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12-member official delegation accompanying Hariri in
his visit are Fouad Sanyoura, minister of state for financial
affairs, Robert Ghanem, minister of national education, youth and
sport and Yassin Jaber, minister of economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
At the Beirut International Airport, Hariri was seen off by
representatives of Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and House
Speakers Nabih Berri, cabinet ministers, Chinese Charge d'Affaires
to Lebanon Li Xiulian and other foreign envoys.
</P>
<P>
The special plane carrying Hariri and his entourage took off
at 6:40 p.m. (15:40 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his visit,
Hariri announced that the visit is "aimed at consolidating the
bilateral relations" between Lebanon and China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit is also aimed at explaining the
Lebanese cause and the Middle East problem to the Chinese
leaders and finding ways to increase cooperation between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese-Chinese relations are always good," he said,
noting that the two countries "always" support and help each other
on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that "the economic relations between
Lebanon and China have been widened and developed, especially
since China's policy of reform and opening-up."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and China share a long history of friendship between
them and Lebanon is an important trade partner of China in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade of China with Lebanon, which had never
exceeded 49.90 million U.S. dollars in 1970s and 1980s, rose
noticeably to 141,60 million dollars in 1995 from 49.99 million
dollars in 1991, according to statistics of the Chinese Customs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Studies Ways to Support U.S. Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government is studying
the feasibility of allowing its troops to provide U.S. forces with
logistics support in military emergencies in the Far East region,
according to local newspaper reports today.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has been attacked by some observers, who say
it violates the spirit of Japan's pacifist constitution and
heightens Japan's military role.
</P>
<P>
A senior Foreign Ministry official was quoted by newspaper
reports here as saying that providing U.S. troops with water, oil
and weapon parts are the "minimum" Japan would have to supply in
military situations.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Japanese government is investigating ways,
including military measures, to ensure that these supplies can be
exchanged during military crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has traditionally ruled out logistics
support to U.S. troops in emergencies, saying it considered such
actions unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
But as both countries work more closely on defense roles in the
region, expectations that Japan will move to provide logistics
support have been raised.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are due to start soon on revising existing
guidelines for defense cooperation laid down in 1978, in line with
an agreement between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
U.S. President Bill Clinton in April to boost bilateral security
ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also recently signed an acquisition and cross
servicing agreement, allowing Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the
U.S. military in Japan to support each other with a total of 15
items of logistics supplies and duties, including
telecommunications, medical and sanitary duties, when they conduct
exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no stipulations for specific joint measures
during a military crisis in the Far East region within the
existing guidelines, which say only that Japan should "study ways
of how it would support U.S. forces" in such crisis.
</P>
<P>
So Japan's Defense Agency is calling for specific guidelines on
what Japan can do in military emergencies. The newspaper reports
said the agency wants, for example, to formulate guidelines for
support to the United States, similar to those Washington has with
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEADLINE> Trans-Atlantic Summit to Review Progress on Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders of the European Union
(EU) is arriving in Washington Wednesday to hold the alliance's
bi-annual summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders to visit the United States include President of
the European Commission (EC) Jacques Santer and Trade Commissioner
Sir Leon Brittan, together with the EC's Italian Presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, to take place in the White House, is the first
since the EU and the United States signed the New Trans-Atlantic
Agenda last December in Madrid to boost their relations.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said that the summit will give the leaders a
chance to review progress made in implementing the New
Trans-Atlantic Agenda, as well as to set new priorities for work
in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda aims to progressively build stronger ties between
the EU and the United States in four key policy areas so that they
can take joint action rather than just consult each other.
</P>
<P>
The areas are: promoting peace, stability and development
worldwide; tackling crime, drugs, pollution and other global
challenges; promoting science, education, cultural and business
links across the Atlantic and creating a "New Trans-Atlantic
Marketplace" by removing barriers to each other's business while
working to expand world trade.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Economies to Have Steady Growth in 1996-97: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- After a soft landing in most
part of the Pacific economies in 1995, the region is predicted to
have faster economic growth in 1996-1997, the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) said today.
</P>
<P>
It noted in its annual Pacific Economic Outlook that in 1995
not all 18 PECC economies followed the pattern of slower real
growth of GDP and ebbing inflation. Six economies -- Chile,
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam --
actually experienced higher real growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said the weighted average growth of GDP is expected
to reach 3.9 percent in 1996, up 0.4 percent from 1995, and to
expand even further to 4.2 percent in 1997. If this forecast is
achieved, then the region's growth would still be below the boom
year of 1994, but would appear to be entirely sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The PECC said China's real GDP growth is expected to reach 9.0
percent in 1996 but slower down to 8.5 percent in 1997 while the
consumer price index declined from 17.1 percent in 1995 to 12.6
percent in 1996 and further to 9.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said China should accelerate reform of its
state-owned enterprise (SOE) system to help assure progress in
realizing a "soft landing" and stabilizing the economy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the SOE's were in serious deficit with 43.7
percent of them losing money by October 1995. Intra-enterprise
debt was also very serious. "The only way to overcome these
problems is to accelerate enterprise reform," it asserted.
</P>
<P>
The report added, "Given its necessity for economic
development, we can expect that economic reform, especially
enterprise reform, will go forward in 1996 and in several
subsequent years. This will assure progress in assuring a 'soft
landing' and stabilizing the economy."
</P>
<P>
The PECC's Outlook said the South Korean economy is expected to
achieve a soft landing in 1996-97 as there is no indication of
overheating in the current economic upswing.
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated that the real growth rates of exports and
imports will be 10-12 percent, resulting in current account
deficits of around 5-6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 and 7-8
billion dollars in 1997," the report said. This compares with the
current account deficit of 8.8 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
About Malaysia, the report said its economic outlook for 1996
looks very favorable and GDP growth should be around 8.9 percent
as against 9.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic growth of more than 8 percent in 1996,
inflation is not expected to worsen. The consumer price index is
forecast to grow by 3.3 percent as compared with a rise of 3.4
percent in the last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PECC is a non-governmental organization devoted to
promoting economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim. It now
comprises 22 member committees representing the economies of
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam as well as the Pacific
Island Nations.

<HEADLINE> Rikfind: Beef Issue to Dominate EU Florence Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said here today that the main target of the British
government in the coming European Union (EU) summit is striving to
achieve a framework on lifting the EU ban on British beef products
exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Parliamentary Select Committee on Foreign
Affairs earlier today, Rifkind said, "the most important UK goal
in the context of the Florence European Council will be agree a
framework leading to the lifting of the ban on British beef
exports."
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister has made it clear that unless the ban on
beef derivatives is lifted, and agreement is reached on such a
framework, BSE (or mad cow disease) will dominate" the EU summit
due to be held on June 21-22 in Florence, Italy, Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind noted that the nature of discussion of beef at the
Florence Summit will depend on progress made between now and then
on a clear framework for lifing the ban and "we will be discussing
this with the EU Commission and with other EU member states at the
Ministerial and official level over the next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
"serious efforts are being made by the EU Commission and some
Britain's EU partners in a bid to achieve substantial progress on
the beef issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary also made it clear that if no
progress is made at the EU Summit, the country's non-cooperation
policy will remain in force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government is facing growing pressure
from its EU partners to abandon the country's non-cooperation
policy with the EU and show enough flexibility if UK wants to get
an early agreement on ending the EU's global ban on British beef
products exports.
</P>
<P>
Italy, the current EU presidency state, warned the British
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind that Britain had to be more
flexible to keep alive hopes of a deal, allowing a step-by-step
lifting of the embargo upon British beef exports imposed by the EU
on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini is reported as saying
that if Britain abandoned its non-cooperation policy in a
"pragmatic and not definite way" there could be progress toward an
agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But other EU countries, led by Netherlands, took a harder line
with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo saying that Britain
should call off its blocking campaign before negotiations began on
a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is also reported as
criticizing Britain, saying Britain was "shooting itself in the
foot" by blocking policies which it favored.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister is quoted as saying in a German
television interview, "I am a bit worried about Florence (Summit)
because BSE should not overshadow such an important European
Summit."
</P>
<P>
The British government has blocked quite a number of measures
since British Prime Minister John Major announced the
non-cooperation campaign in a desperate effort to get rid of the
world-wide ban on British beef exports but Britain has recently
showed some flexibility by giving green light to some limited EU
measures.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on March 27 when the British
government admitted that there were possible links between BSE or
mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU Commission decided to lift the ban
on the exports of three British beef by-products gelatine, tallow
and bull semen, but the British government remained refused end
its non-cooperation policy, saying it will give up the policy when
the EU announced a clear timetable to lift the total ban on
British beef exports.

<HEADLINE> Control of Arms in Republika Srpska Going Well- IFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Control of the quantity of arms
in the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska army units was going
well, British Lt. Col. Mick Akons said today.
</P>
<P>
Akons, who heads a team of IFOR inspectors, said in Serb
administrative center Pale that the implementation of the Dayton
peace accords for Bosnia had so far been successful, which was the
initial step towards peace in the future, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Akons and Romanian Lt. Col. Gabriel Siorobea held talks with
head of the Serb army team of inspectors, Lt. Col. Mica Milicevic,
in Pale Tuesday night to discuss the arms control in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Siorobea said all three formerly warring parties -- Muslims,
Croats and Serbs -- had exchanged information about arms and
equipment, and teams of inspectors were much better prepared for
their task now.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on regional arms control has recently been reached
in Vienna on all elements after five months of negotiations. But
the agreement was not signed today as planned because the Muslim
delegation brought up the issue of the agreement's signatories as
a problem. The problem was expected to be solved on Thursday's
Florence conference which will assess the half-year implementation
of the Bosnia peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Serb armys inspecting team leader Milicevic said Akons's
inspecting team, which includes Muslim and Croat army officer, had
checked the reports sent by the Serb army on the quantity of arms
in its units and found them correct.
</P>
<P>
"The Serb army has again shown that it fully meets all
conditions it pledges to or signs," Milicevic said, adding the
Serb army expected other parties to follow suit as well.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Visit to US Unlikely Until July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu will not visit the United States until July,
his office announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's trip to the U.S., tentatively scheduled in late
this month, will not take place until sometime in July, his office
said in a statement this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu was reported to have invited
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to visit Israel first
before he goes to Washington.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, when Netanyahu won the Israeli elections,
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Christopher immediately invited
him to visit Washington as soon as he forms the new government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is eager to learn about Netanyahu's intentions on the
Middle East peace process and hopes to win his commitment to
continue seeking peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently holding intensive talks with the
potential coalition partners in a hope of forming the new
government before June 17, when the new Knesset (parliament)
convenes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, it remains unclear whether he could put
together the coalition in time for the confidence vote in the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. sources indicated that neither Christopher nor
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross could come to
Israel before Netanyahu becomes the Prime Minister officially.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu's office threatened to shut the Orient
House, the Palestinian Office in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Netanyahu government will take a different policy from
the (outgoing) Peres' government on the Orient House and on
attempts of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to operate in the
city," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader, repeatedly vowed to shut
down the Orient House and other Palestinian institutions in east
Jerusalem so as to keep Jerusalem as a united and indivisible
capital under the Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has demanded the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its
capital. The Jerusalem question is included in the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Nabil Shaas, in reaction to the
statement on Orient House by Netanyahu's office, denounced it as
"unacceptable," saying the Palestinian side will respond "very
strongly" against any change in the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Shaas also called for a face-to-face meeting between Netanyahu
and PA President Yasser Arafat, which he termed as the "best way
to move forward the Israeli-Palestinian track."
</P>
<P>
On several past occasions, Netanyahu flatly ruled out his
willingness to talk with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Proposes African Summit on Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ghanaian Deputy Foreign
Affairs Minister Mohammed Ibn Chambas today proposed a new
initiative by African heads of state and government to solve
economic and political problems on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Chambas said here today that African leaders should meet and
find solutions to problems such as civil strife in countries like
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The minister was in Zimbabwe to deliver a message to acting
president Muzenda believed to contain an invitation to Zimbabwe
to attend a conference on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The conference, where problems facing African countries will
be discussed, will be attended by participants from both the
public and private sector.
</P>
<P>
On war-torn Liberia, Chambas said the warring factions are
not demonstrating the "responsibility and seriousness" needed to
bring peace.
</P>
<P>
"We need cooperation of factional leaders because Monrovia is
now a ghost city, where people have looted anything worth
looting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana chairs the Economic Community of West African States
which are trying to end factional fighting in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests Extension of UN Force in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali suggested that the Security Council extend
the mandate of the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) for six months to December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali
said that the overall situation on the island remained calm,
although tension rose periodically. UNFICYP continued to make
every effort to mitigate such situation.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed serious concern at the excessive levels
of military forces and armaments in Cyprus and at the rate at
which they are being expanded, upgraded and modernized.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the situation of Greek Cypriots and Maronites in
the northern part of the island continues to fall far short of the
normal life they were promised under the agreement reached by the
two sides in August 1975.
</P>
<P>
Though the Turkish Cypriot authorities made commitment to
improving the daily lives of the persons concerned, the measures
implemented to date are very limited and insufficient. He also
urged the government of Cyprus to take measures towards
normalizing the lives of the Turkish Cypriots in the southern part
of the island.
</P>
<P>
As the encouragement of tolerance, trust and reconciliation
between the two communities is an essential part of the peace
process, the secretary general strongly urged both Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot communities to lift and prevent all obstacles
to such contacts.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP was established in March 1964 by the Security Council
to prevent a recurrence of fighting between the Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot communities. Since then, the council has
periodically extended UNFICYP's mandate.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Working Document on Use of Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today approved a working document on a draft legislation to build
up a legal framework for the use of Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
The document outlined that EURO will be the single currency of
participating European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
However, as stipulated by the document, EURO will be divided
during the transitional period from January 1, 1999, to June 20,
2002, when national currencys are still in existence.
</P>
<P>
"This is aimed to ensure a legally enforceable equivalence
between EURO and national currency units," the EC document added,
suggesting that the continuity of contracts denominated in
national currencies and in the ECU basket should be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The EC said it is also taking steps in accordance with the
remit issued by the Madrid European Council to facilitate the
changeover to the EURO by member nations' public administrations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the EC intended to work on other issues,
particularly affecting consumers, dual pricing for instance,
ahead of the introduction of notes and coins denominated in EUROs.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the relationship between EU nations that are
adopting EURO and those staying out in Stage 3 of the Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU), the EC issued another document today.
</P>
<P>
The document said that there was a broad consensus that the new
relationship should be based on an exchange-rate arrangement
linking the currencies of the non-participant nations to EURO.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that, in order to cater for differences in
convergence among EU nations and to minimize the risk of market
speculation, the new arrangement will need to be flexible.

<HEADLINE> China's Labour Minister on Eradication of Child Labour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Labour Li
Boyong said here on Wednesday that in order to eliminate child
labour, the international community should first make joint
efforts to eradicate poverty, the primary factor behind child
labour.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an informal ministerial meeting at the International
Labour Conference, Li said that for developing countries in
particular, poverty eradication should be seen as a fundamental
way to get rid of child labour.
</P>
<P>
Only by achieving sustained economic development and enhancing
people's living standard could developing countries reduce the
number of families and people living under poverty line, and thus
effectively solving the child labour problem, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
In order to speed up the process of child labour elimination,
Li said developed countries should provide developing countries
with technical and financial assistance in a positive and
constructive manner, with a view to help promote their economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Because of differences in social economic conditions as well as
in traditions and development models, the international community
should give adequate understanding to the child labour problems in
developing countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"No country actually welcome the existance of child labour. In
the meantime, one can not expect it to be wiped out overnight. The
elimination can therefore only proceed in line with realities," Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the situation in China, Li said that the Chinese
government has enacted a number of laws and regulations in the
past few years to strictly ban the use of child workers.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale survey conducted recently in China in order to
assess the implementation of the laws has found basically no child
worker in the state-owned enterprises and collective-owned
township enterprises, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Although some child workers do exist in a few private
companies, Li said the authorities have reacted quickly to punish
the violators.

<HEADLINE> No Way for Liberian Refugee Ship in Ghana, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has said it will not give the
nod to the ship carrying refugees from Liberia to sail in its
port despite a United Nations appeal to take in the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you there is no way we will allow this vessel or
any other vessel carrying Liberian refugees to dock at any port
in Ghana," said Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-registered ship, the Zolotista, with some 450
refugees on board is still lying in international waters off the
Ghanaian port of Takoradi, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Half of those on board the ship are Liberians, including 135
Ghanaians, according to another source Ron Redmond, a UN
spokesman for refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in Geneva on Tuesday that humanitarian
workers had not been given access to the refugees and that Ghana
had been requested to take the refugees in.
</P>
<P>
Togo refused to allow the Zolotitsa to dock in its waters.
Last month, the Cote d'Ivoire rebuffed requests from another
Liberian ship, the Bulk Challenge, to discharge refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zolotitsa has been bobbing along the west African coast
looking for sanctuary for the refugees since it left Monrovia,
capital of Liberia, on May 26. But no country is willing to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
It arrived at Takoradi port, some 230 kilometers west of
Accra, capital of Ghana, last Friday but was pushed back to sea
the second day.
</P>
<P>
Ghana took in about 2,000 Liberian refugees in May under
intense diplomatic pressure. But this time, Asamoah and other
senior officials denied any negotiations regarding the Zolotitsa
had been held between the Ghanaian government and international
agencies.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the UNHCR said it was negotiating with Ghana to
allow the refugees to come ashore after two weeks at sea.
</P>
<P>
Conditions on the ship were insanitary with water, food
and medicine in short supply, the UNHCR said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The last remaining delegates
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) left
Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, yesterday because of threats to
its expatriate staff.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal followed the deliberate attack in which three
of ICRC staff were killed on June 4.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC press release issued here today said it has asked the
Burundi authorities to conduct a thorough and objective inquiry
into the attack.
</P>
<P>
At present, the ICRC does not have sufficient information to
say how long its activities will be suspended, but is maintaining
its infrastructure in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the committee has asked the
authorities to ensure the safety of its local staff and to
safeguard its property.
</P>
<P>
ICRC operations were focusing in particular on medical and
sanitation work, it said, adding that 250 tonnes of seed were
handed out to 125,000 people in 1996 and 180,000 displaced
persons received blankets and plastic sheeting.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Is Key to Human Settlements: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The question of human
settlements is in fact a question of development, said Chinese
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua at today's high-level segment of the
Second U.N. Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
"To maintain a considerable economic growth rate is of great
importance to solve the issue of human settlements," said Zou.
"This is particularly the case with the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without adequate economic development or
necessary growth in overall national strength, the goal of
"adequate shelter for all" could never be reached.
</P>
<P>
Zou also pointed out that a peaceful and tranquil
international environment is the prerequisite for solving the
issues of human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a partnership based on equality and mutual benefit
and strengthened international cooperation are an effective way to
solve the issue of human settlements, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, "respect for special conditions and independent
decision-making constitutes a basic principle for solving issues
of human settlements," the Chinese vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning China's achievements in human settlements, Zou told
the high-level meeting that a total of 12.9 billion square meters
of new housing had been constructed in China since the adoption of
the policy of reform and opening up in 1978.
</P>
<P>
This solved and improved the living conditions for over 500
million people in 160 million families.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to implement the policy of strictly
controlling the scale of large cities, properly developing small
and medium-sized cities and actively developing small towns and
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high-level segment of the HABITAT II, also known as "City
Summit," will last three days during which world leaders will
express their commitment to improving human settlements and
outline their views on how to fulfill the main themes of this
conference -- "adequate shelter for all" and "sustainable
settlements in an urbanizing world."

JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's long-awaited
macro-economic framework was presented today to the joint cabinet
committees in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman, the

<HEADLINE> Discovery Seems to Show New Nearby Planetary System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A new discovery seems to point
to the existence of a planetary system beyond the solar system and
intriguingly close to Earth, a U.S. astronomer said.
</P>
<P>
The finding, about long-term gravitational effects, indicated
that two large objects are accompanying the star Lalande 21185,
the fourth-nearest star to the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The detection, by Dr. George Gatewood of the University of
Pittsburgh, was reported Tuesday at the national meeting of the
American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
Gatewood's research is based on 66 years of observations of
Lalande and drawing on photographs of the star's motions, and
eight years of more recent observations by new electronic light
detectors.
</P>
<P>
Lalande 21185, a red dwarf, is only 8.1 light-years away, while
the other four nearest stars that were recently found having
planets ranged from 35 to 50 light-years from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The star under study is about one-third the mass of the Sun,
and is visible through binoculars in the constellation Ursa Major.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of recent data indicated that the star's velocity
had sped up and slowed down as if some low-mass, slowly orbiting
companions were pulling it along and then slowing it down because
of gravitational effects.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gatewood concluded that one of the objects appeared to be
more massive than Jupiter and traveling a 30-year orbit of Lalande
at a distance equivalent to Saturn's distance from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The other object, which is probably less massive than Jupiter,
has a 5.8-year orbit with a distance from the star is visible
through binoculars in the constellation Ursa Major, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Rethinking of Old Peace-Keeping Paradigm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
urged today to scrutinize, analyze and reassess the tragic events
of Rwanda and make every effort to prevent a possible recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day seminar held in
Plainsboro, New Jersey, Kofi Annan, Under-Secretary-General for
Peace-keeping Operations, said that the peace-keeping operations
could no longer be limited to traditional military functions if
they were to maintain their relevance.
</P>
<P>
On lessons to be drawn from the Rwandan experience, Annan
pointed out it was a case of "too little and too late."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that as the cease-fire collapsed, so did the United
Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). Moreover, UNAMIR
had neither the mandate nor the strength or the resources needed
to launch an effective action to stop the killing.
</P>
<P>
As the situation continued to deteriorate, UNAMIR's strength
was further reduced. When the Security Council agreed to increase
its strength, the troops could not be found. And when they were
finally provided, the war was over and nearly 1 million lives were
lost as a result of the three-month war.
</P>
<P>
Annan asked what was the international community prepared to do
now that it was confronted with the prospects of another genocide
in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is attended by troop-contributing countries,
external experts, senior officials who served with UNAMIR and
senior United Nations staff.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Hails Saudi Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today appreciated the readiness of the Saudi Fund to participate
in financing the 340-km section between Ndundu and Mingoyo on the
Dar-Lindi-Mtwara Highway link.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Fund also promised to provide fund for the
re-surfacing project of the Pemba Airport.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed the appreciation during discussion with a
5-man team of the Saudi Fund executives led by Mohamed
Al-Sufyani, who called on him at the State House this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House, President
Mkapa said he was grateful that a lasting solution to the nagging
road problem to the southern regions is now in sight.
</P>
<P>
He said the two southern regions, Mtwara and Lindi, have
potential for agriculture, tourism and mining, and they have not
been fully exploited because of lack of a permanent road link
with other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Pemba Airport, which the fund has also agreed to resurface,
Mkapa disclosed that it might be completed before the end of this
year, saying the airport is very important to the country's
tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
"Let me express my satisfaction that the projects you are
funding are progressing to your satisfaction and that there is
even some balance that would be used in executing the new
extended road project," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Al-Sufyani told Mkapa that the construction of the now
completed 29-km section between Kisiti and Ikwiriri had been so
well executed by the Tanzania government that some fund had
remained, and the Saudi fund had decided to use the remainder to
fund further road construction work in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwait Fund has already agreed to finance the
construction of a bridge across the Rufiji river between Ikwiriri
and Ndundu.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Acts on Campuses Unacceptable: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today sternly criticized criminal acts by student demonstrators,
saying ways have to be found to put an end to lawlessness on
campuses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official residence in Pretoria,
Mandela said transformation of tertiary institutions has to be
speeded up as there are serious complaints about the current
tempo of change.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, university and technikon council should be
better represented to expedite the process, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Mandela met the heads of universities and
technikons at the Union Buildings to discuss campus unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said black students have genuine grievances because of the
culture of exclusion and alienation in the country's education
system over decades. The government has sympathy with the
concerns of students, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"But what is of concern is the question of criminal actions in
the course of those demonstrations," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "I find it absolutely unacceptable that in
institutions of learning there should be the amount of violence
and illegality which has characterized these demonstrations."
</P>
<P>
Actions condemned by the president included the littering of
campuses, preventing non-protesting students from continuing
classes, damage to property, sit-ins and the taking of hostages.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the methods of bringing an end to violence on
campuses, Mandela said the proposed new police plan, expected to
be unveiled on Thursday, would play an important role in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Although the government would not prescribe to individual
institution what steps they should take, preventive actions would
be the result of consultations between institutions and the
government, added the president.

ISTANBUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel met here today with Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and
called for further development in economic and trade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Demirel, who visited China last year,
repeated his invitation for Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
visit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that constant exchange of visits by high-level
officials of the two countries in the past 20 years had made
great contribution to the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou conveyed Chinese President Jiang's regards to
Demirel during the 30-minute meeting, saying that the Chinese
president has accepted his invitation in principle and the
itinerary would be decided through diplomatic channel.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed hope to increase the economic and trade links
between the two countries, saying businessmen from China and
Turkey should further make efforts to increase the trade volume
which stands now at some 600 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Zou said he agreed with Demirel on the trade issue and the two
sides should multiple their trading products and increase mutual
investments.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told Zou that the Turkish government encouraged Turkish
businessmen to invest in China, which could be connected with
Turkey in the future through the Eurasian rail link, also known as
the new "silkroad on rail."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier arrived here Tuesday for the
high-level segment of the Second U.N. Conference on Human
Settlements (HABITAT II).

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Semiconductor Industry
Association of the U.S. reported that orders received by major
chip makers of the world grew slightly in May.
</P>
<P>
It said that its May book-to-bill ratio, which measures orders
for computer chips and other semiconductors against shipments,
rose to 0.84 from a revised 0.81 ratio in April.
</P>
<P>
The report means that chip manufacturers got 84 U.S. dollars in
new orders for every 100 U.S. dollars worth of chips they shipped.
The report says the rise is a positive development that suggests
the first-quarter stagnancy may be over.
</P>
<P>
The ratio has been below 1.0 -- the dividing point between
market growth and reduction -- since the start of the year.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Delivers Water to Drought-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has
approved a feasibility study to pipe water from the Okavango
river bordering Angola in the north to drought hit central
regions, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Winkhoek, Information and
Broadcasting Minister Ben Amathila said the project would be done
by completing the Okavango-Grootfontein link of the Eastern
National Water Carrier (ENWC) with a 250-km pipeline to the
river.
</P>
<P>
The ENWC is an existing canal from Grootfontein in the north
to the central region.
</P>
<P>
Amathila said failure to supply adequate water to one of the
most economically productive areas of Namibia would have adverse
consequences for future development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, water inflow to the Von Bach,
Skwkoppoort and Omatako dams supplying water to the central area
has been well below average because of the long-lasting drought.
</P>
<P>
The piping water project, with an expected capacity of the
pipeline between 15 and 25 cubic meters per year, has been funded
by the People's Republic of China.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the Palestinian
Council, which was scheduled for today, was canceled due to
failure of council members to enter the West Bank town of Nablus
from the Gaza Strip because of arbitrary Israeli measures.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities prevented the council members from
passing through the checkpoint of Beit Hanon and insisted that
they be thorough-checked, according to the Middle East News

The council earlier held a close meeting attended by
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat to discuss
the repressive Israeli measures against the council members.

President of Palestinian Council Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu
Ala, held the Israeli authorities responsible for the members'

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
completed quartering of the rapid-reaction police force as agreed
by both parties, a U.N. spokesman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general,
said that 587 of the rapid-reaction police officers were quartered
in four cities Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,256.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) quartered and registered 45,295 troops. Only 5,000
more should be quartered before the target set for June 15 is
reached.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has some 60,000 troops, according to U.N. statistics.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council considers the quartering
process a crucial component of the peace process in Angola and has
repeatedly called upon both parties to accelerate the pace of
quartering.
</P>
<P>
To help Angola realize a lasting peace after a three-decade
civil war, the United Nations has stationed 7,071 military
observers, civilian police officers and troops there, the largest
peacekeeping operation of the organization.

LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The total number of people out of
work in Britain fell by 14,800 last month to 2,168,000, a five

<P>
The figure compares with a revised fall of 4,300 in April,
originally reported as a fall of 3,200.
</P>

This left the unemployment rate at 7.7 percent of the workforce
against 7.8 percent in April, its lowest level since April 1991
and well below unemployment levels in continental Europe which
exceed 10 percent.

May's job figure lent support to a flagging Conservative

<HEADLINE> Russian City Mayor Shot Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of a Moscow suburb was
shot dead today in a suspected contract killing that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin condemned as a "villainous murder".
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency quoted police in Zhukovsky as saying that
the 42-year-old city boss Viktor Mosolov was found dead in the
stairwell of his apartment building at 9:30 a.m., with two
gunshots to the head.
</P>
<P>
Police said they suspected an economic motive for the murder of
the mayor, who came to power in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhukovsky, a city of 100,000 and about 20 kilometers east of
Moscow, is a company town centered around Russia's top aerospace
research center.
</P>
<P>
In comments issued by the Kremlin press service, Yeltsin called
the murder "a terrorist act" which tried "to frighten people and
undermine confidence in law and order."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, styling himself as a watchdog of social stability, is
seeking re-election in Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But his attempts have been besmirched by last Friday's bomb
attack that injured Valery Shantsev, candidate for Moscow's deputy
mayor, and by a bomb blast on Tuesday that killed four people in a
Moscow subway station.

<HEADLINE> 2/3 of Pak Budget Goes to Debt Servicing, Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Debt servicing and defense will
take more than 70 percent of the total resources of the Pakistani
government in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget for the fiscal year of July 1996 to
June 1997 announced here today, the debt servicing for the next
fiscal year will be 186.1 billion rupees (5.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It indicates a 13.1 percent increase over the revised estimates
for the debt servicing in 1995-96 amounting to 164.6 billion
rupees (4.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The domestic debt servicing is estimated to increase 15.7
percent, foreign debt servicing 5.0 percent and foreign loan
repayments 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total debt servicing will amount to 42 percent of the total
resources for 1996-97 and 37 percent of the total expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The defense expenditure in 1996-97 has been estimated at 131.4
billion rupees (3.75 billion dollars), a 14.0 percent increase
over the budget for 1995-96, which totaled 115.3 billion rupees
(3.29 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will take up 30 percent of the total resources for 1996-97
and 26 percent of the total expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The total resources for 1996-97 are estimated at 439.2 billion
rupees (12.5 billion dollars) and the total expenditure at 500.2
billion rupees (14.3 billion dollars), according to the budget.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation for the debt servicing and defense in
1995-96 amounted to about 64 percent of the total expenditure and
69 percent of the total resources of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual increase in budgetary allocation for debt
servicing and defense is not so high if the 10.1 percent inflation
is taken into consideration.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to make its millions
of state-owned small enterprises more open to the market, and to
improve the economic returns of the larger businesses.
</P>
<P>
At a pilot city reform conference which closed here Wednesday,
the state-owned small enterprises were urged to be more openly
exposed to the market system to ensure the success of a modern
enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 1994, 7.94 million enterprises
had registered with the country's industrial and commercial
administrations. Small businesses accounted for 99.8 percent of
these.
</P>
<P>
These small firms' industrial output constituted 60 percent of
the total; tax and profit, 40 percent; and employees, 75
percent. These figures indicate that the smaller operations have
served as important workforces, and played an increasingly
significant role in the country's market economy strategy.
</P>
<P>
Provinces including Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong, Hebei,
Heilongjiang, and major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan
and Chongqing have started pilot reform projects for their small
enterprises.

WUHAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, today set up a complaint center for local overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the center, the city issued regulations
on handling overseas investors' complaints
</P>
<P>
Now, officials are working to rectify numerous incorrect
charges claimed by overseas investors, and the city has provided a
series of services for approving foreign-funded projects in an
effort to improve the local investment environment.
</P>
<P>
With convenient transportation, Wuhan, a traditional industrial
base in China, follows Beijing in China to lead the country in
application of scientific and technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
Complete opening of the Yangtze River Valley and the state
policy to shift investment focus from the country's east areas to
the central-and-west areas have turned Wuhan into a hot investment
spot for overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the city approved more than 3,000
foreign-funded projects, with contractual overseas investments
reaching 4.4 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Another Black Church Burns in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A predominantly black church in
Enid, Oklahoma, was destroyed by fire early Thursday, the latest
in a string of suspicious blazes at black churches around the
south of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rev. Alfred Baldwin, pastor of the First Missionary Baptist
Church, said firefighters told him they believed someone broke a
rear window of the church and used an accelerant such as gasoline
to start the fire, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The fire was brought under control about two hours later, and
no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Marshal Bill Presley said factors such as the
intensity and size of the blaze made it suspicious.
</P>
<P>
Asked if investigators believe this church fire was connected
to more than 30 other suspicious fires at predominantly black
Southern churches since early 1995, police Sergeant David Gibson
said, "It's too early to say. We hope it's not."
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the church is multicultural with two white
ministers on staff.
</P>
<P>
The string of fires includes four other blazes in the past 10
days.

<HEADLINE> President of Bangladesh's Awami League (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, president of the
Awami (People's) League (AL), is poised to be Bangladesh's new
prime minister as her party won the country's seventh
parliamentary elections today.
</P>
<P>
Born on September 28, 1947, at Tungipara village under Faridpur
district in central Bangladesh, Hasina is the eldest daughter of
Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, who led the nation to
independence in 1971.
</P>
<P>
As a scion of a political family, Hasina was actively involved
in student politics in her college and university life when she
gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his
student leaders during Mujibur's repeated imprisonment by the then
Pakistani rulers in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Always popular among the students, Hasina was elected chief of
the students union of the Eden Girls' College, the leading women's
college in the country, where she was studying. She was also a
member of the student league of the Dhaka University
</P>
<P>
At the time of the liberation war for independence, she was
imprisoned with family members.
</P>
<P>
On the fateful night of August 15, 1975 when some disgruntled
army officers assassinated her father, the then head of the state,
her mother and three brothers to capture power, Hasina and her
only sister Sheikh Rohana survived the carnage because they were
on a tour of the then West Germany.
</P>
<P>
By sheer luck, she escaped from the conspiracy of eliminating
her entire family and subsequently rose to the leadership of the
AL founded by her father. She was elected AL president in 1981 in
her absence.
</P>
<P>
On her return home after six years of exile to take up the
party leadership, she declared: "I have nothing to lose. I pledge
you to fight for restoring the democratic rights of my people."
</P>
<P>
With her firm conviction in constitutional and democratic
movement against the military rule of the then H.M. Ershad regime,
Hasina was arrested and imprisoned many times. But she was
successful in leading her party and a 15-party alliance in the
parliamentary elections held in 1986, in which she won in three
constituencies. Afterwards, she was elected leader of the
opposition in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
After March 1994, the opposition leader led a prolonged
campaign against the then government of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), demanding the holding of a general election under a
neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
While boycotting the sixth parliamentary election held by the
BNP government on February 15 this year, Hasina led the opposition
alliance in launching a month-long "non-cooperation movement"
which forced the BNP government to step down and hand over the
power to a non-party caretaker government to pave way for the
just-ended seventh parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A widely traveled personality, Hasina visited and addressed
international seminars in different countries in Asia, Africa,
Europe and the United States. She is an avid reader of books and
journals on international politics, literature and social changes.
</P>
<P>
In 1968, Hasina was married to Dr. M.A. Wazed Miah, an eminent
scientist. They have a son and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Up by 0.8 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the United
States rose by 0.8 percent in May, the third advance in five
months of this year, the Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 205.5 billion dollars, up
from 203.9 billion in April, when sales slipped 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, which account for about one-fourth of total retail
sales, increased by 2.1 percent in May after a 3.8 percent loss a
month earlier, the department report said.
</P>
<P>
After remaining unchanged in January, retail sales in the
United States shot up 2.1 percent in February, and registered a
0.4 percent gain a month later.
</P>
<P>
Sales in May were 5.5 percent higher than they were during the
same month of 1995. But some analysts contend that they will slow
down in the second half of 1996, in part because of high consumer
debt levels.
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Association said earlier this week that
credit card delinquencies during the January-March quarter reached
the highest level in 14 years, a signal that consumers may be
reaching their debt limits.
</P>
<P>
In the retail sales report, the Commerce Department said sales
of big-ticket durable goods expected to last more than three years
jumped 1.9 percent in May, wiping out a 1.8 percent loss in April.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods, meanwhile, were flat after rising 1
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales are an important gauge of the U.S. economy, since
they represent one-third of the nation's economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Stroke Deaths Rise In Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of deaths caused by
strokes has risen nine percent in Canada in the past five years,
said a recent research report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 16,000 Canadians died from strokes last year and four
times that number had brain damage caused by strokes, according to
the report by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Although most survivors return to their homes, some 65 percent
are left with paralysis, loss of speech or mental ability, said
the foundation, which has launched a campaign to get doctors and
the public to treat stroke symptoms as a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
Many people who have a stroke are apt to go to bed and hope the
symptoms go away. But by the time they see a doctor, the damage
is done, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
When people feel sudden splitting headache, dizziness,
difficulty in speaking or weakness on one side of body, they
should go to see the doctor immediately, the foundation
recommended.

<HEADLINE> Mineral Resources in Sino-Russian Border Areas Prospective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Sino-foreign geologists believe
northeast China's border area is rich in mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a Sino-Russian seminar on the comparison
of geology and mineralization in Sino-Russian border areas, which
was concluded today in China's border city of Manzhouli.
</P>
<P>
About 80 geologists from China and Russia attended the
seminar. When comparing the geology and mineralization in the
Ergun area in northeast China and all of northeast Asia,
geologists agreed that the Hulun Buir League shares a similar
geological structure and mineralization with the Russian border
area.
</P>
<P>
Large minerals have been recovered in the Russian side of the
border, therefore experts held that there should be rich mineral
reserves in the Chinese side, the Hulun Buir League, as well.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, Chinese and Russian experts exchanged
discoveries on mineral technology.
</P>
<P>
The seminar heard 30 research papers, 12 of which were
presented by Russian geologists. Experts said that the discussions
would contribute to the ability to locate, develop and use mineral
resources in northeast Asia, especially areas along northeast
China's Da Hinggan Ling prefecture.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Refuted by Chinese Army Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A front-page commentary on today's
Liberation Army Daily refuted a Western accusation of "China
threat," saying the Chinese government not only calls an end to
nuclear testing but advocates complete destruction of nuclear
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled, "Where does nuclear threat come from?"
quoted statistics provided by international organizations to claim
that China has conducted the fewest nuclear tests in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the United States has conducted 1,030
nuclear tests; Russia (including the former Soviet Union), 715;
Britain, 45; France, 192; and China, 41.
</P>
<P>
Based on these figures, on average, for every four of China's
nuclear tests, the United States conducted 100.
</P>
<P>
China, which has exercised utmost restraint in conducting
nuclear tests, and has conducted the minimum number of
tests, was accused of "threatening world security". "That is
extremely unfair," the signed commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It said that several Western countries have distorted facts
and said publicly that China's nuclear tests pose a threat to
regional and world security. They have used this as one of their
major reasons for trumpeting the so-called "China threat," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that China advocates self-defense by owning a small
number of nuclear weapons and conducting limited number of nuclear
tests. China was forced by outside nuclear threats to develop
nuclear arsenals, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
(1950-1953), the U.S. military made several claims that it would
drop atomic bombs on northeast China, which borders the DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently announced a moratorium on
nuclear testing in September, after it conducts one final test.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the halting of nuclear tests is just
one measure, while the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons is the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Chinese government suggested that the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) be concluded no later than
the end of 1996, and promised to stop nuclear testing as soon as
the treaty goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
In addition the Chinese delegation has taken an active part in
the CTBT negotiations in Geneva, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Current negotiations on the comprehensive halting of nuclear
tests could have never happened without the unremitting efforts
made by China and other developing countries, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation is peace-loving, and China's nuclear weapons
did not, do not and will not pose threat to any other country in
the world, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that the real threat to world security is posed by
those hegemonic powers which advocate the so-called "China
threat," try to contain other countries, and have frequently
interfered in the internal affairs of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Road Death Number High in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece has the highest number of
road deaths in Europe, apart from Portugal, a parliamentary road
safety committee has reported.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results of a European study on traffic
accidents, the committee said that over 22,000 traffic accidents
are reported in Greece every year, with an average of 2,000 deaths
and 32,000 injuries. Half of those killed were aged between 20 and
44. Drunk driving remains the leading cause of accidents.
</P>
<P>
"In our country, the problem of road accidents is more serious
than aids, drugs and air pollution," Christos Mangoufis, chairman
of the committee, said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mortality rate from road accidents is
steadily growing in Greece, contrary to most European countries
where it is decreasing.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, from 1975 to 1995, the number of
fatalities in Greece rose by 105 percent while the EU average
dropped by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that road accidents cost the country 115
billion drachmas (about 500 million u.s. dollars) per year.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy to Continue Steady Growth: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's economy will continue to
experience steady growth in the next 25 years, a group of noted
Chinese and foreign economists said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the viewpoint shared at the seminar "The Economy of
China: Analysis and Forecast," sponsored by Salomon Brothers Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, one of China's top economists, said China
successfully controlled its inflation and slowed down its
overheated economy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country is striving to improve its state
enterprises' economic results, and to reform its banking
institutions, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence J. Lau, professor of economic development of Stanford
University in the US, said in the year 2020, China's real GDP and
GDP per capita are projected to be about five trillion US dollars
and 3,500 dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate will begin a slow but steady secular decline
in 1995, to about six percent in 2000 and five percent in 2010,
and remain more or less constant thereafter, reflecting increased
success in macroeconomic control, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Han Jun, associate professor with the Institute of Rural
Development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said grain
market prices continued to rise in 1995 and the expected increase
in government procurement prices this year is likely to have a
limited impact on the open market price.
</P>
<P>
He said China will become a bigger player in the world grain
market in the foreseeable future.

DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh today set June 19 as the
date for repolling in 27 of the 300 constituencies of the 7th
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Abu

"By and large, the election was free, fair, transparent and
neutral," he said, adding that there had been some cases of
violence and indiscipline and attempts of malpractice, but those
were rather very negligible.

<HEADLINE> Roh Admits Sending Troops to Cabinet Meeting in 1980 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo admitted here today that he personally sent troops to a
government building in 1980, where the cabinet was meeting to
discuss extending martial law nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, Roh, on trial for mutiny and treason, rejected the
prosecution's accusations that the deployment of troops on May 17,
1980, was intended to intimidate the cabinet to approve the
extension.
</P>
<P>
Roh's testimony, which contradicted his earlier statement to
prosecutors, was made during cross-examinations by his lawyers
during the 13th session of his trial at the Seoul District Court.
</P>
<P>
Roh, 64, a former army general, is accused of helping his
predecessor Chun Doo-Hwan stage a premeditated coup in 1979 to
seize power. He faces a maximum penalty of death on charges
related to the coup and the subsequent massacre of demonstrators
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He testified today that, "I knew that the major commanders'
meeting was to discuss the nationwide expansion of martial law on
May 17, 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Since the matter had to be approved by the cabinet, I
predicted that a cabinet session might be held later that day."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the deployment of troops to the area
surrounding the capitol building and cabinet session room that day
was not to intimidate cabinet members, but to guard the conference
room and safeguard the ministers in accordance with martial law
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Roh also denied that the deployment of troops to the venue
of the cabinet meeting was done at the request of the then Major
General Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was succeeded by Roh, who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun and another 14 former army officers, including former Army
Chief of Staff Lee Hui-sung and former Defense Minister Chu
Yong-bok, have also been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their
alleged roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in
the bloody crackdown of a civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted on graft charges for allegedly receiving illegal funds
from businessmen while in office.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government led by
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto today presented the budget for
1996-97 fiscal year with a total outlay of 500.2 billion rupees
(14.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget, presented this afternoon by Minister of State for
Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin at the National Assembly, was the
third by the Benazir government since it came to power in October,
1993.
</P>

dollars) in expenditure compared with the outgoing fiscal year's
431 billion rupees (12.31 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in expenditure is based on the officially

year and devaluation of the local currency of rupee by around 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget includes allocation of 186 billion rupees (5.31

billion dollars) for defense, 44 billion rupees (1.26 billion
dollars) for public sector development program, and 62 billion
rupees (1.77 billion dollars) for the Social Action Program.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue resources available for the forthcoming fiscal
year are estimated at 439.3 billion rupees (12.5 billion dollars)
with net revenue receipts of 280 billion rupees (8 billion
dollars) and capital receipts of 26.1 billion rupees (742 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to bring down the budget deficit to four percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as demanded by the International
Monetary Fund, the Pakistani government has proposed a total levy
of 40.85 billion rupees (1.14 billion dollars) in the new budget.

Li expressed the conviction that Prime Minister Hariri's
current China tour -- his first -- will enhance the friendship
between the two peoples and strengthen bilateral friendly
relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Lebanese friendship has a long history, and the two

development since the two established diplomatic ties 25 years
ago, Li added.
</P>
<P>
China and Lebanon share similar, often identical views on major
international and regional issues, and always support and help

Li Peng said Sino-Lebanese economic and trade ties constitute
an important part of bilateral relations. Such ties, which hold
great potential, have witnessed continual development in recent

<P>
"We are glad to see that Lebanon is restoring its status as the

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Color TV Producer Merges Hong Kong Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The TCL Electronics Corporation
in south China's Guangdong Province has become the first in the TV
industrial sector to merge with an overseas-funded company.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed today with the Hong Kong-based
Luks Company Limited Industrial, TCL will invest 150 million Hong
Kong dollars to revamp Hong Kong's color TV project.
</P>
<P>
ETRON, Luks' current brand name, will be changed to TCL.
</P>
<P>
TCL edged into China's color TV market several years ago with
its quality big-screen color TV sets. Its sales volume now ranks
third among those of China's brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
Luks entered the color TV sector in the early 1980s and formed
a color TV research and production base in Shenzhen. It has an
annual production capacity of 800,000 color TV sets, and is one of
the first to pass the ISO9000 identification in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The merger will involve registered funds of 250 million Hong
Kong dollars, 60 percent of which will come from TCL, and 40
percent from Luks.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, TCL Electronic Corporation,
Shenzhen, will be established following the merge with Luks
(Shekou) Co., Ltd. A new color TV production base with an area of
63,000 sq m will be built in Huizhou, and the TCL (Hong Kong)
Electronics Corporation joint venture will be established to help
purchase raw materials and develop overseas markets and
engineering technology for the branches in Shenzhen and Huizhou.
</P>
<P>
The merger will increase the output of TCL's color TV sets to
more than two million, economists said, and it will strengthen the
competition between local and overseas brands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still World's Largest Arms Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is still the
world's biggest arms exporter, but Russia has emerged as a major
supplier of conventional weapons, a Swedish research group said
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share of the 22.8 billion dollar world arms market
fell sharply from 56 percent in 1994 to 43 percent in 1995. But
Russia's exports surged dramatically from just four percent to 17
percent of the market, the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) said in its annual yearbook.
</P>
<P>
Overall world military spending continued to decline in 1995,
mainly because the biggest customer, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), cut its spending by more than five percent.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, including France, Italy, Sweden and the United
States have cut military spending by 25 percent or more since
1987. Only India, Japan and South Korea increased their spending
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Global military research and development spending has slumped
by 50-55 percent over the same period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The institute forecasts further falls in global military
spending.
</P>
<P>
"The present trend of falling military spending in real terms
will undoubtedly continue into the next few years, as many NATO
countries ... have announced plans or indicated that military
spending will be cut further," the group said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in world military spending coincides with a drop in
major armed conflicts. Last year, there were 30 wars in 25
locations but in 1994 there were 32 wars in 28 places.
</P>
<P>
And all of last year's major conflicts were internal rather
than between states and the risk of global nuclear war has
diminished, said the group.
</P>
<P>
But the report warned that many developing countries continue
to maintain military expenditure at levels which are out of
proportion to their legitimate security requirements.

<HEADLINE> HK to Declare Temple of Two Gods Historical building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will declare I Shing
Kung, which literally means "a temple of two gods", as a
historical building Friday under the Antiquities and Monuments
Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few surviving examples of its kind, I Shing Kung
is situated in Wang Chau, Yuen Long. It was originally a small
temple for the worship of two deities, Hung Shing and Che Kung.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the temple bell, the oldest remaining relic, and
the structure of the building, the temple was probably built by
residents of the six villages in Wang Chau area in 1718, the 57th
year of Emperor Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
It is a green-brick two-hall structure with an open courtyard
flanked by covered aisles. The left aisle, which was formerly
used as a kitchen to prepare basin meals during Ta Chiu festivals,
 is no longer in use.
</P>
<P>
The roof ridge is of simple geometric design while wall friezes
 are decorated with leafy and floral plaster molding.
</P>
<P>
The temple underwent minor repairs in the 1970s and 1980s and
most of the original features have been retained in fair
condition.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of I Shing Kung brings the total number of
monuments in Hong Kong to 61.

<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Olympic title hopeful Michael
Johnson of the United States threatened never to run in Britain
again after being denied a chance to run in the 400 meters at next
month's Grand Prix meet in London.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, world champion at 200 and 400 meters bidding to become
the first man to win both events in the Olympics, is banned from
the 400 meters at the July 12 Crystal Palace event at the request
of Britian's 400-meter runners.
</P>
<P>
"Michael was invited to run the 400, confirmed his acceptance
of the financial offer and today I was told that the BAF's
position had been changed," Johnson's agent Brad Hunt said on
Thursday. "Michael would have to run the 200 or not at all.
</P>
<P>
"I could infer that someone wanted to make sure the British 400
meters runners did not take a shellacking before the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time it has happened to Michael with
British meets. It will be the last time. If he does not run this
400 meters in London, I would be very surprised if he ever allows
me to negotiate with the BAF again."
</P>
<P>
BAF spokesman Tony Ward said the original invitation was for
Johnson to run the 200, but that Hunt came back and said Johnson
wanted to run the 400.

<HEADLINE> HK Equity Funds Run Up for Top For 5 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong equity funds were the
only Asian equity sector which managed to consistently in the top
five in the first five months of 1996, according to a performance
survey of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
As the end of May, the funds came the fifth in the sector with
an annual return of 22.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
HKIFA chairman Andrew Lo said that on a year-to-date basis, the
Hong Kong stock market has provided a return of around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relatively satisfactory return is probably due
to the recovery in the property market, and the lowering in
interest rates by the Central Bank in China which shows signs of
soft landing.
</P>
<P>
The only other Asian equity sector which was able to stay in
the top fifteen positions for four months in the year was the
Indonesian equity sector.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of Asian equity funds were not in the top
fifteen positions, most of the non-Asian equity sectors managed to
take up places in the top league.

NEW DELHI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The "unofficial and irregular"
trade between India and Pakistan is six times the formal and
official trade, said the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
"The unofficial and irregular trade between India and Pakistan
amounts to as much as 20,000 million rupees (597 million US
dollars) a year, while the official trade is about 3,500 million
rupees (104.47 million US dollars)," FICCI Secretary General Amit
Mitra told Press Trust of India (PTI) in an interview here today.
</P>
<P>
"Such a high level of unofficial trade, mostly from the banned

</P>
<P>
The unofficial trade was through the two countries' borders or
through Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong, Mitra said. "Smuggling is
assessed anywhere between 8,000 to 16,000 million rupees (238.80
to 477.61 million US dollars)."

</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr

He said that the summit aims at reaching a unified Arab stance
on the peace process, which he described as an issue of destiny.
</P>

He told reporters that a meeting of Arab foreign ministers
prior to the Cairo summit is also important for the coordination
of Arab stances and the success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief met with Moussa to discuss the agenda of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the Arab League's 22 members will attend the

demobilize all child soldiers who are normally fighting alongside
government troops, a military spokesman here said.
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations statsitics, an estimated 2,000
children were at the height of the war associated with the armed
forces while some 28 percent of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) total forces were made up of kids.
</P>
<P>
Psycho social care for demobilized children and family tracing
have been underway since 1993 through the Children Affected by
War (CAW) programme.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) recently budgeted 784,400
U.S. Dollars to cover the period from March 1, 1996 to February
28, 1997 for psychiatric treatment of demobilized child
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Send 35 Athletes to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will send 22 men and 13
women athletes to the Atlanta Olympic Games, Thailand Olympic
Committee vice president Chairat Khamnuan announcd here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These athletes will take part in seven events, namely, track
and field, badminton, boxing, swimming (diving), shooting, tennis
and weightlifting, Khamnuan said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said Thailand had yet to decide to send
athletes to the windsurfing and yatching events in the Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
Khamnuan noted that it was unrealistic for the Thai athletes to
win gold medal in Atlanta. "But that doesn't mean they will come
home empty-handed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which is to stage the 13th Asian Games in 1998, will
gain experience as a host of the sporting gala from Atlanta,
Khamnuan added.

<HEADLINE> Over 7,000 S.Leonean Refugees Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7,649 Sierra Leonean
refugees have voluntarily returned from Liberia over the past two
weeks, officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
"They are mainly from Pujehun in the south and the Zimmi area
considered to be the hot bed of rebels," one official, John
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists in the area said the refugees returned by
land route, carrying an assortment of property including grass
beds and cooking utensils.
</P>
<P>
One journalist disclosed that many of them looked "slightly
malnourished, especially the children and that they are being
helped by the army to set up makeshift houses in Pujehun town."
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations records, a total of 360,000 Sierra
Leonean refugees sought refuge in Guinea at the outbreak of the
rebel war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNICEF representative in Sierra Leone Benedict
Mboya said in an interview today that the war has introduced a
new phenomena of child beggars, child labourers, child sex
workers and unaccompanied children, most of whom are working or
living on the streets.
</P>
<P>
On how UNICEF would retrieve children held behind rebel lines,
a good number of whom were abducted by the RUF in the northern
town of Kambia in 1994, Mboya said his organization "is now
working with the International Committee of the Red Cross" to
resolve the matter.

<HEADLINE> China Has New Rules on Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Civil Affairs Ministry
published a decision today that revises its provisions on adoption
registration measures for Macao residents and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The additions were made to specify adoption procedures and
change relevant rulings on adoptions made by these groups, said
Yang Yanyin, vice-minister of civil affairs, at a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to its adoption laws, China implements a registration
system for adopting deserted infants, children and orphans in
welfare institutions. Such regulations were established as a means
to protect the rights and interests of the parties involved,
especially the adopted children, and to ensure family and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Adoption registration regulations issued in 1992 did not
stipulate concrete procedures for adoption registration, and rules
relating to Macao residents and overseas Chinese are either
unfeasible or unreasonable, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations state that Macao residents must present
documents from government civil affairs bureaus and notary
offices to adopt children on the Chinese mainland, and the Chinese
translation must be confirmed by the relevant department of the
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch.
</P>
<P>
However, an article was omitted from the regulations that
requires overseas Chinese to offer Chinese translation of their
documents.
</P>
<P>
Yang appealed the media to do more to publicize the adoption
law and the new regulations, "since many still do not know how to
lawfully adopt children, which leads to quite a number of civil
disputes relating to adoption, affecting family and social
stability."
</P>
<P>
"Only the adoptions formed through legal procedures are
protected by the law," she stressed.

NANNING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Many private enterprises have made
great efforts to help local poor counties in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region to escape from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Nanshan Group Company in south China's Guangdong Province

<HEADLINE> Singapore Says No Charges Against Barings Executives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore said today that its
investigations of two Barings executives were concluded and there
were insufficient grounds to bring criminal changes against them.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of Singapore said in a
statement that on March 22, 1995, the CAD started investigations
to determine if James Bax, the former Managing Director of Baring
Future Singapore (BFS), and Simon Jones, a former director of the
BFS, had committed any offenses under the Singapore law in
relation to their dealings with the BFS.
</P>
<P>
The former BFS manager in charge of the firm's futures trading,
Nick Leeson, is now serving his 6.5-year imprisonment in Singapore
for his role in causing the 1.4 billion US dollars trading losses
that finally brought down the 230 year old Barings Bank of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The CAD said that it had completed its investigations which
took into account the Report of the Inspectors appointed by the
Singapore Minister for Finance and transcripts of the statements
taken by them.
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration of all the evidence, the CAD has
recommended to the Attorney-General that there are insufficient
grounds to bring criminal charges against them," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney-General, having reviewed the evidence, concurs
with the assessment of the CAD and has directed that no further
action in this direction be taken with respect to these
individuals," it continued.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Economy Benefits From Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region is witnessing rapid economic development while
doing a good job in family planning.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the region's gross domestic product (GDP)
went up to 166.6 billion yuan in 1995 from the former 44.9 billion
yuan in 1990; meanwhile, the region's birth rate stood at an
average 12.81 per thousand annually, 2.09 per thousand points
lower than the state quota.
</P>
<P>
Calculations based on the former birth rate show that three
million more people would have been born in the region in the past
five years if the family planning policy had not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhiliang and Chen Cuilan, a couple from Maling Town of Lipu
County, decided not to have any children after their daughter was
born.
</P>
<P>
They contracted some 20 hectares of land to plant orange trees
and plum trees. The couple earned 300,000 yuan from selling
oranges last year.
</P>
<P>
More people in the region have given up the traditional concept
of "more children mean much happiness".
</P>
<P>
In Tonghua Village of Lipu County, the local population dropped
to the current 2,900 from the original 3,040 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But the village has become one of the richest with 70 percent
of local households having an annual income of over 100,000
yuan. More than 50 percent of them have built new houses and
bought color TVs, refrigerators and motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Gives Up Its Buried Treasures (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the largest sunken ships might have been carrying some
100 stone construction materials and sculptures, including the
headless minister sculpture with a coral at his neck, spotted by
diver Li.
</P>
<P>
"The stone materials were probably intended for the building of
a large temple," said Yang Lin, official from the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics, and head of the archaeological team.
</P>
<P>
Documents show that southeast China saw many people emigrate to
Malaysia and the Philippines beginning from the late Ming
Dynasty. Many of them became rich overseas and decided to build
temples to give thanks for their good fortune. Even today such
temples can be found in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The construction materials used for the temples were always
transported from China.
</P>
<P>
The sunken ship with the 100-odd stone materials and sculptures
left the Chinese mainland for southeast Asia no later than the
early Qing Dynasty, according to the team members.
</P>
<P>
It hit rocks near Shanhu Island, leaving all the stones
scattered in two trenches five to six meters below the surface.
</P>
<P>
The stones include two-meter-long square pillars,
four-meter-long round pillars and cross beams, and one-meter-long,
0.5-meter-wide boards carved with S-shapes or plum blossom designs.
</P>
<P>
The little lion beside the headless minister's sculpture was a
decoration from one of the square pillars.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the site was the head of a statue of the Buddha
of Mercy, who is smiling with benign countenance. The lines of her
hair worn in a bun can be clearly seen in the water.
</P>
<P>
The head matched objects were netted by local fishermen some
time ago, and subsequently handed to the cultural relics office in
Tanmen township in Qionghai, Hainan Island.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met here today with Soren Gyll, president and chief executive
officer of Sweden's AB Volvo and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Wu expressed
appreciation for the heavy-duty truck joint venture which Volvo
established in Shandong province, together with China National
Heavy Duty Truck Corp. and Shandong Automobile Corp.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Gyll's visit will further advance Volvo's
cooperation with its Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the automobile industry is a leading industry in
China, one that has been set forth in China's Ninth "Five Year
Plan" (1996-2000) and in the long-term development objectives for
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"China has a huge demand for automobiles and the development of
automobile industry can spur other related industries," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that China has mapped out industrial
policies to provide for the healthy development of the automobile
industry. He welcomed Volvo's closer, more economical and more
environmentally-friendly cooperation in the production of
heavy-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Gyll said Volvo and its Chinese partners have experienced
excellent cooperation, and he hoped the goodwill can expand to
other fields.
</P>
<P>
Gyll and his party arrived here today at the invitation of the
government of Shandong Province.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone MP Calls for Charge Against Officers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A member of Sierra Leone's
parliament has called on the government to "charge all military
officers who took part in the coup" on April 29, 1992, which
overthrew the civilian government of President Joseph Momoh.
</P>
<P>
MP Victor Foh, who represents the All People's Congress (APC)
which was toppled by the army, said on Wednesday that "such
violation of the constitution should not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament during a debate, Foh said, "they should
be tried for treason. We must stop this flagrant violation of the
constitution by ill disposed members of the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
Foh also said, "they also committed murder with the execution
of 29 civilians without judicial trial."
</P>
<P>
His reference, observers said, was the mass execution of 29
civilians who were shot to death when the military government
claimed that they were plotting to overthrow the junta.
</P>
<P>
Foh also referred to 58 former cabinet ministers who were
detained for up to two years after they were stripped of their
national awards, properties and also ordered to pay huge fines on
alleged charges of state corruption.
</P>
<P>
Another parliamentarian, Gavas Labor blamed the army "for the
chaos" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers are supposed to maintain peace but the war rages on.
Let the soldiers tell us who are the rebels and sobels", he
added.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the call by Foh for members of the military
junta to be charged "is unlikely to be taken up" by the civilian
government of President Tejan Kabbah, whose policy is now of
reconciliation with former political adversaries "to heal the
deep wounds" which had developed in the past.

In addition to the relics left by sunken ships, the team also
found traces of ancient people living temporarily on an island
there.
</P>
<P>
Although it was the latest to be formed, and covering an area
of only 0.3 sq km, Ganquan Island in the mid-western part of the
Xisha Islands is perhaps the most famous because of its fresh
water.
</P>
<P>
Like most of the islands in Xisha, Ganquan is a volcano-shaped
isle surrounded by sandy shores. Scaevola sericea, a typical
wide-leafed plant in Xisha, can be found in the higher reaches of
the isle.
</P>
<P>
In the central basin are grass and bush, looking like those in
inland areas, partly because of the rich fresh water deposits in
the island.
</P>
<P>
The earliest people making use of the fresh water were probably
from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), according to an archaeological
research conducted 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Archaeologists from Guangdong Province claimed that
they discovered a site where people from Tang and Song dynasties
had been living.
</P>
<P>
They found at the site 100 relics including pottery, porcelain,
iron knifes, pot fragments, remains of food - bird bones and shells
 - and traces of food-cooking.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US, Britain More Concerned About Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
have shown more concern to the latest developments in the Gulf
since the diplomatic disputes occurred between Bahrain and Iran
last week.
</P>
<P>
Various evidences available here during the last few days have
demonstrated that the United States and Britain did not hesitate
to show support for Bahrain after it announced last week that it
foiled a Iran-backed coup attempt to overthrow its government.
</P>
<P>
Iran has strongly denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Bahrain's announcement, the U.S and Britain
as well as other western counties with most influence in the Gulf
condemned the alleged Iranian interference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said on June 6 that Washington took
the allegations "very, very seriously," adding that "given the
long-standing friendship between the United States and Bahrain, we
would like to firmly support the government of Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain, which provided military protection to
Bahrain until 1971, expressed "great concern and gave full
backing to the island's rulers."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office said "we have a vital interest in peace
and stability in Bahrain, a close friend and ally, and condemn
any interference, by Iran or others, in its internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Two days later on June 8, a report from Dubai, a free port
metropolitan in the United Arab Emirates, quoted British
secretary of states for the armed forces Nicholas Soames as
saying that Britain "plans to strengthen our military presence in
the Gulf to guarantee security and stability there" in the light
of the threat from Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said "our ground and naval forces which have been
permanently stationed in the Gulf region since 1980 are not
enough to fulfill all the objectives assigned to them," adding
that "we must stay on our guard to prevent another shock like the
Iraqi attack on Kuwait in 1990."
</P>
<P>
On June the 11, U.S. President Bill Clinton has sent Bahrain a
message of firm support, in which he said that "I have always
condemned Iran's support for terrorism and sabotage and its
attempt to interfere in other countries' affairs."
</P>
<P>
"Bahrain and the United States have long and historic
relations and cooperation and we have common goals one of
which to boost security in the region and in our countries,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the administrative headquarters for the United
States Navy's Fifth Fleet which is operating in the oil rich
region.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said it is understandable that the U.S. and
Britain have reacted so strongly and frequently to the incident
taking place in such a tiny Gulf island country which would
otherwise attack no response from them.
</P>
<P>
Gulf region which produces nearly one-fifth of the world's
crude supplies and their oil reserves of around 465 billion
barrels accounts for 45 percent of the global oil resources is of
strategically importance to the western industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States imports from the Gulf region more than 30
percent of its oil consumption, followed by Britain, Germany and
Japan, each has a large share of Gulf oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has implemented a policy of dual-check on the two big
Gulf countries of Iraq and Iran since the Gulf Crisis in 1990-91
to maintain the stability of the region which is of great
importance to its interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S military forces now stationed in the Gulf region
amounts to more that 20 thousand soldiers. As for Britain,
it presently has several warships permanently stationed in the
Gulf and sends its soldiers to several countries in the
region to help train their own military forces.

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang said here today that issues concerning Hong Kong do
not need any observance from the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a draft resolution concerning Hong Kong
adopted by the US House of Representatives, Shen said the US
congress had better closely follow what is happening inside the US.
</P>
<P>
The US House of Representatives has adopted a draft resolution,
stating that in the process of the transition of Hong Kong, the US
would closely observe actions taken by China in Hong Kong and that
it would impose sanctions on China when it deems necessary.
</P>
<P>
"I really doubt whether the US congressmen have a clear
understanding of the history of Hong Kong," Shen said, adding that
"I don't even believe that the people in Hong Kong will agree to
such an observance."
</P>
<P>
Touching on sanctions, the spokesman said that fact has proved
that for such a large country like China, sanctions would have no
effect at all.

<HEADLINE> China Compiles Large Ordinary Map Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale collection of state
ordinary maps of China has been compiled and published after
extensive efforts of more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the maps, which have taken more than 100 experts
and scientists over ten years to complete, provide the most
comprehensive geographic information ever made public in China.
</P>
<P>
The collection was organized by the state surveying bureau and
compiled by the China Map Publishing House, China Surveying
Science Research Institute and the Shaaxi Surveying Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It reflects China's natural landforms, including the hydrology,
physical features, residential areas, communications,
administrative regions, geology and vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Compiling the state map collections was one of China's primary
science projects, initiated in 1956 by the late Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Plans called for five volumes of state map collections that
included the ordinary maps, and also maps detailing nature,
agriculture, the economy and history.
</P>
<P>
The compilation began in 1958, but was stalled for ten years
during the so-called "Cultural Revolution". The work resumed in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture and economy map collections have been made
public while the remaining two are yet to be published.

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old Chinese girl has
invented a watch that can tell the time of 100 countries, "China
Women News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoyan is a secondary school student. But she did not even
know that time varies from country to country until her first
geography class.
</P>
<P>
If somebody can make a watch that can tell the time in
different parts of the planet, that would be terrific, Wu thought.
</P>
<P>
Then she began to design her "100-country-time watch" on a map.
</P>
<P>
With the help of her father, she finally succeeded. And her
design has been given patent by China's State Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
A factory has even started to produce the new watch based on
Wu's design. Additionally the State Science and Technology
Commission has listed the design in a major scientific development
program.
</P>
<P>
Wu hopes her watch will be exported in the near future and worn
by people from around the world, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Caused by Three Gorges Dam Minor, Experts Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Three Gorges Dam
project will be able to withstand a massive earthquake measuring
10 on the Richter scale, a top Chinese seismologist has announced.
</P>
<P>
A quake of such a magnitude will not threaten the safety of the
dam, said seismologist Chai Baoping.
</P>
<P>
The dam's colossal water storage capacity may be able to induce
an earthquake as large as six magnitude, but the resulting
intensity affecting the dam will be below six, seismologists say.
</P>
<P>
Chai said the dam is designed to survive an earthquake with an
intensity of ten degrees. Therefore the potential of induced
earthquakes will not threaten its safety.
</P>
<P>
The dam which is now under construction along the Yangtze River
in central China's Hubei Province is one of the world's biggest
key water control projects.
</P>
<P>
It will form the largest lake in the country's mountainous
areas, with a water storage capacity of over 30 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Antishock capacity around the dam is one of the issues Chinese
scientists and officials have faced since the project was
planned. Other issues include silting, ecology, resettlement of
residents, mud slides, huge ship locks and equipment, Chai said.
</P>
<P>
Chai Baoping, also a high-rank official from the State
Seismological Bureau, said almost all of the huge dams in the
world induce earthquakes of different magnitudes because of the
large water storage.
</P>
<P>
"The larger the water storage, the bigger the possibility of
earthquakes it might induce," Chai said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the dam can induce earthquakes became a major concern
for the whole nation."

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Caused by Three Gorges Dam Minor, Experts Say (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese seismologists have already conducted a series of
special studies in the dam area on the induction of earthquakes,
stability of the earth crust around the dam, and jeopardy
evaluation of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The research project has resulted in a clear picture of the
deep geological structure of the whole Three Gorges area and
provided key data for antishock design.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant water and electricity resources. Most of the
hydropower stations are built over rivers with a high drop.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the water control and power
departments, China has now built more than 80,000 reservoirs with
a total water storage of 450 billion cubic meters. About 350 of
them each has a water storage capacity above 100 million cubic
meters, totalling 300 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
A considerable part of these dams are located in the earthquake
belt with different intensities, and 115 large dams have survived
earthquakes above six magnitude on the Richter scale. None of them
collapsed and caused disasters.
</P>
<P>
Since the policy of reforms and opening to the outside world,
China has redoubled its efforts in exploring the water resource on
a large scale. During this period, seismologists have made a
thoroughgoing seismic engineering evaluation for more than 30 huge
water control projects in the country and provided important data
for decision-making and construction of the projects.
</P>
<P>
According to seismologists, the design and construction of
large water control projects in accordance with different
earthquake intensities in different places can save a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, which is jointly designed
by Chinese and US designers and is now under construction over the
Yellow River in central China's Henan Province, has a total
generating capacity of 1.8 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The dam was originally designed to withstand an earthquake of
nine degrees intensity. After a careful examination of the
historical records of local earthquakes and geological surveys of
the area, both sides agreed to set the safety requirements at
seven degrees. This reduced the construction cost by five percent
and saved more than 400 million yuan.

FUZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An Islamic grave in the shape of
sacrificial altar, the first one of such style, has been excavated
in Quanzhou City, in East China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The remaining tomb similar to a wall, was discovered 80
centimeters beneath the ground, and is 100 centimeters high and
140 cms wide. It has five tiers made of rectangular stones.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists found nothing except the carved stones in the
tomb, suggesting it had been damaged by tomb robbers.
</P>
<P>
According to experts who have studied the construction method
of the tomb, it was first built during the late of the Song
Dynasty (960-1279) or the early of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
Among the many altar-style tombs excavated in the city so far,

DAR ES SALAAM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzaia is likely to
qualify later this year for a 200 million U.S. Dollar loan from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for desirable economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving towards an ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility)," Festus Osunsade, senior IMF representative told
reporters here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The basic question is how come things are working out so
suddenly. The basic answer is the (President Benjamin) Mkapa
factor. The guy is forceful, determined," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the ESAF loan is granted, it could trigger renewed
financial aid from international donors.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is due to visit Tanzania in August to negotiate
the ESAF and an approval could be forthcoming by October, the
same month when Tanzania is to go to Paris for talks on debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
The 200 million U.S. Dollar ESAF loan spread over three years
would also open the door for a soft loan of 100 million U.S.
Dollars from the World Bank International Development Association
(IDA), as well as renewed balance of payments support from
bilateral donors totalling 200 million U.S. Dollars, Osunsade
said.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Giving A Helping Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's township enterprises are
developing business links in a bid to follow the country's policy
of narrowing regional gaps, and they are achieving success by
giving each other a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises in east China, where resources and labor forces
are in short supply, are expanding business with enterprises in
the country's central-and-western areas, where the population
accounts for two-third of the nation's total, and where there are
abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces in east and south China, especially Jiangsu and
Zhejiang, and Guangdong, have moved their resource-intensive and
labor-intensive enterprises to the country's central-and-western
areas, improving the rational use of resources and significantly
helping to narrow regional gaps.
</P>
<P>
The central government has called for greater efforts to narrow
regional gaps between the country's east and central-and-western
areas.
</P>
<P>
Since last year township enterprises in China's eastern areas
have co-operated with more than 10,000 projects in the
central-and-western areas.
</P>
<P>
The contractual investments of the projects reached 30 billion
yuan, half of which were introduced from eastern areas, helping
set up more than 2,100 cross-regional township enterprises in some
120 co-operative pilot zones in central-and-west areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year the 120 pilot zones generated 15.8 billion yuan in
output value and 1.4 billion yuan in profits and tax, increasing
by 30 percent and 40 percent over 1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China plans to add 200 east-west co-operative township
enterprise pilot areas during the coming five years, aiming to
generate 150 billion yuan in profits and tax, and to resettle more
than 5 million surplus rural labors.
</P>
<P>
China intends to transfer about 30 percent of the
resources-processing and labor-intensive enterprises in the
eastern areas to central-and-western regions during the 1996-2000
period, in a bid to further narrow the country's regional gaps.

<HEADLINE> Official Killed by Poachers Named As "Guard of the Environment" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Gysang Soinandaje, a leading
county official who was killed by armed poachers in 1994, has
posthumously been conferred the title of "Guard of the
Environment" by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
In a circular to provincial governments and ministries, the
State Bureau of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of
Forestry say they have made a decision to honor the brave
official.
</P>
<P>
The circular also calls on officials and the general public to
learn from Gysang Soinandaje, and do a better job to protect the
environment and rare wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Gysang Soinandaje, deputy secretary of the Zhiduo County
committee of the Communist Party of China, was killed at the age
of 40 in a gun battle with two groups of poachers on January 18,
1994 at Hoh Xil in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture,
Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
Hoh Xil, known as No Man's Land, is 200 km wide and 500 km long
and one of the largest uninhabited areas in the world, and the
last unexplored area on the "roof of the world" -- Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, Gysang Soinandaje and a colleague
entered the area 12 times in a bid to develop and protect mineral
resources and wildlife in the area which has an elevation of 4,600
m.
</P>
<P>
During the trips, Gysang Soinandaje and his task group seized
eight armed poaching groups together with 1,416 antelopes and
about 200 corsac foxes.
</P>
<P>
Antelopes and corsac foxes are both rare wild animals under
governmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The party official chose to work in the remote and backward
hometown after he finished college education in 1974.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Companies To Attend Zambia Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- More foreign trade companies are
expected to attend the Zambia International Trade Fair (ZITF)
scheduled to open in Ndola, north of Lusaka in early July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Ndola on Wednesday, ZITF Chairman Leonard Kafunda
said that many foreign firms had shown interest in participating
in this year's fair.
</P>
<P>
Botswana and Zaire had confirmed their participation while 18
foreign companies will come as private firms without
representing their countries, said local press reports today
quoting Kafunda.
</P>
<P>
Kafunda said that among the foreign private companies that
will exhibit are three firms from China, two from Zimbabwe, six
from Namibia, six from South Africa and one from India. ''There
are other private firms and countries which are participating but
have not yet confirmed,'' Kafunda added.
</P>
<P>
However, Kafunda said, the fair has lost 50 percent of its
traditional local exhibitors through privatization and
liquidation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ZITF is held usually once a year to provide an opportunity
for companies of Zambia, its neighbors and the rest of the world
to market their products and enhance exchanges among them.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Foreign Cooperation in Onshore Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China is actively exploring
international oil markets, alongside efforts to tap huge oil and
gas resources domestically, by inviting foreign partners,
according to a senior Chinese oil official.
</P>
<P>
President Wang Tao of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)
said in an interview with Xinhua today that China has expanded
Sino-foreign onshore oil cooperation to 21 provinces and
autonomous regions, covering a total area of nearly 2.5 million sq
km.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has signed 34 contracts worth 627 million US
dollars with 32 foreign oil giants in terms of oil and gas risk
exploration and technical services.
</P>
<P>
China, meanwhile, has developed a cumulative crude oil and gas
production capacity of 40.5 million tons and 500 million cu m by
taking advantage of various foreign-supplied loans totalling 9.94
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The senior oil official added that China is also making headway
in exploring oil and gas resources in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
To date China has already signed five oil contracts abroad and
has successfully obtained a share-holding, operational and
development rights in a series of foreign oil fields.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC president noted that China has made marked
breakthroughs in undertaking international oil engineering
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that China signed contracts worth 400 million US
dollars with Kuwait alone in 1995 on building oil storage
facilities and oil pipelines. Moreover China exported oil
technological equipment worth 39 million US dollars in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that amid fierce international competition,
China has won bids for a series of important projects in recent
years, including the construction of five large oil and
petrochemical projects in Kuwait with total investment of more
than three billion US dollars, and the construction of five
highways for transporting petroleum in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that China will further expand
Sino-foreign cooperation in oil and gas risk exploration,
enhancement of oil recovery in aging oil fields and construction
of long-distance oil and gas pipelines by adhering to the
principle of equality and mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules Out Possibililty To Intervene To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said on Wednesday he could not intervene to have right-wing
hunger striker Willem Ratte released from prison before all legal
avenues had been exhausted, a local daily ''The Citizen'' reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the organisation campaigning for Ratte's release,
Mandela said: ''No person is above the law and all people, including
Mr. Ratte, can turn to the courts for the protection of their
rights.''
</P>
<P>
There had been numerous other persons of all political
persuasions, including members of the african national congress, were
in custody for allegedly committing politically-motivated offences,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Tatte, who entered the 38th day of a hunger strike at Zonderwater
Prison north of Pretoria on Wednesday, was jailed for five-and-a-half
years on charges arising from the armed rightwing occupation of Fort
Schanskop in Pretoria in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Mandela said he will not be in Pretoria on
Saturday and will therefore not be able to receive a delegation from
the right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers staged a series of mass actions during the past
few days, including a blockade of highway, demanding for the release
of Ratte.
</P>
<P>
They said a planned mass protest meeting in Pretoria on
Saturday will go ahead and another attempt will be made to persuade
Mandela to have ratte released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special parliamentary debate on the imprisonment and
hunger strike of Ratte has been requested by the Freedom Front, its
leader Constand Viljoen said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen cautioned Mandela to be circumspect in dealing with the
issue, saying ''a mistake in this serious situation could result in
big problems for the president''.

<HEADLINE> China to Halt all Activities of German FNF Representative in China </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen
Guofang said here today China has decided to suspend the
cooperation between its State Statistical Bureau and the German
Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) and halt all the activities of
the foundation's representative here.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's response to the report that the German
FNF will conduct anti-China activities by holding an international
conference of Tibet support groups, Shen noted that the FNF, will
hold the Second International Conference of Tibet Support Groups
jointly with the so-called "Tibetan Government in Exile" in Bonn
from June 14 to 17. In doing so, he said, the foundation has
openly supported Dalai clique in its activities to split China.
</P>
<P>
And what is more, Shen pointed out, the foundation clings to
its erroneous practices of willfully interfering in China's
internal affairs by turning a deaf ear to the repeated solemn
representations from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this, the Chinese side has decided to suspend the
co-operation between its State Statistical Bureau and the FNF and
halt all the activities of its representative in China." Shen
said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Thirsty for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi voters turned out in
large numbers, and peacefully in general, in Wednesday's
parliamentary polls, highlighting their longings for stability in
a country plagued by political tension and military coups in its
25-year history.
</P>
<P>
Reports said nearly 57 million voters across the country cast
ballots to elect 300 parliament seats from 2,574 candidates
representing 81 political parties and a good number of
independents.
</P>
<P>
The "very high" turnout has been described as "unprecedented"
and "may even be a record" by the local press.
</P>
<P>
"People were seen to queue up even before the polling stations
were open," said a poll observer, noting that the process was
strongly marked by a massive presence of women voters.
</P>
<P>
The election rather stood alone from the past ones in
Bangladesh in that it was held under a non-party neutral caretaker
government after more than two years of political disturbance
caused by bitter rows between rival parties.
</P>
<P>
Strikes or strike-like activities have been a common scene in
the streets of Bangladesh since the former opposition alliance led
by the Awami (People's) League (AL) began to boycott parliament in
March 1994 in its fight against the then ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
"Now people want to change. They have placed hope on this
election to bring back peace and stability for the good of the
common people," said one voter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here also pointed out other factors contributing to
the largely peaceful atmosphere during the poll.
</P>
<P>
Over 400,000 members of civil law-enforcing agencies and 40,000
members of the armed forces were deployed around polling centers
across the country, constituting a major deterrent force against
any violent attempt.
</P>
<P>
Both the BNP and the AL -- the two major rivals in the election
-- have expressed confidence in coming out as the winner, which
helped to secure a peaceful and lawful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The AL, seeing its long-cherished dream of winning elections
under a neutral caretaker government close to reality, seemed only
too glad to encourage its supporters to vote for it in a peaceful
manner.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, braced up by the influence of its five-year rule and
the military support, also urged its supporters to cooperate with
the caretaker authorities to go through with the election
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, however, only one party can enjoy the fruit of
victory.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results, the AL has now emerged as the
largest party in parliament with 135 of the 276 announced seats,
as against 107 seats bagged by the BNP.
</P>
<P>
But with rival parties trading allegations of "false voting" or
"poll rigging," there are still fears for another round of
political unrest after the final result is announced.
</P>
<P>
Reports said six persons were killed and more than 300 injured
in poll-related violence Wednesday while polling suspended in 55
centers.

The archaeological team also found a pottery piece with
tile-like design, believed to be part of a powder jar from the
Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents Chinese fishermen in Song,
Yuan and Ming dynasties used contraptions to catapult the powder
jars in sea battle with pirates.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yunquan, director of Guangdong Provincial Institute of
Archaeology, said that 98 percent of the pottery and porcelain
pieces found on the Xisha Islands were made in China.
</P>
<P>
"Porcelain fragments found on such islands as Jinyin and Shanhu
were the same as those found under water near the islands,
suggesting that the porcelain fragments were carried to the
islands by waves, and that there were many sunken ships near the
islands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several wooden boards, and stones used as ballast, belonging to
five ships, were found by the team.
</P>
<P>
"They are the remains of ancient ships which were smashed into
pieces by the waves after they ran onto the rocks in bad weather,"
said Zhang Wei, director of department of underwater archaeology,
National Museum of Chinese History, and the team's underwater
archaeology instructor.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the sunken ships may be lying in deep sea
far from the islands and shoals.
</P>
<P>
"There are tens of sunken ships in the sea area around the
Xisha Islands, " he estimated.

<HEADLINE> Integrated Economy Booming at Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai and east China's Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces are speeding up economic cooperation with
each other to promote the economic integration of the Yangtze
River delta.
</P>
<P>
Close links between them began in 1990 when the central
government put forward a strategy -- for Shanghai Pudong new
area's development, to give an impetus to economic progress along
the Yangtze River and the Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai gives priority to industry while strengthening
connections with neighboring areas to promote cross-region
economic cooperation, allowing them to share each other's
advantages.
</P>
<P>
During recent years Jiangsu Province has co-operated with
Shanghai on more than 8,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the province generate 515 billion yuan in GDP, 80
percent of which was made by cities in the delta, including
Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou. All of the cities have close
economic connections with Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhenjiang City has set up many enterprises to produce necessary
items to serve many brand-name products made in Shanghai, allowing
it to lift the GDP from 1.2 billion yuan in 1978 to 29.5 billion
yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province has invited professional technicians from
Shanghai, and has set up nearly 3,000 enterprises in Shanghai,
adding 200,000 building workers to the city, and another 100,000
workers involved in shipping cargo between the province and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
During the coming five years, Shanghai will co-operate with
neighboring areas on 100 key projects, including a 600,000-ton
ethylene project in Pinghu in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Express trains between Shanghai and Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu
Province, started on April 1, and an expressway between the two
cities is scheduled to open traffic this September. Another
expressway between Shanghai and Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang
Province, is expected to be built in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Convenient transportation is expected to improve economic
integration in the Yangtze River Delta.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed lower today due to a weaker banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index lost 11.5 points to close at 2200.6

broker said.
</P>
<P>
NAB lost 51 cents to close at 11.10 Australian dollars, with
more than 9.3 million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in gold and base metal prices also helped to drive the
local bourse down.
</P>

slightly firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar strengthened to 79.19 US cents from 79.17

waters as the international monetary market remained steady.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was boosted by the issue of 20 billion yen
dual currency Amurai bonds by the Queensland Treasury Corp this
morning, but the rise was capped by selling pressure from overseas
investors who sold Australian dollar for other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 86.24 yen against the Japanese
yen from 86.71 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection of Mt. Qomolangma Needs World Effort: Chinese Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts held that the
world's highest mountain has been polluted by out-of-control oil
well fires sparked off during the 1992 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
They have ruled out local pollution sources as reasons for the
deterioration, and instead pinpointed world events.
</P>
<P>
Now Gao Dengyi, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric
Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has urged countries
around the world to help save the world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with Xinhua in Lhasa, Tibet,
Gao said, Mt. Qomolangma - known in the west as Mount Everest - is
located in an area of middle latitudes and very near to inhabited
areas of mankind. Because of that air pollution incidents in other
places will inevitablely affect the environment around Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has monitored the environmental situation in the
Himalayas in 1975, 1980, 1992, 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the results of these surveys show that the contents of
chemical elements in the atmosphere and water in base camps of
Mt. Qomolangma in 1992 was twice to five times higher than that in
other years, indicating that the Mt. Qomolangma has been polluted.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director deemed that the source of pollution does
not come from local areas, but from major pollution incidents in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that around 1992, the biggest pollution incident was
the oilfields fire caused by the 1991 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The British magazine "Nature" had inferred in one of its issues
that the catching fire of oilfields in Middle East countries may
affect Pakistan and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dengyi said, Mt. Qomolangma and Kuwait are located at very
close latitudes and Qomolangma is on the east side of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During July and August, eastern wind blows on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau while during the rest of the year, a westerly wind appears
on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Gao said, the emitted materials from the blazing
oilfields were absolutely likely to have been blown towards the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 some foreigners spotted black snow on the southern side
of Mt. Qomolangma and Tibetan local residents also witnessed the
falling of black snow on the northern side the mountain.
</P>
<P>
The black snow might have been caused by the oilfield fires,
Gao said.
</P>
<P>
In addition analysis of the 1992 environmental report of
Mt. Qomolangma also indicated that the increased chemical elements
in the atmosphere and water are materials caused by burning of oil.
</P>
<P>
On domestic pollution caused by mountaineering, Gao said
mountaineering would not bring about much pollution to the
environment in Qomolangma, adding that most of the Chinese and
foreign mountaineering teams also paid much attention to cleaning
up their domestic garbage.
</P>
<P>
However, Gao suggested, mountaineering teams should use solar
energy or wind power for cooking instead of gasoline and natural
gas, in an effort to reduce domestic pollution of the mountain.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Odds on Constitution Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Minister Christon Tembo
accused, of late,the business community of being greedy and using the
current political situation to siphon money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Chairman of the ruling Movement for Multi-Pparty
Democracy (MMD) Sikota Wina challenged the international community to
condemn terrorism in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Investigations by ''Times of Zambia'' shows that Zambia is losing
huge amounts of money as business firms sceptical about the political
future have drawn their foreign exchange out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Threats from some western donors to cut off aid,threats of
violence and political uncertainty are all of concerns to the business
circles.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the constitution amendment bill by
President Frederick Chiluba at the end of last month, Zambia's
political atmosphere heated and the MMD and opposition parties,
especially the United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by former
President Kenneth Kaunda, have been locked in strife over the new
constitution, which actually bars Kaunda from standing in the
presidential poll to be held late this year because Kaunda was born in
an immigrant's family.
</P>
<P>
The MMD repeatedly says Zambia is Zambians' Zambia and Zambia
should be ruled by indigenous Zambians instead of those like Kaunda
whose parents were immigrants from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The MMD government has accused the opposition of taking the
opportunity of the signing of the constitution amendment bill to fan
violence. On June 2 and 3, Zambian police detained eight leading
members of the biggest opposition UNIP on charges of involvment in the
recent bomb blasts and being behind a secret group called ''Black
Mamba'' which is inciting violence against the constitution amendment
bill.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda denies any link with the ''Black Mamba'' while the
UNIP accuses the MMD of being a sponsor of the ''Black Mamba'.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the bill, Kaunda has wasted no time in
dismissing it as ''an apartheid constitution'', declaring that nothing
could stop him from contesting the presidency. Kaunda ruled the
country after its independence in 1964 until he was defeated
by current President Chiluba in the first multi-party elections in 1991.
Kaunda even called on the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the frontline states to press the MMD government for repealing the
bill. The UNIP and other opposition parties urged the frontline states
to close their borders with Zambia. But there is no response to the
call so far.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP has threatened to call for civil disobedience to the
government should Kaunda not be allowed to run for the presidency. It
says " no Kaunda no elections".
</P>
<P>
Four bomb blasts took place in the past one month or so
with the serious explosion at the Lusaka international Airport in
which one policeman was killed while another wounded at the night of
June 6. The ''Black Mamba'' has claimed responsibility for one of the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's mass media have called for political reconciliation. The
government has appealed to the public to keep calm and
remain vigilant against extreme provocations. At the meeting at the
last weed end, Zambian stakeholders, the MMD and the
opposition UNIP and the Democratic Congress all agreed on the need for
dialogue and understanding. It seems the political parties are trying
to find a solution to the political strife.

<HEADLINE> Water Lifeline For Flood Risk Area Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Water projects have proved to be
a crucial lifeline in northeast China's flood-risk Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
 Eight years of water conservancy construction has helped
greatly lift the province's comprehensive agricultural production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 Liaoning has injected more than six billion yuan
into the work, building 24,800 km of dykes and more than 90,000
bridges and culverts, and harnessing 600,000 irrigation canals and
ditches.
</P>
<P>
Last year the achievements helped the province withstand the
biggest floods within a century, retrieving nearly 20 billion yuan
worth of economic losses, and enabling it to harvest more than 14
billion kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
The province added more than 400,000-ha high-yield farmland,
harvesting more than 15 billion kg of grain a year for four
consecutive years since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Plantation of land-protected vegetables, formerly on the
outskirts of cities, has been extended to hilly areas, bringing
the total to nearly 67,000 ha. Local farmers annually earn more
than five billion yuan from the plantation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Decides to Fire 645 Foreign Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's educational sector
will fire 654 male and female teachers of Egyptian and Syrian
nationalities serving in various public schools, said official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a recent periodic meeting of the
undersecretarial council chaired by Education Minister Ahmad
Al-Rube'i.
</P>
<P>
These teachers will be granted a period of three months ending
with the start of the next academic year to seek alternatives, the
sources said, adding that their work contracts specify a one-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Surplus of Kuwaiti teachers in science subjects for the primary
and elementary stages has forced the ministry not to renew the
contracts of 134 teachers from the group and about 260 teachers
were fired for giving private tuitions outside school hours in
violation of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
Budget strain and a number of Kuwaiti graduates expected to
join the teachers ranks soon are also believed to have contributed
to the Educational Ministry's decision.
</P>
<P>
However, rumors has it that Kuwait is intending to bring in
Palestinian teachers when it took the decision. But a senior
ministry official denied it and clarified "this is still an early
step."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready for U.N. Debate on East Timor: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said Wednesday that Indonesia is ready for an open debate
on East Timor at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the House of Representatives' Commission on
foreign policy and defense, Alatas said that the past seven
meetings with Portugal had yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
"So far no significant progress has been made, particularly
because of the awkward and negative attitude of the Portuguese,"
he said in a written response to questions from legislators.
</P>
<P>
Under the aegis of the U.N. Secretary General's office, the
Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers have engaged in
"tripartite talks" on East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which
came under Indonesia's rule in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The seventh tripartite meeting was held in London in January.
Another meeting is scheduled for Geneva later this month.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Ban on Smoking in Public Abortive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's ban on smoking in public
places is abortive after the Parliament's latest law was turned
down by the powerful Guardian Council, a press report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily, Abrar, reported that the Guardian Council,
which consists of mostly hard-line clergymen, rejected the
Parliament's regulation on the prohibition of cigarette smoking in
public places.
</P>
<P>
Emani Kashani, spokesman for the council, said that the
Guardian Council turned down the bill on the ground that it
contradicted certain principles of the Constitution. The problem
is not the content but form and procedure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the council had rejected the similar law passed
by the Parliament in 1992 in connection to the reduction in the
consumption of tobacco in the country.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on the issue, adding that the
council also favors the opinion that tobacco products do damage
to health and is opposed to their consumption by the public.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the Iranian Parliament passed a law which banned
smoking in public places, which include the holy shrines,
mosques, administrative offices, factories, banks, hospitals,
movies, hotels, public transport means, bus terminals,
restaurants, schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibited sale or purchase of cigarettes and
tobacco on the streets and in public places.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulated that anyone who violates the law would face
a fine of between 20,000 rials to 100,000 rials (6.6-33.3
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Gives Up Its Buried Treasures (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historical records show that Chinese people discovered the
present-day Xisha Islands as early as in the Han Dynasty (206
BC-220 AD).
</P>
<P>
During the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280), a marine route from
the present day Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong Province, via
Xisha Islands and the Strait of Malacca, to the West was
developed, becoming a "Silk Road" on the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
In the Tang Dynasty (618-907), pottery and porcelain replaced
silk as the major exports of China. But many of the exports became
buried treasure as ships sunk along the way.
</P>
<P>
The archaeological team found fragments of pottery and
porcelain on all the islands and in the shoreline waters
nearby. There were remains of bowls, jars, plates, dishes and
cups.
</P>
<P>
The earliest items found were fragments of pottery that were
pieced together to form the base of a tea-grinding bowl made in
the Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The best preserved article found was a celadon plate with a
protruding design of two fish on the inner bottom, made in the
Yuan Dynasty by the prestigious Longquan Kiln in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Blue and white porcelain from Ming and Qing dynasties made up
the largest finds.
</P>
<P>
On the shorelines of the Nanshazhou islet alone, the team found
hundreds of blue and white porcelain pieces, all made by private
kilns in the coastal areas of southeastern parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The pieces include the remains of a Ming cup, bearing the
design of a boat flowing on the water, and a poem describing the
scene, and Qing dynasty bowls with double pheonix or sea port
designs.

<HEADLINE> Guidelines on Access to APEC Papers Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Media Bureau of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Philippines released
here today a set of guidelines on the public access to documents
pertaining to the APEC meetings in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Reyes, APEC-Philippines media director, said that the
APEC secretariat had labeled documents into three categories,
keeping in mind the forum's principle of transparency and the
protection of the interests of individual member economies and
APEC as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the final versions of joint statements,
summary conclusions and other approved documents of the informal
meeting of the APEC leaders, the APEC ministerial conferences, and
other APEC meetings, which would be labeled as category A, are
accessible to all.
</P>
<P>
Documents exchanged at the level of senior officials,
committees, working groups and other APEC forum are labeled as
category B, he said.
</P>
<P>
These documents are only circulated among officials of the APEC
member economies, the secretariat and officials of observer
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that access to documents labeled as category C will
be decided on a case-to-case basis by the concerned APEC members
and representatives of APEC-related forums.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that papers circulated among APEC members
would contain sensitive data and therefore, access to certain
types of APEC documents has to be restricted, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will host this year's informal meeting of APEC
leaders scheduled for November in Subic, a former US navy base.
APEC senior officials and ministers are expected to meet in the
country before the leaders' meeting.

DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Awami (People's) League
(AL), the former largest opposition party, won 135 out of the 276
seats announced by the Bangladesh Television.
</P>
<P>
Although the ballot counting of 24 constituencies are still

</P>
<P>
The Jatiya (national) party and the Jamaat-e-Islami separately
won 30 and 2 seats. Others got 3 seats.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, the opposition spearheaded by the AL
had launched a series of street agitation to topple down the BNP
government.
</P>
<P>
Finally the BNP government stepped down on March 30 paving the
way for a caretaker government to conduct the fresh election held
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Irish Premier on Partnership Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Premier Albert
Reynolds said that only partnership between the government,
business community and labour can help Zimbabwe attain economic
and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce congress
and business forum in Victoria Falls yesterday, Reynolds said
experience in his country had shown that a nation could realise
its potential by bringing together its social players.
</P>
<P>
While conceding that Ireland, one of Europe's economic success
stories, could not be exported to Zimbabwe, he however, offered
ideas which he said had proved successful in his country.
</P>
<P>
These included processing raw materials into semi-finished
products, focusing on small-scale enterprises and the creation of
''an environment where enterprise flourishes, risk can be
rewarded and profit is not a dirty word''.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''I can't tell you what you should do here but the
model of partnership is hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had a good platform for its tourism sector to leap
from and expand to improve export earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce congress began on Wednesday with a
focus on partnership between the government, labour and business
community.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Continue Efforts on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will continue
efforts to find the basis which will enable the two communities in
Cyprus to come to direct and constructive talks, said
U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative here.
</P>
<P>
Gustave Feissel was speaking upon his arrival from Geneva
Wednesday evening, where he attended a meeting between
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Geneva meeting, Feissel said Clerides and the
U.N. chief had an "opportunity to review many aspects of the
Cyprus question".
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Boutros-Ghali emphasised the importance of
finding the common ground which will enable the two leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to meet in direct talks as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief had a similar meeting last week in Istanbul,
Turkey, with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
After the Ghali-Denktash meeting, a U.N. spokesman said the
secretary-general expressed the hope that it would be possible to
create the basis for the two community leaders to resume direct
talks and called on them to cooperate with his aides "in order to
create a new momentum in favor of a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Feissel announced that the U.N. secretary-general's special
representative, Han Sung-Joo, will visit the island on June 25 and
will spend a few days in Cyprus before going to Athens and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to see if we can find this basis which will
enable the two sides to get together. We want to be confident, we
want to have some indication before a meeting, that when the two
get together in the meeting, something is going to happen,"
Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issues of unmanning, the U.N. official said
that "experience has shown that there is no need for weapons
along the ceasefire line," adding that the U.N. would like to see
the National Guard and Turkish and Turkish Cypriot soldiers on the
cease-fire line to act as "observers."
</P>
<P>
Feissel made the statement following an incident on June 3,
when an unarmed Greek Cypriot soldier was shot by a Turkish
Cypriot soldier in the Buffer zone when the first walked across to
exchange hats with the latter.
</P>
<P>
Stelios Panayi was the seventh National Guardsman to have been
shot by Turkish Cypriot soldiers since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. peace-keeping force patrols the
180-kilometer long buffer zone across this East Mediterranean
island.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Approves Monitoring Group Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benyamin Netanyahu has approved a proposal for the formation of a
multinational monitoring group in south Lebanon, in his first
substantive foreign policy decision since his victory.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post, the monitoring group,
which was to be established in the aftermath of Operation Grapes
of Wrath against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in April, will
include representatives from Israel, Syria, Lebanon, France and
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's approval included his own "comments," an aide
said, but apparently leaves intact the principles underpinning
the outgoing government's negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Netanyahu's Likud party has been critical of the
results of Operation Accountability in 1993 and Grapes of Wrath,
leaving some wondering whether Netanyahu would seek to implicitly
or explicitly scuttle the monitoring format in favor of a
unilateral approach by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I think you can see this decision as a first signal that the
prime minister-elect means what he says that he is serious about
the peace process," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
The premier-elect and top aides were extensively briefed on
the monitoring group last week by Foreign Ministry
Director-General Uri Savir and top Army officials, and the
Netanyahu decision was forwarded to Savir on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One Netanyahu's aide noted that the people who are to inspect
complaints by Israel or Lebanon of a violation of the
U.S.-brokered cease-fire of Grapes of Wrath are "monitors" who on
specific occasions investigate the site in question and are not
permanent "peace keepers" in the area.
</P>
<P>
The whole notion of a monitoring group was to enforce the
cease-fire, which was designed to keep civilians both in the
northern part of Israel and in southern Lebanon out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
Now diplomats from Israel, Syria, Lebanon, France and the
U.S. are supposed to hammer out the final terms of the monitoring
group, probably in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, defeated Prime Minister Shimon Peres by 50.49
percent to 49.51 percent of the total votes in Israel's first
prime ministerial election on May 29, is expected to form his new
coalition government next week.
</P>
<P>
He has made clear that he would not undertake major policy
changes without first being thoroughly briefed, and being given a
chance to see all the classified information relating to the
issue at hand.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said that the premier-elect was spending
several hours a day lately receiving some called "tutorials"
on the issues, which includes the Lebanon monitoring group and
the Oslo accords, at hand from top military, security and
civilian officials.

<HEADLINE> China to Import More Welding Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to improve its
welding industry by importing advanced technology from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Ruiquan, general secretary of the Chinese Mechanical
Engineering Society, announced the move at the International Essen
Welding Exhibition being held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This showcase event attracted more than 190 manufactures coming
from 15 countries and regions, including Germany, the United
States, Japan and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign manufacturers are showcasing their latest
technology and products in the world, including welding robots,
numerically-controlled cut-off machines, welding materials, and
protective overalls and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase their share in China's market, many
foreign businesses intend to introduce more welding technology to
China.
</P>
<P>
China did not import welding technology and equipment from
foreign countries until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Now a Sino-German joint venture has been set up in southwest
China's Guizhou Province to produce flame cutting machines, and a
Sino-Japanese joint venture has been set up in north China's Hebei
Province to produce welding robots.
</P>
<P>
The four-day exhibition closes on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislative Council Puts off Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The 88-member legislative
Palestinian Council (PC) has postponed a planned two-day session
in the West Bank city of Nablus, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Wednesday because the Gaza's 22 members
did not arrive in protest against the Israeli authorities'
measures persisting on searching them at the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The PC decided it was an issue of principle, since the
legislators were elected to represent both the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and were therefore entitled to free access to both areas.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Israeli government coordinator
said Israel was entitled to check them for security reasons like
any other Palestinians leaving Gaza.
</P>
<P>
There are ample signs indicating that the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) have hardened their attitude toward the Palestinian
Authority since the right-wing Likud won the country's elections
two weeks ago. The PC held sessions in Ramallah and Bethlehem
before the elections and no searches were carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, has
reportedly instructed officials negotiating with the PA to slow
down the pace and contact their Palestinian counterparts by phone
instead of meetings.
</P>
<P>
PC member Ziad Abu Amr said that the security claim was
ridiculous as all members were checked by Israel when they ran in
the election for the council and were not considered security
risks. As PC members, they should have VIP passes, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 13 (Xinhua)-- Crime rate in Uganda dropped by 8
percent last year in comparison with that of 1994, reported the
local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Julius Odwe, Deputy Director of the Ugandan Criminal
Investigation Department (CID) was quoted as saying that the
number of cases reported had dropped from 43,787 in 1994 to
40,268 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
CID Director Richard Bisherurwa attributed the decrease in the
number of crimes to the people's high vigilance in crime-reporting.
And Uganda is also ahead of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa
in the field of telecommunications and this has helped in reporting
crime, he added.
</P>
<P>
Odwe said that theft has topped the list of crimes committed.
</P>
<P>
"Common assault was second after theft in number of reported
cases, followed by aggravated robbery, rape and defilement and
murder being the fifth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 30.3 million dollars lost in property destroyed
or stolen, only 9 million dollars were recovered by police, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A retired Philippine intelligence
officer who had served during the reign of late ex-president
Ferdinand Marcos was shot dead today in Manila by four armed men,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the assailants, all armed with automatic weapons,
shot from all sides retired Colonel Rolando Abadilla, 55, former
head of the Marcos' military intelligence service during the late
dictator's martial law rule.
</P>
<P>
Abadilla was in his car on the way to his private office when
he was attacked in the suburb of Quezon city, Metro Manila, by the
gunmen who then escaped in a car.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the Marcos loyalists who launched the aborted
Manila Hotel uprising against the provisional government of former
president Corazon Aquino in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He retired from the military service after being charged with
human rights violations against political activists.
</P>
<P>
Abadilla won the vice-governorship of the Marcos' home province
of Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines in 1992 and lost the
bid for it in 1995 for alleged fraud.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The peacekeeping force of west
African countries operating in Liberia known as ECOMOG has
disarmed and moved out so far this week thousands of Liberian
fighters from the Barclay training center barracks in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The barracks which has been held up by fighters loyal to
factional leader Rooselvet Johnson since the outbreak of
hostilities in April this year has come under continuous
artillery fire from Charles Taylor's fighters and other factional
forces.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, the movement, which began on
Tuesday, is part of efforts to restore peace to Monrovia and put
the Abuja Accord signed last year by the factions on track.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the ECOMOG Field Commander, Nigeria's Majro-General
John Mark Inienger, reportedly ordered the disarming of all
fighters found in the capital while residential and business
premises suspected to be arms dumps were cordoned, searched and
arms and ammunition found there seized.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Diver Li Bin thought he had
discovered the mythical Dragon Palace as he scoured the sea bed of
the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
To Li's astonishment, he spotted a headless stone sculpture of
a man dressed as an ancient minister, coral growing around the
neck. Close by was a small sculpture of a stone lion.
</P>
<P>
At the time Li was being towed along the sea surface by a motor
boat, allowing him to search the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
In an area of fifty meters around the sculptures lay some 100
granite pillars and beams and more sculptures.
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a ruined Dragon Palace, " said Li, who has been
an underwater archaeologist in the prestigious Museum of Chinese
History for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Dragon Palace is the mythical home of the dragon, the king of
the sea, in Chinese legend.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable finds were made in the middle west of the South
China Sea, to the northeast of the Shanhu Island of the Xisha
Islands, more than 200 nautical miles off the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from late April, a 15-member archaeological team
sailed some 850 sea miles on a fishing boat, carrying out a
four-week research work on all of the 30-plus islets and shoals of
the Xisha Islands.
</P>
<P>
Li and his research team members found the 300-year-old stones
and sculptures, and a great number of fragments of pottery and
porcelain from the Song (960-1279), Yuan (1271-1368), Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest archaeological tour China has ever
conducted, " said Chen Gaowei, an official from the Hainan
Provincial Cultural Department, and organizer of the tour.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was the first time China conducted underwater
archaeological research in the South China Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A farming technology service
network has been built in East China's Zhejiang Province to fight
fake chemicals and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the province, farmers know little about the
basics of agricultural technology, and it is difficult for them to
determine if farm chemicals are authentic. In the past, many
farmer' crops have suffered because of the fake products.
</P>
<P>
To curb the spread of counterfeit products and educate farmers
about new products, local agricultural officials have organized
more than 20,000 households to form a provincial technology
service network.
</P>
<P>
The network links them to 12,600 leading grain growers and
provides various services, including technical training.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Threaten to Halt Crackdown on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security officials
have threatened to stop crackdown on Hamas if Israel continues
the closure on the territories, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The officials have conveyed a message to Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu that they would halt actions
against the Islamic militant movement Hamas, if Israel refuses to
change its policy toward the Palestinians within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the security officials demanded that Israel
lift the three-month long closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. They said they are losing public support because of the
continuing blockade, adding that their ability to fight Hamas has
been harmed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security forces, under Israel's pressure,
launched a massive crackdown against the Hamas, nabbing hundreds
of suspected activists.
</P>
<P>
Israel security forces has imposed a crippling closure on the
Palestinian territories since early March after a series of
suicide bombings by Hamas terrorists, which killed at least 58
people inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The closure almost paralyzed the fledgling Palestinian economy,
barring nearly 60,000 Palestinian workers from their jobs in
Israel and inflicting an estimated daily economic loss of 5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority, under mounting pressure of
the Hamas sympathizers, has repeatedly called on Israel to
lift the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel further tightened the blockade before the May 29
Israeli elections to prevent terrorists from disrupting the
polling, although it partially eased the closure immediately
after the elections, allowing about 32,000 Palestinian workers
over the age of 35 returning to jobs inside Israel.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Wipes Out Chimneys for Bluer Skies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Factory chimneys are rapidly
disappearing from the skyline of Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
They are toppling at the rate of two a week in the city's
urban area.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau
estimated that 1,000 chimneys have been moved to the outskirts of
the city in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"In the 5-sq-km area around the Bund, which is scheduled to be
developed into the city's central commercial area, there are now
only two factories, and they are also in the process of moving
out," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This area will soon become the first no-chimney area in
downtown Shanghai," he announced.
</P>
<P>
Among 270 factories in the Jingan District, a prosperous
commercial and shopping district in central Shanghai, some 170
factories - and their chimneys - have been relocated in the
suburbs, he added.
</P>
<P>
In early 1980s, Shanghai was notorious for its industrial
pollution, especially smog and fumes from the chimneys of
factories.
</P>
<P>
At that time most of the 4,000 factories in the city used coal
as fuel, and only a few of them added filter devices to screen
pollution from the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
In some areas the pollution was so serious that a household in
the neighborhoods near the factories could make one coal cake, a
then popular household fuel for coal-burning stoves, with the coal
dust landing on its balcony and doorstep in just one day.
</P>
<P>
With the start of the industrial restructuring in mid 1980s,
Shanghai launched a large project to wipe out chimneys in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Each year it costs the municipal government several billion
yuan to carry out this project," the official revealed.
</P>
<P>
He said that today all the remaining chimneys in the city have
installed filtering devices, while many factories not yet
relocated have replaced their coal-burning boilers with boilers
using oil, gas, and even solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reduction of the number of the chimneys, he
pointed out, the atmosphere in Shanghai has become much cleaner.
</P>
<P>
"The major air quality indexes in Shanghai are better than the
state requirements, putting the city among the top ten in the
recent environmental protection examination across the country,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that it remains a hard job to bring the
pollution of industrial dust under thorough control.
</P>
<P>
"There are still over 3,000 factories within the Inner Beltway
of Shanghai," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the municipal planning commission has mapped out a
plan to move some 2,000 of them out in the next 15 years, with a
target of 110 for this year.

<HEADLINE> Over 200 Schools in Jaffna Peninsula in Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- At Least 208 of the 490 schools in
Jaffna peninsula are now functioning normally while the Education
Ministry of Sri Lanka has allocated 90,000 US dollars for
repairing some 60 school buildings damaged in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources today, the Jaffna peninsula
originally had a population of 200,000 school children when the
situation was normal.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the war, a little over a quarter of these
children had left the peninsula while a few thousand others had
moved further to the interior along with their parents.
</P>
<P>
Of the 6,500 teachers in the peninsula, 1,500 were displaced
following the war while the rest is still reported to be in the
peninsula. All of them are expected to be back to the peninsula
once normalcy is completed.
</P>
<P>
Sources added that the majority of government officials in the
education sector who fled Jaffna peninsula had already returned.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics Beats Bulls in Fourth Game of NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Shawn Kemp scored 25 points and
Gary Peyton shook off a slump with 21 points and 11 assists as the
Seattle SuperSonics defeated the Chicago Bulls 107-86 in the
fourth game of the National Basketball Association Finals in
Chicago on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory prevented Chicago from sweeping the final series
with four to nil.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, which scored a finals record-low 11 second-quarter
points, became the first club in 45 years to lose after leading
the best-of-seven championship series three victories to none.
</P>
<P>
Game five will be here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who won a record 72 regular-season games, missed the
chance to win their fourth title in six years and set an all-time
mark by going 15-1 in the playoffs. Philadelphia's 1983 title run
of 12-1 stays the standard.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls became the first team with a 3-0 lead to fail in a
finals sweep bid since the 1951 Rochester Royals, who then needed
seven games to subdue the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
No club in NBA history has ever recovered from a 3-0 or 3-1
deficit to win the championship.

<HEADLINE> Plywood Prices Likely to Increase in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Plywood export price,
which is now close to 500 US dollars per cubic meter, is forecast
to rise, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Chief of the Indonesian Wood Panel
Association (Apkindo) A. Tjipto Wingnyoprajitno as saying that
"the average price of plywood exports up until April 1996 already
stood at 496 dollars per cubic meter. This is a significant
increase compared to its corresponding period of 426 dollars in
1995."
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the basis of his optimism, but said that the
increase of plywood price occurs in 13 main markets.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase happened in Singapore where plywood price
went up from 352 dollars per cubic meter in April 1995 to 648
dollars per cubic meter in April 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
The price hike also occurred in US and Canada markets from an
average of 492 dollars in April last year to 648 dollars per cubic
meter in April this year.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest plywood exporters, Indonesia's plywood
prices also increased in South Korean market where per cubic meter
price stood at 443 dollars in April this year followed by China
with 467 to 553 dollars per cubic meter, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's plywood exports contributed 280 million dollars in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Data from Apkindo showed that plywood prices declined in
several markets including ASEAN (exclude Singapore) and Middle
East countries.

noted that not all foreign values are acceptable to his country

Meanwhile, Soeharto said that "we have no intention whatsoever

<HEADLINE> Hungary, Slovakia Seek Further Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Hungary and Slovakia
agreed today that peaceful co-existence and further reconciliation
between the two countries are in their common interest.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Hungarian parliament today, Slovak
President Michal Kovac said there had been friendly exchanges
between the neighboring countries during a history of more than
1,000 years, although their relationship had also experienced ups
and downs.
</P>
<P>
On the status of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, the
toughest issue affecting bilateral relations, Kovac said the
rights of the Hungarian minority are enshrined in the Slovakian
constitution as well as international treaties signed by the two
states.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would urge his government to draft additional
legislation to protect the language of minorities in Slovakia and
to grant them the right to autonomy on an ethnic basis.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia will not avoid constructive dialogue to protect the
rights of minorities, he added in the speech, the first by a
Slovakian president in the Hungarian parliament.
</P>
<P>
On a friendship treaty signed last year, he said that the
government and parliament of the two countries should supervise
the implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said he himself would work hard for further reconciliation
between Slovakia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Kovac, who arrived here today for a two-day official visit, met
separately with his Hungarian counterpart Goncz Arpad and Prime
Minister Horn Gyula.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Goncz told a press conference that peaceful
co-existence will serve the interests of the two nations, adding
that he hoped the border between Hungary and Slovakia would become
merely symbolic in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Goncz said the two states should work to reconcile with each
other rather than seek international mediation.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Kovac, Horn stressed that the proposed
entry by all four member states of the Visegrad Group into the
European Union is in Hungary's interests.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the four states -- the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Poland and Hungary -- have to demonstrate political
maturity as a condition for membership.
</P>
<P>
The Visegrad Group was formed in February 1991 when the
presidents of the four countries met in Visegrad, Hungary, to
coordinate their joint entry into the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Tourists' Arrivals up 12.5 Percent in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Tourists' arrivals in Nepal in
the first five months this year registered an increase of 12.5
percent over the same period last year, a tourism industry report
said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of foreign tourists to Nepal by air during the
last five months is recorded at 141,368 compared with 127,268 in
the same period of last year, according to a report recently
published by the Hotel Association of Nepal (HAN).
</P>
<P>
A HAN official said that Nepal could easily meet the target of
attracting up to 500,000 tourists by 1998 if the trend of
increasing tourists' arrivals continue in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government announced two months ago that it is to
observe 1998 as "visit Nepal year" with a view to promoting
tourism industry in the country and attracting 500,000 foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one major source of Nepal's national revenue and
foreign exchange earning. More than 300,000 tourists arrived in
Nepal annually in recent years, bringing in nearly 90 million US
dollars worth of foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that some 360,000 tourists would visit Nepal by
air by the end of 1996, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the present trend in tourists' inflow, the country
is likely to attract more than 452,000 tourists by air in 1998,
they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the target of 500,000 tourist arrivals for 1998
would by no means tough as a large number of tourists come to
Nepal by land via the neighboring India every year.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Spain to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (xinhua) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar here today,
saying both sides will conduct intimate cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived today for a visit in an effort to maintain good
relations between the two countries after his new cabinet took
office.
</P>
<P>
Aznar and Kohl agreed at the meeting that the two nations will
strengthen cooperation within the framework of the European Union
organization.
</P>
<P>
Britain's non-cooperation policy was one of the main topics in
the meeting. Aznar told reporters after the meeting that he views
Britain's non-cooperation policy as "unreasonable" and hoped the
situation won't become dramatic. He called on various parties to
take constructive positions.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also met with his Spanish
counterpart Abel Matutes today and told reporters after the
meeting that he hoped the EU's coming Florence summit would not be
blocked by Britain's non-cooperation policy and turn out to be a
BSE (or mad cow disease) meeting.
</P>
<P>
The British government has blocked quite a number of measures
of the European Union since British Prime Minister John Major
announced the non-cooperation campaign in a desperate effort to
get rid of the world-wide ban on British beef exports imposed by
the EU on March 27.
</P>
<P>
The British government has recently showed some flexibility by
giving green light to some limited EU measures, as the EU
Commission decided this month to lift the ban on exports of three
British beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain refused to end its non-cooperation policy,
saying it will remain in force if no progress is made at the EU
summit to lift the total ban on British beef exports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Approves Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives narrowly approved Wednesday night a budget plan
eliminating federal deficits by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The plan was passed by a vote of 216 to 211 in the
Republican-controlled House. Four Democrats voted for the plan
while 19 Republicans opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The budget resolution, a compromise between plans passed
separately in May by the House and the Senate, would trim spending
by 702 billion U.S. dollars over six years, allow a tax cut of 122
billion dollars and produce a surplus of 5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The spending restraints are tougher and the tax cut larger than
President Bill Clinton proposed in his budget plan for fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the budget passed in the House today projects increased
deficits of 153 billion dollars in 1997 and 147 billion in 1998,
up from a deficit of between 144 billion and 130 billion in 1996,
the Congressional Budget Office said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget allows a slightly larger increase in the
deficit than the Republicans' plan -- 156 billion dollars in 1997
and 153 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote on the budget plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The budget resolution is an outline and will not be sent to
Clinton for his signature. But it is a politically important
document that establishes limits for later tax and government
spending bills that are supposed to be enacted between now and the
start of fiscal 1997 on October 1.

annual inflation rate to 3 percent in 1997 and to contain the
external current account deficit at the equivalent of 11.4 percent
of GDP in both 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tibet, Inalienable Part of China: Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The German Foreign Ministry today
reiterated that Germany will not recognize the self-claimed
"Tibetan Government-in-Exile," stressing that Tibet is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said that most
countries in the world have reached consensus on the issue, and
that his country will also insist on the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Erdmann made the remarks after the German parliament had voted
down by a majority a motion from the minor opposition, which
proposed a parliamentary debate on the situation in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Jaochim Hoerster, Parliament Group leader of the ruling
Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, said that the
motion lacks constructiveness and is "a farce."
</P>
<P>
Lately, a few in the German political circle, who pose as
guards of human rights, have wantonly interfered in China's
internal affairs by supporting the Dalai Lama's splitting
activities.
</P>
<P>
They have also been attacking the Chinese government on the
so-called human rights issues while accusing the German government
of pursuing a policy of "obedience."
</P>
<P>
Despite some deputies' accuse and protest, however, the German
government has withdrawn 300,000 marks (some 200,000 U.S.
dollars) from a fund which is working on an international meeting
on the so-called "Tibet issue."

KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Committee on
Child Rights in a recent report expressed concern over the
"unsatisfactory situation" of child rights protection in Nepal, a
local child rights organization said in a press release here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out Nepal's failure to implement the UN Convention on
Child Rights, the UN committee urged the Nepali government to
initiate economic, administrative and legal steps to ensure
children's rights and interests, according to the non-governmental

</P>
<P>
It said the UN committee is worried about early marriages, low
rates of school attendance and high drop-outs of girls, the caste
system and traditions of living goddesses in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based committee is also concerned about lack of
governmental coordination in implementing policies to promote
child rights in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The committee asked the Nepali government and international
donors to pay attention to the impact of growing foreign loans on
the future of Nepali children.
</P>
<P>
It is especially concerned about the increasing child
prostitution in Nepal, particularly among children of lower
castes, and the little control over the problem, Watch Nepal
added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Defends ASEAN Policy on Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Amnuay Viravan Wednesday defended the ASEAN's
engagement policy toward Myanmar, criticizing the West's approach
of isolation and economic pressure as unproductive.
</P>
<P>
Political and security cooperation, rather than economic
interests, are key factors driving the ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) to formulate and adopt the engagement
policy, Anmuay said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was unnecessary for ASEAN members, which are
Myanmar's close neighbors, to follow the steps of those faraway
countries, such as the United States.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ASEAN is expected to seek a formal common
stance on the Myanmar issue when its ministers meet in Kuala
Lumpur on June 17-18 for discussions on cooperation in the
development of Mekong basin.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand opened a consulate
general in the Laotian province of Savannakhet on Wednesday,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The consulate will promote trade and investment and oversee
Thai interests in six provinces in central and southern Laos.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Charas Puachuay and his Laotian
counterpart Pongsavath Boupha presided over the opening ceremony
of the consulate at the Nanhai hotel in Savannakhet.
</P>
<P>
Savannakhet is an important province in both Laos and Indochina
because of its investment potential and key location straddling
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The previous Thai consular office located at the Savannakhet
provincial hall was closed in 1975 when the Lao People's
Revolutionary Party took control of Laos.
</P>
<P>
Laos opened a Laotian consulate in the Thai province of Khon
Kaen last Friday to serve 19 provinces in northeastern Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Bill to Counteract Helms-Burton Act Ready Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A bill that will counteract
the effects of the U.S. Helms-Burton Act will be ready next week
in Mexico, announced Mexican Foreign Ministry legal advisor Miguel
Angel Gonzalez Felix here.
</P>
<P>
Before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of
Deputies, Felix commented that the bill will be a "special
legislation" to be enacted during the next special session of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
It provides that Mexican businessmen refrain from obeying any
foreign norms or receive "hefty fines", he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Helms-Burton Act will be effective August 1 when some
300 Mexican private firms doing business with Cuba will be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Felix noted that the "antidote" bill will help prevent Mexican
businessmen from being sued in the United States or forced to
provide information about their trade activities with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever violates this precept and informs the neighboring
country will be subject to the sanctions stipulated by this
special law," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The application of countervailing duties on U.S. exports is
under study, although they would not be applied immediately since
they would have to be assessed over a very long time and after all
legal recourses in the first instance have been exhausted, he
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Eco-Tourism Burgeoning in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Polish farmers in inland and
mountainous regions are turning their houses and lands into
eco-tourism resorts in an attempt to better their own lives.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six more farmer households have joined the eco-tourism
vogue recently, according to Aliaja Borowiec, chief of the
agricultural information center of the Szczecin province in
central Poland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of farmers specializing in eco-tourism
in the province has increased several times within the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers only provide tourists with housing and foods while
others are beginning to treat tourists to angling, horse-riding
and four-wheel cart traveling in the countryside as well.
</P>
<P>
Still others have even guided tourists on excursions to nearby
scenic spots and historic relics.
</P>
<P>
Borowiec said that more farmers will be turned into eco-tourism
specialists who will first be trained in a crash course conducted
by his information center.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of the Polish agriculture ministry,
some 2,000 farmer households are serving as eco-tourism caterers
and guides along the country's coastal areas as well as its inland
and mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
In the poverty-stricken province of Suwalki, 160 farmer
households have become service providers of eco-tourism while
farmers in the Walbrzych province bordering on the Czech Republic
have also followed suit.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Senator Slams U.S. Remarks on Samper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading Colombian
senator today rebuffed remarks by the U.S. State Department
questioning the ability of Colombia's Congress to investigate
corruption charges against President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that the Colombian Congress be directed,
from another country, on how to rule in the case of President
Ernesto Samper," Senator Julio Cesar Guerra Tulena said in a
letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Congress know how "to act according to law" and
find it unacceptable to "be shown which route the verdict should
take," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The senator was referring to statements made on May 24 by the
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns who questioned the
credibility of the Colombian legislature in its hearings on the
alleged infiltration of drug-related money into Samper's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Burns urged the Congress to produce a credible investigation
and to "come clean about the charges against President Samper."
</P>
<P>
"It appears that we Colombian Congressmen will comply properly
only if we rule against the head of state," said the senator in
his letter.
</P>
<P>
"Such an interpretation of our duty is completely unacceptable
since we profoundly respect the rule of law, meaning the
established legal and constitutional framework in which due
process is legally guaranteed as a fundamental right," he added.
</P>
<P>
Guerra Tulena said that concern over the "improper meddling" of
the United States in Colombia's internal affairs has led to
speculation about U.S. economic sanctions in the event that the
Congress reaches a verdict in favor of Samper.

</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to proceed from the overall situation of

<HEADLINE> Extended U.S. Troops Mission Possible in Bosnia: Perry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. troops may continue to stay in
Bosnia after their mission expires in December, Defense Secretary
William Perry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent renewed war in Bosnia, NATO has decided not to give
up its efforts there, Perry told reporters after a meeting with
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, said reports from Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
NATO may use the air bases in northern Italy, or a "rapid
reaction" force stationed in Bosnia or nearby to preserve peace
there, said Perry in the Macedonia's capital for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, NATO will discuss measures to be taken after the
withdrawal of the multinational Implementation Force (IFOR) from
the region, but decisions will not be made until Bosnia's general
elections slated for September, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a news conference with two European Union leaders
in Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that he intends to
stick to the troop-withdrawal timetable after its one-year
mission, which ends December 20.
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 18,000 troops within the NATO-led
peacekeeping force, which were dispatched to the former Yugoslavia
last December soon after the signing of the Dayton peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Worst Military Disaster Claims 18 Lives in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 people were killed
in Australia's worst military air disaster in over 30 years
yesterday evening, Defense sources confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
There were ten injured, three seriously.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Mike Smith told local ABC radio station that seven of
the 18 dead had been identified.
</P>
<P>
"There are another 11 at the crash site but they have not yet
been identified due to severe burning," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Force set up a hotline for relatives of
the victims today.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said that an initial report on
the accident would be issued in 48 hours by an air crash
investigation team led by Defense Force chief General John Baker.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan flew to the site of the crash in Townsville in
northern Queensland this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong to speculate on whether it was equipment
failure or pilot error," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
This was the third accident involving the US-made Blackhawk
helicopters in the past four years. The latest one happened during
the March federal election campaign, when former prime minister
Paul Keating narrowly missed a crash as his Blackhawk clipped tree
tops.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, federal Opposition leader Kim
Beazley and other senior government officials expressed sympathy
to the families of the victims today.
</P>
<P>
Two Blackhawk helicopters carrying 14 servicemen collided in a
regular anti-terrorist training about 60 km west of the city
center of Townsville yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
"What was seen from aircraft also in the air at the time was
that the left lead aircraft banked steeply to the right and
collided with the rear rotor blade of the aircraft to its right
causing both aircraft to crash and burn," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The two helicopters collided at a speed of 60-90 knots 150
meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
Six soldiers died at the crash scene while another 12 died
either on the way to or in a hospital in the city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the killed were members of the Australian Army's
Special Air Service (SAS), an elite anti-terrorist force based in
Perth, West Australia.
</P>
<P>
The 2-million-Australia dollar helicopters were from the fifth
Aviation Regiment based in Townsville, which is the site of major
army base in north Queensland, and home to the Army's frontline
operational deployment force and most of its Blackhawk
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks carrying ten SAS troopers and four crewmen each
were involved in night training in the twice yearly Exercise Day
Rotor anti-terrorist exercise yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters had their lights turned off and the pilots were
on night vision goggles when practicing rappelling insertions and
extraction.
</P>
<P>
"They do have lights on the helicopters but when they are on
night vision goggles that's not what they train for and this was a
counter terrorist exercise," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous business and this is the first such accident
that I am aware of," he said.
</P>
<P>
The worst military training tragedy in Australia's modern
history happened in 1964, in which 82 people died in a collision
of the destroyer HMAS Voyager with the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne.

Thanks to developments in the service industry, particularly in

many old people who can use such services do so in order to

</P>
<P>
China's speedy urbanization has quickened the pace of people's
lives and enabled more residents to live in apartments. However,
this makes it difficult to get to know and understand neighbors,

<HEADLINE> China Active in Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power
plants generated a total of 3.975 billion kilowatt hours of
electricity in the first five months, jumping 35 percent over the
same period last year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase indicates that China's nuclear power plants
are endowed with a strong development capability, China National
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strategic objective for us to focus on transferring
nuclear technology into peaceful use and developing nuclear
power," said Jiang Xinxiong, president of CNNC.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 41 years China's nuclear industry has achieved
success in developing atomic and hydrogen bombs and
nuclear-powered units for submarines.
</P>
<P>
But since 1980 China's nuclear industry began to make
structural adjustments in the new era of reform and opening up to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government says that the limited amount of nuclear
weapons China possesses is solely for the purpose of self-defense,
and does not constitute a threat to any country.
</P>
<P>
Civilian production in the nuclear industry, headed by the
development of nuclear power plants, has contributed to 80 percent
of the total output value of nuclear industry, compared with five
percent 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China has two existing nuclear power plants, the first phase of
Qinshan nuclear power project in eastern Zhejiang Province and
Daya Bay plant in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of Qinshan project, which was started early
this month, is the first nuclear power project China has launched
in the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Apart from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, Jiangsu, Shandong,
Fujian, Jiangxi, Liaoning and some other provinces are also eager
to build nuclear power plants to ease their grave shortages of
power.
</P>
<P>
Construction of nuclear power plants has enabled China's
nuclear industry to make a significant step in completing the
transformation from being centered on military production, to
combining military production with civilian production, while
concentrating on civilian production."

Widespread use of isotope and radiation techniques is another
of the country's important forms of peaceful use of nuclear
technology, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
At present China is capable of producing and supplying over 800
varieties of isotopes and isotope products, which are widely used
in the fields of industry, agriculture, medicine and scientific
research, he said.
</P>
<P>
A hi-tech industry including isotope products, nuclear
appliances and meters, radiation processing techniques, nuclear
agriculture and nuclear medicine, is taking shape, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years CNNC will give priority to the
development of 15 civilian products, such as automatic fire alarm
and fire control systems, rare earth products, valves, a planning
official with the company revealed today.
</P>
<P>
One of CNNC's ambitious goals is that by the year 2000 its
output value generated by civilian products will be twice the
amount of 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the same time officials in the radiation industry have
recently raised goals for the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The industry plans to select 15 disease-resistant, fine and
early-maturing varieties of crops to increase grain output by 900
million kilograms. The industry will also make efforts to fight
bollworms, and carry out research in radiation technology for
keeping food fresh.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of the industry is expected to hit five
billion (about 602 million US dollars) to six billion yuan by
2000.

<HEADLINE> British Beef Ban Causing EU Internal Crisis: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Santer, the president of the
European Union (EU) Commission, has expressed serious concern over
the internal crisis caused by the EU's ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
"I feel worried as there are escalating anti-Europe sentiment
in Britain and anti-Britain feelings in Europe," said Santer in an
interview published today in Les Echos, a French economic daily.
</P>
<P>
"This will do no good to the construction of Europe, which
should be a community based on solidarity," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was confident that the issue would be
settled before the EU summit scheduled to begin on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports on March
27, after the British government admitted that there was a
possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human
equivalent, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to get the ban lifted, British Prime Minister John
Major has announced a campaign of non-cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission's decision last week to partially lift the
ban on British beef exports was opposed by Germany, which has
threatened to pursue the matter in the European Court of Justice.

Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina", released a list of 11,000
missing people in Bosnia, and another list of 1,000 missing people

<HEADLINE> Survey Says Beijingers Usually Net 120 U.S.dollars Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A survey by Beijing University
found that 69 percent of the people in the capital earn less than
1,000 yuan (120 U.S.dollars) each month, China's Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 18 percent of the Beijingers make less
than 500 yuan a month, as compared to the legal minimum salary of
220 yuan (26 U.S.dollars) a month in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly income for urban workers was 460 yuan last
year, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The university randomly selected 916 people in eight districts
of Beijing last December.
</P>
<P>
The result shows that 18 percent of residents earn 1000 to 1999
yuan monthly and 5 percent earn more than 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Only 7 percent of Beijingers have more than one job. Half of
these people get less than 340 yuan from the extra work.

<P>
Education is also a decisive factor in personal income. The
survey says one-third of the group that makes more than 2,000 yuan
monthly consists of people with master's degrees and PhDs.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Publicize Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Silk Road Forum, a joint promotion
for the development of international tourism along the ancient
silk road, will be held June 17-19 in Xi'an, capital of China's
Northwest Shaanxi province, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the World Tourism Organization and China State
Tourism Administration, the forum will attempt to develop a
market-oriented transnational tourism route along the ancient Silk
Road and discuss how to promote this tourism route in the
international market, according to Zhang Xiaoke, deputy director
of Shaanxi Provincial Tourism Administration and secretary-general
of the preparing committee of the forum.
</P>
<P>
A total of 124 officials from the World Tourism Organization,
UNESCO and more than 20 countries and tourist industry executives
from the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea are
expected to attend the forum, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Silk Road and Three Gorges are two key tourism routes mainly
promoted to foreign tourists by the Chinese tourism
administration. But after several years of effort, Silk Road has
become a more attractive tourism product and tourism conditions
including hotel, transportation and communications have greatly
improved, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the starting point of the Silk Road, is a world renowned
tourism spot, with about 7,000 life-size terra-cotta warriors and
horses and many other historical spots.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the city received
147,719 overseas visitors, 18.4 percent more than in the same
period last year, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Not to Surrender Sevastopol to Russia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma said today
that Ukraine is ready to "create conditions" for Russia's fleet in
the Black Sea but will never surrender the whole city of
Sevastopol, headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia will get "the part it deserves rather than all of the
infrastructure" for the Black Sea Fleet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who was speaking to students in the Ukraine Institute
of Management, expected that the presidential elections in Russia
will affect relations between the two countries and a further
settlement of the Black Sea Fleet Dispute.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Ukraine will not give up Sevastopol because
it is home to a significant number of industrial and trading
companies and 13,000 Ukrainian naval troops.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet has been a longstanding dispute between the
two Slav neighbors since the Soviet Union fell apart in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has delayed his visit to Kiev
six times because of his discontent over the division of the fleet
and its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said Ukraine will continue to cooperate with Russia
after the presidential elections because Russia is "a strategic
partner" of Ukraine.

Women also possess the virtues of loyalty and common sense
which could make a government more effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
Society should attach greater importance to the education,
intelligence and honesty of women, instead of their physical
beauty, he added.

SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Although he has two sons, one
daughter and grandchildren, 70-year-old Feng Xiren spends most of
his time with his birds, flowers and TV programs.
</P>
<P>
Feng's wife passed away several years ago, and now his
children, who are all married and live away from home, come to see
him only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
"Now I needn't worry about food and clothing, but I really hope
somebody can often have a chat with me," said the old man from
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city with a population of about 12
million, thousands of the aged face the same problem -- their
material life has been guaranteed, but their inner world still
needs fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
A recent sample survey showed that 40 percent of 2.27 million
over-60 single people and couples in the city lived apart from
their children, and many felt a lack in their spiritual lives.
</P>
<P>
Among 1,000 of the elderly people surveyed, more than 60
percent had never or seldom participated in activities such as
physical exercises in an attempt to communicate with the outside
world, mainly due to poor health.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent have fewer chances to visit relatives and
friends, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Because their ties with the outside world were loosened, about
ten percent of the those surveyed expressed feelings of loneliness,
and 15 percent felt the joy had gone from their lives.
</P>
<P>
Chinese population experts believe the situation will worsen as
Shanghai's aging population increases. The elderly will account for
13 percent of the total population in 2000, and 22 percent in 2030.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the problem reflects rapid economic growth and
improved living standards, such as housing conditions, over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
As in other Chinese cities, many residential high-rises have
broken through the ruins of old and shabby bungalows in Shanghai in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
People now have enough space in which to live, so the elderly
don't need to share overcrowded dwellings with relatives from two
or three younger generations, explained Professor Chen Xianqian
from the Population Research Institute of Fudan University.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian drug kingpin
Luis Enrique "Miki" Ramirez Murillo was arrested Tuesday night in
the north end of Santa Fe De Bogota, the police said today.
</P>
<P>
It said "Miki" Ramirez, who was guarded by eight men apparently
related to the armed forces, was followed by the police from the
center of the country until he arrived Tuesday night at a
bullet-proof house with electrified fences in the north side of
the capital, and arrested.
</P>
<P>
"Miki" Ramirez, using a fleet of at least 15 airplanes to
transport drugs, is said to have worked for Pablo Escobar Gaviria,
the Medellin group boss who was shot dead by the police in
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
National Police Director General Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena
said: "Ramirez is one of the most active drug dealers".
</P>
<P>
He added Ramirez infiltrated security bodies and used a number
of dummy companies to shield his activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen Port of Entry, a major
foreign trade outlet of the country in southeast China's Fujian
province, resumed the system of six days a work recently and will
eventually extend it to seven days a week as part of its efforts
to improve its work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xiamen Port crossing the Taiwan Strait handled over
13 million tons of cargoes, while the passenger flow of its
airport ranked the fourth in China only after Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In its bid to improve efficiency, Xiamen Port started to open
to ships at night last year.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the efforts, a joint declaration center was set
up in Dongdu Port, which has helped shorten the check-in time from
the previous two to three days to two to three hours now.
</P>
<P>
Other reform schemes already in practice or to be introduced
soon include non-obstacle passage to passengers at airport and
docks; selective check-ups for exporters and importers; joint
check-ups for large amount of imported equipment of the key
enterprises and spot quarantine examinations for emergency
exported commodities, port authorities said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Muscovites in their
Sunday best turned out today to celebrate Russia's Independence
Day by rallying in support of their presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin joined tens of thousands of
merry-making youths in a mass rally near Red Square to tell them
that this was the day Russia declared its freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We Russians will overcome all difficulties and obstacles to
pass onto our offspring a Russia which is prosperous and
glorious," Yeltsin said from a makeshift stage where top Russian
rock bands later performed.
</P>
<P>
On June 12 six years ago, the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of
the Russian Federation approved a manifesto which declared that
the federation enjoys "absolute sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
June 12 was made a national holiday in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin supporters, basking in late afternoon sunshine,
converged on the concert site after marching through the center of
Moscow bearing huge banners hailing his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party, Yeltsin's archrival in
the presidential elections on Sunday, did not attend the rally in
Red Square, but his supporters held processions and parties
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
People in other major Russian cities also held celebrations.

"(This) could seriously lower our performance at the

<HEADLINE> East China Province Builds Tourism Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province is
making efforts to link the world-renowned tourist attraction,
Huangshan Mountain, with other major tourist attractions in south
Anhui in a bid to cater to growing tourist need.
</P>
<P>
On the list of the natural and cultural heritage of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the
scenic Huangshan Mountain drew 4.5 million tourists in 1995, of
whom 150,000 were from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Jiuhua Mountain, which is one of the four Buddhist shrines
in China located in the northern part of Huangshan, received one
million tourists in 1995, of which 8,000 were from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"We have far more things in the south to offer apart from the
two mountains," said a provincial tourist official.
</P>
<P>
In between the Huangshan and the Jiuhua mountain, there is the
beautiful Taiping Lake, which is known as a "lover of Huangshan".
</P>
<P>
Also to the north, there is the Jingting Mountain, known as the
"mountain of the poem" for it was frequented by ancient Chinese
poets such Li Bai.
</P>
<P>
To the west of Huangshan, there is a group of scenic karst
caves and to the south and the southeast are the Daoist shrine of
Qiyun Mountain and well-preserved ancient houses and streets.
</P>
<P>
Under a major tourism development plan, the province is
connecting as many scenic spots as possible by one tourist route.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the routes will be linked with major attractions
in other provinces and cities such as the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River, Guilin, a major tourist city in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, the Mount Tai, and Beijing, Xi'an, and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the travel, the province plans to
accelerate construction of major highways and will open air routes
for chartered flights to Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is expected to draw increasing tourists not only
from the major markets in Hongkong, Macao, Singapore, Malaysia,
Japan and the Republic of Korea, but also from Europe, North
America and even the Middle East and West Africa, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- June 12 (Xinhua) -- The government of Argentina
will intensify its efforts to combat against organized crime and
drug trafficking as one of the basic objectives of the
administration, Interior Minister Carlos Corach said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are unleashing a battle in which we are not going to give
up," said Corach in a speech to the IV International Conference on
Cocaine Trafficking which was opened here today and will conclude
this Friday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the diverse aspects with which Argentina is
confronting the war against drugs, the minister said that
specialized state bodies have been set up such as the secretariat
of programming and the war against drugs so they can work together
in joint combat with security forces.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the interior minister expressed his
satisfaction over the praise lavished on Argentine security forces
by Miguel Chamoro, the delegate of the International Police or
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he highlighted the work of the Interpol which
coordinates the efforts of all the organizations in the world
that fight against drugs.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav, Zimbabwean Presidents Stress Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
today welcomed visiting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and
praised his principled and objective attitude to the crisis in
the former Yugoslavia and to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia can never forget that Zimbabwe was among the few
states that resolutely opposed and voted against the U.N. Security
Council's unjust resolutions about Yugoslavia," Lilic said at a
banquet held in honor of President Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, a close ally in the Non-Aligned Movement, arrived here
today for a three-day official visit to Yugoslavia, the first
visit since the funeral of the leader of the old Yugoslav
federation, Josip Broz Tito, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
By suspending anti-Yugoslav sanctions, normalizing relations
and resuming cooperation with Yugoslavia, the world has given
recognition to the country's peaceful policy and constructive
contribution to ending the Bosnia war and creating conditions for
peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe have always been in the forefront of
the struggle for equality-based international relations,
especially international economic relations," the Yugoslav
president added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe said he was aware that Yugoslavia had been
made to suffer unnecessarily under the unjust sanctions clamped on
it on the pretext of its aggression on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had strongly opposed the sanctions which had dealt a
heavy blow to the Yugoslav economy, he said, adding that the
situation in Yugoslavia had been further aggravated by a tidal
wave of refugees from war zones in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe had always consistently
cherished and advocated the principles laid down in the U.N.
charter, and had always striven to promote international peace and
a peaceful settlement of disputes under the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the current visit to Yugoslavia would pave the
way for a greater bilateral exchange and lead to the finalization
of talks on the promotion and protection of investments and
cooperation in air transport.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mugabe will meet Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic.

<HEADLINE> Youth Suicide Serious in NZ: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has the third worst
suicide rate for males aged 15 to 24, according to a report issued
by the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The study of 32 countries lists New Zealand behind only Russia
and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
The report, The Progress of Nations: 1996, shows there are 39.9
male youth suicides in New Zealand for every 100,000 males in that
age group, compared with a rate of between four and 14 for most
developed European countries.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand female suicide rate in the same age group was
6.2 for every 100,000. Only seven countries have a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
The report links suicide by young people to sexual and
emotional abuse, stress, unplanned pregnancy, sexual preference
problems, unemployment, jail, and running away from home.
</P>
<P>
Another concern identified in the report is a high death rate
among women during pregnancy and childbirth. The report said New
Zealand has 25 deaths for every 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF New Zealand President Fran Wilde said the figure is
unacceptably high, trailing well behind most other developed
countries. For examples, she noted, Britain records nine deaths
for every 100,000 live births and Sweden even lower at only seven.

<HEADLINE> US Announces Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
announced that it would provide the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) with 6.2 million U.S. dollars in emergency food
aid to alleviate a food shortage caused by floods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here that the decision was made "in response to a
consolidated appeal from the various United Nations agencies,
including the World Food Program, and after consultation with the
governments" of Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced that the food situation, based on the reports
that have been given to us by the United Nations, is actually quite
severe and that there is a possibility that the situation could
deteriorate further absent a response from the international
community," Burns said in explaining the U.S. government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
This would be the second food aid to the DPRK by the United
States since the country suffered severe floods during the 1995
harvest. In February, the U.S. gave the DPRK 2 million U.S.
dollars worth of aid food.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that Washington "has chosen the World Food Program
as the channel for this assistance," which includes 3,500 tons of
corn/soy blend as well as 6,600 tons of rice and 3,000 tons of
corn meal for the flood victims.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Iraq to Allow Inspection of All Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today demanded that the Iraqi government allow the United
Nations arms inspectors access to all sites they wish to inspect.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the Security Council
expressed concern at the incident on June 11-12, reported to the
council by Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the United Nations
Special Commission, when access was not allowed by the Iraqi
authorities to an inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the unacceptability of any attempts by
Iraq to deny access to certain categories of sites designated for
inspection by the Special Commission, including such sites under
the control of special forces.
</P>
<P>
The council deplored the failure by Iraq to comply with its
obligations under the relevant resolutions of the council, which
constitutes a clear violation of resolution 687 (1991).
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that "the Government of Iraq allow the
Special Commission inspection teams immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment,
records and means of transportation which they which to inspect."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang Xuexian, Chinese acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, said that the Chinese
government always supported the work of the Special Commission and
expressed concern at the incident that Iraq denied the Special
Commission inspection team access to certain sites.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq must fully implement the Security Council
resolutions concerned and cooperate with the Special Commission,
which conforms to the interest of the Gulf region, to the interest
of the international community as well as to the interest of Iraq
itself.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence should be respected and maintained, he
added.

<HEADLINE> AAA Launches Nationwide Campaign to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The 39-million-member American
Automobile Association (AAA) today launched a nationwide campaign
to call attention to the nation's deteriorating highways and
airways and to seek ways to help correct this problem.
</P>
<P>
The campaign -- "Crisis Ahead: America's Aging Highways and
Airways" -- is being kicked off simultaneously by AAA in more than
two dozen U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this campaign is to clearly show our policy
makers and opinion leaders that unless urgent steps are taken to
better maintain and improve our highways and airways, this country
faces a national transportation crisis," stated AAA President
Robert L. Darbelnet.
</P>
<P>
The country has interstate highways with an accumulated length
of more than 45,500 miles. But 35 percent of highway mileage and
one quarter of bridges on the interstate highways are in need of
repair or upgrading. Some local highways are even in worse
condition.
</P>
<P>
The interstate highway system has been regarded by the
government as an engine that fuels the economy, creates jobs and
generates all of the opportunities that connect Americans.
</P>
<P>
But in a nationwide AAA public opinion poll of 1,000 adults, 66
percent of those surveyed said the condition of roads in their
state was poor to fair and 40 percent said their state's road and
bridge maintenance was inadequate or non-existent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 69 percent of respondents felt that problems with
the air traffic control system have caused a rise in flight delays
and concerns with air safety.
</P>
<P>
To support its campaign, AAA released a report on this
country's transportation needs and sent President Bill Clinton and
every member of Congress a copy and a letter urging them to
appropriate the needed funds to help correct the deteriorating
state of U.S. highways and airways.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Highway Administration says it will take an annual
capital investment of 72 billion U.S. dollars over the next five
years to upgrade roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
"The 35 billion U.S. dollars that is currently being spent by
the federal, state and local governments is woefully inadequate to
meet current and future needs," Darbelnet said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of flight delays caused by an
inefficient air traffic control system is costing airlines and its
customers 3 billion U.S. dollars annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
AAA's Crisis Ahead campaign includes six key action steps. The
key point is to urge Congress to use all taxes collected from
motorists and airline passengers for their intended purpose of
maintaining and improving highways and airways.
</P>
<P>
"Gasoline taxes for non-transportation purposes must be
stopped," according to the pamphlet released by AAA.

<HEADLINE> White House Sees No Change in US Timetable in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The White House today insisted
that the timetable of basing American Peace Implementation Forces
(IFOR) in Bosnia would not be changed.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the president's view of the
current IFOR mission. It will last about a year," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
McCurry made the statement when asked to comment on remarks
made by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry early today. Perry
told reporters en route to Macedonia that he would recommend
President Bill Clinton to send American ground troops to Bosnia if
NATO decided a new mission after the scheduled withdrawal of the
current 60,000-strong NATO-led IFOR from the Balkan nation in
December or January.
</P>
<P>
Perry's remarks were the first public signal from Washington
that the United States is willing to prolong its military presence
in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
When deciding to send American troops to Bosnia late last year,
President Clinton promised the Republican-controlled Congress to
keep the U.S. forces in the country for only one year.
</P>
<P>
McCurry insisted that American troops "will be coming home in
about a year" and Perry "was just speculating on what the
decision-making process might be in the future."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the White House believed "there is no
substantive reason to speculate on what type of decision the
alliance might make as we look ahead to 1997 and beyond."

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed his planned visit to Washington
in order to have more time for forming a new government,
diplomatic sources said here today.

Netanyahu, who won Israel's prime ministerial election on May
29, planned to come to Washington on June 25 to See U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other top
U.S. government officials, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has expressed Washington's eagerness to see
Netanyahu and to be informed of the new Israeli government's
policy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been urging Arab nations to exclude
prejudgement about any new Israeli Mideast policy before Netanyahu
forms his cabinet and develops a new policy program.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Total in Britain Falls by 14,800 in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The total number of people out of
work in Britain fell by 14,800 last month to 2,168,000, a
five-year low, according to figures released by the Office for
National Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
The figure compares with a revised fall of 4,300 in April,
originally reported as a fall of 3,200.
</P>
<P>
This left the unemployment rate at 7.7 percent of the workforce
against 7.8 percent in April, its lowest level since April 1991
and well below unemployment levels in continental Europe which
exceed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
May's job figure lent support to a flagging Conservative
government which, facing a general election within a year,
welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
"It confirms unemployment is on a firm downward trend,
something like 10,000 a month, and that's very pleasing," Eric
Forth, minister responsible for employment, said.
</P>
<P>
But economists say that while unemployment falls due mainly to
new posts being created in Britain's lively service sector,
particularly for part-time workers, the manufacturing sector
appears to be shedding staff at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
The jobs figure showed the UK manufacturing sector shed 18,000
jobs in April and economists believe thousands more workers could
find themselves out of jobs in the months to come, because firms
are being forced to cut production lines and lay off staff as
demand for UK goods abroad remains sluggish and factories attempt
to clear their huge stocks of finished goods.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Suspects Hidden Weapons in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official said
here today that Baghdad might hide weapons materials at the sites
where the U.N. arms inspectors were blocked Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the Security Council, Rolf Ekeus, the U.N.
official in charge of Iraqi disarmament, told reporters that there
was a high probability Iraq was hiding items which they believed
still existed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said that a 30-member inspection team had been barred
from Revolutionary Guard sites twice in defiance of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
